I especially enjoyed his memories of the young Al Pacino and comments on the way audience expectations have changed."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"I've always wanted to make movies and this is the perfect guidebook. Sidney Lumet shares his sucesses, mistakes and methods in this very well written book. Anyone who wants to work in the film industry should read this book to learn about all the creative outlets open to some one willing to learn. Mr. Lumet's book is the perfect gift to an aspiring director."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"I did not know Sidney Lumet before I read this book as I do not stay in the US. After reading the book, I realized that here was a highly accomplised film-maker who yet had that passion to explain movies in a very easy way to newcomers. I was impressed with the practical approach to film-making coupled with the burning desire to maintain the creative integrity of the project. Mr. Lumet discusses several of his movies while explaining concepts such as Casting, Photography, etc. He also explains certain industry-jargon which any newcomer to the industry should learn. Having directed stars such as Al Pacino, Sean Connery, etc, Mr. Lumet explains how one needs to juggle relationships, ego and other emotions of all the cast and crew, in addition to respecting the business of film-making given the tight budgets and schedules. This is a must-read for any newcomer to the film industry (such as me) because it encourages passionate film-makers to maintain that creative edge, at the same time be aware of and respect the business aspects of films. The only reason I did not go for all 5 stars is that I would have preferred some more contemporary examples or at least examples from famous movies other than those directed by Mr. Lumet - I think that could have been achieved by getting the clearances from the other film-makers."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"You are just about to start filmschool?Get ahead and read this faboulus book about making movies.From the screenwriting process to the post work Lumet describes the making of a movie.A must read for future moviemakers, filmbuffs or people who wonder how a movie is made.Easy to read. Easy to understand."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"While it was a decent read, this book is not about making movies. It is about directing movies.

It's fascinating, inspirational, educational, and sometimes intimidating."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"This is a great book for those people who are tired of reading books on the filmmaking process that are dry and boring. This book gives wonderful anecdotes of some of America's greatest actors along with the technical jargon of an experienced director. It takes you in."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"The world is fortunate that veteran cinema auteur, Sidney Lumet, has decided to publish his take on the filmaking process. There is much to learn from the man who gave us movies the likes of 'Long Day's Journey Into Night,' and 'Dog Day Afternoon,' and Lumet teaches it. From his subtle use of color, his choice of camera angles, and how to work with acting legends, I learned more from this one book than in reading countless others about the same subject. Sidney Lumet's 'Making Movies' is very possibly the one book that all those intersted in motion pictures can't afford to do without"},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"I myself am an aspiring filmmaker, and this is the best book I've read so far on filmmaking. I am extremely pleased with both Lumet's writing and structure. He takes you through every aspect of filmmaking and gives such an earnest account of his experiences. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in filmmaking."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"if you like movies, buy this thing. if you don't, buy it anyway. i've always found Lumet's films very straightforward, and had no clue how much thought goes into every element of them. Pauline Kael used to deride Lumet's habit of bringing films in under budget and on time, as if this somehow compromised his artistry. what i find in these pages is a guy of great integrity and wisdom. can he be ranked in the pantheon of the best directors of all time? probably not. but he was very, very good at what he did, and his explanation of how he worked is charming and insightful."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"It describes nicely how the director has to work, think and interact with others.

There's a thin thread throughout about the way Lumet conducts his movie project, most evident in the book's best chapter (7) entitled &quot;Shooting the Movie: At Last!&quot; The pieces of the puzzle all fall together at that point, and you get a true sense of everyone's responsibilities and how Lumet plans and uses these resources. So yeah, that's project management.But if you're going to buy this book, buy it because you're interested in how movies get made, starting right from how a script is chosen, through to the preview. From that perspective, it's a great book. Again, in the book's best chapter, you get a sense for just how draining - and unglamourous - it is to actually shoot the movie. Early pick-ups, lots of work with stand-ins to get the set (esp. lighting) right, multiple takes, late-night viewing of rushes. This is tough work, and Lumet describes it clear, concise language. And he pulls no punches as to where his frustrations lay in the process.Roger Ebert's cover blurb states &quot;I am sometimes asked if there is one book a filmgoer could read to learn more about how movies are made and what to look for while watching them. This is the book.&quot; I'd say that's a very accurate summation of what you'll find here."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"I've read 'Making Movies' for my 'Visual Communication' class, in which we examined visual sources that ranged from pictorial representations to actual films. I must admit, however, that the book was a real joy to read, and Lumet a master to know closely.As the other reviewers have mentioned, Lumet's style makes it easy for everyone to understand and get a grasp of what it takes to shoot a movie, from reading a scenario, to bringing together a cast, from dealing with actors to trying to stay within the budget. The book's procession is designed in such a way, that your curiosity increases as you flip through the chapters. (You begin to wonder if the film's going to get ready in time.)Lumet, as the director of many films, should be considered as a real master in the film industry. He has worked with important actors such as Sean Connery frequently, and succeeded in putting together remarkable films, like 'Twelve Angry Men'. He tells the audience exactly how he's felt and what he's thought during the making of the movies. He expresses the stress he's had when the actors did not show up on time, when the weather conditions changed dramatically or when the production company announced to cut off a significant portion of the film budget. He also depicts his delight when he's got astonishing performance from his actors and actresses, when the cameraman managed to do a better job than he had even planned. His telling of these remarks are inspiring, indeed.'Making Movies' is a great source, although not necessarily a technical source, for all people either working or interested in the film world. A wonderful book to both read and have in shelf."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"Get this book if you want to know what a year-in-the-life of a powerhouse filmmaker is like. If you are a beginner with an indie, much of Lumet's experiences are not going to apply. They are simply going to make you want to work harder on your indie so that you can get where he got! However, Lumet does NOT deceive. He never promises you any how-to information. He simply calls his book &quot;Making Movies&quot;, and that is exactly the subject matter to which he sticks. His honesty does not go unnoticed, although he maybe should have called the book, &quot;Making MY Movies&quot;."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"Lumet's book is one of the best film books I've read. It explains all the technical terms, and has diagrams to accompany the text. It explains the process of making movies step by step, and shows the glamorous and not so glamorous parts of the industry. This books is definately for people who are interested in the art of filmmaking, for fun or for work."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"This novel was written for those who love movies, and for aspiring filmmakers. It gives the common person an insight and an appreciation for what it takes to make a film, and have it be successful. This is not a too technical book which only relies on &quot;movie&quot; terminology, but instead Lumet actually talks to the reader as if he was really in a conversation with you. He breaks down movie terms so they are easy to understand. Lumet also does not hold back any of his opinions on anybody. He will literally say how he feels about certain people on a film crew and how he reacts to everyone's ego. Lumet does not make himself out to be be the best filmmaker alive, yet he becomes a real person which anyone could be friends with. This novel can easily be read by one who has never seen any of his movies; but one who knows Lumet's work well can really relate to this novel. This is becasue Lumet talks about how he dealt with real life situations making his movies and not just some hypothetical situation. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and would read it again and again. It is a necessary addition to anyone's library who truly enjoys movies and can appreciate its' artisitic qualities"},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"I've read other books about directing. But I didn't understand what a director did until I read this book. Written lucidly and intelligently, with a true love of a good film story, Lumet's book is a valuable inside account of making movies. There are stories about stars (though not gossip) and about incredible disasters. But mostly it's about going out there, day after day, and getting the best shots you can, the best sound, the best cut.Lumet lays it out step by step with absolute honesty (film-making can be boring!) but also with a great love, a love for a good film story. Lumet believes that the authorship of the film belongs to all the people who help make it-- the actors, the writer, the set designer, the cinematographer, etc.-- The proof is in the pudding: Dog Day Afternoon, 12 Angry Men, Network. He let's today's spoiled-child 'auteurs' know that humility pays dividends. All in all, an essential volume on the craft of directing."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"Sidney Lumet's book has to be one of the greatest reads I have ever found on the art of making movies. He takes a stand on all of the hard issues that a director must face. Additionally, he is candid in admitting what he has done right and what he has done wrong. It is seriously the most educational experience I have ever had from a book, and far better than 90% of my classes at USC film school... Rush out and get this one. It is not only enjoyable, but is also very educational."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"Sidney Lumet is a tremendous director who has worked with some of Hollywood's finest. In this book, Making Movies, Mr. Lumet allows the reader into his mind and method answering any question one might ever think to ask.

It is as though he were passing his knowledge on to a family member.

Just great!"},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"Everyone who loves movies owes veteran director Sidney Lumet a debt of gratitude for &quot;Making Movies,&quot; his lively and well-organized memoir-dissection of the filmmaker's craft. Even the longtime and astute moviegoer will reap a goldmine of insights into how directors (and the teams of actors, screenwriters, and others on whom they depend) actually move from a script to screening the finished film at the local mutiplex. It is an arduous process indeed, and an extremely uncertain one even under the best of circumstances. Because Lumet has such a substantial oeuvre of his own, spanning some forty years, to mine for anecdotes and insights, the reader senses immediately a surefootedness, clarity, and authenticity that not even the best critic or film school professor could possibly match. We come to understand that, like any old pro, Lumet has had his share of disappointments and tight spots, as well as triumphs -- such as &quot;Network&quot; and &quot;The Verdict.&quot; (Somehow I'd always vaguely recalled the latter as a &quot;brown movie&quot; and now I realize why: Lumet and his team set out to drape every image in earth tones, completely eschewing pastels.) Readers seeking either Hollywood gossip or gassy theorizing should look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a master craftsman's first-hand tour of his art, this is the book is for you.

I flipped through it and bought it. Then I read it in less than a day. I loved it. It's a perfect insight into a career that I want to get into. I've recomended it to friends and librarians everywhere - and I say this to anyone who is even remotely interested in movies - read this book!

Every aspect of filmmaking is touched upon and explained in explicit details for the reader. Lumet leaves nothing out. Although he can at times seem a little pretentious, his writing is top-notch and his intelligence always welcomed.

I figured this would be a dry step-by-step manual on who does what in the crew, but Lumet pumps the chapters full of attitude, to the point even with all the pain and angst that goes into making movies, you want to pick up a camera and start shooting.He covers all the bases and tosses in personal anecdotes from his many many films, from how writers often whore themselves to appease big stars, to how to read a call sheet, to how complex setting up otherwise mundane shots can be.

Though I have read a number of books about film-making and biographies of directors this one is unique in that it combines both. Lumet speaks not only about his experiences of producing many outstanding films. At the same time he shares with us his deep knowledge of how to make a movie, the technicalities this involves, and much more.I took the book with me on holiday and wasn't able to put it down in the evenings after a wonderful day in Italy.

Lumet does not talk about cinema theory, he explains how he works to share an insider's view of what it is that goes on on a movie set, in an editing room, in the mix room and at the Hollywood meeting with the studio's president.He shares his tricks and technics without making them \\"the\\" example to follow but in order to explain how films are done or can be done. His writing is simple and clear, his respect for writers, composers and actors is clear throughout (and welcome).

Lumet describes the process we need to be aware of in order to make a movie. Having 30 years in production and now sharing this with my students, Making Movies has become the perfect compliment to my discussion with the class before they decide on a script, or go on set and/or location to experience the moments. I understand, and Laumet's text helps me explain, the collaboration, attention to detail, and the creative decisions, necessary to complete a film. I am also aware that, as university students, they won't have the budgets to play with, yet this book helps express the decisions that must be made whether, or not, a budget is attached."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"With over 50 films to his name, Lumet is nothing short of being one of the most prolific filmmakers of our generation, and as a non-fiction writer, this book echoes his mastery, and eloquence of written word. Witty, sarcastic, and no-holds barred, this book is a wonderful behind the scenes/anatomy class of the autopsy of what goes into making a feature film - from inception to distribution, with all the delightful things in between, along with a few bonus history lessons about the \\"old hollywood system\\" which I found to be enlightening and fascinating (after all, he is 86 years old - that's a long time to be in the business!).Having worked behind the camera for many years, and on some big budget Hollywood films, i can attest to this book being an accurate account of what every director (and crew) goes through during this laborious, often gut-wrenching intensive creative process. And unlike most \\"how to make a movie/my life in film\\" memoirs, \\"Making Movies\\" takes a candid look into a Tinseltown's giant's life within \\"the system\\", and life on the set, which contrary to popular opinion of it being all wine and roses, is in fact, a lot of blood, sweat, tears and of course, the sea of dirty politics. Lumet gives us a front row seat to the mechanics of filmmaking, even dedicating a chapter to the camera - lenses, filmstock, and cinematograph in detail.Some people might be put off by his almost exclusive references to his own films, but this just made me want to revisit his works again, with fresh eyes and an intimate knowledge of what really went on 'behind the scenes'. After all, it is a story about his life in the industry - who would know more about his films than the man himself!For all lovers of cinema, for people who want to get into the business, for people in the business or just the curious, \\"Making Movies\\" is a highly entertaining easy read with plenty of useful information, delightful repartee and chalk full of inspiration."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"This book should be read by anyone who is interested in movies. No thechnical misteries but a bunch of stories from someone who dedicated his life to film. Sidney Lumet let us embrace his joy and his pain in the world of filmstudios. It's not something for the filmschool student cause you won't learn how to make a film. But you will participate in a lot of human experience in the course of film making. Finally you can explore in a very cheerful way the hidden world behind the making of a film."},{"Title":"Bending the bow","review":"It surprised me that no word on this volume had been given, a volume that possesses all kinds of riches including not only a continuation of the \\"Structures of Rime\\" sequence but also the beginning of the long poem, \\"Passages\\". \\"Bending the Bow\\" and \\"My Mother Would Be A Falconress\\" can be singled out too as poems important to Duncan's career. Also pleasing to this reader are Duncan's versions of Nerval's \\"Chimeras\\".In this volume of poetry, which feels more substantial with each reading, one finds the poet following new paths, themes of preoccupation, and experiments of both genre and technique. Duncan is not the favorite poet of most people who read poetry but the power of his work is difficult to deny when one sees what its influence has wrought, especially in poets centered in San Francisco and Berkeley and other parts of the Bay Area.For oddly felt fires, stirring visions, and lyric approaches from the meadows more than the paths of poetry, I recommend this volume of poems."},{"Title":"RICHARD WAGNER, FRITZ LANG, AND THE NIBELUNGEN.","review":"David Levin's book _Richard Wagner, Fritz Lang and the Nibelungen_ centers around the allegation that Mime in Wagner's opera _Siegfried_, and Alberich in Fritz Lang's 1920 film _Die Nibelungen_ (both dwarfs), are antisemitic representations.Levin's arguments for these twin accusations will cause jaw-dropping disbelief in anyone familiar with Wagner's or Lang's work. He writes: \\"Thus Mime is repeatedly shown to be narrating (a terrible thing in Wagner's eyes and works) while Alberich embodies a version of 'Hollywood' cinema (a terrible thing in Lang's eyes and works).\\"Anyone who's seen or heard a Wagner opera knows that far from narration being \\"a terrible thing in Wagner's eyes\\", it's a Wagner specialty. All Wagner's important characters are incorrigible narrators, to an extent that's notoriously off-putting for newcomers. (Levin later claims that Mime is unique because he narrates events that haven't previously been represented in dramatic form. Nice try, but so do most of Wagner's other characters, from Senta and the Dutchman to Wotan and Gurnemantz.)This isn't just a minor error. It's actually Levin's whole argument concerning Wagner: that Wagner's character Mime was a narrator, Wagner hated narrators and thought narration was somehow Jewish, therefore Mime is an antisemitic representation and the _Ring_ is an antisemitic parable.But if we took Levin's test seriously, all the major Wagnerian characters would be Jewish representations, and Wagner would emerge as the most obsessively philosemitic dramatist in history. (Except that according to Levin's test, everyone in Greek tragedy and Japanese Noh drama is Jewish too.)Levin's accusation against Fritz Lang is that his _Nibelungen_ film, made in Germany in 1920, was antisemitic in its depiction of the dwarf Alberich. Levin gave two grounds for his claim that Lang's Alberich is an antisemitic representation.First, Levin said that Lang's biographer Lotte Eisner had claimed that critic Siegfried Kracauer had thought that Lang's depiction of Alberich was antisemitic. Unfortunately for Levin, Kracauer's discussion of Lang's film is in print, and Kracauer made no such allegation. More importantly, Kracauer's opinion would only have weight if Kracauer had actually provided arguments or evidence in support of this reading of Lang's film. So Levin's first piece of supporting evidence is unsubstantiated hearsay; that one critic, Kracauer, may or may not have thought Lang's Alberich was a Jewish caricature, but provided no arguments in support of that interpretation, which he probably did not support.Well, you can't get much more convincing than that!And Levin doesn't. His other argument is that Alberich took Siegfried into an underground cave and shone an image on the wall: the Nibelungs mining for gold. Levin argued, essentially, that projecting images on a wall (a symbol of filmmaking) is somehow a Jewish thing to do. Therefore Lang's Alberich is an antisemitic Jewish caricature.Obviously that's not much of an argument, expressed so baldly. So Levin expressed it hairily. Delving into the works of Freud, Klein, Lacan, etc, he engaged in a great deal of oracular pronouncing and general arm-waving. It's probably fair to describe Freudianism as a dead religion now the Freud Wars are over, and Levin did his case little good by tying so much of it to the Freudian tradition.But against Levin's psychoanalytic flights of fancy there's just one awkward fact. It's that Fritz Lang was of Jewish descent, and he fled Nazi Germany to America (to Hollywood) partly because of politics and partly because of his Jewish ancestry.How did Levin deal with that awkward fact? The same way he dealt with the awkward fact that _everybody_ in Wagner is a narrator, not just Mime. Levin simply didn't mention it. But at one point he cited a biography of Fritz Lang, so he can't credibly claim ignorance of the awkward fact.An intellectually honest academic has to mention facts that hurt their thesis, and argue around them. A book that simply buries awkward facts, presumably in the hope that the readers won't know better, is not an intellectually honest book.Levin does a lot of omitting awkward facts. For example Levin tells us that when Wagner's Siegfried (_Siegfried_ Act II) killed Mime it was because Mime was sort of Jewish; Siegfried heard Mime narrating, and realised that narrators are aliens who should be killed. Next stop, Levin suggests, is the Holocaust.But Levin can only argue this by omitting the actual content of Mime's speech. Mime was telling Siegfried, inadvertently but truthfully, that he intended to drug Siegfried unconscious and then decapitate him. Thus Siegfried could not risk sleeping, if he wanted to wake up again. In a forest, unattended by a police service with the resources to apprehend murderous stalkers, Siegfried killed Mime in self-defence: not because Mime was a narrator, but because Mime would kill him the next time he fell asleep. (By the way Mime's threat to Siegfried was not even narration. It was exposition. Since \\"narration\\" is such a central concept in Levin's book, he should at least know what \\"narration\\" means.)Here, as with his claims about narration in Wagner, and whether Fritz Lang is likely to have made antisemitic movies, Levin used the technique known as \\"misrepresentation by omission\\". He also applied this technique in his discussion of Wagner's prose. But although I'd meant to discuss such things as Levin's claim that Siegfried burnt down the world ash tree in order to forge Nothung (a false claim that suggests that Levin may not have actually read the _Ring_ libretto), and many other things, I'm close to the word limit.Basically this book is nonsense. Wagner students are used to this sort of thing; Wagner brings out this sort of tin-foil-hatted lunacy in some academics. But admirers of Fritz Lang, in the real world a victim rather than a perpetrator of Nazi bigotry, have the right to be a little annoyed by this mildly misleading piece of work.Cheers!Laon"},{"Title":"RICHARD WAGNER, FRITZ LANG, AND THE NIBELUNGEN.","review":"What verbiage!

It reminded me of nothing so much as a very whiny babywho's grown up to be an equally whiny guy who's found a comfyliving whining at music conferences, and is ultimately a boring,tiring person who needs to get a real life-and stop whining!His rant really ticked me off, it is very puerile and boring.If ya gotta buy the book, buy it used."},{"Title":"RICHARD WAGNER, FRITZ LANG, AND THE NIBELUNGEN.","review":"A \\"book\\" about Wagner and Aryan legend by someone named Levin.

Think again! Not all varieties are, and Llewellyn gives us an in-depth analysis of one of the less-tolerant branches (which some people would consider not even Hindu), the Arya Samaj. Comparing it to extreme fundamentalism in Islam and Christianity (where he uses Bob Jones University), he shows the Samaj as a fundamentalist movement while simultaneously exposing all of the internal conflicts of this controversial proselytizing and exclusivist/inclusivist (but not pluralist!)

I especially appreciated her commentary on the socks that go in the drier as a pair and don't come out as a pair! Good argument for never having to wear socks!! I also appreciated her ability to speak freely about the Catholic church, and what Catholicism has meant for her.

I'm sure she was far too modest to admit it, but she was one of the greatest humorists of the 20th century. And her words still resonate here in the 21st.Most people think she wrote only for housewives, or women in general, but as a guy (and a humor columnist myself), I can say that she wrote for anyone who has ever had or been part of a family, which means everyone.This book is, in my opinion, her best because it is undiluted Erma. Humor works better over the short haul, and these columns, grouped thematically and filled with her warm, self-deprecating, gently subversive wit, are the finest and most lasting representation of her work. Even though the pieces were written between 1965 and 1996, they still hold up. They are, in fact, timeless.Hence, the title, \\"Forever, Erma.\\" I told you she was a genius."},{"Title":"Forever, Erma: Best-Loved Writing from America's Favorite Humorist","review":"I had forgotten just how funny she was.

If you want to teach a course in overall research methods, this may be your book. If you want to teach survey research, use something else. Too much of the book focuses on qualitative methods. In addition, some of his information is simply off-base. His discussion of the reasons for using stratified sampling is particularly erroneous. In addition, the research he uses as examples (research he has conducted) was done 20 years ago and is neither interesting nor enlightening.In addition to the problems with the text book, the publishing company is not terribly helpful. I had to hound them to get desk copies and a test bank. They never did send me a copy of the study guide.It seems as though Earl Babbie writes text books to make money, not because he is a researcher with an abundance of information to share with the world.

These well-constructed mysteries are noted as much for their witty dialogue, character development, and psychological complexity as for the puzzle itself. One reviewer observed: Blake will always be a writer for the connoisseur of detective fiction.This four volume, hard cover edition, The Nicholas Blake Treasury, includes twelve of the sixteen Nigel Strangeways mysteries. Only The Dreadful Hollow (1953), The Whisper in the Gloom (1954), The Sad Variety (1964), and The Morning After Death (1966) are missing.The first two volumes (burgundy and green covers, respectively) were published by Nelson Doubleday, Inc and the third and fourth editions (orange and blue covers) by the Mystery Guild.Volume 1: Thou Shell of Death (1936), The Beast Must Die (1938), and The Corpse in the Snowman (1941). These three stories are among the best.Volume 2: A Question of Proof (1935), There's Trouble Brewing (1937), and The Smiler with the Knife (1939)Volume 3: Murder with Malice (1940), Minute for Murder (1947), and Head of a Traveler (1949)Volume 4: End of Chapter (1957), The Widow's Cruise (1959), and The Worm of Death (1961).Cecil Day-Lewis was professor of poetry at Oxford in 1951-56, and a lecturer in the 1960s at several universities. He was Poet Laureate from 1968 until his death in 1972. The actor Daniel Day-Lewis is his son.Unable to find these book club editions? Try looking for the Nigel Strangeways mysteries reissued as Perennial Library paperbacks by Harper and Row Publishers in the late 1970s."},{"Title":"The Nicholas Blake Treasury (Volume 1): Thou Shell of Death; The Beast Must Die; The Corpse in the Snowman","review":"I came across Volume 1 of the Nicholas Blake Treasury at my local library recently. I've read a number of mystery writers (they really proliferated between the World Wars), and had come to the conclusion that Agatha Christie was deservedly that most famous. This one however comes pretty close, and deserves to be more popular than it is.Nigel Strangeways is a likable young detective, sort of a less eccentric version of Lord Peter Wimsey. He similarly has an intelligent wife who sometimes assists him.\\"Thou Shell of Death\\" is about an eccentric retired pilot and explorer whose threatened murder Strangeways is called in to prevent. When he fails in that (no great spoiler here), he's determined to get to the bottom of it. This is also where he meets his future wife, Georgia. It'll be interesting if anyone decides to film this, because it ends with a dramatic airplane chase, just the sort of scene filmmakers like to invent to \\"spice up\\" their adaptations.\\"The Beast Must Die\\" begins with the diary of a man whose young son was killed in a hit-and-run accident, and he decides to track down and kill the driver. Then things apparently go awry, and Strangeways is called in to figure out what really happened.\\"The Corpse in the Snowman\\" is a sad (and rather gruesome) story about drug addiction. When a young woman is found hanged in her bedroom, it's not clear whether it's murder or suicide. Strangeways has to delve into her past life and relationships to figure out how she got to this point. I thought this was the weakest of the three. The title and opening chapter seemed designed to get the reader interested, but most of the story takes place earlier (that corpse isn't even identified until the end), and the earlier death is the focus of the story.Other than that, though, these stories were pretty good, and I recommend them, especially to anyone who enjoys Agatha Christie."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Pentax Zx-M K1000","review":"I bought this book hoping it would be full of specificinformation on my Pentax ZX-M.

Volpe has done all of the difficult sorting and taxonomy we are obliged to do before we can come to our own terms with a novel. Who is each narrator or character, what do the events look like in chronological order, etc. To have that kind of work done for you for such novels as &quot;Absalom! Absalom!&quot; and &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; is worth the price of admission.In the second section, each novel is given a reading, and while one may not always agree entirely, they almost invariably identify all the major features and events of the novels and are often closer to very careful glossed summaries than they are argumentative. If you've read a novel, these are comprehensive enough to return to you whatever you might have forgotten. If you haven't read a novel, they function very adequately to convey the essentials.The third section provides detailed chronologies of events for nine novels.If you're interested in making your own sense of the novels, Volpe's meticulous work will allow you to get down to business more quickly."},{"Title":"A READER'S GUIDE TO WILLIAM FAULKNER","review":"The author explains Faulkner in a direct, straightforward, \\"Hemingway\\" style, risking reductiveness but undeniably expanding the potential audience for the book. Readers entirely new to Faulkner may benefit from the general introduction as well as the interpretations (basically sound, \\"widely-received\\" readings) of individual novels. Others may understandably take a pass on the first two sections in favor of the third, which provides a breakdown of the narrative order as well as the \\"actual\\" chronology of each of the chapters in Faulkner's novels. Included are scene descriptions based on compiled evidence from the chapter as well as verbal clues that alert the reader to scene shifts in a narrator's consciousness.A downside: Like most other commentators on Faulkner, Volpe often takes too seriously the seriousness of Faulkner. This is especially apparent in discussions of \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" Unquestionably, it is apocalyptic, tragic, visionary narrative, but it is also supreme farce. Readers need to know that it's OK be bemused by the first chapter and to laugh out loud at the second. Critics have done a grave disservice to Faulkner by representing the novel with such unrelenting sobriety. (Reading Robert Browning's \\"Caliban Upon Setebos\\" might be the first step to a cure from much insensitivity to the playfulness of Faulkner's discourse.)Finally, the page references to Faulkner's novels have not been updated to agree with the current Vintage editions. And the decision to ignore all of the short fiction might have been more palatable had the author not cast aesthetic judgement upon it, in effect \\"ranking\\" it beneath the novels. Faulkner's short fiction is not only of the same high order as his long narratives but is inseparable from them."},{"Title":"Blood Trail","review":"Probing the human spirit, as it searches for ultimate clarity under the descending petals of a blooming cherry blossom tree, is part of the enlightenment of this seductive journey into the senses of an Asian-American poet. Mrs. Florence McGinn's poetry shapes the core of human vitality and paints with the ease of Chinese brush strokes the archetypes and lush metaphors, of human existence, into her reader's hearts. The poetry goes beyond the definition of mere words written in meter and syntax and becomes part of the organic orchestra of human desires. Perhaps, Basho, the seventeenth century Japanese poet puts it best, Between our two lives there is also the life of the cherry blossom. His description of the riddles and mysteries of existence is reawakened with the creative genius and boldness of Mrs. McGinn's writing. Her poems illuminate the hidden core of all races and lifestyles, as she turns to Chinese myths, history, multiculturalism, family stories, and dreams with a powerful, magnetically readable, and newly original voice. Her poems unearth the fragility of nature, the death of a parent, and the connection between memory and everyday life. These natural changes are depicted with an exotic and sublime play with words, as each section in the anthology grounds its poetic tendrils into the reader's intellectual curiosity. The start of a poetic feast, Sources bleeds with poems in relation to the loss of childhood in a multi-cultural home, while Moments and Tracks honor the courageous journey of a women from adolescence to motherhood. Living Trail is a spiritual mosaic forming the realizations of adult-hood and the reformation of mind and soul. This book is a great resource into phenomenal poetry, as well as an inner path to awaken the spiritual connectivity with our revered ancestry and our approaching futures.A MUST HAVE FOR ALL POETS AND LOVERS OF WORDS!

Fr Clarke explains the principles of Thomas' thought in an easy to understand fashion and then convincingly applies them to modern thought. What is especially important in this work is Clarkes development of St Thomas' idea of being as a &quot;substance in relation&quot; which be defintion has a communicative value. This theme is stressed often in the book and is useful in having a response to skeptics of knowledge about the material world. Fr Clarke also gives compelling modern versions of Thomas' 5 Ways of arguing for the existence of God. Well done."},{"Title":"Objects of Desire","review":"While doing research for an essay on the \\"Search for Postmodernism in a Modernist World,\\" I purchased Ms Rowell's book, curiously titled Objects of Desire. At the very least, it was a questionable investment. However, it is indicative of what is wrong with the world of modern art [or even postmodern art] where pretentious jargon takes the place of actual description, reason or discussion as an excuse for art works that in the end are just boring.At the time of the book's publication, Ms Rowell was allegedly a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Her explanation of Postmodernism gets at the heart of the matter in such a way that I am compelled to quote her at length, in particular her explanation regarding the bridge between pastiche and schizophrenia:\\"The possibility of pastiche -- its neutrality and blankness - presupposes that individualism is dead. The copy is impersonal; the model is either indifferent, forgotten, or never existed. High modernism, however, was \\"predicated on the invention of a personal private style... This means that the modernist aesthetic is in some way a unique personality and individuality, which can be expected to generate its own unique vision of the world, and to forge its own unique, unmistakable style.\\" Yet today, scientists, social scientists, and cultural critics are \\"exploring the notion that that [sic] kind of individualism and personal identity is a thing of the past; that the old individual or individualist subject is \`dead'; and that one might even describe the concept of the unique individual and the theoretical basis of individualism as ideological.\\" Thus the old models of modernism are no longer viable. As we know, schizophrenia is defined as a basic breakdown of relationships - because objects in a perceptual field, for example and between words and their meaning or content, or between words and each other as a continuous fabric of meaning in a linguistic system. As a result, the schizophrenic has no concept of time as linear, interconnected, and sequential, and none either of personal identity as a selection and interrelation of certain specific human potentials at the expense of others. Conversely, because the schizophrenic does not (indeed cannot) search for meaning behind the object, behind the word, or within the unhierarchical unfolding of the field of experience, he or she has an experience of the present and of its objects that is \\"overwhelmingly vital and \`material'... ever more material - or better still, literal - ever more vivid in sensory ways.\\" ... Pashtiching the objects of desire of our traditional landscape, they set a film of meaning (or nonmeaning) between themselves and ourselves. In their deliberate displacement and disconnection from familiar circuits of meaning - whether aesthetic or real - these surrogates or simulacra embody another register of experience, that of the signs and systems of the postmodern world.\\" [Rowell, 194-195]Is there anything more that can be added after such an erudite analysis? Perhaps there is. However, the analysis does cause one to ask a number of questions. Did anyone buy this book for anything other than the pictures? How does one get a job as a curator in a major museum? And more to the point, was there an editor, or was the editor on vacation when page after page of turgid, incoherent and virtually incomprehensible pseudo-intellectualism made its way to print? Or perhaps this presentation is meant to be a literary representation of Postmodernism, most likely a parody of postmodern Deconstructionist style. One can only hope that this is satire - the world of Dilbert in the \\"artplace.\\" Dramatic readings of her text have provided considerable entertainment for my friends and family, who found it quite amusing."},{"Title":"Objects of Desire","review":"This outsize book begins with some arrestingly beautiful illustrations that reward repeated viewing. But the selection stumbles when it tries to stretch the definition of \\"still life\\" to include postmodern sculptures like Jeff Koon's basketball in an aquarium and Tony Cragg's pointed objects lined up across a bare floor.But well before that, you'll have thrown up your hands (along with your lunch) at Margit Rowell's text--written in PhDspeak, seeking to plumb new depths of academic obfuscation. For example:\\"As mentioned earlier, the specific objects of a traditional still life, and their interrelations, obey a rigorously closed and articulated narrative structure, a structure of desire, 'a structure that both invents and distances its object and thereby inscribes again and again the gap between signifier and signified that is the place of negation for the symbolic' [Susan Stewart, 'On Longing'].\\"Purer than this, drivel doesn't come!"},{"Title":"My Life As My Self","review":"I used to have a great deal of trouble sleeping. It was a mixture of insomnia (due to a great deal of worry) and fear of going to sleep (due to inevitable nightmares). Thank God(dess) that I came across this audio interview with Alice Walker. There is nothing more soothing to a frightenned child in the night than the sounds of a voice of a loving mother.This tape includes an interview as well as poems that Walker recites with an occasional backdrop of Bluegrass/Folksy music. She discusses with genuine concern issues such as the creative writing process, religion, the repulsive act of Female Genital Mutilation (which she has researched and written about elsewhere), anger and rage, remorse, reunion, animals, racism, meditation, silence, personal identity, and many other topics.This interview took place in Walker's home in Northern California and you can sense the utter peace, silence, and a very deep spiritual focus surrounding her dwelling. Her presence (from just hearing her voice) is deeply mysterious with a quiet power.It is probable that only die-hard Walker fans will search this tape out. This is really a shame. But, I suppose (as Patti Smith once said) those who seek feel the glow."},{"Title":"My Life As My Self","review":"I loved Alice's writing early on, but when I heard this audiotape, I was mesmerized by her soft, breathy lovely voice. It was then I got a sense of the fullness and width of the lady's heart, social conscience, love, and grounded spirituality. This is a lady of courage and integrity. A wonderful introduction to the author."},{"Title":"Death in Ecstacy","review":"First published in 1936, this mystery is just a bit dated, as one might expect. It is a little too polite by today's standards: the detective and his confidants are never in jeopardy. There is but the one murder and no real foreshadowing of another possible homicide. The plot might well have been improved by more action or at least the threat of something dire. Despite this, the ambience and characterizations are superior to most present-day whodunits. The only flaw in the characterizations is in Ms. Marsh's attempts to write grating American slang. If the reader likes Agatha Christie and the novels that are more puzzle than danger, this is a very good choice."},{"Title":"Death in Ecstacy","review":"This is one of Ms. Marsh's earlier mysteries and it shows in how soon into the novel the murder occurs as opposed to the mid-novel murder that takes place in later efforts. As usual, it is well written and this time has a rather exotic beginning as action opens in the confines of a cultish \\"church\\" where strange goings on occur.The start of the story is seen through the eyes of Nigel Bathgate, an up and coming journalist who became friends with the lead character, Inspector Alleyn, in Ngaio Marsh's first novel, A Man Lay dead. His presence adds \\"fresh\\" eyes to the investigation as opposed to the efficient and logical views of Alleyn. In other words, Nigel plays Watson to Alleyn's Holmes.A strange ceremony in the above mentioned place of worship, involves the communal drinking of a sacred mixture by a select few congregants. This leads to the poisoning of the Chosen Vessel (the last to drink from the cup). The cast of suspects are pretty varied including some spinsters, a young couple facing problems of their own, a stereotypical (from the then British point of view) American, a rather slimy leader of the congregation and Frenchman with refined tastes.As always, all the loose ends are neatly tied up. If one concentrates, one can usually solve a Ngaio Marsh mystery as all the clues you need are placed before you. Her style is not of the Agatha Christie, shock twist, but rather relies on a careful examination of the facts by a likeable lead detective of perfect manners who has a keen insight into people. Her later novels reveal characters of greater depth, but for all the briefness of this novel, it is still a pleasant read as we can take pleasure in the sparkling prose of Ms Marsh and tickle our minds with a neat little mystery."},{"Title":"Death in Ecstacy","review":"Not my favorite Marsh, but still very good. Nigel Bathgate (AKA Inspector Alleyn's &quot;Watson&quot;) is simply a bored journalist looking for something to do on a rainy day. He spies the mysterious &quot;church&quot; across the street from him, sneaks in to a secret ceremony, and quite by accident, ends up witnessing a murder. Who does he call but his own favorite Scotland Yard detective, Roderick Alleyn. An interesting blend of spiritualism, money, drugs and murder."},{"Title":"Death in Ecstacy","review":"Great book from the 30s.

A true Romantic living in an age when Romanticism was rapidly growing out of fashion, he died of heavy drinking (but really of lost love) at age 33.His poetry may be overly sentimental at times, with its overt echoes of Swinburne, but it's also meticulously crafted and most memorable when his melodious word-music underscores original images. \\"I cried for madder music and for stronger wine\\" is one of his justly famous lines, as is \\"They are not long, the days of wine and roses\\".The few prose stories here collected reflect his sensitive, fragile character as much as the poetry. Both remain worth reading as a testament to a sensitive soul who, even if he couldn't play the game of life, excelled as a writer of sad and beautiful tales and poems. After all, \\"a thing of beauty is a joy forever,\\" as his predecessor Keats knew so well."},{"Title":"Blue Jelly - Love Lost And The Lessons Of Canning","review":"I've been in her shoes, and i know how it feels to search for peace.

Canning, a lost art, now recovered thanks to DB"},{"Title":"Blue Jelly - Love Lost And The Lessons Of Canning","review":"I would give this book a 2.5 star rating if I could. I rounded down to help offset all the unmerited positive reviews.Former Rolling Stone writer Debby Bull's \\"Blue Jelly\\" is a simultaneous account of one woman's journey through depression and step-by-step recipe book for preserves. The idea is fun and quirky. Unfortunately, the content isn't as good as the premise.The book is mildly funny, and it might be worth reading if you're really in a funk. But it probably won't be the protagonist's successful transformation from abject to alright that'll make you feel better. You'll more likely just experience a boost of confidence when you realize how much less pathetic than the main character you are.I'm not sure how much of this story is autobiographical. I don't want to be insensitive to anyone's personal plights here, but the woman in this story was downright ridiculous. (If you don't want spoilers, stop now.) To clarify, at one point she's visiting a boy in a mental asylum. He's there for having murdered his abusive family. While she's talking to him, she breaks down crying and whines to him about how her relationships never go right... Seriously, lady? This poor kid has been through absolute hell, and you're asking him for sympathy because you can't resist throwing yourself into admittedly unpleasant but still totally escapable relationships. Co-dependency is rough, but come on. I think the protagonist deserved a life in the loony bin much more than that boy did.To her credit, Bull's style doesn't waste your time. Her writing is compact and unadorned. Many people would be able to read this book in a day if it was remotely interesting to them. But as much as I'm a fan of minimalistic writing, it didn't always work in this case. There wasn't really enough depth to get the reader invested, and extra clarification would have been useful at times.This book is just pretty expendable. The best lesson you can take from it is that calming ritual activities are a good way to give your life context when you're feeling down, but any shrink can tell you that. If you want to read a story about a crazy person that's actually insightful, try \\"Fight Club.\\" If you want jelly recipes, just Google them."},{"Title":"Blue Jelly - Love Lost And The Lessons Of Canning","review":"This was a tremendous disappointment to me. The entire book isdevoted to the author's distress over a lost love. Although we allknow how unbelievably (and unbearably) devastating that is, life *does* go on. Since Christopher Reeve, the off-duty policeman paralyzed one St. Patrick's Day, and other extraordinary people like them -- not to mention those who have lost loved ones (even children) to death -- can find the strength to go on, it seems almost ludicrous to devote an entire book to the trauma of losing a lover, and long periods of being unable to get dressed in the morning or go to work, et cetera. Most of us simply don't have that luxury, and have to pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and start over again. However much we may mourn the loss, we must move on. I therefore think that a good, uplifting book would be much better than this ... one which reminds us of how lucky we are, and how much we still have to be thankful for.I was also greatly disappointed with the recipes. Although &quot;lessons in canning&quot; is part of the title, I could not find *ONE* reference to how the recipes turned out save for the author having come in second (out of only two entries) to a twelve year old at the state or county fair. That's not much of a testimonial for me! For me to be inspired to try the recipes, I'd have wanted to read that they were delicious, that people loved them, or whatever -- something besides have come in second out of only two entries, with the other a twelve year old.I just think that this book is a downer, and that people should instead try to focus on the positive, and upon how much they have for which to be thankful. Very disappointing ... whining rather than uplifting."},{"Title":"Blue Jelly - Love Lost And The Lessons Of Canning","review":"Simply stated, one of the best books for healing and growth (and humor) I've ever read...well, to be specific, I've ever read 5 times!

I've loaned it to friends a million times over, and it's never been received with anything less than pure excitement, relief, pleasure, and appreciation. Great writing, great book, great lessons.

It's been awhile but years ago I remember going through a break up that was hard to let go. Now, I was in high school and that to me is a teenager thing but I could relate. Different phases, different situations but probably all the same feelings. This book jumps around to different things which keeps you interested on her journeys, all the while learning a little about canning. Something I know NOTHING about. In the end it comes together, it's a amazing how all the jumble of stories, times, thoughts come together to show a lesson learned. Now, I have a feeling each reader will take something completely different from this book, a lesson of some sort!My favorite line was (I think) from page 85 or 86.

Canning, a lost art, now recovered thanks to DB"},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"This novel, first published in 1967, has a more serious and darker tone than most of Dick's earlier works. It is an ambitious novel, underread and underrated in the Dick canon, in which the author attempts to integrate religious and metaphysical thought from a wide variety of writers across history. The premise is that time has started to run backwards due to something called the Hobart Phase. Dead people come back to life in their graves; living people grow continually younger until they reenter their mothers' wombs. Food is regurgitated into its original form, and while eating is considered obscene, waste (&quot;sogum&quot;) is &quot;imbibed&quot; through tubes in public. People say &quot;goodbye&quot; when they greet each other and &quot;hello&quot; when they part. Critics have derided Dick's use of time reversal as completely illogical and inconsistent. That doesn't seem to matter really. The novel's serious concerns, about the frailty of life and love in the face of monolithic external forces, lift it above its own contrivances."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"Maybe it's not such a great idea, reissuing PKD's back catalog. To be sure, many of PKD's novels are sheer brilliance, even if flawed. But as more and more of them come back into print it becomes equally evident that many of his novels were more flawed than brilliant. Sadly, this is the case with \\"Counter-Clock World.\\"According to this novel's fascinating premise, time is running backwards: the dead return to life and begin getting younger; people smoke butts which become full-length cigarettes they put back into the package; one is greeted with \\"goodbye.\\" It's a fascinating idea, but not altogether clear.In Martin Amis'sTime's Arrowa similar thing takes place: the dead are resurrected and forced to relive every moment in reverse. Forced, because their lives unwind like a film. Amis's book is brilliant in that the reader must make sense of events that become all too clear, but only upon reflection. Specifically: Amis's character is a former Nazi doctor, and he --like the reader-- must try to make sense of his acts. The gimmick --time running backwards-- isn't really a gimmick at all; it's a successful endeavor to force the reader to consider an old story in a new way.By comparison, PKD's book seems juvenile, and I say this as a fan of PKD. Not only are the metaphysics of this world unexplained (time goes backwards on Earth but not on Mars; people must smoke in reverse but still have free choice); more damaging still are PKD's own metaphysics. One constantly has the feeling that PKD is really just trying to work though some ideas himself --and failing at it. \\"Just a rehash of Plotinus and Plato and Kant and Leibnitz and Spinoza\\" (216). That's about right, but without the developed arguments. If you're familiar with the philosophical arguments, PKD's handling of them will not impress you.Worse still, the characters (none of whom you particularly like) change so radically with regards to their core values --who they love, who they hate, who they want to kill-- that the effect is, oddly enough, not unrealistic but too realistic. That is, too painfully close to the author's own confused life and relationships. That doesn't make the characters any more developed or credible, but it does perhaps explain why.I think this is honest writing and a sincere attempt to represent the world PKD thought he was living in. For this same reason, it is actually quite pathetic."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"Welcome to once again another romp through the genius mind of PKD. In Counter-Clock World(1967)people greet each other with \\"Goodbye\\", light cigarette butts and blow smoke into the filters, and a whole lot of funny \\"food\\". You see, in this future world time has begun moving back, at least for the dead. The dead are coming back to life and become younger once again until a fetus in a womb.Sebastion Hermes runs a Flask Vitarium where he greets and digs up the newly born dead, informing them of the time change, known as the \\"Hobart Phase.\\" In this case, the newly born is a man called Thomas Peak, or the Anarch Peak, a very religious figure in the past associated with the Udi religion, and certain parties would like to see him dead before he can talk of his personal experience with the afterlife. The \\"Erads\\", work with the Library to eradicate all previous history of positive activism and truth.Another religious figure-head to come to town is the \\"Almighty\\" Ray Roberts, a leader of an African-American religion, Udi. His intentions and plans with the possible resurrection of the Anarch are unknown. Officer Joe Tinbane also helps in trying to help Mr.Hermes, to isolate him and protect the Anarch, while in pursuit of agents of the Library.PKD touches on a little mystery with this novel, along with his typical philosophies of religion and death and drugs and time.A fast and fun and not quite so confusing as other of his works. A lot of fun and I recommend this to a first time reader of Dick.A fantastic read."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"Some time ago I've attended a seminar on \\"Philosophy & Sci-Fi\\" and was delighted when PKD (1928-1982) was chosen the first author to discuss. I plunge into reading and re-reading his works, and still am.Obviously the second step of my renewed PKD-mania is to produce new reviews!\\"Counter-Clock World\\" (1967) is quite underrated amongst PKD's novels, nevertheless, IMHO, is a GREAT story.The backdrop of the story shares some traits with other ones dear to PKD: colonization of Mars with only a one-way ticket; USA divided into three parts; some kind of shared massive religious experience; androids shows up and charismatic religious leader too. It doesn't matter if these peculiarities are main issues in the story or not: they are there.This book, as each of PKD's novels, is unique, captivating and full of action, moral, religious and ethical issues. Characters are not heroes, just human beings doing their best to survive in a hostile environment. They may be selfish and even despicable but within them there is always a spark of altruism trying to emerge.The story is situated on Earth suffering a strange time reversal. Time is going backwards and people are resurrecting: they are called old-born and must be helped in this process.This time turn affects everything from eating till speaking and PKD exploits it greatly.The reborn of a religious leader unchain confrontments among different political, social and economic powers. In the middle of these colliding forces Sebastian and Lotta are trapped and make their way.Do not expect a neat \\"these are the good guys\\", that's not PKD style. The reader must compromise with the story and choose its own solution to the puzzle.As usual with PKD writings an unfathomable melancholic undercurrent traverse the whole story, forcing every character to wonder \\"why am I here?\\"This book is real good. Not only sci-fi fans may appreciate it, general inquisitive public too!Enjoy!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"You might say that science fiction tells two kinds of stories most of the time, \\"if this goes on\\" stories and \\"what if\\" stories. \\"What if\\" stories give more play to the author's imagination, but there's a problem with them; you can't tell stories about whole worlds. They have to be about people. That is, you can't write a story about what would happen if time ran backwards; the real question is, How would people get along in their lives if time started to run backwards? That's what Philip K. Dick gets into here.He was no quantum physicist, he was in many ways a mystic, and therefore the anti-time technicalities in \\"Counter-Clock World\\" don't quite come off. Inconsistencies abound. This story occurs some years after time has started to rewind, and people have been crawling out of their graves, growing younger, and eventually creeping back into the womb. They take cigarette and cigar butts out of packages, puff on them until they get longer, then put them in ashtrays. The even regurgitate food instead of eating it, cursing by saying \\"Oh, food!\\" and \\"You're a mouth-hole!\\" instead of the idioms you and I are used to. Nevertheless, they continue to walk forwards, they speak English that we recognize, and as far as I can determine the sun continues to rise in the East.Take the scene where a man wakes up in the morning, opens up a box of whiskers, smears them all over his face and roots around for dirty clothes to put on before going into the kitchen to disgorge his breakfast. Fine, he's doing the reverse of the usual morning routine, but shouldn't he be waking up in the evening? And disgorging his dinner? And...well, you get the idea.Don't try to figure this thing out. If you want a time-reversal story that makes logical sense, check \\"Time's Arrow\\" by Martin Amis. You don't come to PKD for logical consistency anyway, so if that's what you want you're in the wrong house. This isn't really a story about time reversal; as I said before, it's about how people cope with time reversal.Sebastian Hermes is a twice-born - someone dug him out of his grave some years before (or after) our story begins. Now he's in business doing the same thing. He, his much younger wife and his staff find people calling out from their coffins, dig them up, and make them available for sale to the highest bidder, usually some relative. It's distasteful, obviously, but it's a living. Then he locates the grave of a man named Thomas Peake, who founded a new religion based on the idea that all humans are one, and developed a sacrament to demonstrate that truth by means of a drug-induced collective experience. Since his death, the Udi have turned their services into a kind of circus attraction - it's become quite popular and a source of enormous power to its leadership. Now Peake is about to wake up.Here's another important detail; Sebastian sends his wife to do research on Peake and the Udi at the People's Topical Library, a place dedicated to eradicating all knowledge, bit by bit, as time flows backwards. That is, if Philip K. Dick emerged from the grave and had to un-write \\"Counter-Clock World\\", the Library staff would be there to make sure he did it. (Shouldn't that happen automatically if time is running backwards?) When it comes to Peake, though, they're concerned - what if he wakes up and tells everyone what life after death is really like? He's a religious figure that people would listen to. A new thing would be created rather than eradicated.So, having located Peake's grave and determined that the man will be resurrecting soon, Sebastian Hermes has a lot of decisions to make and a lot of people after him. That's what this book is about.Like all great sf and most of the good stuff, the technical speculation is really just an excuse. In this case, it's an excuse not only to take a look at what ordinary people under pressure are capable of, it's also an excuse for some surprisingly subtle metaphysical speculation. There's no point in getting into specifics about this, but what else can you say about a book that kicks off by asking what rights a person might have by saving another person's life? That's just for openers. PKD spent a good part of his life examining gnostic Christianity, and each chapter in \\"Counter-Clock World\\" begins with a quote from a metaphysical philosopher like Aquinas or Boethius on the nature of God, the human experience of time, the power of relationships, and all like that there.The characters, too, spend way more time discussing the morality of their deeds than pretty nearly anyone else would do in a futuristic adventure tale. And that's what this is, make no mistake about it; unlike some of PKD's weaker stuff, \\"Counter-Clock World\\" is full of desperate flight, battles large and small, love and hatred. Some of the characters go so far as to die, and others grieve piteously for them. PKD was prone at times to get distracted, but not this time; this novel begins at the beginning and goes right through to the end with few, if any, tangents, despite the philosophical debates.\\"Counter-Clock World\\" is, I gather, considered by many to be minor PKD, hardly worth mentioning. I can't imagine why. Its closing scene is overwhelming; a man stands in a graveyard at night listening to the dead wake up and beg for help. What's more, the novel earns that dramatic close. On second thought, don't bother with \\"Time's Arrow\\" - good as it is, read this one first.Benshlomo says, Rejoice, PKD fans - the critics were wrong."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"Though the pace can at times make you feel like your in labor, this novel has an incredible plot, and is simply another in the plethora of PKD's dystopic wonders. Honestly, not his best effort, but definitely worth the time."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"I am a sucker for wacky, non-linear time shifts, and this novel did not disappoint, despite some weaknesses. The story starts with Mrs. Tilly M. Benton, crying out from the grave. She has just woken from death, and is eventually disinterred by Sebastian Hermes and his crew from the Flask of Hermes Vitarium, a business that rescues newly reborn corpses and sells them to relatives and other interested parties. This whole scenario is made possible by a freak of nature, which has caused time to reverse, causing people to age backwards from death, and eventually seek out a womb as they become infants.There is a religion, or perhaps a cult, which provides an overarching framework for the narrative. Sebastian believes the founder of the religion, who has become a prophet figure, is soon to be reborn. The story revolves around finding this leader, and the dynamic conflict among: a) its church, which may have strayed from the prophet's teachings, b) Sebastian and his wife, c) the policeman who originally found Tilly Benton, and d) The Library, which is proxy for an Orwellian shadow government.The book is 200+ pages. It zips along. The trade-off, however, is that some of the complex plot and character developments are handled in almost a shorthand. I found myself forgiving the author, Dick, for breezing past what really should have been flushed out to make better sense. But then the novel would have been long and had much different pacing. If the novel were written today, it would be 957 pages and be made into a 4-1/2 hour movie.As neither indulgence is true here, I can recommend this novel. I enjoyed it a great deal. It is fascinatingly weird."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"This novel is remarkable at every level. Only PKD's deft touch could allow the impossible premise of the story to persist, even to the point of satire and humour, and achieve a powerful allegory. The novel mirrors elements of the Christian story but is applicable to any attempt by centrist power to manipulate people, history and truth. PKD has the humility to reflect on some of the oddest contrivances of the human condition while maintaining dry humour but not ridicule. Similarly, he offers apt classical references without a hint of hauteur.PKD manages this allegory while dishing up a good plot with the twist and turns, however inevitable, to retain the attraction of strong genre fiction. As the reader identifies each character's counterpart in popular mythology, it is interesting to read commentary that PKD penned some characters around, for example, his wives. He seems to have fun using the counter-clock plot device to poke fun at social mores.Commentators do not place this novel with his best. If so, the reader is left to wonder at the author's prolific turn out of highly imaginative work. With this in mind, this reviewer has resisted the temptation to award one star in keeping with the book's premise."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"'Counter-Clock World' is a decidedly odd offering from the decidedly odd yet enormously talented Philip K. Dick. In this counter-clock world we have people who inexplicably rise from the dead and grow younger until, well, they are placed back into a womb. Without much explanation, this world seems to progress nicely until a Martin Luther King-like figure rises from the dead. His followers view this as a messianic revival, his detractors think otherwise, and then there are those who want to exploit this event for money. Most of the book focuses on these various forces vying to gain control of the reborn spiritual leader.As an action story 'Counter-Clock World' moves fairly nicely and at times is a page-turner. But the science fiction element to the story, although intriguing, is really half baked. A shame really, because the overall premise of the story is quite original.Bottom line: sort of a \\"one trick pony\\" oddity of book. Best left to loyal fans of the author."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"If someone else had written this book, I would give it 5 stars, but it is not of of Dick's best.

Especially if you are a major religious leader? As usual the characters are plagued by self doubt and having unsuccessful relationships.Some parts are funny, such as 'sorghum', being imbibed through pipes and whiskers being plastered at the beginning of the day. I liked the idea of LSD grenades and a region based on a sharing of minds brought about by using a drug called DNT (presumably DMT.)What bothered me was the lack of consistency in the backwards world and the neglect of detail. What happens if you were cremated not buried? Or died a violent death, your body dismemebered? Why are some things backwards, some not?"},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"The rough draft, now called COUNTER CLOCK WORLD, must have lain at the bottom of Dick's manuscript trunk many years. But a lot of deep thoughts, about god and about man's existence, went into writing this novel. Someday in the future, if man ever gets over his petty attitudes toward life, toward what reality is, these scraps could become an important work.But science has not yet absorbed the significance of nano-scale and pico-scale reality, the tiny seeds from which life springs. Dick's dead characters, born again with the reversal of time, could only report how terribly small they felt while dead. Their deaths had imparted to them a new perspective showing them the huge, immensity of the universe.As always, Dick transcended common thought. Here he uncovered another zany, hidden world. The dead arising from the grave, babies re-entering the womb, none of this made any sense. But nutty stories were what Dick was all about. What he gave the reader was an opportunity to free him/her self from the reality that tried to imprison Dick within his own mind. Read it!"},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"PKD creates strange \\"platforms\\", which allow ideas to be examined from unusual points of view. This novel is no exception.One question Dick repeatedly asks in this highly unusual novel is: \\"why do humans make such strong, arbitrary, decisions on what is socially acceptable?\\"One example. Why is eating a highly social ritual, yet going to the bathroom causes so much anxiety that we have to hide behind doors (preferably far away from where people are) and generally are afraid to even talk about anything to do with it, including the organs under our underwear?Dick brilliantly uses the device of time flowing backward to reverse the process of ingestion and excretion to examine this and some characters' feelings towards it as the novel progresses.Why do we pick 17 years old as an age a woman can cause a date to be (technically) guilty of statuatory rape if her shoes are off, yet at 18 any sexual act imaginable is fine and dandy by the law?Again, by the reverse time sequence of the novel, such issues can be probed in a very thoughtful manner, without all the emotional baggage they would usually entail.Brilliant. Weird. Subtle. Riveting. Dark. Philosophy. In short, the classic heart of PKD!"},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"Some time ago I've attended a seminar on \\"Philosophy & Sci-Fi\\" and was delighted when PKD (1928-1982) was chosen the first author to discuss. I plunge into reading and re-reading his works, and still am.Obviously the second step of my renewed PKD-mania is to produce new reviews (and still am too)!\\"Counter-Clock World\\" (1967) is quite underrated amongst PKD's novels, nevertheless, IMHO, is a GREAT story.The backdrop of the story shares some traits with other ones dear to PKD: colonization of Mars with only a one-way ticket; USA divided into three parts; some kind of shared massive religious experience; androids shows up and charismatic religious leader too. It doesn't matter if these peculiarities are main issues in the story or not: they are there.This book, as each of PKD's novels, is unique, captivating and full of action, moral, religious and ethical issues. Characters are not heroes, just human beings doing their best to survive in a hostile environment. They may be selfish and even despicable but within them there is always a spark of altruism trying to emerge.The story is situated on Earth suffering a strange time reversal. Time is going backwards and people are resurrecting: they are called old-born and must be helped in this process.This time turn affects everything from eating till speaking and PKD exploits it greatly.The reborn of a religious leader unchain confrontments among different political, social and economic powers. In the middle of these colliding forces Sebastian and Lotta are trapped and make their stumbling way.Do not expect a neat \\"these are the good guys\\", that's not PKD style. The reader must compromise with the story and choose its own solution to the puzzle.As usual with PKD writings an unfathomable melancholic undercurrent traverse the whole story, forcing every character (and the reader too) to wonder \\"why am I here?\\"This book is real good. Not only sci-fi fans may appreciate it, general inquisitive public too!Enjoy!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"This book arrived very quickly. Was completely brand new. Looked just like it would have if I had bought it at Barnes & Noble. Great."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"This is not one of Dick's best books, and I kind of found myself getting annoyed a lot of the time at the way time \\"moved backwards\\" in the story. It just never quite made proper sense. However, I still enjoyed the whole book, mostly because I love PKD's writing style and imagination. If you are new to his books, I would not start out with this one.(Rated at 5 because he's my favorite author and way better than any other sc-fi out there)..."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"I'm reviewing this book, because I've just read it; also, I'm a bit appalled at the number of high reviews of Dick's work in general.Dick is definitely one of the all-time great SF writers (and he's arguably one of the few geniuses to have worked in the field). Approx 6-10 of his books are classics; however, Dick also wrote a lot of just plain awful books (esp. in the 1950s); and due to his growing popularity, some of these books are actually being brought back into print (e.g., the Man Who Japed, World Jones Made). Luckily Counter-Clock world (1966) isn't one of them; however, this is one of Dick's lesser works. It's a short, mildy amusing read, but the ideas in it are frankly underdeveloped and unconvincing. Race relations also are thankfully much better than depicted in this rather quaint and obsolete \\"clunker\\" of a book. Save your money and get this from the library; or better yet, read something better (and similar) like Ubik."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"Dick attempts the impossible task of making time seem to flow backwards as the reader moves forward through the book. An eerie and unforgettable premise has the dead being &quot;born&quot; in their graves, crying out to be exhumed so they can begin their reverse trek through life. In other scenes food is excreted onto plates and then boxed and returned to the shelf, while bodily wastes are ingested through a &quot;sogum pipe,&quot; a process alluded to several times but mercifully never depicted. Eventually the book reaches an action-packed climax (shouldn't it have occurred at the beginning?), in which bullets are sucked back into firearms and so forth, but by that time the paradoxes have come so fast and furious that the reader's brain has imploded. As in so many of his novels, Dick throws too many balls in the air to keep the juggling act going, and as scientifically plausible fiction, it's a mess, but only a genius would have attempted an idea as weird as this one, and taken it as far Dick does."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"Do you love PKD? Have you read a lot of his books?If you answered yes then you'll love this. If not I would try one of his more approachable titles first (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, or one of his short-story collections). I would not recommend this to a first time Dick reader; if you don't know what you're getting yourself into you probably will not like it.With that said, I love PKD, and have read quite a few of his works. I, having been aclimated to his style, found it very enjoyable. The only concerns I have are that some of the ideas, with reguards to the backwards flow of time, are somewhat garbled. A good example is how cigeretts are smoked by inhaling the fumes and blowing into the filter- yet the people still manage to communicate while inhaling. Try it yourself, see it's not so easy. I know it's nit-picky, I can't help it.All in all a great book for anyone who already enjoys PKD."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"PKD faced the old problem of commercialism vs. integrity. I consider this book to be a testament to Dick's integrity. Exploring often mentioned, but never developed, ideas.For example, the Wizard Merlin supposedly lived backwards in time. Yet this idea has only been presented, not developed in the stories I have read. Several religions suggest a rapture or ressurection of the dead, without filling us in on the details.Dick must have really felt the avenue of backwards time was worth exploring or he never would have finished it. It was brave for Dick to see these ideas through to their conclusion. While facing the realities of rent and editors, etc.This book is not as morbid as earlier reviews might suggest. The characters are sincere and even light-hearted at times.I found this to be one of Dick's easier and smoother reads.I break it down this way. If you go to a movie and willingly submit to a fantasy experience, read this book. If you go to movies to test your analytical and deductive skills don't bother.If you suspect that time is really just one big cosmic \\"Wow!\\" that has already ensued, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"Originally posted at FanlitIt's 1998 and time has started running backward. Aging has reversed so that people are gradually getting younger, and dead people are awakening in their graves and begging to be let out. The excavating companies have the rights to sell the people they unbury to the highest bidder. When Sebastian Hermes's small excavating company realizes that Thomas Peak, a famous religious prophet, is about to come back to life, they know that getting to him first could be a huge boon to their business. The problem is that there are other organizations that prefer for Thomas Peak to stay dead, especially when they realize he may have information about the afterlife.Philip K. Dick is in a class of his own and it's hard to compare his novels to anyone's but his own. Maybe it's not fair, but there are certain expectations we have for other novelists that don't apply when we read PKD. Most importantly, we can't expect the plot to always make sense. This is most true, I think, when Dick shows us a future United States of America which we know could never happen. For example, in Counter-Clock World, we can't let it bother us that an excavating company has the rights to sell people it digs up and that nobody, including the resurrected people and their relatives, question this. Or that the public library system has the authority to eradicate important works of arts and literature. Or that some things work backwards (people disgorge their food instead of eating it, they say \\"goodbye\\" when they answer the phone and \\"hello\\" when they hang up, and cigarettes get longer when they're smoked) -- but most things (like walking, driving, and talking) don't. None of it makes sense, but you just have to go with it and, if you can't, you shouldn't be reading Philip K. Dick.So, compared to some of his other novels, Counter-Clock World, published in 1967, does pretty well. It's got the usual wacky premise, annoying abbreviations ('pape\\" for newspaper, \\"pilg\\" for pilgrimage, etc), bad marriages, robots, drug trips (only one short one this time), and plenty of paranoia, but the plot holds together well (once you agree to the premise), it's fast-paced, amusing, and, most importantly, not confusing.There's usually a religious theme in PKD's work, but it's a particular focus in Counter-Clock World. He has some interesting thoughts about death, resurrection, pride, and humility. As usual, I find it disappointing, and somewhat sad, that Dick imagined all sorts of sophisticated technology for 1998 but assumed that we would not have progressed in the areas of civil rights for blacks and women. We have further to go in these areas, but it's disturbing that Dick did not foresee our social progress. In fact, most of his work, like much science fiction from the 1960s, assumes a degradation of American culture that, fortunately, we have not seen.Patrick Lawlor did an absolutely perfect job with the narration of Brilliance Audio's production which has just been released. His clear strong voice is attractive, his male and female voices were spot-on, and he managed to get the paranoia and frenzy across without annoying me. I can't wait to listen to more of Patrick Lawlor."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"Started of with too many characters and too many conversations, this book almost forced me to give it up straight away. But perseverance to read until the middle will be rewarded.The concept itself is interesting. A world when times move backwards. When the deads are 'revived' from the grave, being sold as a property to anyone who would bid the highest.And when the one who's coming back to life is a religious figure, interesting things can happen.There are two kinds of sci-fi books: one that is written by a scientist and one written by a non-scientist. This book is the latter. Sci-fi Books written by scientist contains the actual correct science or science of what would be possible in the future. While non-scientist writers tends to use science as basis and props for futuristic situation, emphasizing more on (perhaps) psychological and philosophical issues.This book puts forward some interesting religion and philosophical issues such as how a person who live in the period where times move backwards reacts to the mind that move forwards. However, a reader with a scientific background might be put off by the some of the logic and science in this book, that are rather inconsistent and incorrect at times.Take the example of this: [A person in a coffin in a grave just woke up]&quot; 'Get air down to me!' he tried to yell, but since there is no longer air he could not breathe; he was suffocating. \`Hurry!' he called, but his call became soundless in the absence of air; he lay compressed, crushed, by an enormous vacuum; the pressure grew until, silently, his ribs broke. He felt that, too, his bones one by one snapping.&quot;Overall it's an enjoyable book if you somehow can disregard the incorrectness of the science behind it."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"Anyone who has seen the Red Dwarf episode \\"Backwards\\" will know the basic premise of Counter-Clock World. Based on Dick's short story \\"Your Appointment Will Be Yesterday\\", Counter-Clock World has time running backwards, curiously only on Earth, due to the naturally occuring 'Hobart Phase' (in the short story the Hobart Phase was artificially created).Logic would dictate that everything would have to run backwards but in Counter-Clock World people have a forward-pointing 'arrow of time' while the world they are living in has a reverse arrow of time. Dick selctively has his characters doing certain things in backwards (such as 'imbibing' Sogum and later on uneating a plate of food) and other things forwards like driving a car or carrying on a conversation.Even though the environment of Counter-Clock World is a bit hard to buy it nonetheless a good story and is as worth reading as any of his other novels."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"Though the premise is corny, the intrigue Dick generates is extraordinary, as usual. As fiction it's engrossing, if a bit dark and without a particularly good ending.Even moreso than usual, you can correlate the character's thoughts to Dick's life here. He definitely was one to analyze himself in his books. He seems to prefigure here not only much of what he wrote about for the next 15 years, but much of what he lived. It's not glorious or noble, and makes me a bit uncomfortable."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"[NO SPOILERS]If there's one thing that I love about PKD stories it's this:He almost always has a plot or concept that will blow your mind.This time around, the plot deals with the idea that \\"The dead grow young\\", meaning that those already dead eventually come alive in their coffins and after being exhumed begin living life as usual, but getting younger as the years go by.As you can imagine, this is a difficult concept to grasp and even PKD seemed to have a bit of a hard time with it. For example, there isn't a whole lot of consistency or reason as to how things work.Why are their food and other natural processes done backwards?Why do the characters say \\"Goodbye\\" for \\"Hello\\" and vice versa? If they're going to go to that extreme, then shouldn't they be talking backwards as well?What happens if you were cremated instead of buried? (I think the book lightly touches on this, but still didn't do a very good job of explaining how this situation would play out.)As usual, the main character is plagued with marital problems, something PKD was well familiar with, unfortunately. It does make for some very interesting reading by shifting the spotlight so it's not on the \\"dead grow young\\" concept 100% of the time.There are some neat bits of technology mentioned here, including a CEPHALIC-WAVE DETECTOR which is used to track people and their movements, as well as a LOCK-ANALYZER which can open doors. Later on in the novel there is even a MATRIX-style action scene.There is also a bit of prophecy with the mention of the one-way trips to Mars. Once you get to Mars, never expect to return to Earth.Plot-wise, I found the original premise rather intriguing, but despite that I spent the first half of the book struggling to figure out how this crazy world worked and what exactly was going on (something to do with a resurrected religious leader who knows the secrets of the Afterlife). Fortunately the last half of the book starts to make more sense and even has a little action, however, the last sentence of the book lacks any punch.Although I rate this book 3 stars, it is actually closer to a 3.5, the fun premise is one of the better ones put out by PKD, but the execution of it is a little inconsistent and confusing."},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"If you finish the book you will vicariously experience death and rebirth more than once. The quotes from Erigena placed at the head of many chapters guide the reader into a Neo-Platonic world that is explicitly described as fundamental reality later in the book. Quite an experience.I personally found the play on the library, which is in the reversed-time world of the novel destroying books and knowledge, an interesting comment on Ray Bradbury's basically simple Fahrenheit 451. Bradbury's book was the book of the month here in Los Angeles a few years ago. I would be interested in living in any city that would make Dick's Counter-Clock World as its book of the month. Very.Read the book.\\"-\\""},{"Title":"Counter-Clock World","review":"It's kinda a cliche to be labeling one of Dick's books as, \\"underrated.\\" This one has gotten a few \\"average\\" reviews which I don't think are deserved. This is my fourth Dick book and first time I've commented on Amazon about him, I feel I've read enough PKD to make an accurate comment.This book gets a lot of average reviews because of the world depicted. Time is traveling backwards, people are born from the grave and end their lives in the womb, cigarette butts are lit from ashtrays and are finished when they're \\"new\\" again. The world, in anyone's stretch of the mind, isn't believable, in fact it's a bit silly. But that doesn't matter, it's VERY entertaining. Dick slowly reveals more and more about this world throughout the book, always leaving you with more and more questions. A real page-turner.For those of you who are new to PKD, I think Counter-Clock World is a great introduction. Unlike some of his other books, this one starts off very exciting. And for the newbies, it's much easier to follow than the other books I've read of his (\\"Ubik\\", \\"Flow My Tears...\\", and \\"A Scanner Darkly\\") - Unfortunately, it doesn't have that huge weird ending like in his other books, but that doesn't matter. The end is very climatic and has millions of twists and turns all throughout the entire book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Musical Ascent of Herman Being","review":"Although the book short, I found it much too long for the simple idea it conveys. The book focuses on a man named Herman Being as he moves through a process of learning to appreciate classical music. Despite the underdeveloped and unrealistic subplots, this book does succeed in presenting the author's idea that repetitive listening is the best way to gain an appreciation for classical music. The book is humorous and enjoyable but I would not recommend it to a friend."},{"Title":"The Musical Ascent of Herman Being","review":"Not a bad book, it was a good mixture of everyday life dealings mixed in with some musical revaluations. What I liked about it most was how relate-able it was pertaining to classical music. I myself am a composer (not of classical music), and so far, besides Chopin, find listening to classical music to be incredibly boring. This concept of repeated listening was a real revelation to me in why I tend to like certain music genre's well others I never give a second thought too (in example, I play a lot of video games, which explains why I like video game music so much). It is a simple concept that could be stated over a quick paragraph, but the presentation of many different well known and respected composers and authors coming to these same conclusions really helps it to sink in. Also being a music major, the book is very accurate in all of its descriptions of music, form, style, tension and resolution. I would definitely recommend this to any of my music minded friends trying to discover some of the hidden elements of musical preference. An amusing and informative read!"},{"Title":"The Musical Ascent of Herman Being","review":"Well this is one of the worst books I have ever read. I had to read it for a music appreciation class, and the only good aspect of the entire thing is that it was short. The &quot;helpful information&quot; and &quot;secret&quot; theories of music appreciation could have been easily fit into a modest paragraph, and the rest of the book was unnecessary and irrelevant fluff that was so poorly written I was truely shocked. If you have a choice about reading this, I would say don't bother. If you must, do not buy it because it is not worth the paper it is printed on. I suppose it was better than a boring text book lesson on music appreciation, but the information it provided was minimal and barely scratched the surface of the complex methods of music appreciation."},{"Title":"The Musical Ascent of Herman Being","review":"The book was in superb condition and the seller was honest in all the dealings."},{"Title":"For God, Country, and the Thrill of It: Women Airforce Service Pilots in World War II (Charles and Elizabeth Prothro Texas Photography Series)","review":"The previous review covers the book thoroughly and well, but I have to add how entranced I was by the recent photos of the women. You can see in their eyes, their faces, and their posture that they are something special.

American women flew every type of fighter and bomber, from the nimble P-38 Lightning to the massive B-17 &quot;Flying Fortress&quot;. They ferried warplanes from factory to front, and helped train young men in flying and targeting. And in September 1944, WASP Anne Baumgartner test-piloted the American prototype jet-fighter, the YP-59A Airacomet. This big, glossy book contains a brief history of the WASP and narrative of their training, accompanied by large, high-quality black-and-white photos of the youthful aviators and their airplanes. Their pride of service is evident in their smiling faces and the praise from military leaders such as Generals Arnold and Eisenhower. Their bittersweet sorrow at their post-war deactivation is described poignantly. They continue to meet annually, and the book concludes with a series of more recent photos of the women, as they appeared in the early 90's. Members of the WASP have attended as guest of honor at the yearly reunions of Russian female WWll combat-aviators. (Ms. Noggle has also authored the marvelous book of interviews and photos of veterans of the Soviet women's air-regiments, entitled &quot;A Dance With Death&quot;.) Note: while very attractive, &quot;For God, Country, and the Thrill of It&quot; seems somewhat high-priced for what is basically a coffee-table photo-album.

Only reason that it does not rate a 5 star rating is that it is now 12 years old, and some of the data is now, well, dated.The contributors include a few of the current well-respected researchers (besides the editiors Samet and Spengler) including Harriet Burge in Chapter 12 (Indoor Air Pollution and Infectious Diseases) and Bill Cain in Chapter 6(Environmental Tobacco Smoke).This is still a valuable basic text that helps to give one a nice overview of the complexities of indoor air quality investigation, without as I mentioned above, sacrificing the detail."},{"Title":"Human Error: Cause, Prediction, and Reduction (Applied Psychology Series)","review":"This is a quick read (135 small pages), but very much worthwhile for anyone who is also reading, or about to read, the 'classics' on Human Error (e.g. James Reason). The book is a clear concise analysis and synthesis of 'The Conference on the Nature and Source of Human Error' in 1983, which included Reason and Sanders and Norman and other names you'll find highly cited in the academic literature. The beauty of this book is its scope and clarity, it really sets the applied psychology human error scene in an unbiased way and it really helps connect the ideas you'll find in the various individual books and papers together into a meaningful whole. Of course, this also means it does not have a lot of detail or loads of copious references.Let me pick just some subjects from the table of contents to show you what's inside: Does error exist? What is a fault? About skill, learning & error. On the nature of taxonomies. Is there a theory of error? Psychological bases of error. A taxonomy of taxonomies. Problems of causality. System reliability and redundancy."},{"Title":"Crystal rain from black clouds","review":"I met the author of this book in the 1980s when I was a teenager and he gave me a signed copy. Twenty-five years later I looked online to buy a copy for a friend who had been in a serious accident. The book recounts true stories which remind the reader that even though terrible things happen, sometimes something good can happen because of that bad experience. A quick and easy read."},{"Title":"Building real life English skills","review":"I am currently using this book with my special ed Juniors. They initially were (as usual) unreceptive, but are actually getting into it now. Most of my kids won't go to college and won't need to be able to conjugate verbs or locate the object of the preposition, but they will need to fill out applications, search want ads and read prescription medication. I love this book and really like the areas that allow them to look into things in their own lives (local newspaper, magazines, etc.) for a more practical handle on learning. These kids need to know how it will effect their lives before they are willing to put forth any effort. This book does just that!"},{"Title":"Ninja Gaiden /Nr","review":"HI! I have read the Ninja Gaiden book, and I must say that it is my very favorite book. It has a great story of the young ninja, Ryu Hayabusa on a quest to find his missing father, but to do that he must fight the Jaquio, earn his black belt, and fight off a bunch of feds. This book, aside from having a great story also contains great game tips at the end of each chapter which really help. I am honest, if you are a fan of the Ninja Gaiden series or just a fan of Martial Arts stories, then this is definitely the best book for you!"},{"Title":"Pablo Picasso","review":"This book on Picasso is well worth the money. It is not just a story here, but a reference book that you can read many ways. There are interesting boxes of information, samples of his work on every page, and text for the confident young reader. Although the text will challenge young readers the images will captivate them, so the book has many levels within it: visuals for the young, a challenge for the confident child, and loads of information for the supporting adult.Would be great for school projects and developing a sense of art appreciation in a child."},{"Title":"Pablo Picasso","review":"This book was very helpful as I was preparing to present Picasso's art to elementary school children. It takes a long, prolific career, and organizes the different periods of Picasso's art so that it is more succinct. The wording is very understandable yet not condescending for older readers. This is a great series for adults, like myself, trying to help children understand why an artist was so great."},{"Title":"The Ophthalmic Assistant: A Guide for Ophthalmic Medical Personnel","review":"I have been in the eye care profession for nineteen years.

He discovers 'how' the authors of these books are delivering their meaning. He spends less time than Ken Bailey on sociology. Jan Fokkelman finds the meaning hidden between the toes of the letters in the words. Robert Alter places more emphasis on literary issues. But triangulate between these giants and you'll get Wilson."},{"Title":"Like a conquered province;: The moral ambiguity of America (The Massey lectures)","review":"The Moral Ambiguity of America is a very insightful book to read because it documents Goodman's style of activism during one of the most revolutionary periods of America's history, yet the book provides scholarly reasons for the unforeseeable ambiguity which began in that era of the student movement of the 1960s and prevails today. Likewise, the book offers practical insights into possible recurring ambiguities that might happen again in the world-wide protest movements of today. Hence, The Moral Ambiguity of America is a helpful guide for a new generation of \\"active\\" citizens who feel the \\"system\\" has failed them and therefore pragmatic solutions are needed to approach the current unresolved issues of our times.Paul Goodman was a passionate activists, and as we read through the pages of this book, Goodman's accounts show us that the heartbeat of the Civil Rights movement did not arise out of the student \\"mass\\" movement, but it came from the small \\"radical student\\" groups fighting an over-centralized government bureaucracy and from the black American community's struggle to resolve long-standing issues that can be traced back as far as slavery. Hence, in this chaotic environment, we observe how a \\"majority\\" fails to live up to the ideals of democratic populism, and therefore, the hope for \\"change\\" is left to a small minority instead. Likewise, Goodman offers a generous critique about why his own government failed to resolve these societal conflicts, instead furthering a relationship with a small elite of corporate America which relied heavily on the scientific establishment to \\"progress\\" their materialistic agenda of consumerism. All this while the \\"Republic\\" tried to maintain its democratic ideals in the face of these two movements and win the wider America over to its new economic program.Yet, Goodman does not leave his readers to suffer in a hopeless world of cynicism because he attempts to free us from this disempowering \\"ambiguous\\" force. Hence, The Moral Ambiguity of America pursues (you could say in three sections) societal problems in America and the student response, Corporate America's reliance on technology without much of a moral concern for the implications, and finally, to resolve these concerns, Goodman concludes that Americans must exercise that borrowed Enlightenment idea of \\"freedom,\\" which those earlier American revolutionaries entrenched in the Declaration of Independence, so they can pursue a \\"decentralized\\" system, or else American democracy will not be \\"viable.\\""},{"Title":"Stories for Nurses: Acts of Caring, 1e","review":"I have had the distinct pleasure of knowing Lynn Wieck as a professor, friend, and colleague. Lynn is a tremendous cheerleader for nurses everywhere. She writes her encounters from the heart. Sometimes I laugh with her, other times I cry, but mostly she makes me laugh. She helps us poke fun at the idiosyncrasies of &quot;the system,&quot; changing technology, and ourselves. She reminds us of precious encounters with our patients and what they have taught us. Lynn guides us on a journey to rediscover why we became nurses in the first place! Thank you for another great literary contribution!"},{"Title":"Erewhon;: Or, Over the range","review":"Following in the tradition of Jonathan Swift's &quot;Gulliver's Travels,&quot; the English novelist, essayist, and iconoclast Samuel Butler published &quot;Erewhon&quot; privately in 1872. The title is an anagram of &quot;Nowhere,&quot; which is the literal translation of the word &quot;Utopia,&quot; the title by which Thomas More's 1516 work has commonly become known. &quot;Erewhon&quot; is arguably the first anti-utopian or dystopian novel, anticipating the later and better known works such as Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot; and George Orwell's &quot;1984.&quot; Whereas More and other utopianists are primarily interested in attacking society's ills and making the world a better place, the anti-utopians engage primarily in either satire of the society in which they live or in making dire predictions about the dismal fate that awaits humanity. Butler is most decidedly in the former category, since he proves in not only &quot;Erewhon&quot; but also his more famous work, the semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;The Way of All Flesh,&quot; that his main concern is in attacking the complacency and hypocrisy he saw infecting Victorian society.Like More's island of Utopia, Butler's Erewhon is a remote kingdom, not to be found on any map, which is discovered by the narrator of the novel (biographers of Butler have assumed it is modeled on a part of New Zealand, which anyone who has viewed the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; movies can attest has some spectacular landscapes). Cut off from the rest of the world, the citizens of Erewhon lives according to their own rules and dictates. Butler breaks from the tradition of creating an idealized world that goes back from More to Plato in favor of a more realistic society. In Butler's world there is still money, and both the rich and the poor still exist; there is even a monarchy in charge. It is when we notice strong parallels between Erewhon and the members of Victorian society that we start to see Butler's true purpose.Hypocrisy is rampant in Erewhom, where citizens think nothing of agreeing with things they do not believe in and their friends know that they are doing so. While the citizens pretend to worship deities that are the personification of lofty human qualities such as love, justice, and hope, they really worship a goddess, Ydrgun, and the Church of England is transformed into the sytem of &quot;Musical Banks.&quot; As Butler hits his stride in this novel he creates a topsy-turvy world where illness is treated as a crime (there are no physicians in the country) and criminal behavior, such as theft, are seen as minor weaknesses in character.Unlike Francis Bacon's utopian work &quot;The New Atlantis,&quot; where science was seen as the salvation of humanity that would correct all ills and provide all necessities, Butler's world has outlawed machinery because they might one day become the masters rather than the servants of humanity. Clearly Butler was no more enamored of the Industrial Revolution than he was of Victorian society. In many ways this is the section of &quot;Erewhom&quot; where Butler makes his most cogent arguments. It is also the point where the book's narrator, whose initial attitude of admiration turns to one of surprise, now beocmes one of condemnation as the eccentricities of the citizens of Erewhon are fully revealed. Ultimately, the shortcomings Butler sees in them are the same of which he accuses British society, politics, and religion.Because Butler is satirizing Victorian society his value to modern readers remains inferior to that of Huxley and Orwell, not to mention Edward Bellamy (&quot;Looking Backward 2000-1887&quot;) and Yevgeny Zamyatin (&quot;We&quot;). However, in many ways &quot;Erewhon&quot; is a pivotal novel in the history of utopian literature, not only because of how it follows and breaks away from More's original work and how it sets the stage for what other forgotten writers of dystopian fiction, such as Alexander Bogdanov (&quot;Red Star&quot;) and even Jack London (&quot;The Iron Heel&quot;). &quot;Erewhon&quot; remains one of those novels where its historical significance outweighs its literary appeal."},{"Title":"Golosa: A Basic Course in Russian, Book I (2nd Edition)","review":"I am on the brink of completing an intensive Russian course (1 year of Russian compressed into one quarter) which has used this series. Over the course of 8 weeks with the two books and a PhD candidate as my guide I have found myself possessing enough proficiency to converse with a couple I met on a bus, to listen to the news in Russian, and assume I could keep my head above water were I to travel.The authors' approach is vastly different from other texts I have encountered. A large number of listening and reading excercises accompany lessons on grammar and a wealth of vocabulary. Texts and dialogues, unlike other texts, are not overly glossed and seem to focus on adding unknown words and phrases, forcing the student to pick out what he or she understands to follow the action. Such an approach approximates what a student might experience in a real world situation.For a student or teacher of early Russian classes I believe there to be few better books. I could not recommend the text and the authors' approach more. Although I would suggest awaiting the 3rd edition (the current edition is rife with confusing errors and typos as well as a cumbersome delivery system for the accompanying audio) the issues can be surmounted by a dedicated student and/or knowledgeable teacher. They do little, however, to detract from the overall quality inherent in the books' approach to learning."},{"Title":"Golosa: A Basic Course in Russian, Book I (2nd Edition)","review":"I used this textbook in an intensive Russian class I took in college. It follows the standard textbook format: Each chapter introduces a grammatical concept and new vocabulary. There are a few short dialogues and several exercises to reinforce the grammar and vocabulary. There are also exercises at the beginning to practice cursive in the cyrillic alphabet. At the end of the book there was a grammar reference so it was easy to review and brush up on previous lessons. It was a perfectly good textbook to use as part of a class.In this case I also used the workbook and tape set. The workbook has additional exercises for each chapter in the book. It helped, but isn't necessary since things are covered in enough detail in the book. The tapes were helpful for picking up on how to pronounce. Russian pronunciation is very tricky. Basically they contain spoken versions of the dialogues in the text and a few simple exercises. I would just try to repeat after them to pick up on how to pronounce. The tapes are only useful as a supplement to a class, and not to teach you Russian on your own.This and Golosa Book 2 is a good textbook set to use as part of a class. I used it in college but it would also work for highschool. It did a pretty good job of explaining things and covered the concepts adequately. Teachers will want to know that there is a third edition out now.If you are trying to learn Russian on your own: Don't try to use this as a tape and book set. It isn't designed for this and unless you have superhuman amounts of natural aptitude for Russian it isn't going to work. Instead find a good tape and book set specifically designed for studying on your own. If used copies of the Golosa books are on sale dirt cheap then consider buying them for the exercises and to use as a grammar reference, but don't expect to learn Russian from them alone."},{"Title":"Golosa: A Basic Course in Russian, Book I (2nd Edition)","review":"This book series, in my experience, is the best way to start learning Russian. It is more helpful in conjunction with the workbook, and most helpful when combined with the written exercises in the workbook and oral exchange with other people (there's a tape series that goes with this, but if you have people who are learning with you to talk to, the tapes aren't really necessary). It covers all the basic conversational topics like greetings, weather, telling time, etc. And for the most part, the phrases in the book (even the colloquialisms) are still in use today. So if you want to start learning Russian, order this book and the workbook right away!"},{"Title":"Golosa: A Basic Course in Russian, Book I (2nd Edition)","review":"The only people who should get this book are people who are forced to because their school uses it. It is poorly planned and hard to find topics that you want to review. The worst part about this book is that it has no answers to the exercises in it making it usless for anyone wanting to advance at their own pace or for self studiers or even know if they are on the right track! A waste of money. Get New Penguin Russian Course instead for a fraction of the price it is way better than any of the books that the universities are using."},{"Title":"Golosa: A Basic Course in Russian, Book I (2nd Edition)","review":"Unfortunately this one of the better text books for the Russian language available. Before you buy this product look at the author's names. Neither is Russian. I am American High School French teacher and fluent in French having learned it by textbook and real world exposure. Before buying any language program make sure at least one author is a native speaker of the foreign language and the other is a native speaker of your own language. Although this book has extensive explanations of how the complicated noun declensions change, it does not provide a sufficient amount of real world examples as to when or how to use them. Although present tense verbs are clearly explained, the perfect and imperfect for past and future are not presented clearly. Many sections are poorly conceived. For example, one chapter section which explains time of day, only instructs you how to tell time on the hour but not how to say any minute, quarter or half hour interval. The book's illustrations are the worst I have seen in any modern foreign language textbook. Picture examples in the book, which are supposed to inspire you to think, only serve to confuse the reader. I completed this course solo along with the lab manual. It was not a pleasant learning experience. I would only suggest this book to someone who is taking a course in a university and that a native Russian who speaks PERFECT English is teaching the course. I would not suggest this book to any one trying to go it alone. Good Luck to you all."},{"Title":"Golosa: A Basic Course in Russian, Book I (2nd Edition)","review":"I notice a lot of these reviews say \\"not for self learning!!!\\" Of course not, it's a language! Only the basics should be self taught like the alphabet and some basic grammar so that you can save yourself some time and money with a tutor. If you're enrolled in a Russian class, that's already in the curriculum anyhow. If you're going to learn a language, you're going to have to have the self discipline to dedicate a lot of your free time to self study along with a tutor or someone willing to help you learn. You can also find people online to speak with living in Russia(or said language). I would plug a site that I've used for that purpose, but I don't know if Amazon would consider this comment spam. Self study alone will not do anything but teach you basics that you probably won't be able to apply much."},{"Title":"Golosa: A Basic Course in Russian, Book I (2nd Edition)","review":"I stydy russian language for some years, and recently I re-started, using the volume 2 of Goloca.

For thosethat are just starting with russian, it will surprise that a so complex language can be quickly understood and give fast confidence in its use."},{"Title":"Golosa: A Basic Course in Russian, Book I (2nd Edition)","review":"An excellent beginning text for learning Russian.

It worked masterfully! It seems that the things not explained in this book well, the authors of \\"Live from Moscow/Russia\\" explain much better and vice versa. If you are using this book and having trouble I would certainly advise you to use the other books as well. They ARE more expensive (upwards to a hundred dollars brand new and with a workbook) but if you're serious about learning Russian then I definitely suggest it. Best of luck!"},{"Title":"Golosa: A Basic Course in Russian, Book I (2nd Edition)","review":"After going through this book -- I'm well equipped to enter a russian department store and charge like crazy. In fact, I've even been asked to help other american tourists get around in a department store. What you learn is how to buy things, order things. Russian culture doesn't seem to be very important. Instead of learning words like &quot;war&quot; or &quot;literature&quot; you learn &quot;hat department&quot; and &quot;credit card.&quot; Perhaps it's the lack of interest/demand for good russian textbooks in the States. The grammar explainations are fine. Quite good in fact. I'm just depressed at what these authors think is of interest to an american/english audience. I can't imagine anyone interested in such an extremely materialistic introduction to Russian. Sadly, I haven't found any alternatives. But if I had to start learning Russian again -- I really would not use this book. You may learn some grammar -- but you'll end up learning words like &quot;credit card&quot; before words that will really help you experience Russian culture."},{"Title":"Golosa: A Basic Course in Russian, Book I (2nd Edition)","review":"I have used this book in a two course sequence that was taught by a native Russian speaker who has graduate degrees in philology from prestigous universities in Moscow. I consider her considerably more knowlegeable about the Russian language and how to teach it to Americans than the know-it-all, KMM, who gives this book an unbelievable single star.Our instructor, who actually knows something about Russia, having lived there for at least 45 years before coming to the US, repeatedly informed us that Golosa is the best text available and easily supersedes anything else that is available. It works for me.My teacher warned us that a very limited number of phrases weren't culturally authentic and explained why. But, this book is more than adequate. Though some of the tapes don't conform exactly to the text, this engenders some level of sponteneity and helps develop listening skills.Ignore KMM's diatribes against this book. Talk about a complete lack of crediblity! KMM rails against the American authors of the book, but apparently because KMM is French and knows a little English, too, KMM has expert status and superior knowlege about how native English speakers should learn Russian. Duh???Wasn't KMM the person who essentially indicated that only a native Russian speaker can teach a Russian course? So, by KMM's own logic, ignore a native French speaker's comments on a Russian language text for Americans. KMM must agree that is it not possible for KMM to understand the needs of an English speaker in learning any language, except possibly French?The specific criticisms KMM makes of this book-bad graphics and an incomplete \\"how to tell time\\" section-miss the mark, widely. Graphics: I've used the book and have two advanced degrees from nationally recognized institutions. I've seen a lot of textbooks. These graphics are adequate. Though some of the letters and notes reproduced in cursive script are a bit difficult to read, isn't the handwriting of many people difficult to read?How to tell time: The time keeping information isn't introduced just to provide a complete discussion of how time is told in Russian. Rather, it is provided to acquint the beginner with one of the six complex \\"cases\\" that must be introduced to cover the basics. Hint to KMM: In Russian telling the time isn't as simple as \\"Six heures et demi\\", which is not different from English in structure.Maybe KMM is only upset because Russian is so much more complex and difficult to learn than French. There are six \\"cases\\" and the nouns and adjectives must be \\"declined\\" to agree as to number, gender AND case. Even the \\"gender\\" is more complicated than French, because there is a neuter, not just a masculine and feminine. Then, almost none of the words are English cognates, though there are some French cognates. Anyone who suggests that Russian can be learned in a self-instruction program doesn't know enough about the subject to be taken seriously."},{"Title":"Golosa: A Basic Course in Russian, Book I (2nd Edition)","review":"Golasa RULES!!!

The author, Jessamyn West, has captured the &quot;evanescent&quot; (one of Cress's favorite words) nature of a young girl's personality as she is growing up. The book is a collection of stories about a girl between the ages of 11 and 17 who lives on a ranch in Southern California. Each chapter entrances the reader with Cress's shenanigans. You think she is doing something outlandish or brave; you think the story is going one way, and then you get a view into the workings of Cress's mind and you suddenly understand what she's doing and the story goes in a different direction. As an adolescent I loved Cress because she was me, in all her insecurity, feats of boldness, crass humanity and growing understanding of boys, friends, family and relationships.The last chapter transcends all and always makes me cry."},{"Title":"Cress Delahanty (Pocket books)","review":"Jesamyn West gives us a character in Crescent Delahanty that is so real you think she just might have been your friend when you were thirteen. Cres, as she is called in the book represents the struggles for peer acceptance and young love that any young woman can relate to. West's acute attention to the details of Cres's external environment (growing up on a ranch) and the other characters who impact on Cres's life deserves applause."},{"Title":"Cress Delahanty (Pocket books)","review":"When I was in sixth grade, the St. Louis Public Library still had a branch in the basement of our school, and it was there, in the \\"junior fiction\\" department, that I discovered Cress Delahanty, Jessamyn West's soon-to-be-teen girl, growing up on her family's citrus ranch. Ms. West created a character that appealed to my--shall we say androgynous?--self-image. Cress was more like me than anybody I knew: she was more like a boy in some ways, and yet more like a girl in others, and like me she seemed to have problems defining the lines between the two. Her father was the sage that advised her through much of her growing up--and he seemed to me to be the kind of man I would like to be when I got there.The thing I remember most, though, about Cress is her lovely poem:Once I was young and had dreamsNow I am old and have children.Dreams are evanescent; dreams fade:Children do not.But then again,You do not have to wipe the noses of your dreams.If that's not quite correct, it's because I haven't seen the book in over forty years, but I think I'm close to right. And indeed, one does not have to wipe the noses of one's dreams.I think about Cress from time to time, and most recently as I write this: for me in some not exclusive way she reminds me of what I thought growing up should be about, and how I thought I should react to it. I think I must read this one again."},{"Title":"Cress Delahanty (Pocket books)","review":"In \\"Cress Delahanty\\" the author, Indiana writer, prolific and renowned fictionalist, \`Jessamyn West, has given a typical portrayal of what it was like for a young girl to pass through her teen-age years in Southern California. She desired as much as any girl, even though she was not a traveler, but a child living on a ranch. Today the story brings back the historical spirit of the 1940s and what it was like in that slower, safer time.It's hard to determine if this is now more appropriate for the originally intended audience of teenage girls, or is it a fond memory and nostalgia for more mature women. Women surely will rate it higher than men, as they will relate to the emotions of Cress much closer. However, author West was so good at writing, that even a man can understand some of the girlish feelings.Cress Delahanty passes through stages including: boyfriendlessness, clown, dancer, pianist, lover of signs & portents & Calvin Dean, actress (mom's idea), and the sacrifice. Sections were taken from magazines (The New Yorker, The Ladies' Home Journal, Harper's Magazine, Collier's, Woman's Day, The New Mexico Quarterly, and The Colorado Quarterly) so you see, West is a well received writer.This author is more noted for her book-to-movie \\"The Friendly Persuasion\\" and it's sequel, about Indiana Quakers, of which she was one at childhood. 'Except for Me and Thee', was also filmed for TV and a hit. Both the 2 books and movies, yet available, are recommended.For the men, and historically interested readers, I'd recommend West's book, \\"The Massacre at Fall Creek\\" a story, fictionalized true story, about the first American trial and hanging of men that killed Native American Indians.

She left a legacy of fine family reading."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Mind: A Short Introduction","review":"In THE PHILOSOPHY OF MIND: A SHORT INTRODUCTION, Prof. Edward Feser provides an excellent introduction to this branch of philosophy. Not surprisingly, Prof. Feser starts with the contemporary genesis of the issue in the writings of Descartes and proceeds to the various attempts by materialists to reduce or explain mental events by purely physical processes.This book is introductory in nature and doesn't presuppose any knowledge of philosophy. Given its broad scope, it could even be used as an introductory work in philosophy. Prof. Feser hits some of the basics of epistemology such as realism and idealism. He also incorporates a fair amount of metaphysics as well, discussing personal identity and the question of universals. However, it can be a bit hard going at times, if for no other reason than many of the theories used to defend materialism are difficult to understand and even a bit strange. I found that skipping over the difficult parts and going back to them later to be helpfulUnlike other introductions I've read, Prof. Feser interacts with Thomas Aquinas and the contemporary school of analytical Thomism. The glossary was quite helpful. (For some reason, my copy of the book is entitled \\"PHILOSOPHY OF MIND\\", leaving out \\"THE\\".)"},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Mind: A Short Introduction","review":"If you want a brief but comprehensive overview of the philosophy of mind, I can't think of a better book. Prof. Feser is quite good at describing the opposing views of what the human mind is, meaning: the materialist approach which views the mind as the product of purely physical states and interactions, and the dualist approach which views the mind as fundamentally unphysical--and he is fair to both sides. Indeed, as his closing chapter on the virtues of the classical approach to the mind makes clear, he finds the modern dualist and materialist views both...unsatisfying. Well written with excellent examples."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Mind: A Short Introduction","review":"The book aims are to provide a solid introduction both to the traditional arguments against materialism and to the contemporary arguments in favor of it. The author does an excellent job of achieving that. His use of clear and simple language in explaining complex arguments provide the mind with enough light to shine the path to understand the twist and turn of the philosophy of mind. By including a further reading material (not just a list) at the end of each chapter makes it very easy to widen one's scope to understand each and every idea one is interested in."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Mind: A Short Introduction","review":"I was interested in the Thomistic view of the mind and soul per another book of Feser. It does not cover as much as I thought, but goes over the competing theories at a reasonable length. Includes comprehensive further reading guide for all the themes covered. The book didn't dissapoint at all. Quite the opposite. WARNING: ATTENTIVE FOLLOWING OF THE ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THIS BOOK MAY ACTUALLY ASTONISH YOU.I'm glad I bought it so I can reference later. Great buy."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Mind: A Short Introduction","review":"At first glance the book seems like a 'neutral' introduction to philosophy of mind. But when you start to read it, gradually the author shows his real intentions. Instead of reviewing the various positions in the philosophy of mind in a fair light, Feser attacks all accounts of materialism and of Darwinism. These positions are debunked without much compelling argumentation - in fact, Feser glosses over nearly all reasons which have made these positions so compelling in recent decades - in favor of Feser's own brand of Cartesian dualism conjoined with a revived Thomism (both poorly argued for). When I looked up the author on Google I found out why. It appears Feser uses an introductory text on the philosophy of mind to further his more general agenda as a religious (specifically, Catholic) believer: Feser's aim is to defend these beliefs against any claims made in modern science and philosophy which seemingly cannot be brought in agreement with his beliefs.The lack of convincing argumentation apart, the book's introductory nature does not sit easily with this dogmatic agenda, and certainly makes for a poorer text in selecting pertinent arguments in discussing contrary positions. What's more, while authors are certainly entitled to bias and favouritism in their own views, I found it distasteful that the author does not state his own more up front (or, at all).I strongly recommend to avoid this text when finding one's way in philosophy of mind. There are much better argued and dogmatically neutral alternatives around (e.g. Colin McGinn's \\"Character of Mind\\")."},{"Title":"Early Childhood Development: Prebirth Through Age Eight (2nd Edition)","review":"I had the privilege to study under DR Wanda Franz.

It has baffled me how so many great Flash designers wow me visually and totally ingore the power of streaming audio in Flash. Brad Kozak has organized this information and hit the nail on the head of what it takes to make quality audio, covers the tools and techniques to do it right are allin this book. I bought it as a reference, but I suggest it be required reading for anyone designing Flash presentations for the web and CDroms. Silent movies didn't last very long in Hollywood and there is no reason Flash movies should remain silent or contain mindless music loops when audio that supports the visuals is so easy to deliver in Flash."},{"Title":"Flash MX Audio Magic","review":"This is a great book, especially the style used in writing the actual code. Great instruction on using audio editing programs, and how they relate to the Flash projects. Excellent instruction for linking audio button to animated button. Amazing demonstration of \\"Multiple Logic\\" for button behavior. Great video game instruction. I like that there is a website for it, and I really appreciate that the entire project is included on CD-Rom to study. I am inspired by the chapter illustrating how to define the project with the client. It really helps when an author discusses how to actually run a web-based business."},{"Title":"Flash MX Audio Magic","review":"As with any book of this type, you buy it and hope that there's something you can glean from it that is useful.This book, while far from a complete reference, has already provided me with some good tips on a current project. Flash and audio is partly the subject along with the programs that create or enhance audio such as Acid Pro and SoundForge, and how you use the results in Flash.If you don't have any advanced audio applications, don't buy this book; you'll likely be disappointed because you'll have to rely on whatever demo versions of this software are available. But, if you are a multimedia professional and have one or more of these integral audio tools, you'll find some good information along with what you already knew -- and it's information that will prove valuable not only for Flash, but also Director and DV if you do that too.I'm still waiting for the definitive &quot;audio in multimedia&quot; reference, but this will give me some stuff to work on and think about until I find it."},{"Title":"Flash MX Audio Magic","review":"I'm somewhat new to Flash, although I understand Flash well enough to design most things seen on the web, the actionscripting used in the book was far more advanced than I anticipated. I bought the book because I'm interested in better audio for my projects, but after reading about 1/2 the book, I'm going to have to put it away until I have a better understanding of actionscripting. I would not recomend this book to the beginner or even intermediate designer."},{"Title":"Australia's Underwater Wilderness","review":"This book was put together in the mid-eighties and was a \\"first off its kind\\" in the sense that it covers all the important aspects of the Australian marine environment - oceanography, an introduction to the animals (from the tiniest corals through to whales), the coastal fringes, Barrier Reef, deep ocean as well as providing a look into the seas of the future. There is even a diving guide.What makes the book so special is that the contributors were all top marine biologists and the photography is the best you'll see in any publication.The book was re-printed over and over again and even featured in the American Museum of Natural History bookshop for many years.The author also wrote the quirky Sydney guide - Roland Hughes Wraps Up Sydney - which was very popular at the time and copies of this book are still available."},{"Title":"Desktop Publishing with PageMaker 6.5","review":"A great many of the exercises in this book require the electronic templates specially created for the class (apparently this book was written by some Community college folks for one of their classes). NO CD or URL accompanies the book to access the electronic templates leaving readers SOL for some of the exercises. Even at used book prices, it wasn't worth it."},{"Title":"The Augustan Aristocracy","review":"Sir Ronald Syme, OM, was one of the great Classical historians of the 20th Century. Aside from the value of his researches and his introduction of novel and productive sociological methods into the writing of Roman History, he was a master of English prose. His love of Tacitus no doubt encouraged his writing of well-balanced periodic sentences, the 20th Century equivalent of those of Gibbon and Samuel Johnson.Most of Sir Ronald's books are now out of print. Therefore it is all the more disgraceful that his longtime publisher, Oxford University Press should charge $137.00 for the paperback edition of one of the few of his books to remain in print. Theusual excuses for such price inflation are that the book has only limited appeal and the academic publisher must offset the expense. of publication by gouging the few readers expected to buy the book, and that the high cost of the book to the reader allows the press to offset the cost of publishing other similar commercially unviable but academically valuable titles. These arguments would be legitimate (however distasteful the result for the reader who may find it necessary to buy the book) if this book were published by, e.g, Southern Illinois University Press, but this is the OUP, for God's sake, whose popular editions of classics can be found on the shelves of every Barnes and Nobles and Borders throughout the world. Surely the OUP sells enough copies of Dickens, Mary Shelley etc. to be able to defray the expense of publishing Sir Ronald Syme at a reasonable price?"},{"Title":"The Augustan Aristocracy","review":"Sir Ronald Syme's \\"Augustan Aristocracy\\" is a gem of high scholarship. It is the best book on Roman history that I have come across. I have no hesitation to state that he is one of the very few authors from whom I have learnt much and with whom I have found it difficult to disagree. His prose is matchless and his style is refreshingly different from that of E. Gibbon, who appears rather gullible, and to me Syme appears to be superior to even Th. Mommsen. His treatment of Augustus, in particular, is excellent. Even his Tiberius is scintillating. He praises both Asinius Pollio and Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus and I have identified them as associates of Jesus Christ (Amyntas of Galatia in my scheme). Syme writes with great insight that Augustus encouraged Roman authors to vilify Julius Caesar. Ovid did not fall in line and he was banished.My only criticism is that he relied too much on Tacitus and did not understand Amyntas of Galatia. He knew that the Christian churches mentioned by St. Paul at Lystra, Derbe, Antioch in Pisidia etc. are the oldest known, but failed to see that Antioch and its sister cities, Lystra and Tavium were all centers of Amyntas, whose name may have been 'Amen' and whose palace was at Isauria. I also feel that the price of the book is exorbitant."},{"Title":"Bent Red Moon (Leisure Western)","review":"Russ Hall has written great books in two genres now: mystery and western. This book has elements of both genres: the story wends about in unexpected turns, like a mystery, while the backbone and the details of setting are true to great westerns. There is a tender story at the heart of a McMurty-like story about the harshness and cruelty of the old West. I loved this book. I hope you will too."},{"Title":"Bent Red Moon (Leisure Western)","review":"I fell in love with the story of Bent Red Moon! It was the kind of book that grabbed my attention from beginning to end. The setting of rustic hills in Texas was so real I could almost feel the heat from the sun and the grit on my tongue. My favorite part was seeing how Mick and his dark skinned friend would get out of the trouble that seemed to follow them everywhere. I'd recommend this book to anyone who loves westerns, romance, excitement and mystery all wrapped up in one."},{"Title":"Bent Red Moon (Leisure Western)","review":"Wow! What an exciting book!

Spirit works with each of us to design a series of symbols to help us on our journeys. Many times, the only time we are quiet is when we sleep.

Covering everything from techniques on how to remember your dreams to the smallest detail to which they may entail, even ELVIS!!! It is truly amazing how Wilda Tanner has written in such laymen terms the depths of ones subconscious influence in their dreams. Taking a dream that may seem so black and white and noting the true internalization of it. I highly advise even one with the slightest curiousity pick up a copy."},{"Title":"Mystical Magical Marvelous World of Dreams","review":"I guess I should blame myself for buying a book titled &quot;Mystical Magical..&quot; when what I was looking for was a serious book based on facts and experience. In this book dreams are often interpreted as messages from God or memories of past lifes. I am an not a christian nor a hindu, so this is meaningless to me. The dream topic &quot;cleaning yourself&quot; can mean you have to &quot;clean up your act&quot; and &quot;driving&quot; can mean &quot;you drive yourself&quot;. These interpretions only work for the english language. Being norwegian, this also becoms meaningless to me. It also leads me to think that the author has done little reaserch before writing this book. This book has no credibility and is of little use to me."},{"Title":"Mystical Magical Marvelous World of Dreams","review":"This was not the book I thought I was purchasing. I didn't like it at all. Glad I didn't pay that much for it. The seller was great in sending it to me. Woulc deal with her again."},{"Title":"Mystical Magical Marvelous World of Dreams","review":"By combining basic psychological explanations with interpretive meanings for dream symbols, this book provides a good balance for those who wish to understand their dreams and themselves without delving into a lot of technical jargon. Or, the archaic and downright hilarious guides, as in the \\"dreaming of a teapot means a Gypsy will steal your cow\\" sort. This one does explain that the possible interpretations are subject to the dreamer's own associations, which is the first thing we need to know about dreams. It gives a good range of symbols and is one of the best of its type that I've seen. The basis for the psychology is Jungian, which is simply way more fun for dream interpretive work than Freudian. By the way, there's nothing wrong with approaching dream interpretation with a sense of fun; dreams aren't always weighty psychological things, and we're missing a lot of the entertainment that our minds can provide if we disregard our dreams."},{"Title":"Mystical Magical Marvelous World of Dreams","review":"Most dream books are written with the definition of objects/subjects as absolutes and that there is no other description to include or suggest. This makes these other dream books too rigid and orthodox which is frustrating. Tanner gives a comprehensive view of each subject, including the all important spiritual aspects (which other books usually ignore). Tanner teaches you how to figure out what certain things may mean to just you and not another dreamer. She helps you figure out what your nightmares mean as well. She writes as a sensitive but informative teacher and guide. If you are intrigued by your dreams, she really helps you along to figure out the possibilities of what YOUR dreams mean to YOU."},{"Title":"Mystical Magical Marvelous World of Dreams","review":"I have bought many books on this subject that disapointed me.

One such dream let me know my sleep apnea was going to get the best of me. This book, which I have had since it was first on the book shelves, very well may have saved my life. ...Not every book will give you the exact meanings that you mind uses to let you know about things going on in your life, not even this one. BUT! it is the very first book to be 99% right on for me. You must remember dream books are mearly guides which can guide US into a deeper understanding of what we cannot see or what decide to ignore. Our minds choose images we identify with and it is up to us to decide what they truly mean. Wolf, for me, means protection where as most books will use the Red Ridding Hood thery because we grew up with the big bad wolf image thanks to the blindness of the writer of that story... This book chooses this also. The other parts of this book have been my only choosen guide for many years and I have learned waaaay more from this book than the countless other dream books I have bought over the years and I recomend this book above all others. read the first part of this book and keep notes for yourself. Be determined to remember your dreams. Keep a notebook by you bedside along with this book and you will find you way through the confusing parts of you life and be better for it.

The listing of symbolic meanings are thoughtful and meaningful. The interpretations are not random and meaningless magic (&quot;If you dream of a snake it means you will get a new job&quot;) but instead help us see the possibilities inherent in our own symbol-system (&quot;a snake could represent temptation, as in the Garden of Eden, or it could be a phallic symbol, or it could represent danger, slyness, &quot;a snake in the grass,&quot; etc.)I've looked at a lot of dream interpretation books, and this one is the most sensible and complete.

I have had lucid dreams since childhood, but have never seen anything close to helpful about the dream state. For the clinician, dreams are mental garbage. For those of us who live with them and use them, they are so much more. I found Part I to be the most helpful, as it describes the various states of sleep now \\"proven by science to exist\\" (my quotes, sarcasm intended) so well, an active dreamer clearly wrote this book. They get it! For Part I, I gave the 4-stars, because it really is quite unique in the realm of dream books. It has sections on Nightmares, what your mind/body are doing during sleep, the kinds of dreams (including the dream-within-a-dream), goals, recall and interpretation. My suggestion would be to print just Part I as a separate book for people who are curious about these things, but not necessarily in symbolism distilled through someone else's experiences.I did not appreciate the references to God, especially the Christian angle, because I don't believe you need a specific god, religion or belief system to be tuned in to your electric mind. The author is brave in this regard, given that many of certain Christian stripes would condemn such a book as so much witchcraft. She gets her props.As for the actual Dream Dictionary, it is organized somewhat differently than most other Dream Dictionaries. Rather than being an alphabetical listing you flip to, you refer to a major category, (Games and Sports, for example,) and proceed to hunt for what you need. This I found more ponderous than the old-fashioned alphabetical listing, but it is serviceable once you get the hang of it. You may find the chapter on Numbers especially helpful if you tend to have lots of input of this kind, but be forewarned: this is numerology, and if your spiritual sensibilites are easily offended, then you may not want go there. For the dictionary, I'd give it a 3-star, just because I think the good ol' Zolar's Encyclopedia and Dictionary of Dreams is the best choice for exhaustive entries for dream images.If you're looking for something meatier vis-&agrave;-vis the dream state, types of dreams and dream journals, then this is the book for you. That is has a decent dictionary attached to it is a bonus."},{"Title":"Mystical Magical Marvelous World of Dreams","review":"This is the dream book I recommend to all my friends and clients.

For instance, if you keep breaking a glass over and over again, you can look up broken glass and see what the deeper meaning is.

For those new to interpreting dreams her step by step process in Part 1 of the book is not to be missed. It is also important to remember, and this is her point, that dream symbols are very individual. Attending the New England Dreamwork Institute, I learned that dream dictionaries are reached for only when you have run out of ideas or connections, then they are sometimes, not always, helpful in connecting you to a possible meaning. All dream interpretation is ultimately done by the dreamer; they need to receive that inner 'aha' moment.

Time and again, this book has proven itself to be the best. It teaches you how to look for your own dream symbols, and thereby, making your interpretation richer and specific to your life. Dreams can help your relationships, help you problem-solve, and even entertain you. I've used several other books over the years, because no book can cover every image/symbol in dreams, but more often than not, this is the one I reach for first and last.

I have always had dreams that have guided me in this life but sometimes they were confusing and left me wondering \\"why in the world I would dream that??\\" I keep a journal and was able to go back through it and understand why some dreams repeated themselves thanks to this book... It is true that only the dreamer can truly interpet their own dreams but this book was very insightful and helped me to move on from repeated dreams. The only thing I found I did not like was what it said about \\"wolves\\" I am part Native and Wolves to me mean Protection not the big bad wolf theroy of little Ridding hood. Most people see Wolves this way because of this story so the mind stored this image and used it in this way. Not the books fault but the person who write the story which left an impression on our young minds.If you use the back of the book to look up images you will find them most of the time instead of looking for them in A-B-C order.There is so much more to this book than just the symbols and it IS A WORTHWILE READ! The person who left a negative feedback must have been thinking it was something completely different and did not understand dreaming."},{"Title":"Mystical Magical Marvelous World of Dreams","review":"I refer to this book almost everyday since I bought it in 1988 or 1989. This is not your typical \\"fortune telling\\" kind of dream book, such as Zolar's. I have found the symbol definitions to be highly accurate. It's not just a dream dictionary, there are also primers for every chapter to help you interpret your own dreams using the book as a guide.Part 1 is all about dreams themselves. Part 2 is the dictionary, featuring \\"definitions,\\" more like highly accurate suggestions, for what the object, animal, etc means. Everything from animals to food to sex to transporatation, plants, furniture, illness, jewelry...it goes on and on.If this is your first dream book, and you're looking for a bargain, you could purchase the first edition (1988) and get lots of use out of it, like I do.

The book is set up very much like a dictionary making it easy to find a symbol and its interpretation.

The Major Purposes for Interpreting and Understanding Our Dreams are to aid us in Problem Solving, Getting Ideas, Solutions and Insights, Discovering the Lessons We Need To Learn, Guidance, Knowledge and Encouragement when We Get Off Course. This Book has been and is the Major Influence in My Work and Teaching. It will greatly assist the reader who is interested in understanding their dreams and not disappoint them in any way.There are several types of Dreams that we have, they are:The Prophetic Dream is one that Happens in an awakened state, exactltly as it occured in the dream state. It generally fortells of a Future Event or Happening.Symbolic Dreams occur most often and can give needed advice. For instance, if we dream of a Traffic Light, it could be giving us a direction to take, Green, Go ahead, Yellow, Proceed with caution, Red, stop where you are going.Spiritual Dreams reveal what the Soul is seeking from us.Superficial Dreams are scattered and make no sense.Astral Projection: A projection out of the body to another placeDistortion Deams relate to dreams that are not part of a time sequence, and may be related to a Feeling Sequence that is distorted or disguised by the sub-conscious to conceal something.Condensation Dreams are dreams that have fewer symbols. They are comprssed with several events, people or wishes all condensed into one.Symbolization Dreams are where one thing stands for another. Symbolizing one thing for something else. Very Often having a meaning for a certain person, place or thing that is personal to the individual. For someone else, the symbol can have a completely different meaning to someone else. These are Individual Personalized Symbols.Frank Rambow"},{"Title":"Mystical Magical Marvelous World of Dreams","review":"I've had this book for over 25 years and it the best most complete dream symbol book EVER!

I asked her what would be a good book to decipher dreams. She couldn't praise this one enough. I reluctantly bought it, hoping I wasn't wasting my money.The moment I opened it, I became hooked. The layout is fabulous. Not too cramped. Not too full of flowery jibberish as an attempt by the author to make themselves look overly witty. Just simple, to the point, easy to follow information. It is set up a little like a dictionary, with terms listed alphabetically. However, it also separates the terms into sections like: work, people, buildings, etc.I believe it states in the book that it is only meant to be a guide. That everyone's dreams have different meanings, with their own unique symbols, meant just for them. I already figured this, but thought it was wise of them to mention it. Alot of people rely solely on the interpretations of these types of books, as if they are magic crystal balls or something. It suggests that the reader keep a dream journal to enable them to bring their dream into a more understandable light. I began doing this and was amazed at the pattern of certain symbols that repeat themselves in my dreams.Another great thing about this book is the explanation of each term. It doesn't just give one brief, simple description to each symbol. It gives various ideas and meanings as to how they can be interpreted. For example, \\"window\\" is not just listed as window. It gives some meanings of window, meanings of \\"looking out window\\", and meanings of \\"looking into window\\". The same with \\"car\\". The meaning behind a car depends on: if it was moving, if it was sitting still, if you were driving, if someone else was driving, etc. (Just a heads up...you always want to be the one driving if you can help it).So anyways, it's an awesome book; as long as you remember that it isn't programmed just to you. You will have to pay attention to what is going on in your life at the time of your dream, and put a little effort into the interpretation yourself. The book is meant to work with you, not do all the work for you. Also, I would suggest purchasing a good numerology book to work along with it. I recommend: \\"Numerology and the Divine Triangle\\" by Faith Javane and Dusty Bunker. I purchased it based on it's good reviews. I haven't read any others to compare it too, but let me tell ya...it seems pretty accurate to me.Jennifer J. PassmoreInspirational Writer: www.inspiringthruwriting.comP.S. This is a sincere review. I am not being paid to write it. I enjoy leaving honest feedback about all of the books I've purchased, because I know how it feels to spend money on a book and then find out it is no good."},{"Title":"Mystical Magical Marvelous World of Dreams","review":"I have found this book to be incredibly helpful when trying to figure out what a particular dream meant. Ms. Tanner does not force you into her interpretation of each symbol but gives you enough possibilities to the meaning that I always come away knowing what message my dreams are trying to tell me.I have shared this book with many friends and co-workers who also find it valid for their own experiences."},{"Title":"Mystical Magical Marvelous World of Dreams","review":"I guess I should blame myself for buying a book titled &quot;Mystical Magical..&quot; when what I was looking for was a serious book based on facts and experience. In this book dreams are often interpreted as messages from God or memories of past lifes. I am an not a christian nor a hindu, so this is meaningless to me. The dream topic &quot;cleaning yourself&quot; can mean you have to &quot;clean up your act&quot; and &quot;driving&quot; can mean &quot;you drive yourself&quot;. These interpretions only work for the english language. Being norwegian, this also becoms meaningless to me. It also leads me to think that the author has done little reaserch before writing this book. This book has no credibility and is of little use to me."},{"Title":"Mystical Magical Marvelous World of Dreams","review":"This is without question THE best book on dream analysis that I have ever come accross.

I have several other dream books, and none even compare to this one. Its easy to read. I have friends and family always calling me to look up what there dreams are.

Highly recommend this book! :)"},{"Title":"Mystical Magical Marvelous World of Dreams","review":"First, I'll admit that I'm rather biased towards this book, but for good reason. I've owned two copies of this book in the past. I loaned it to someone who I never saw again and bought it again, then not sure what happened to my second copy. At any rate, I'm glad to have found this again! I spent a lot of time reading this book and on introspection of what my dreams meant for a good couple of years which is why I am biased towards this book. Out of all the dream books and dictionaries I read, this is the one that is most common sensical and practical. And the definitions behind the symbols in the dreams I was having at those times in my life made absolute sense compared to what I was going through in my waking life. Nearly all other dream books I've read were classical (read: outdated for modern times and influences) interpretations or just plain out of whack. Besides defining dream symbols very well, this book also guides you on how to lucid dream, \\"practicing\\" dreaming and gives great information on how to remember your dreams. While searching Amazon for this book and at first not remembering the title or author, I was honestly surprised that it didn't come up in my search and I still am. I'm obviously no expert on dreams (is there REALLY such a thing?), but I've studied my own throughtout the years and this is by far the best you can find on interpretation, knowing your dreams and most importantly of all, knowing yourself."},{"Title":"Mystical Magical Marvelous World of Dreams","review":"Another good book on Dreams.

It is Carl Jung style and refers to past lives, a topic in need to be explored. I have written a book myself on dreams \\"DARE ASKING YOUR DREAMS FOR ANSWERS\\", that you sell. It is a study on how to dream on demand and use our own clairvoyant mind. My experience is that most symbols are common to humanity, unless they are personal to the dreamer. The book of Wilda Tanner meets my own experience and adds to it."},{"Title":"Mystical Magical Marvelous World of Dreams","review":"I have owned this book for over ten years and absolutely love it! When I first purchased it, I took the time to read what the author had to say, and that made a huge difference on my ability to use my dreams to find answers. Now, the book stays on my shelf and I pull it out when I have a dream that perplexes or disturbs me. It only takes noting a few key attributes from my dream to interpret the message and gain better insight. I always feel better after using the book. Even though my dream meanings are not obvious at first, after using the book I am able to link my dreams to something realistic happening in my life. Dreams are a great way to resolve issues and find guidance, if one understands how to use them properly!

If you peruse a list of their recent offerings, this book stands out as rather more specialised. Certainly, in general there is no shortage of linux books, from a variety of publishers. But typically such books are aimed at using linux or they describe applications built atop it. Whereas the technical ability and interest in actually understanding and changing any operating system (not just linux) acts as a tremendous barrier. Hence, the potential audience for Gorman's book is quite exclusive. An upside is that it reduces the potential competition from other authors and publishers.Gorman is attempting an outreach to potential linux developers. The book has two parts. The first explains key concepts for the VMM. He quickly gets into the issues, with little preamble. In other words, you need at a minimum to be fluent in C, and have some acquaintance with the ideas of memory management, though not necessarily with linux.Each algorithm in this book is not that intricate. As a rough guide to difficulty level, if you can understand a typical algorithm from the texts by Knuth or Aho or Sedgewick, then you should not have any trouble here.The second part of the book has code listings with accompanying detailed commentary. This is different from, and substantially improves upon the inline comments, which are sparse to non-existent in the exampled code. To some of you who want to try changing code, the second part's annotations may be the crucial portions of the book. It is rare to see such extensive commentary of source code in book form."},{"Title":"Understanding the Linux Virtual Memory Manager","review":"If the title of the book is a hint that it is not for the masses, then the additional information one is presented with is a definite confirmation of this fact.The book is an in depth look into intricate workings of one of the most complicated and sophisticated parts of any OS that supports virtual memory concepts. As such, it is not an easy read for people who are not familiar with programming and general OS concepts, and since, to be honest, most people today do not fall into this category, this book has a very specific audience. In short, if you do not already know how TLB operates, do not even look at it.The text itself is nicely organized, hierarchy is well defined, concepts explained. Detailed description of logic is supported by the code examples that are dissected in detail, and in my mind provide an excellent learning resource.One drawback that caused 4 stars, instead of 5, is the lack of common terminology; rather, author explains in his own words some of the details. As such, these explanations tend to be unnecessarily complicated, burdened by the re-defining of the every day language that is used in a wrong way.Overall, a very, very good resource on Linux VM, and a definite must for a serious kernel developer."},{"Title":"Understanding the Linux Virtual Memory Manager","review":"The book's goal \\"a detailed view of the Linux VM as implemented in 2.4.22\\" -- as I think the specification of the version to that level of detail indicates, it is not a theoretical exercise.Given that goal the book is well structured, building up from from basic functionality and giving references to both theory and measurement as appropriateThere's ~500 pages of annotated source that's preceded by a clear ~200 page discussion of its functionality and behavior"},{"Title":"Understanding the Linux Virtual Memory Manager","review":"It is funny that the whole book is printed and binded in the reverse order i.e. the last page is the first page and first page is the last one. I need to start reading from the back. I didnt notice this till now as I was busy reading other books and just started to read this book. I was so shocked and surprised that AMAZON sells such books. Hope they replace the copy with a good one."},{"Title":"Three Witnesses (Nero Wolfe)","review":"Nero Wolfe may be enjoyed through the media of print, audio, and video--in print courtesy of Bantam Books; on audio courtesy of Durkin Hayes, Radio Spirits, and Books on Tape; and on video courtesy of A&E Network. It's hard to say which way gives the most pleasure. As much as I like the A&E shows, and as much as I like Durkin Hayes' editions of the CBC radio shows, I think the best way to enjoy Nero Wolfe is in print. And the best way to enjoy him in print is in Rex Stout's novelettes. The novels are good, but the novelettes are tauter, faster-paced, and funnier. \\"Three Witnesses\\" serves up three very good novelettes. In \\"The Next Witness\\" Wolfe sits uncomfortably in a crowded courtroom, under subpoena, and waiting to give truthful testimony which he expects will materially contribute to the conviction for murder of an innocent man. What to do, what to do? Flee the courtroom, dodge the arrest warrant issued for contempt of court, and bring the real murderer to justice before the judge can bang his gavel down on a sentence of imprisonment for contempt. That sounds easy enough, doesn't it? In \\"When a Man Murders\\", a millionaire returns from the dead to retrieve the fortune which was divided among his heirs and reclaim the \\"widow\\" who has entered into a much happier second marriage. The \\"widow\\" comes to Wolfe for his assistance in obtaining a divorce from her recently resurrected spouse. Not to worry, he almost immediately dies again, but the widow's new husband is arrested for murder. Wolfe must penetrate a web of lies to determine who among the heirs had the most to gain from the millionaire's second death. In \\"Die Like a Dog\\" an improbable chain of coincidences brings Nero Wolfe together with Nero the Labrador Retriever. Together they unravel a murder mystery, reunite a couple, and retrieve Archie Goodwin's raincoat. \\"Die Like a Dog\\" and \\"The Next Witness\\" have both been televised on the A&E series."},{"Title":"Three Witnesses (Nero Wolfe)","review":"To date (beginning of season 2), 2 of the 3 stories herein have been adapted by A&E; with Maury Chaykin as Wolfe; the TV series is extremely faithful to the original stories.\\"The Next Witness\\" - (Adapted for _Nero Wolfe_'s 2nd season.) Wolfe makes a point of never leaving home on business, but alas, subpoenas are an occupational hazard for private investigators, and even Wolfe can't always shuffle them off onto Archie, even when the defendant never made it to the status of client.Wolfe didn't deliver Leonard Ashe to the law; he rejected Ashe as a client because he won't touch marital squabbles. Ashe is being tried for the murder of one of the operators of his telephone answering service, apparently after a failed attempt to bribe her to tap his wife's calls. Wolfe, after hearing the testimony of preceding witnesses, skips out on the subpoena, taking Archie along, having become convinced that Ashe is innocent, though he doesn't at first explain why. See if you can deduce his reasons before the grand finale.When Wolfe finally does take the stand quite a while later (now, of course, facing contempt of court), he has a diabolically clever plan to get his new evidence before the jury. Enjoy.When a Man Murders... - Sydney Karnow had wealth, a sardonic sense of humor, a nice wife, and a pack of sponging relatives. A year after his marriage, he volunteered for army service in the Korean War, and was reported dead within a year, leaving his fortune divided between his wife (50%) and the spongers (50% divided 3 ways), so all were well provided for if not filthy rich.Now, 3 years later, he's come back *alive* - two years after Caroline's remarriage to Paul Aubry. They used her inheritance to start an automobile agency, but the money didn't bring them to Wolfe - their problem is that their marriage is now invalid. (They're willing to concede anything about the money in exchange for a simple divorce.) Paul can't bring himself to speak with Karnow directly, and Karnow's lawyer won't get involved, so they're approaching Wolfe to act as intermediary.Ordinarily Wolfe won't touch any case related to marital squabbles, but he's willing in this instance. Unfortunately, when Archie enters Karnow's hotel room at the Churchill, he's dead again, this time for keeps. Did Paul or Caroline try to hire Wolfe as a bluff? Or did one of the spongers (some of whom haven't *got* the money to repay the estate anymore) panic? Or was it something they don't know about yet?\\"Die Like a Dog\\" - This has always been a favourite of mine, and I was very pleasantly surprised when A&E; adapted it for _Nero Wolfe_'s 2nd season. A black Labrador literally follows Archie home, and not only retrieves his windblown hat, but turns out to be named 'Nero' (part of a much longer kennel-club name on his collar, but how could Archie resist?)Unfortunately, the unannounced (even if temporary) introduction of a dog into the hallowed halls of the brownstone backfires in a totally unexpected manner, which you'll have to read/see to believe. :) The *dog* turns out to be a possible witness in a murder investigation, but how the heck can anybody learn anything from him?"},{"Title":"Three Witnesses (Nero Wolfe)","review":"Nero Wolfe has many eccentricities, his orchids, his rigid schedule, his obsessive reading to name a few. Very prominent on this list is that Wolfe rarely leaves the house, NEVER handles divorce cases, and is opposed to animals in his house. In this collection of three novellas all of the above and more occur.THE NEXT WITNESS is the first story. Nero Wolfe has been summoned to court as a witness in a murder trial. This has necessitated him to abandon his routine, travel in a car, sit in court (next to a woman wearing perfume!) and just when the end of this torment is in sight Wolfe walks out of court. Now a fugitive himself he, and Archie set out to solve the case in a more satifactory manner so Nero can return home. This is hilarious, Wolfe becomes involved in many unusual (for him) situations that he reacts to as only Nero Wolfe could or would.WHEN A MAN MURDERS.... finds Nero and Archie confronted with a low bank balance and two eager clients which Wolfe would prefer to dismss since the case involves divorce. Still the details are intriguing enough to look into and soon this simple matter becomes one of death and deception.The final work - DIE LIKE A DOG begins with Archie out on a simple errand. A would be client has taken Archie's raincoat by mistake so Archie go the man's apartment and retrieve his coat. When he arrives at the address he discovers that the situation has been complicated by the man's murder, he leaves in order to avoid dealing with the police but discovers that he has been followed home, by a dog. Archie then decides to have a little fun at Wolfe's expense before locating the dog's owner. Soon however the trio - Archie, Nero and the dog find themselves deeply involved in the case and with no client.These are particularly funny entries into this long running series. Wolfe is thrust into many situations that he would very much prefer to avoid. Fans are treated to many juicy little tidbits about life in the brownstone and even a fleeting glimpse into Wolfe's mysterious past. The mysteries themselves, although somewhat secondary to the cozy/comic elements in these stories, are very clever, fairly laid out and challenge to reader to solve them before Nero reveals all."},{"Title":"Three Witnesses (Nero Wolfe)","review":"The rating on this book would be a 3 stars. This is not a bad reading considering if you like fee differentiator stories."},{"Title":"Three Witnesses (Nero Wolfe)","review":"... and I am eagerly re-reading all of the Nero Wolfe books that I am buying anew! Rex Stout is a terrific writer!"},{"Title":"Three Witnesses (Nero Wolfe)","review":"The three stories in this collection are all very good. \\"The Next Witness\\" starts with Nero and Archie in a courtroom, where they've been subpoenaed to testify in a murder trial. In the middle of the trial, Wolfe leaves the courtroom, taking Archie with him: Wolfe has become convinced that the man being prosecuted is innocent. Upon leaving the courtroom, Wolfe and Archie go to the physical location of the telephone answering service where the murdered woman worked. This expedition neatly leads to another, and soon Wolfe has the suspects and un-suspects where he wants them, with the Assistant D.A. as a witness. Neatly done!In the second story, \\"When a Man Murders,\\" Stout has a Korean War soldier, thought dead, return alive after escaping from the prison camp in which he had been held. Stout loved using political events of the day in his fiction, and he usually did it well, as here. While Sidney Karnow was presumed dead, his widow, now wealthy, married another man. How inconvenient the return of Karnow, who now makes his wife a bigamist. His wife and her now-not-husband try to buy Karnow off with what's left of his original fortune, but . . . Karnow is conveniently murdered and Wolfe is hired to prove that the couple didn't do it. Satisfying.The third story, \\"Die Like a Dog,\\" is my favorite because it contains one of those oh-so-Wolfe moments when Archie, who wants to annoy his employer by bringing a dog, a black Lab, into the office, learns to his chagrin that Wolfe loves dogs. The dog happened to follow Archie home from the scene of a crime, but Archie does't know why. Wolfe names his new friend Jet, and allows Jet into the rooms and even the kitchen. The police inform Archie and Nero that the dog belonged to the murdered man, so Wolfe sends Archie back to the apartment complex where the murder took place, to see if Archie can find a way that Wolfe can legally keep the dog. From there, a series of complicated interactions between renters and artists and models takes place and leads to the solution of the murder.An excellent collection of three."},{"Title":"Three Witnesses (Nero Wolfe)","review":"This book consists of three Nero Wolfe/Archie Goodwin mysteries. The stories are well written but do not keep the reader's attention as do the novels."},{"Title":"Three Witnesses (Nero Wolfe)","review":"I love the mystery novels written during the 30's to the 60's. There is a certain style to Chandler, Hammet and Rex Stout which creates an interesting and fast paced story. Rex Stout is a master at giving the reader just enough detail to allow the reader to visualize his/her own images without going into the painful details some modern writers give. The books which are a collection of short stories are the best ones to me. They are written without tedious back-story and come to a speedy conclusion. Three Witnesses is a great example of this. Three stories linked in a theme that entertain. My favorite is the last story about the dog. It shows a different side of Nero Wolfe. Worth reading."},{"Title":"Three Witnesses (Nero Wolfe)","review":"These are great stories, but the most memorable one is \\"Die Like A Dog.\\" A dog's owner is killed and, because Archie accidentally swapped coats with him, the dog literally follows Archie home. The A&E; adaptation of this story is great.The Wolfe Pack, though, has raised a continuity concern: the dog's owner was dead, Wolfe was obviously very fond of the dog, and yet, without explanation, the dog disappears.\\"The Next Witness\\" has Wolfe testifying in court. The A&E; adaption is also a good one, but I was disappointed in the depiction of the judge and his demeanor - it was not how the book has it at all.And \\"When a Man Murders...\\" would have been an outstanding addition to the A&E; catalog. Wolfe avoids marital work (a staple of the private detective business), but takes on this one because of some unusual facts and because he's low on cash. The characters in this one are great; you could see the A&E; ensemble having a ball with this one."},{"Title":"Margaret Ogilvy","review":"JM Barrie wrote this curious memoir of his mother after her death. I don't know much about Barrie's personal life, I found it psychologically qute strange. He seemed obsessed with the idea of being her son and being close to her, yearning for her to mother him and to remain forever a little boy. (Yes - this was the writer of Peter Pan all right). He gives a vivid pictures of a provocative, strong minded, intelligent Scotswoman who wanted things very much HER way and was extremely mysterious and hard to pin down. Yet Barrie clearly got a great deal out of his relationship with her and genuinely loved her. This touching book made me feel there was a great deal more to find out about Barrie and now I want to read more about him. I do recommend this book."},{"Title":"Mike and the Bike","review":"I bought this for my 6-year-old son who LOVES riding his bike and watched part of the Tour on TV with us this year, but he hasn't been interested in reading it again after the first time.I think the story is a bit too simple to hold his interest, and I wish it had been developed into a longer story that had more \\"meat\\" to it. It seems to me that \\"Mike and the Bike\\" is a story more geared for kids in the 3-5 age range.

A thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"While this book may not be for everybody, and it might not include all the aspects that a reader might expect - kind of a one stop shopping to tell everything that is necessary to understand this sect - it nevertheless tells you what the Amish are really like and why they wear the unusual clothes they do, as well as preach against the \\"worldly wisdom.\\" You get to follow Rosanna through her childhood, youth, courtship, and marriage, and child-rearing. Not only that, you see how her Amish life will differ from that of her Catholic friends, especially when they visit from their Philadelphia home.While this is not a modern day presentation, it is really useful as a historical piece. Just don't get bogged down by expecting a thorough intellectual examination of the Amish. The book is not intended for that. It is written as a honest, sympathetic and straightforward reflection of these folks from a religious, social, and economic snapshot. The traditions of the Amish are celebrated, and it's done very nicely. Recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"I loved this book....and was sorry to see it end. The author (son of Rosanna) wrote a beautiful yet simple and compelling biography on the life of his mother, and the people closest in her life. I felt privileged reading this story - almost as if I were a member of this close-knit community. This story of honor and simple values would be wonderful today as it was then. Probably the most surprising statements which helped me to put it in perspective were comments made about Lincoln.....while I would prefer to believe this was a modern day story - stage coaches were in use and Lincoln was the President of the day. I highly recommend this book as an insight into the wisdom of how people should hold respect for one another, how families could work together for each other's good......and how communities can thrive without the aid of much of the electronic gadgetry of our modern times. This is a book of simple wisdom and peaceable lives. I am so grateful to son Joseph for his writing. There is even a very few pages at the end of the book, telling a bit about him......I highly recommend this book and hope you find value in it as I certainly did."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"The author is the son of the main character, Rosanna. Rosanna is the daughter of an Irish immigrant who is born around 1840 (my estimate as it is never given in the book). Rosanna's mother dies following Rosanna's birth. She is given to an Amish family on a temporary basis. When her father dies some months later, she ends up being permanently adopted and rasied by this old order Amish woman who later marries and bears more children.The author tells this interesting story, all the while weaving information about the lives of the old order Amish. I found this an interesting read. Explanations for why the Amish do things the way they do are given. There are details about their religious services, weddings, and funerals. Why they refuse to buy medical or fire insurance, why they refuse government aide, and why they refuse to fight in American wars is all explained.The author ends up going to college and later leaves the old order Amish to become a Mennonite. The old order Amish don't allow attending college as the author chose to do, to further his formal training as a teacher, so he had to change religious affiliations.What is missing from this book is a true spirit for Rosanna as a woman. Specifically, there is not much emotion or thoughts about certain things such as what it is like to mother children. There was virtually nothing about the experience of pregnancy, childbirth from her point of view, or how she could balance all that work and rearing so many children. The emotional aspect of losing her only daughter when she was just a toddler was not really elaborated on. I understand that it may be the custom to not verbally express emotions but I refuse to believe that emotions are not experienced...then again, if she was quiet about expressing her emotions I guess she would not have told her son therefore making these thoughts impossible for him to know and write about. Also missing was an explanation for what an Amish childhood is like, how much do they play and work? How much do they contribute to the laborious farm work the families accomplish? How does a busy Amish mother have time to pamper and enjoy her newborn baby? Also I'd like some parenting information such as common philosophies such as \\"is corporal punishment used\\"?Something else that I would have appreciated is a bit of an overview of the differences between the different orders and about the differences with the Mennonites. A better explanation of when and why people are ex-communicated, banned or shunned would put things more in perspective. There is nothing about this except a couple of sentences of inferred information. To get that information will take further research and reading.The account of the old order Amish is tastefully and respectfully written about in this book. I think this would make a great read aloud book for young children or as a book for a young person to read to themselves, perhaps if learning about American history or just to satisfy a curiosity about the Amish. There is nothing in here that is controversial such as sexual content. Since they live such a clean and virtuous life, there is nothing that needs censoring here for young children.The old order Amish are portrayed as a content, happy, and peaceful people. If we each changed a few things we non-Amish do to follow in their footsteps we'd be all the better for it."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"I remember my mother reading this book to the family when I was a child so when I found it in the bookstore I had to pick it up.I found the book interesting and the Amish a fascinating group of people. The book tells about the Amish and about growing up Amish. The Amish live a totally different type of lifestyle than most of us are used to and this book explains some of their reasons for why that is. In living close to them I was able to compare what the book said with what I saw them doing.If you ever find this book I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"Rosanna of the Amish is the story of a young orphan raised in the 1800's among the Amish of Pennsylvania. Beginning with it's first pages, the story reaches out and pulls you in. From it's descriptions of the Amish worship to the simplcity of daily life, it brings the often secluded world of the Amish to life, not only describing how things are done, but in many cases why...I couldn't put the book down once I started and to date have read it numberous times. It is a classic that bears reading and re-reading."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"First written in 1940, this book tells the story of the author's mother, an Irish girl who was orphaned as a newborn and raised by an Amish neighbor after her father and older siblings move away. Rosanna grows up to be Amish in everyway, and over the years, she does get a chance to see her Catholic siblings from time to time and the difference in their lives.I enjoyed the character Rosanna and reading about her life. Her characterization, and that of other characters was good, but not outstanding. What makes this book so enjoyable is how naturally the author brings you into the Amish lifestyle. We learn about dress, selection of ministers, the bann, courtship, worship services, etc and very much feel like we're part of the scene. There are some differences compared to the Amish of today (and between different groups), in the exact specifics of dress, most using generators and having bathrooms today, etc, but the fundamentals of the group and their basic principles are the same.To anyone who is fascinated by the Amish or enjoys reading other Amish books, I would definitely recommend this one. This book has the advantage of being written by one who grew up in the community. It conveys the lifestyle very well and is an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"I thought this was one of the most interesting books I've read all school year. I've always wondered about the amish society, but until I finished this book this afternoon, I didn't have any clue as to what the amish believed.Joseph Yoder makes it possible for people like me to really enjoy a school book.I really think that if you have any questions about the amish to go straight to this book and read it."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"I read this book almost thirty years ago, and read it again this year. My memories of a great story about the Amish were completely confirmed on the second reading. Joseph Yoder tells a very sensitive and caring story about his mother, Rosanna, and the family and Amish community in which he grew up. The reader must accept that the book was first published many decades ago and therefore was written to different standards than today's family stories. I credit the author with refraining from judgement when it comes to doctrinal differences among various Amish and Mennonite groups. The fact that he left the Old Order church of his childhood for a less conservative church, yet was still fully accepted in the community of his youth speaks for the respect he retained in the Old Order group. If you are looking for a completely family friendly story with great information on the Old Order Amish of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, you will not find a more enjoyable read.Rosanna's Boys"},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"The book was in great condition and was exactly how they described it. Can't believe they only wanted a penny for it! The only thing was the first time I had to sit down and read it for a long period of time I started to smell something and when I pulled the book closer to my nose, I realized that it was the book that smelled like cigarette smoke. I gag almost everytime I open it, but spraying it with body spray seems to be helping =)"},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"I have enjoyed reading several other books detailing the customs and religious beliefs of the Amish. I purchased this book thinking it too would be enjoyable reading. In my opinion, this book is one of the most boring and &quot;slow&quot; books I have read in a long time. I will probably not even read the last few chapters, but go on to another author, hoping for more enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"The Apalachee Indians and Mission San Luis (Native Peoples, Cultures, and Places of the Southeastern United States)","review":"The Apalachee Indians and Mission San Luis is one of the most physically attractive books ever produced by an academic press. Its hundreds of photographs, drawings, and panoramic paintings bring to life a long buried Indian town and Spanish colonial regional capital. The authors help establish the importance of the overlooked yet once great chiefdoms of the Southeast and of the abortive but still influential efforts of the Spanish to make those chiefdoms part of their empire. At the same time, the authors vividly reconstruct the daily life of the Indians and Europeans who lived and died at San Luis. Hann and McEwan show commendable sensitivity to the native Apalachee inhabitants in the process. This is a book that can satisfy readers of history, Native American studies, or archeology at several levels."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"I loved this book. I really did. Ray Coleman has written an objective, factual account of the late Beatle. To his credit, Mr. Coleman does not languish during John's years as a Beatle; on the other hand, Coleman's book picks up steam and speed after the Beatle years have been explored.Ray Coleman has plainy done his homework. This work is well researched and explores the psyche and personality of John Lennon in all his humanity. He does not make John to be anything other than human; he does not hammer home the point that as a human John had feet of clay; he does not enlarge John beyond his own artistic talents.The passages concerning John's murder in 1980 are handled in a factual and tasteful manner. Coleman has done a good job in tracing the movements of John's assassin and the series of horrible events that culminated in John's untimely death.This book will certainly leave readers with much to think about and has something to offer everybody."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"it really got into the psyche of the man &amp; the myth through the people that knew him best (aunt mimi,astrid,cynthia&amp;yoko)i especially enjoyed the first half of the book but mr chapman gave little insight into john's work in the making of my favorite beatles albums i.e. (sgt pepper &amp; abbey road) and trying to make yoko a songwriter ahead of her time was a bit too much - But i did feel i got a good understanding of john &amp; yoko's amazing relationship."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"Coleman's book is loaded with fascinating detail of John's pre-Beatle days - must read for true fans. The insight this provides into his rebelious attitude, humour, and music makes this the best Lennon bio out there...period."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"John Lennon was quoted (by Jann Wenner I believe) as saying: \\"If there's such a thing as a genius, I am one.\\"Braggadocio of that magnitude is worthy of a snicker, the product of being 'too big for your britches.' But you can't expect John Lennon to have been grounded in reality because he was a Beatle. The Beatles were surrounded by yes men and starry eyed girls and therefore could hardly be expected to have had a realistic sense of themselves while they were recording as a group, or after. Lennon's boasting was that of a man who'd had his picture on too many magazine covers, breathlessly welcomed by hosts of too many TV shows, and his records broadcast on radio stations around the world.Lennon was, of course, deserving of many of the accolades heaped on him. I enjoy the Beatles to this day, but not any more than Zeppelin, the Stones, Elvis, Cream, Hendrix, or any other tier one old school rock act whose music has passed the test of time. Coleman's fluff book is fun to breeze through while listening to the White Album, certainly more than Albert Goldman's book about the same subject. Apply the adage of not believing everything you read, especially about a cult of personality like John Lennon.Jonas Salk was a genius. Einstein was a genius. Lennon was a talented entertainer in the music business. It is true these men were and are still legends in their chosen fields of endeavor, but none of them are gods.When it comes to Lennon, my humble opinion is Ray Coleman (and Jann Wenner) become a bit starry eyed themselves."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"Those who think that Coleman's book leans too much toward the light must have skipped the parts where Cynthia talks candidly about how John used to hit her. Also, his beating of a man at a party who accused him of an affair with Brian Epstein is more detailed here than anywhere else. This book tells the truth, the reality, the dark AND the light. It is really long; I won't lie to you. However, if you want the real story, this is the only book. It's also the only book brave enough to call May Pang a liar, which she is. It tells the truth about Yoko, and that she really is a human being with feelings, not fangs. This book will not only teach you everything we know about John from his general beliefs and his feelings about his music to his favorite cafes and foods, it will teach you enough that you will become a sharp critical eye of other books on the market. You will know which ones are telling the truth, and which ones are bunk. Coleman's work is the definitive biography, by far."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"I've read a lot of books on Lennon and I have to say that this is the best one around. It gives a good detailed account of the life and times of Lennon. And it also has old love letters that John wrote to his first wife Cynthia which I thought was great and some art work he drew when he was in school. However, the book tends to be a bit repetative. That slightly annoyed me. It would have also been nice if they included more pictures. But as I said before, this is the book to get on John Lennon. A must have for all Lennon and Beatles fans!"},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"This is an interesting and very readable book that covers a lot of ground. Like all biographies on John Lennon, the author has to choose who to believe from the various insiders in the story. As a result, things tend to lean toward whichever insiders the author identifies with the most.I find it interesting to read books about Lennon just to see which version of the man the author has chosen to portray: The infalible genius, the flake, Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde, the crusader for peace and justice... In this case, Lennon is sort of a flawed genius. Fair enough.Here is the main point that I want to make, however: While this book is thorough, it is NOT definitive. It completely leaves out or brushes over many of the most well-known stories. If this were the only book you read on the subject you would be very confused. I was hoping the author would spend some time digging up new facts or bringing fresh perspective on the old stories (much like Spitz did in \\"The Beatles\\"). Instead, many of the well known stories are missing without explanation. I understand if the author wants to avoid all the things that have already been said over and over again but you can't skip essential material and then claim to have written \\"The Definitive Biography.\\""},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"I'm only going to say that I've read MANY books on the Beatles, but this was the first I ever read and I will always think it is the best and most thorough."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"This is an excellent book, I learned much about one of the greatest musicians of the 20th Century.

Very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;Being born one year exactly after John Lennons death I could never experience the excitment of the Beatles or John Lennons solo years as it happens. Before the Anthology I never knew who The Beatles were, but ever since then I have loved them and read anything about them I could get my hands on. Because John is my favorite Beatle I have read the most about him and thought I knew almost everything about him. Then I read Ray Coleman's Biography and learned many new fascenating things about him."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"As a great fan of John Lennon, eventhough I'm too young to really know about the 60's and 70's, I must say that (thanks to Ray Coleman) I get a feeling of what was going on at that time. This book is wonderfully liberated from &quot;we whom know as we were all into it&quot;. Ray Coleman describes a complex artist and throws the light on him without respect without being too impersonal. As a journalist myself (for a small local paper in Sweden though) I do appreciate the way he presents such a famous man. Coleman seems to be one of the closest journalists, though he is the first to admit that &quot;nobody but aunt Mimi and maybe Yoko was really close to him). In other words, he doesn't claim to be an expert. He leaves a lot to the reader and since I now know more about his (John Lennon's) personal life it's even greater to listen to Beatles and Lennon again.//Anna Tidqvist"},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"When i first ordered this book, I had great expentations.And it is a great book about John Lennon. It tells everything about John Lennon, from the start to the end. As I started to read, it got more and more interesting.It has details and interwievs with peoble you didn't know exsisted.

Jan Wenner is the interviewer and the book is available on Amazon. I highly suggest it to any true fans of Johns."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"Aside from being one of the best musicians in the history of rock and roll, John Lennon was also a philosopher and an activist, and while so many modern day activist/musicians seem to lack credibility, if not to be downright charlatans, Lennon seemed to deeply believe in what he was doing, and made serious use of his fame as a tool for social good. And, as I say, he was a phenomenal musician. This bio is one of many that have been written about the former Beatle, and it is, in my opinion, the best. The volume chronicles Lennon's early life and spends a substantial amount of space delving into the triumphs and conflicts of the Fab Four. You come away grasping much of the complexity that made Lennon such a prolific musician, but also what drove him to want to better the world. Coleman's intimacy with Lennon shines through the book. It is a must for any Beatle's fan."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"I loved this book. I all of my reading about the Beatles and John Lennon himself, this one told me the most. I had spent the last four months reading a different Lennon book, that was even smaller then this one, and I think I read &quot;Lennon&quot; in about two weeks. It was so much easier to read and Coleman wrote it beautifully. From the start &quot;Lennon&quot; was a book that I never wanted to put down. I think I even read it twice, it was so good. This book is guarenteed to make to laugh, cry, and maybe even curse when you hear about the treatment John recieved during his lifetime. From his tragic childhood, to the Beatles, to Yoko, to Sean and his awful death in 1980, you will love and maybe even understand John a little better than before. This is one of the greatest biography book ever published and ever will be published for that matter. It's a must read for any Lennon fan out there, young and old"},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"Perhaps the only true definitive biography ofBeatles genius, John Lennon, was his ownmusic, lyrics, art, interviews, idealism,and life work itself. Ray Coleman's \\"Lennon\\",however, is a classic work that comes in a close second;as it remains the very best end-to-end biography andportrait of the complex, often misunderstood, brilliant, andlegendary Beatle's leader and visionary - spanning his wholelife from child to death. Ray Coleman knew all of the Beatlesfirst hand as a reporter and traveled and toured with them.His intimate knowledge is unique and extends beyond the mereresearch and interviews (of other would-be biographers) tohaving had direct personal experiences with John Lennon, withthe band, and with their whole entourage.Coleman's biography reveals and explores John's greatpersonal lamenting and dissastifaction at the very heightof \\"Beatlemania\\" and his unprecedented success - the key tounderstanding who John Lennon really was and what wouldlead to the Beatles breakup and form his post-Beatle goalsand objectives. While exploring John's dispair, depression,lows, and highs head on - the book also refreshingly exploresJohn's humor, warmth, charisma, loyalty, leadership,actitivy, positive ideals, committments, and desire to be\\"real\\" and credible - unlike various cheap, tabloid-style,one-dimensional, ill-willed, character assassination booksthat have unfortunately surfaced in the wake of his murderseeking to trivialize (arguably) the 20th century's greatestsongwriter and one of it's most influential and inspirationalfigures. For a complete examination of John Lennon's lifein-total, this excellant book, and Jon Wiener's book\\"Come Together\\" (which focuses on John's political thoughtand activism, solo career, and the U.S. government harassmentand abuse against him in detail) provide and form anexcellant and complimentary set. Other absolutely essentialreading is John's own lengthy 1980 Playboy Magazineinterviews (published in book form) that includes the mostaccurately documented song authorship breakdown of theBeatles songs and also his self analysis of his solomusic. The musical analysis of John's work providedin \\"Lennon\\" is a little bit lacking as it focuses mostly onjust the lyrics. However, the book \\"BeatleSongs\\" rounds outthis information as does the book \\"Tell Me Why\\". But, ifyou are buying only one book on either the Beatles or JohnLennon, Ray Coleman's book \\"Lennon\\" provides the best singleand substantive source of insight available into thephenomena of Lennon and the Beatles - containing none of theirrelevant aimless drivel of the much ballyhooed \\"BeatlesAnthology\\" book and far more substantive information.This book is the benchmark. A must read for any fan,Rock archivest, or musicologist."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"In the midst of a rather lengthy introduction, Coleman asks the reader how John Lennon could be widely considered a genius and yet be considered foolish in his choice of a life mate (Yoko). It's in this supposition that the author almost lost me. Clearly people can be strong in one area and weak in others, and if nothing John Lennon was a man who was possessed of both strength and weakness. The author was a long-standing friend, and I suppose that needs to be considered when you pick up this book. Lennon's short-comings are chronicled in the book without apology, but Coleman it seems, will make allowances for the flaws in the man because of his musical genius. As a person who was born in '67 and missed a lot of this era first-hand, I was excited to learn more of the nuance about the Beatles and the post-Beatles John Lennon. You do get a comprehensive view of the man's career, and of his life. I found it hard to reconcile a man who adored one child (Sean) but largely abandoned his first-born (Julian); who professed the need for peace, yet had bouts with violence; who claimed to not need much in the way of material things yet dispensed of one palatial estate (because it had memories of his first marriage) in favor of a 30 room mansion and called it \\"adequate\\". It is widely held that Yoko Ono was chiefly responsible for the break-up of the Beatles; after having read this book (and potentially an even better one on McCartney by Barry Miles) I don't think she is entirely to blame, but she did contribute to an environment that probably deprived us of a break-up and subsequent reunion(s). At minimum, Yoko Ono's impression on me is that of a poseur artist and a despicably selfish person who shut Julian out of a rightful inheritance for many many years. None of this makes Lennon any less interesting as a musician or as a figure in history; but Coleman's account of Lennon and his contributions seem to sometimes be at the cost of what McCartney brought to the partnership."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"Ray Coleman's book addresses many of the rumors that swirled around John Lennon, and brings out personal information from the best possible sources.

The one constant was the music. The Beatles continued to make great records. They recorded Ticket To Ride which John Lennon called the first heavy metal song. They did a second movie, Help!

Revolver was released the following year. These were tough times in the United States. The Vietnam War and race riots were out of control. When The Beatles were threatened by the Ku Klux Klan, the tours ended. They retired to the studio. Lennon's songs remained the best on Beatle albums, although they became morbid in a way which is hard to explain.

Buy it though he\`s a very good writer!"},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"i think it is a very good book but that it ignores the dark side goldman might have written a bad book but coleman wrote a too good book i think it santifies a man who was just a man i think coleman looks at john with love in his eyes but overall it is better than goldman's character assasination"},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"I love John Lennon. I love the Beatles. Heck, I even love Yoko Ono's solo albums. So I should probably agree that this Lennon adoration is the definitive biography...but it isn't.Like most biographies of celebrities, Lennon's bios fall into two extremes. The most notorious extreme is Albert Goldman (The Lives of John Lennon): mean-spirited, doing whatever he can get away with to tear down the subject even if it means passing off rumors as fact, speculating on the flimsiest of evidence, and using obscuring resources to the point that you're hard-pressed to know what to believe.But it's just as bad to write something at the opposite extreme, and that's what Ray Coleman does with Lennon. I expect that there's a lot of truth here, particularly when it comes to the Beatles, Lennon's radical period and his fight for U.S. residency. But an awful lot of it is fawning, worshipful John-was-always-right fluff.Any book that relies so much on Elliott Mintz's testimony as the second half of this book does is going to be badly slanted--bear in mind that Mintz is Yoko's publicist. He's PAID to whitewash and pretty up the stories. And this publicist has always been particularly sycophantic: he's Yoko's puppet. So when he calls May Pang an outright liar, or implies that after the Lost Weekend John and Yoko never had a single marital dispute again, take it with the biggest grain of salt you can find.But then again, Coleman does a lot of the window dressing himself. Look, anyone who's seriously looked at Lennon knows how capable he was of immature and nasty behavior, and if you're writing a book about him you have to acknowledge that. Instead we get very little story about the \\"Lost Weekend,\\" which lasted a whole year and a half and is dispatched here in about ten pages. (Peter Brown's The Love You Make is the best account of John's public obnoxiousness at the time.) The closest Coleman comes to giving John human flaws is pointing the finger and saying, \\"Sure, John did this or that, but it was only because he/she/they picked the fight first!\\" For example, apparently every time Paul McCartney said something in an interview about John, even something as earnest and understandable as \\"I wish we could all sit down, just the four of us with no outside interference, and work out our problems,\\" it was apparently a personal attack on John and a deliberate snubbing of Yoko. I'm sure that's how John saw a lot of these things, yes, but Coleman need not take such a \\"Yes, that's exactly how it happened\\" approach to all of John's interpretations of every event.Finally, there's the question of Yoko, who comes off in the book as almost more perfect than John, the absolute soul mate who was wise and good and deeply in love with John. The relationship is pretty much a fairy tale in Lennon; any relationship that was so close for so long HAD to have complications, spats, entanglements, and so forth. Coleman gives us hints that those might have happened, but what were they and why? Just a gloss-over. There has indeed been a lot of negative press about Yoko, and it's true that a lot of it has come from people who knew her and have a clear axe to grind (like Fred Seaman, who Yoko personally fired from the estate in 1981)...I don't believe most of those accounts, but the fact that so many people who knew Yoko had an axe to grind leads me to believe she's not all sunshine and lollipops. But that's what she is in Lennon.Most people should read Lennon, because it covers the whole forty-year ground and it's very good in some parts. But realize that what you're essentially reading is \\"The Gospel According to Ray\\" and that you can't take this kind of posthumous [...] too seriously. While I admit that this is probably the best biography yet written of John Lennon, the \\"definitive\\" biography is yet to come."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"Ray Coleman's biography is terrific due to its depth. It gets longs and tedious at times, but many of the details are essential to understand such a complex man as John Lennon. Coleman being a personal friend of John also gives the reader great insight, rather than reading a book by someone who has never been acquainted with him. I believe Coleman portrays Lennon warts and all. He doesn't really shy away with faults of John, and tells about how he roughly treated Cynthia and Julian, describes how he hurt many people in his young days being inconsiderate of cripples and deformed people, and tells about how he did get involved with drugs too heavily and ignored many important things going on around him. Being personaly acquainted with Lennon, Coleman also tells about the intimate, vulnerable side of John rarely revealed during his life. The book gives an accurate representation of John as it shows many sides of such a complex man. I believe this is a true must have for beatles fans and those he want to find the truth about a great man stolen from us by some maniac."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"This is the most in-depth of all John Lennon biographies, but I wouldn't recommend it to casual or new fans. Ray Coleman's non-linear analysis of the ex-Beatle's life, constantly flashing back and forward to illustrate an angle or exhaust a topic, can only be appreciated if you're already familiar with the basic story. Since no other good Lennon biographies are currently available (&quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot;, by the editors of Rolling Stone, would be a good start, but it's out of print) you can either begin with a Beatles biography (The Beatles' own &quot;Anthology&quot;, Phillip Norman's &quot;Shout&quot; or Hunter Davies' &quot;The Beatles&quot;) or you can research about John Lennon on the Internet and other sources. THEN, if decide you want to go really deep into the subject, you'll find all you need in Ray Coleman's book. On the other hand, if you're a long-time Lennon fanatic, this book is a must."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"As the only readily available biography of John Lennon, Ray Coleman's eponymous book must serve as the benchmark. However, decades after his death there really should be other quality biographies available. The fact that there aren't is surprising and distressing.Ray Coleman (of \\"Melody Maker\\" magazine) does a good, but not great, job telling the story of Lennon, who was far and away the most talented and dynamic of his bandmates.In discussing Lennon's childhood and teen years, and in recounting the very early days of The Beatles (coach bus tours and all), LENNON is a wonderful, albeit non-linear book which discloses much about John's early life and the influences that shaped him. Reminscences of old friends fill the pages.John Lennon's sense of the absurd and the bizarre is well documented (the book contains many of his early sketches) and Coleman revels in recounting examples of Lennon's weird and very original sense of humor. The man was unquestionably a genius, even though his focus and his choosings were often illogical or inexplicable.One of the things that most strikes the reader is Lennon's unshakeable sense of loyalty. The devastation he felt at losing first his beloved mother, Julia, and then his best friend, Stu Sutcliffe, presages other, future losses, and goes far toward explaining his lingering sense of betrayal and bitterness as and after The Beatles broke up.Sutcliffe is a case in point: Woefully short of musical talent as Sutcliffe was, Lennon refused to listen to the entreaties of the other Beatles to eject Stu from the band, even as The Beatles made their chameleonlike change from a local garage band to a minor (and then major) sensation. Despite the fact that he couldn't really play an instrument at all, (he faked it and made up for it by looking cute for female fans), Sutcliffe remained with The Beatles until his untimely death during the Cavern Club days (1962) from a brain aneurysm. Harsh as it may sound, Sutcliffe's death may have freed The Beatles from the ash heap of history. Still, it was a loss John neither forgot nor spoke of.Coleman is best at retelling John's personal history.The book is weakest during, ironically, the best-documented period of John's life, from 1964 to 1970. It is as though Coleman studiously wanted to avoid repeating information available elsewhere, and so the halcyon years of Beatlemania are slighted. The Beatles' 1964 triumphant American tour, Shea Stadium, the Hollywood Bowl, and their appearance on Ed Sullivan simply don't exist. Coleman hardly mentions the Colonies or the madness that met John, Paul, George and Ringo in the United States in 1964 at all, and the band's subsequent worldwide experiences read like an encyclopedia, being, for the most part dry and colorless.One thing that does shine through is George Martin's critical role in shaping the sound of The Beatles. His ability to translate John's visual imagery (\\"I want this to look like a County Fair\\" in \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" and \\"I picture myself as a shaman on a mountaintop\\" in \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\") into music was a huge part of The Beatles' success.The solo career years of 1970 to 1975 are more completely documented, though Coleman did not have access to Yoko Ono. He did however, have access to John's friend, Elliot Mintz, to John's Aunt Mimi, and to other personalities of the \\"lost weekend\\" period. Coleman is fair and balanced, and not overly adoring of John in this period.Coleman is delicate, dignified and respectful in discussing John's private years (1975 to 1980), and clearly sympathizes with Lennon's intense need for privacy and personal growth time. John's all-too brief musical reemergence and tragic death in late 1980 are handled with the same propriety and restraint.The problem with LENNON is that it really only scratches the surface of the life of this marvelously complex and talented man who touched so many people so profoundly. Still, this is IT until another biography of substance comes along. As such it is recommended: THREE AND A HALF STARS."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"I have read many Lennon biographies, but none of them compared to this one. The late Ray Coleman proves that he knew John Lennon at the best and worst times of Lennon's life. Coleman does a good job by including postcards John sent him. Instead of getting the same Beatles information that you can find in many other books. You get in-depth information, such as the time John had to choose between his mother and father, his hand-written love letters to his first wife (Cynthia), the price he paid for being a Beatle, his struggle with fatherhood, drug abuse, possible depotration and the F.B.I. I first read this book over the summer of '96 and I have read it many times since then. I highly recommend this book for Lennon fans or anybody who wants to know about John Lennon the man. END"},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"On the anniversary of his death, there will be an inevitable surge in all things 'Lennon' and 'The Beatles'. There are a lot of books on Lennon, some good, some not so good. Some have simply done a hack job, relying on gossip and hearsay as 'fact' for the sake of profit and shock - such as Lennon's sexuality for example.In this book, hearsay stays as hearsay, and doesn't evolve into fact or truth.From early on in this book, it is fair to say that Ray Coleman does have a genuine fascination/respect for John Lennon and I thought this will sour the book and turn it into a biased sugary affair that will forsake Lennon's 'human' elements and instead opt for a crux to prop up The Myth, The Legend, and The Superhuman Lennon instead.But, Coleman doesn't allow bias to get in the way of getting an accurate portrayal. Lennon comes across as a flawed human being -like we all are.Lennon is not an angel, but nor is he a monster. He is, simply, and most interestingly, a rather complex man whose childhood was set by tragedy and rejection, therefore fuelling his temper and frustrations in the process. This book shows Lennon as a man who could cruelly hurt the ones he loved (both physically and mentally). But, he is also a man who could show compassion and generosity - and away from the media spotlight.These contradictions in Lennon's life doesn't mean that one side of Lennon must be true and the other side not. But, instead, it reinforces Coleman's objections in this biography - Lennon was a complex human being, with the same faults, as well as the same kindness, of us all.For more music-orientated fans, Lennon as a songwriter is vividly disected, with his songs broken up and analysed carefully.My favourite part of the book is Lennon's time at Art college in Liverpool. Coleman manages to set an atmosphere in a city of unlimited supply of talent in young people, but have nowhere to channel it or turn it into something productive (obvioulsy, Lennon did). Nothing changes...After reading this book, you have the strange feeling that you actually KNOW Lennon, rather than simply hating him or loving him, which I think, is a golden sign of a good biography.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"While thoroughly worthwhile, I hesitate to call this the &quot;definitive&quot; biography. Coleman tells the Lennon story from his perspective as a British journalist and former acquaintance of John Lennon. As such he is in touch with many valuable sources, and not with others. Perhaps this books should be read in tandem with Albert Goldman's negatively sensational but well-researched biography. The truth may then emerge, for it probably lies somewhere in the middle."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"This is an outstanding biography of the man who came to be known as the Chief Beatle and the Founder of the World's Greatest Band, the Beatles!Coleman does an in-depth analysis of the former Beatle and traces his ancestry. One comes away with a \\"sense\\" of John, the natural and environmental forces that molded and shaped this highly gifted and articulate man. One can smile at the bright, high-spirited child who reached developmental milestones early and was also an early reader; one can smile at the artistic boy who created complex drawings at a very young age; one cheers for the talented young boy who proved to be quite adept at things musical.Coleman does an admirable job of portraying John's natural parents, half-sisters and the indomitable aunt who raised him in realistic lights; one gets a good sense of how each one of these people influenced John and how his life experiences were expressed by his early experiences. In a very touching description of John reconnecting with his natural father, one feels John's anguish at having been promised a life with him and denied; one feels John's devastating maternal loss when his natural mother Julia is killed in an accident when John was in his teens.John takes those experiences and fleshes them out musically; his songs \\"Mother\\" and \\"Julia\\" are songs that come straight from his early loss. His interpersonal relationships with the other Beatles, his first wife Cynthia and their son Julian and his second wife Yoko and their son Sean are fully examined in this work. John describes the \\"strong women\\" in his immediate family and how he drew strength from their examples. This book makes readers feel as if they are seeing John emerge from his own \\"Hard Day's Night\\" to \\"Starting Over,\\" which appeared to be where he was in his life during his last five years. Sadly, on December 8, 1980 an assassin's bullet silenced the voice of the man who got the world to listen.This is a must read for all John Lennon fans and for people becoming familiar with his work. Please listen to John Lennon."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"This is a fairly good biography. The writing could be a little more involving (you can tell the writer got his start in journalism). And I was quite surprised how little Ringo is mentioned in this quite long book (only a few pages here and there). It has been said that Ringo was closest to John in the group. And I am interested in the group dynamic. I am a Beatles fan first, before being a Lennon fan. And some of John's rough spots are glossed over. Since AND THE LOVE YOU MAKE revealed that John had a little semi-gay affair with Brian in Spain, where they vacationed while Cynthia Lennon was dealing with the newborn Julian, this book tries to go to much effort to disprove John's gay impulses. Well, I don't think John had real gay impulses. He saw that Brian was in love with him, and, as an artist, probably thought he'd give it a brief try with him. John in his PLAYBOY interview said, &quot;[In Spain with Brian] I was thinking like a writer all the time: \`I am experiencing this'...It was almost a love affair [with Brian]. But it was never consummated.&quot; (John told his childhood friend Pete Shotton that Brian merely masturbated John, which wouldn't qualify as consummation). And in his interview with Jann Wenner, John said, &quot;[with Brian] I enjoyed playing a bit faggy. It was enjoyable. But in those very large rooms in Liverpool, it was very embarassing.&quot; So there is John himself suggesting that his relationship with Brian bordered on the &quot;romantic&quot; (even though it doesn't quite qualify.) This biography should have mentioned this aspect of John and Brian, instead of trying so hard and obviously to deny it. And later, when John is separated from Yoko in the 70's, and Cynthia happens to be in L.A., and she and John, with others, go to Disneyland together, John never says a word to Cynthia, and won't let her say a word to him. She just wants to talk about their son Julian. And when they fly on the same plane later, he still won't talk to her, and she cries to herself during the flight. Coleman let's John off the hook here for his very insensitive behavior; that it was acceptable since John was going through problems being separated from Yoko. So what! John's treatment of Cynthia here is mean, especially for a man who preached peace and love. And John was furious at his own father for being a lousy father, but then John turns around and was less than a wonderful father for Julian. I admire John Lennon, and know he was far from all bad, and was mostly good. But this book goes too far to paint him as all-around wonderful!! And he wasn't that either. A very good bit of the book is seeing John's love letters to Cynthia Lennon before and when they were married. There is a belief that John didn't ever love Cynthia, and only married her because she got pregnant. But the love letters Cynthia provided the author show that John did in fact love Cynthia very much at one time (and let her know it in these letters). These letters show the warm and loving side of John, and it is nice to see it."},{"Title":"Lennon: Definitive Biography, The","review":"I think Ray Coleman gave an in-depth approach to writing this book. He didn't attack John Lennon in any way, he just told facts. He talks a lot about John as a teenager, a star, a father, and a husband. This book was well written and insightful. At times it did get very tedious, but nonetheless interesting and definitely a book for any Beatles, or John Lennon fan to read. Being a HUGE Beatles fan, it made me see another side to John Lennon that I was oblivious to. Paul used to be my favorite Beatle, but now it is John. It was obvious that Ray was a close friend of John's, which really let the reader see the REAL Lennon. He doesn't sugarcoat Lennon at all. He tells about how John would make fun of cripples, and how he was heavily into acid and other drugs. He tells about John's arrogant approach toward women, and how he sometimes ignored his family. He also lets us see the sensitive side of John. Ray Coleman really lets the world see what a witty, intelligent, loving on the inside, &quot;hard&quot; on the outside, genius that John Lennon was."},{"Title":"The Concept of Ideology and Other Essays","review":"In the opening title essay of this work Lichtheim discusses the origin of the concept 'ideology'. He traces it from the Puritan seventeeth century but puts his main emphasis on the French Revolution .He considers it in connection with the great intellectual systems of the nineteenth century and gives special emphasis to Marxism. He in other essays considers the development of political thought in the period from French to Russian revolutions. He in the latter part of the book looks at the struggle between Communism and Fascism and closes with a disucssion of Sartre."},{"Title":"A Companion to the Fairy Tale","review":"This collection of sholarly articles on the fairy tale are diverse and interesting.

On the other hand, where I recognize numerous styles, each available for view in my closet, Miss Meghan can't distinguish more than \\"high heels\\". Well, that much for the direction the taste in clothing takes in the young generation. Even more interesting is outlook on life, expressed primarily in the professions Miss Meghan selects for her readers. Positions in the media and marketing dominate the selection. There are few occurrences of the legal occupations, corporate ranks, non-profits, full-time mommies and housewives. There is even a waitress and a lab worker and perhaps a teacher and a fashion designer. What is missing: medical doctors, engineers of all kinds (chemical, electrical, mechanical), technology workers, trades women - not a single lady welder or lady carpenter, for example! - university professors, pilots, military women. Shortly, all the professions important in the life of each society are neglected, with all the marginal and decorative occupations as the recommended careers for the modern woman. Return to Victorian times, shoed in sneakers? After all, those Victorian shoe styles were not glamorous, and after factoring in the difference in manufacturing technology they were more like sneakers or hiking boots than high-heel sandals with ankle straps."},{"Title":"The Perfect Fit: What Your Shoes Say About You","review":"I went to a showing at Macy's and one of the gifts in thegiveaway bag was this book \\"the perfect fit, what your shoes sayabout you\\"on top I got to meet the most charming young lady who wrote thebook.

Sorry the book reviewer was so harsh...I do agree the cover should have been re-designed to grab one's attention."},{"Title":"The Last Dinosaur","review":"Over the last week, I have been reading Robin Dobbin's first novel, The Last Dinosaur (An Unforgettable Love Story). Dobbins and I had corresponded via email several times in the late winter/early spring of 2006. It seemed to be an interesting plot: great baseball player gets hurt, wife walk out on him, gets a gig coaching at an inner-city school, takes team to the state title, wins wife back--or something like that.As the months passed, I had forgotten the plot as there is no blurb on the back cover, just a lengthy author bio. As the months passed, I would look at the cover and think I had committed to a sci-fi or something like that. It has nothing to do with baseball, and looks like a jungle. So I did what all reviewers do, I procrastinated.Then I felt guilty about promising Dobbins I would review the book, so I settled in. I found that interesting plot but was disappointed in its execution. There are too many weaknesses in the book for me to give it a recommendation.I could never determine if Elizabeth was the protagonist's (legendary baseball player Jerry Walker) sister or his ex-wife's attorney's sister. There is no pacing/tension in the story. That nefarious exposition via dialogue. Jerry gets a gig teaching history and coaching baseball at a Houston school but has no credentials or training that would allow him to be anything more than a substitute teacher. The white millionaire coach was too easily accepted by the poor inner-city students and staff. All tell--no show.For these reasons, I can't recommend The Last Dinosaur (An Unforgettable Love Story).Armchair Interviews says: Heed the reviewer's comments."},{"Title":"The Last Dinosaur","review":"This book was wonderful.

It will give you information unlike any other review book out there because it's written by students at the school and contains only things current students know about. No large review book is going to give you information about guys and girls, or off campus housing. In addition to these things of course there are sections on academics and facilities alike as well as a ton of other things.

Unfortunately, the editorial reviews do not mention this. I would recommend it to 16 and up, not 12 and up. Just a warning to parents and teachers if you care about this kind of stuff. In an attempt to be \\"authentic\\", it seems coarseness is thought to be OK.

Other towns survive them. But the thing about Chris Creed's disappearance was that he was just plain gone. There was no evidence leading anyone to prove anything specific had happened to him.Torey Adams becomes obsessed with Creed's disappearance because of their friendship. He really doesn't discover anything except that some mysteries are not meant to be solved, but rather just to be overcome.For mature readers only because of very offensive language and adult subject matter (description of having sex)."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"I was supposed to read this book over the summer of 02, but I could barely finish it. It's awful. Simply about some nerd that goes missing in the woods and one kid that wants to find him. This book was horrible language, containing the somewhat-dreaded 'effword' and many things containing sexual references. It was like a Stephen King wannabe book, and really doesn't pull you in. If you want a good read, pick up \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.\\" It's at least the littlest bit suspenseful, and though it's a little over my age group and still says cursewords, it was far better than this dissappointment of a book."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"This book is on a reading list for 9th grade. I bought it for my son to read and I read it myself. It contains several \\"f\\" words and several \\"a\\" words. It also has other offensive language. I don't particularly mind the language, my son has certainly heard it before, but should this be on a 9th grade reading list? I don't think so. Also, the book contains many sexual references and is written from the perspective of an 11th grade student. The author tries to use slang for the teens she writes for but isn't often successful. Terms such as \\"crashed out\\" for falling asleep don't make sense. The term is \\"crashed\\". Also, what teen says \\"don't wig out\\"???? The story was predictable and I knew what was going to happen by the time I was half way through. If there are any other books on your child's reading list I would recommend you look to them. My son will probably read this one anyway since I already bought it but I wish I had known about the material beforehand."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"The following reviews from young teens who read this book:I just couldn't get into this book, it had some dark elements that I thought were unnecessary and disturbing. As it is, I didn't like where the story was going and wasn't really interested in anything that the characters were doing. I didn't feel like the author fleshed out the people in the story, they seemed rather lame and stereotypical. I would not recommend it. This book had an underlining dark atmosphere and unsettling elements that made it unworthy to read.I'm more than a little disappointed. Also, this is the first book I read for class that I truly did not like.It's kinda obvious that the author is trying to write like a teenager would... and it's a miserable attempt. Terrible characterization, awful narration... couldn't finish it. BlahMy son felt the same as the reviews above, he was very disturbed by this book. How it got into his high school library - I DO NOT KNOW. As a parent I followed up and I read through Chapter 12, I myself couldn't finish the book. Foul language, sexual references, perversion, talk about suicide, bad characterization, just too many bad underlying tones to list here. This IS NOT a book for jr. high or high school, in fact most adults would never consider this a book for any young adult.The author clearly made a mistake in description from page 106 to 108. How did it receive a medal?There are far greater reads than this and you should seek them out. PARENTS BEWARE. EDUCATORS BEWARE. SCHOOL LIBRARIANS BEWARE."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"This book was horrible. I admit, since it was a mystery, I read it without putting it down for one whole day.

Beware parents."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"I am adding this book to my 'to painful to read list', it's that bad.

Blah."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"\\"This was the most dangerous kind of lying, it struck me, the kind that was happening to me now - where people need the lie so badly they become convinced the lie is true. It's dangerous because they can tell the lie with so much belief that it sounds like the truth, and they can make other people believe it.\\" - Torey AdamsTwo years ago, before all of this began, Torey Adams was a different person, one of Steepleton High's elite. On the football team, in a band, dating the most beautiful girl in school - Torey was the perfect son of perfect parents living a perfect life in a perfect town. Tthat changed when Chris Creed disappeared. It's not like Torey and Chirs were friends, really. Chris didn't have any friends. He had been the class freak for as long as anyone could remember. He was just that kind of kid, weird and irritating and totally without social skills. Still, as Torey put it, \\"...when a kid sits behind you every day since kindergarten, sits across from you in Sunday school, belongs to your pool, annoys you in Cub Scouts, and throws a thousand balls over your head in Little League, you don't have to like him in order to love him.\\"When Chris disappears, leaving behind only an ambiguous note that could signify either his suicide or running away, people in town - and particularly the kids who have known him all his life - are not terribly concerned. Unlike his popular friends, Torey doesn't see the humor in imagining Chris as a suicide and wondering how he did it and where his body will turn up. He's more concerned with the fact that none of them, not one person who had been going to school with Chris since kindergarten, noticed that he was troubled enough to run away or commit suicide. He accepts, when no one else will, that he and all of his classmates played a part in whatever it was that Chris decided to do. When ridiculous - and dangerous - rumors begin to swirl and everyone in town seems determined to point his or her finger at someone else, Torey becomes determined to uncover the truth.The Body of Christopher Creed is one of the very best examples of a psychological mystery/thriller that it has ever been my pleasure to read. As Torey's interest in Creed's disappearance spirals into obsession, he sees clearly how difficult it is for most people to take responsibility for their own actions in the wake of an event such as this. That difficulty leads many to bend the truth to fit their perceptions rather than to view the world as it really is and not as they would prefer it to be. The Body of Christopher Creed is one of those novels that hooks you from the beginning and then reels you in steadily as the tension ratchets ever tighter. This is a cleverly plotted, wonderfully written mystery that is sure to keep you guessing until the end."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"I liked this book even though it wasn't what I was expecting. I had the idea that it would be a young adult mystery/thriller. Even though there is mystery in there, there was not much thriller. Even so, it was a good unexpected book that sent out a message.The story is about a boy named Christopher Creed who is a bit different from the other kids in his town. Because of that he hasn't made any friends and he gets beat up a lot. Then one day he ends up missing. The town goes into turmoil as rumors arise. Was he murdered? Did he runaway? Did he commit suicide? Fingers start pointing and accusations start flying. One boy named Torey starts to really care what happened to him and starts looking into to it. Not only does he see more clearly into what Christopher actually went through in his life but he starts seeing what others around him have went through as well.I think this is a great book for young teens to read. It makes you look at that weird kid in school a little differently. Maybe instead of picking on him/her, maybe try to be someone for them to talk to or at least understand that they might be going through a lot. Great lessons to be learned in the book and written very well."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"I first read this book when I was finishing my senior year of high school in 2004 and I have made a point of reading it at least once a year ever since.

It's well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"I just completed The Body of Christopher Creed, a six hour read for me, dedicating half of the read to late last night into early morning and then completing it this morning after 5 hours of sleep. I honestly couldn't think of doing anything else today until I finished the novel (I love the \\"quick-sand books\\", which you grab you from the start and leave you sinking). As soon as I finished the book, I insisted my 15 year old read it next. We are, to say the least, book lovers. This story is in your face and full of profanity, which I am not convinced was totally necessary. But, aside from that, I find no other fault and can even forgive the author for throwing the f-word around like it was candy.A word of caution, this is not a book for the young. I recommend it for 15+ and, although it is given a 6.1 grade level equivalent (it is indeed an easy read), it is also rated as \\"young adult\\" and believe that rating should be taken seriosuly.This novel is amazing for a first-time author.

The beginning was a little slow but by the end it was a real paper turner."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"This is a hard book to review without giving away the major plot points.Suffice it to say(if you read the book you'll understand that) anyone who lives in small town should read this book!We all know about bullying and outcasts especially in high schol but as you get older you realize its not just high school there are adult bullies and outcasts too.And in a a small town everyone has a secret.I found this book engaging and see why it won so many honor awards.I would venture to say that everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"It is not a revelation to adult readers that every life holds secrets, but it can be a revelation to teen readers. Introspective Torey Adams' discovery of his small town's secrets makes for an extremely suspenseful read. It works, even with a slow beginning, the use of slang I'm not sure ever existed (turbo-slut?) and some clunky physical characterization that at times makes one expect to hear the theme song from 21 Jump Street come blaring off the pages.It's all forgivable, of course, but as a reader, I particularly wished I could rid my mind of the mullet and bandanna vision of Bo Richardson. Bo also talks like someone from the Bronx, for some reason. But his sweetness and masculine competence are appealing enough that I looked past all that and loved the character.And the characterization of Christopher Creed is so heartbreaking. Does the missing young man have mild Asperger's syndrome? With his professorial use of language, his inability to read social signals, his confusion over what is and isn't funny, he is probably a bright kid with a spectrum disorder, living in the perpetual confusion of a young man who never quite understands how things work socially.When I remember my own school years, my mind lights on a child here, a child there, usually boys but sometimes girls, one child almost every year who stood on the edge of things, wanting to be liked but never fitting in, solitary, irritating people who wanted to be left alone, obsessively working over a specific interest, occasionally having a meltdown. I never had a clue what to do with that fellow student, other than to avoid him.These days, almost every classroom holds a Christopher Creed. Does compassion cost us that much? Was it necessary to have it cost Torey what it did? It seems severe. But I did like the book a great deal. With its hopeful ending, complicated narrating character and message of compassion, it's easy to see why this book remains relevant."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"I was very happy with the speedy shipment and the quality of my book! Thank you Amazon!"},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"This is a superbly written teen novel containing an array of excrutiatingly real characters. Being a teacher of teenagers, I see these kids at school on a daily basis. I've read a large number of Young Adult novels that create cartoony representations of what a teenager \\"looks like.\\" THE BODY OF CHRISTOPHER CREED looks, sounds and feels much more realistic. That is the pillar of this highly engaging story.Multi-layered (theme, plot, character, conflict, tension, and dialogue(!) all excel here), this book does have one HUGE drawback from being one of my all-time favorite YA novels -- the key story is book-ended by a truly disappointing \\"flashback\\" convention that does not work in the end because it psychoanalyzes the story to death(characters, motivations, plot resolution), and thereby detracts from the passionate story it frames. Chapter One works only \\"okay,\\" and would better serve the whole by being dropped (although the first-person narrative is absolutely the right choice). The last two chapters are a mess with the last ten pages or so being an enormous real hindrance to the novel ending graciously. The way Plum-Ucci brings in \\"babble\\" (as I call it) ruins the sense of reader satisfaction with a well-told tale.That said, this book rocks (though the language and sexual nature of some of the sections of this book prevent it from having a wider school-age audience -- I would have loved to use this in class, but social morays prevent that)! I understand that the film rights have been optioned (if Hollywood does NOT end up making a film of this, I swear I will go to film school and then option it myself -- I'm not kidding), but the way to make this film is without celebrities; make a truly small budget film that will focus on the quality of the storytelling and not the production values. With the right director and actors (with Torey's narration underscoring many scenes) in place, this will become a favorite film of teenagers across the country.Excellent, excellent book with an extremely high recommendation from me (with the exceptions mentioned above)!"},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"This book is going down in my personal hall of fame - \\"The Body of Christopher Creed\\" gives us all a look into the minds of people we scorn and point fingers at.

She manages to capture all of the gut wrenching humiliation and heartache that go along with those years. And I have to admit that I was one of those kids watching from the sidelines.

He'll treat you like his best friend, hanging onto your every word, following you everywhere you go, even as you tell him to go away. He'll get up, smiling, after you've punched him in the mouth after saying something totally inappropriate. He's the kid we see at every high school--the one with no friends, who thinks he knows everything, loathed by all and yet oblivious to our hatred.Except Christopher Creed wasn't totally oblivious, as shown by the email he sends to the school principal the day he ends up missing. No one seems to be sure whether Creed was contemplating running away or comitting suicide--all they know is that he's gone, disappeared as if he'd never lived in the town of Steepleton at all.For Victor \\"Torey\\" Adams, the day Chris Creed drops off the face of the Earth is a defining, and life-altering, day for him. Suddenly confused by the way he's treated Creed in the past, ashamed by the pure glee that his fellow students seem to get out of speculating what happened to the missing teen, Torey is disillusioned with his life--and so sets out to discover what truly happened to Christopher Creed the day he went missing.Along with two unlikely allies, a once popular girl now considered to be a [...] and a \\"boon\\" boy from the wrong side of the tracks, Torey has become obsessed with unearthing clues to Creed's mysterious disappearance. As he learns more about the strange happenings in the Creed home, as he becomes convinced that his mother is hiding something, as he wanders the woods looking for a body, Torey learns something about the way the world works--and it isn't pretty.THE BODY OF CHRISTOPHER CREED is an engaging mystery, but it's also a look into the life and times of every high school in the world. The cliques, the drama, the need to belong. The bullying, the hatred, the intense pressure to fit in. Ms. Plum-Ucci has penned a book that goes straight to the heart of the matter--when things are unbearable in your life, when fiction is preferable to fact, how far are you willing to go to change your destiny?A real winner, this is definitely a recommended read!"},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"Christopher Creed has disappeared. He has left no trace of what happened to himself-nothing except an e-mail, which may or may not have actually been written by himself.Victor (\\"Torey\\") Adams is one of the more popular, wealthier kids in Steepleton High School. Sure, Christopher lived a few blocks away from him, and sure, he occasionally insulted him - nothing major. But when he begins to realize he's really the only person who actually cares about how Christopher was, instead of where he was, he begins to dissassociate himself from his friends, and more with Ali and Bo, whose lives were far worse off than his.Along with Ali and Bo, Torey decides to take up the matter of finding Christopher (and proving that Bo was not a murderer, as Mrs. Creed seemed convinced) themselves. However, all this seems to do is make everyone in town a bit angrier, a bit unhappier-and a bit more convinced that the threesome had something to do with Christopher's disappearance.Ms. Plum-Ucci manages to make the novel seem as though it is actually written by a teenager, which is something quite unusual in young adult fiction; along with that, the lives of outsiders in high school and how poorly they are treated by the so-called \\"popular\\" crowd stands out as being true to life.

This book is based upon the disappearance of a seventeen-year-old boy, Christopher Creed. Christopher was known as an outcast among his peers, which is what makes his disappearance more interesting to read about. The vanishing of Christopher haunts the main character, Tory Adams. When the blame of Christopher's mysterious disappearance is placed upon Tory, rumors begin as well as insanity, when his days start to fill with endless searches for him. This tragic incident turns into an obsession of Tory's, and his curiosity leads him into trouble wherever he goes.

If you went to high school, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"An impressive debut novel, most definitely. I was hired freelance to write curriculum guides for this book from a publisher and, quite frankly, I couldn't put it down. Intricately woven, masterful in suspense. Not intended to emulate any of the authors on the market today. Interest group for this novel would be 9th grade and beyond."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"This is the best book! i read it in one night..i couldnt put it down! I cannot wait for her to come out with a new book. I read this book over 3 times I liked it sooo much!!!!!! I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes reading mysterious and suspensful books."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"This book is one of my favorites. It goes into the depths of a small town that from the outside seems perfect. The plot seems unoriginal at first... a small town with a hidden problem. The author keeps twisting the plot so you never know what's happening next. I couldn't put it down and had to read it in one night. Great book, although I wouldn't have expected it from the back or even by the reviews."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"Carol's book is a wonderful coming-of-age novel with very valuable life lessons for teens. Moreover, it is an outstanding page-turner! I read it because I am acquainted with Ms. Plum--I am 40ish. I passed it around to my family members asking their opinion whether my 13-year-old nephew was old enough to read it. His grandmother said no, but conceded that she might be out-of-date. Nevertheless, she absolutely loved the book (age 70). My brother (nephew's dad) read it in one sitting, loved it, and immediately told his son to read it. Thanks Carol for an outstanding effort!"},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"\\"Body\\" was most definitely not one of the best books (YA or otherwise) that I've ever read. I might be missing the point, but it mostly just made me happy I never spent much time wanting to be part of the popular crowd in high school. I found it depressing in the extreme that after all Torey went through (seeing a dead body, being in a psych ward, getting to know an amazingly compassionate outcast - Bo) he STILL treats a non-popular dormmate at his boarding school like excrement - in a scene that seems to be a \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" ripoff -he STILL feels superior because he has friends, musical aptitude, etc. Perhaps the author is to be commended for not slamming the reader with a stereotypical message about become a better person, but I find it hard to believe that Torey didn't change at all considering he seemed to have more sensitivity than the rest of his crowd. He feels a bit guiltier, perhaps, about dismissing others onthe outside, but that seems to be it.Some of the writing seemed awfully clunky, too, particularly in the mental hospital chapter at the end. How can you make someone having a psychotic (?) episode dull? Oh well. The author's sympathies also seemed to lie mostly with the outcasts, so the story might have worked better from their viewpoint."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"The Body of Christopher Creed was a very interesting mystery that I just read by Carol Plum-Ucci. It follows sixteen-year-old Torey Adams as he tries to unravel the secret behind the disappearance of the neighborhood weirdo, Christopher Creed. No one is sure if Creed is dead or alive or where he is, and people are quick to point fingers from the security of their own ignorance.I liked this book, although I wouldn't recommend it to readers under 12 due to some of its content. I liked the writer's style in this book because it was easy to follow; it wasn't slow but it still gave you a good image of what was going on. Also, I found the characters to be very human, in that you could relate to them. I also liked that there were lessons to be learned in this book, but if you just wanted to read something for pleasure without thinking about morals, it worked just fine, too. Overall, I would recommend this book to someone 12 or older who wants an enthralling, somewhat disturbing, yet very interesting mystery book."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"I read this book with my book club in school, and since it was my first time participating, I wasn't really expecting much. But i ended up really liking this book, I thought Torey, the main character was a really great guy, it was easy to feel bad for him and all.So even though the plot was good, there were two things i didn't like. First, this book was for a much lower reading level, and secondly i was not satisfied with an ending.But, in the end, this is a good book for a book club to discuss"},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"In this book the main character, Torey, was a football player with the perfect life, perfect parents, perfect girlfriend, and perfect friends. There was a really weird kid in his school too, named Christopher Creed. He was the school 'Whipping boy' as said on the back of the book. He was pushed around by all the kids in the school. Then one day...he disappeared, the only thing that was given was a note stating how he couldn't take it anymore. Gossip started about how he killed himself or if he ran away, even after the fact he might be dead, people still joked about dumb ways he could have killed himself. Torey was effected and these jokes made him sick. Chris had used his name as someone he wish he could have been born as and it bothered Torey. Then from there Torey's world was turned upside-down as he searched for the answers to what happened. READ THIS BOOK NOW, I PROMISE IF YOU START YOU WONT WANT TO STOP BEFORE THE ANSWER IS REVEALED...OR ISN'T!"},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"The \\"Body of Christopher Creed\\" could possibly go on my all-time favorite mystery book list. The book was suspenseful and chilling from the start of the book to the finish. It was one of those types of books in which I couldn't put down. Every free minute was spend reading this book. Carol Plum-Ucci did a good job in making the book a very intriquing. At times, this book gave me the chills. At the end of each chapter, I was left hanging and wanting to read more to see what happened next. I recommend this book to readers who are especially interested in mystery books."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"This story is quite fascinating in the way that the author portrays a teenage boy's discovery of truth and deception in a small suburban town in Southern New Jersey. It perfectly describes the way that small towns work, and how society and community can often hide within themselves amazing truths of secrets and power.This book tells the tale of a boy, named Christopher Creed, who has gone missing, leaving nothing behind but a laminated treasure map, a hidden diary, and a cryptic last letter to his principal. Torey, along with his friends Ali and the outsider Bo, must find a way to exculpate himself as well as Bo, or else be placed in the ridicule and judgement of his tightly knit community.The most interesting aspect of this book is that it is a quick and easy read, but manages to be incredibly fascinating and exciting. The ending will shock you, since the story eventually becomes an interwoven tale of two outsider's stories and how their lives are affected by the way people treat them.Overall, this book is one of the best I have ever read. It gets deep into people's minds, and exhibits the way that, during a crisis, bystanders and hypocrites, as well as life-savers and virtue are present, no matter what.I definitely reccomend this book.Also reccomended: Monster, Sloppy Firsts and Second Helpings, Harry Potter, anything by Dan Brown"},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"This book takes place in a small town called Steepleton where everyone knowseverybody. There's a boy that lives in Steepleton named Chris who was constantlymocked since he was young and has suddenly disappeared, leaving nothing but amysterious letter. No one in Steepleton knows what happened to him, not even his ownmother. They don't know whether he was kidnapped, if he committed suicide or if hejust left town. Now everyone in Steepleton is blaming each other for Chris'disappearance and Torey and his friends are trying to get to the bottom of this mystery.I enjoyed reading this book because it's suspenseful to the very end. There are somany surprises in this book, I enjoyed reading every page. The characters in this story arecomplex and they have there own opinions about Chris' disappearance.The lesson to learn is you shouldn't be cruel to people because it might not seemto affect them, but it hurts inside. Chris wasn't a bad person, he just wanted friends.Nobody cared about him until he disappeared. In this story nobody wanted to admit thatthey treated Chris badly.I would recommend this book to people that love to read books that keep you onthe edge of your seat to the very end. It was honestly one of the best books I have everread because once you pick up this book up, you wont want to put it down until you readit to the end."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"I read this book for a course I'm taking and I was blown away.

I would reccomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"This book kept me at the end of my seat the whole time! This was the best book I've ever read, and trust me, I've read a lot of them!!!"},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"The Body of Christopher CreedBy Carol Plum-UcciSome of the main characters in this book are, Torey, Ali, Alex and Chris. Torey is the one of the characters in the book who likes to be a good friend and really likes to play music. Torey is one of my favorite characters in the book because he likes music that I like. Ali is an old friend of Torey and his friends. She stopped hanging out with him after she started to have problems at her house. I felt really sorry for her because Ali's mom had ten different boyfriends and all of them where mean to her. Alex is Torey's best friend that he had ever since he was a kid. Alex and I are much alike. We stay true to our friends. Chris is really different from everyone else in the book because he doesn't have friends and he is really annoying.The book takes place in a town that's not that small. It takes place in the present time. I know this because they have cars and they had bands that had drums and electric guitars.The plot of this book is when Christopher Creed comes up missing. No one knows what happened to him and a lot of them really don't care he's gone because he wasn't a person you would be friends with. The whole book is about where Chris could be and if he is dead or alive.I would recommend this book to anyone it's a really good book to read. If you like mystery then this is the book for you. I would recommend young adults to read this book."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"The Body of Christopher Creed was the first book I've ever finished in one day.

Parts of it sent chills to the back of my neck and I had to put the book down for a minute, but I ended up picking back up wanting to continue."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"This is an excellent book for all readers. The book starts in the future after all of the main events have happend. The actual thing you are reading is an e-mail story. I won't tell you why for that will ruin the book. This book is some-what a horror story that is so believable that you won't believe me when I say it's fiction. The whole story is based on the disapperance of a boy named Christopher. The whole high school hated him. When he disappears, Christopher's mother, completley naive of his unpopularity, blames the students of murder...but the students think it was suicide. Who is right? You will read this book the whole way through non-stop to find the conclusion. (I sure did...6:00pm - 4:00am). The book has a fantastic ending unlike many other books of its kind. I completley recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"My book club tries to read one young-adult book a year. As a teacher, doing so also helps me better relate to my middle school students. I would highly recommend this novel to kids and adults alike.

What an incredible finish!"},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"this book kept me going to the very end"},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"The Body of Christopher Creed. This book has alot of twist and turns that catches the reader off guard.The imagery that Carol Plum uses is great. She truly captivates the readers attention and again this is one of those book that is hard to put down. The book is about a boy named Christopher Creed who has come up missing and the note he emailed to the principal who is unable to tell whether or not it is a run-away note or a suicide not. I recomend it. It is a great mystery that keep you wondering what is going to happen next."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"I was thoroughly impressed throughout the first 300+ pages of this book. While there are some small problems, such as the \\"teenage dialect\\" consisting of the slang words of at least three different decades, I felt that its strong theme rendered these smaller elements far less detrimental to the overall quality of the novel. I was really rather shocked, then, when the author's carefully constructed moral dissolved with Torey's participation, in the concluding chapter, in a prank against Leo, an alienated classmate who reminded him of Creed! Only a few pages later, he says of Creed, \\"he was an innocent kid, a victim, and I still have the same feeling I had when I first saw my name in his note. Like I could have shared some part of myself with them...\\" Yet, when Leo's face falls in dissapointment that Torey doesn't want to spend time with him, Torey seems to make no connection beteen this and everything he's experienced and learned in the aftermath of Creed's dissapearance. So, am I missing something? Perhaps the author is trying to make a different point here, perhaps about Torey's own hypocricy? If so, I don't think such a subtle angle is appropriate in young adult literature, as its themes are typically purposefully clear in order to be more accessible to the less experienced reader. I have to think this was simply a mistake on the author's part, but, given the merit of the rest of the novel, I have a hard time believing that, too! I'm only upset because this is, otherwise, a very strong novel. I would really appreciate it if someone would respond to this review; help, please!"},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"This is the second book I have read by Carol Plum-Ucci, and I devoured both very quickly. I read What Happened to Lani Garver about three years ago, and in my recent attempt to pick up reading again, I grabbed this off the shelf (I had bought it immediately after I finished Lani Garver). I am nearly 21 years old now, so the reading is quite elementary for me, but the story line and intensity of the twists and the plot held me close to this book for 3 days until I finished.I can clearly see now the over all theme Carol uses on all her books (it seems, from the reviews I've read of her oter books) but I find it important to talk about these things and let middle school and high schoolers take a look at the issues they deal with on a daily basis. The kids in this story are as real as they come as well and it's easy to relate with all of them on some level.The best part about this book is how every chapter was full of development and adventure. Now don't get it wrong. This is not a murder mystery. Rather, it's about how a small town deals with a mystery, and how in tradegy, people learn to pick their own truths.I highly recommend this book for teenagers, and especially for those who understand what it's like to be an outcast."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"How did I not read this sooner?? Loved the story and the strong characters. Sadly the ending fell short and was WAY too abrupt, causing it to loose a star in my book. HIGHLY recommend."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"Fantastic, excellent, breathtaking...I'd add more superlatives, but I'll stop to tell you to READ THIS BOOK. Plum-Ucci perfectly captures her teenage characters -- particularly the outcast, scorned Christopher Creed. I could go on and on, but believe me when I say the end of this book took my breath away."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"My 16 year old nephew told me about this book. It was assigned reading for his English class and he was telling me about how much he was enjoying the book and the discussions they were having in class about the story and characters. So, I thought to check out the book myself and downloaded the Kindle copy. Much to my surprise I found myself quickly immersed in the book. So much so, I actually finished reading it in just a couple of days (I'm a slow reader).The plot, although not entirely original did have some nice twists. More importantly, I really liked how the book touches on so many key messages regarding truth, lying and how we treat others, even when we think we're nice people. I think it's a great book, but due to some strong language, sexual references and morbidity, I think it's a read reserved for for older teens and adults. Overall it's an excellent read that is especially relevant in this age of cyber-bullying."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"I received the book. It was in great shape.Thanks for being so prompt.I got it in the mail a few days later."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"This book is simply amazing. I hope to see it considered for the Printz Award in 2001. I don't want to give anything away by mistake (just read the summary above) so I'll just say &quot;read this book.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"Having just finished this book, I have to say that it could be a great book, but isn't. It seems to be an attempt at an S. E. Hinton story for the 90210 set. It is told from the first person recollection of sixteen year old Torey Adams. Chris Creed, one of those socially inept kids who seems unaware of how socially unacceptable he is, disappears leaving behind an ambiguous email note to the school principal that suggests he may have run away, or committed suicide. Because of Torey's ability to see situations from multiple perspectives he ends up with a bad rap in his normal, middle class - college bound social crowd, and is suspected of being the accomplice of a \\"boon\\" who some people believe murdered Chris.This is a good story and includes the tunnel vision and stereotyping inherent between our different social strata. It has the good girl gone bad, the misunderstood \\"boon\\" with the heart of gold, and the social elites and adults with blinders and an axe to grind. It is basically a solid story, but has two problems that go together. One is a fault that I find with many books. Computers have made it too easy to write and publish without editing rigorously. The other is that there are important junctures in the story that are so contrived that they are distractions and editing would help a lot.The kids that read YA lit may not always be able to explain it, but they recognize quality, finished works that they get from authors like Walter Dean Myers or Lois Lowry. It would get 3.5, but is being rounded down rather than up because of what it could have been."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"The Body of Christopher Creed was one of the best books I've read so far in school. If this book was a food, I'd have to make it a chocolate chip cookie. It is just amazingly delicious and scrumdiliumptious. Carol Plum-Ucci is a brilliant writer, who has done a great job writing in a guy's point of view when she is a woman. I would suggest this book to any teenager who wants a good book to read that would relate to them."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"High School drama is an excepted thing nowadays. Bullies, preps, jocks and nerds clash socially throughout the year and sometimes physically. Christopher Creed was easily classified as a nerd, but not even that because nerds where excepted somewhere in society yet Chris was not. Creed was a High school outcast who was bullied, beat up and then disappeared. The unexpected disappearance of the young man came as a shock to the town of Steepleton, New Jersey. The last sign of Chris was the cryptic email he sent to the principle the day before he disappeared. A childhood friend, Ali, begins her own investigation into her missing friend since the town seems to take the disappearance as a joke and hallway gossip. Ali begins to suspect Chris's own mother, the military like, controlling and selfish mother Ali believes her to be gets in the way of the truth about whether the Chris is dead or alive. This is a fascinating, story about a boy and town searching for truth and deception. A description of how people hide behind the truth and what it takes for it to actually come out."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"This is a wonderful book about a teenage boy who finds a note from Christopher Creed who has disappeared from his school. He comes to find out that he was mentioned in the note and it is his mission to find Cristopher Creed. This was a very well written book, that was full of mystery. I have read other books like this and they were full of teen angst, this was truely a book that lives up to the teenage status. I suggest this to anyone who is looking for a good read. My teacher caught me reading it in her class and she had me come after school. She said after i finished it, she was next in line to read it. Well as a result i finished it very quickly becuase i enjoyed it so much and i gave it to her. She read it and loved it too. She wanted to buy a copy for herself her classroom and have everyone read it. I have seen some of the people who complain about the language in the novel. This may be a shocker to you but that is how teenagers talk. Its not like you see on TV where they sugar coat everything. Our world is filled with cuss words be it on tv or movies, but my argument is that wouldn't you rather have your child read it in a book then hear it somewhere else. Especially in a book that is so good. I just don't agree with censorship. It's not fair to the author or the reader. This isn't a book for really young kids but i mean i think a teenager or preteen can look past the language and see what the book is really worth. I should know i did. This is a book that is well worth reading just give it a try."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"The Body of Christopher Creed has a lot of potential. Outcast, mystery, small town drama, etc. Carol Plum-Ucci fails to deliver the goods on what could have been. A lot of the book is downright unbelievable, and not unbelievable as in, WOW incredible!, but not likely to happen or horribly researched. A few of the biggies: although the Lenape Indians are from the area near where this takes place, they didn't \\"leave on their own\\" to go to Oklahoma. Google the Lenape Indians, and two seconds later, you can find out that they were forced to leave. Probably by Torey Adams great-great-great relatives. The most egregious of crockery was anything dealing with the criminal justice system. When Ali, Torey, and Bo are brought in for questioning, reality fades and a bad episode of Mayberry RFD (except not funny) materializes. A simple call to a cop would have made this stuff way more dramatic and believable. Finally, can we stop trying to imitate kids' slang? Either do the research or play it straight. Read this sentence aloud to a class: \\"She just needed to dump.\\" Now watch what happens. Dump doesn't mean discuss problems (not in the real world); it refers to your dinner's exit strategy. In conclusion, this book feels like a book that was written to sell books. Want to read about believable outcasts? Get \\"Cannery Row\\" from John Steinbeck or \\"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest\\". They are classics for a reason. This book will never be a classic for any reason."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"This book was the first that my school's book club read. It was rather slow for me and by the time I got to the middle I felt like we should've been wrapping it up. I did get in to the story and it did take me away from my surroundings to the setting the author created. Though it was probably 100 pages long than necessary and was definitely a cliff hanger, the end of the book was really deep and insightful and there were lots of lessons to be learned. However, for as many hundreds of pages as I read, I deserved a better conclusion than that. Even if the main characters didn't find Christopher, I deserved to know what happened."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"I'm not usually into mysteries but this was great.

I had to go home, but I simply Could Not Put It Down, so I read it while driving home: one eye on the page, and one on the road. This goes to show what a great book this is.This novel has all the elements I like: a boarding school, a school outcast, child abuse, a missing person, etc. It's a great mystery and some parts are darkly funny. My favorite scene is when Torey discovers the body in the burial ground. For awhile I believed it really was Chris Creed, though he'd said in the beginning that he thinks Chris is still alive. I think that too, and like to think of Chris out there making his way into the world alone.The characters were very well-drawn. No stereotypes, no cliches. My favorite was either Chris or Ally, I can't decide. That's another thing I like in a novel -- good characters.I've been told this is Carol Plum-Ucci's first novel. Well, if future ones are anything close to the quality for this, then she is going to go far."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"This is a very good book.

This is a great book, you wont want to put it down!"},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"The Body of Christopher Creed gripped me from page 1. It's short, with great twists and turns, and won't be interrupted or put down. In short, it's a great little mystery. Carol Plum-Ucci's treatment of the primary themes - don't judge a book by its cover, and people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones - is sometimes repetitive and heavy handed - but hey, the main characters are sheltered teenagers, so we cut them (and her) some slack.The main point is I couldn't put this book down. I listened to it unabridged on audio CD, narrated by Scott Shina, whose voice and emotion are finely matched to the material.My favorite part was the end, which is slightly chilling. I rewound it to listen again. When it was over I just said \\"wow\\"."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"Speaking as an English teacher of seventh and eighth graders, CHRISTOPHER CREED is a refreshing and challenging book filled with the kind of rich symbolism and personal introspection that teachers can spend hours poring over with kids.Carol Plum-Ucci's debut novel is about a wealthy and popular boy named Victor who hears one day at church that the resident geek-wad at school (do they still call them geek-wads?), Christopher Creed, has gone missing. Not a hair. Not a fiber. Nothing is left but a single email that provides more questions than answers. Victor is a thoughtful kid, which is not always easy to be when your friends are mostly dismissive gossips, and the news is presented to him at a very important point in church: the point where he is wondering about the Christ on the cross.According to history, Christ was crucified naked. And yet, on every crucifix and in every tableau of the moment, Christ is always wearing a strategic loincloth. \\"Why?\\" Victor wonders. If it's okay to show him tortured and dying, why are we all so worried about his genitals?Plum-Ucci takes this interesting theological point and uses it to underpin a much broader social lesson. It is a lesson about the lies people tell themselves, about the lines families draw, and about how ready we are to see the blood on others, without having the guts to open our eyes to their most vulnerable and private places. Creed's disappearance and Victor's stumbling investigation into it cause massive rifts in the town and his school, exposing (to some) the secrets most people rip their eyes out not to know.It's not what I would call a pretty book, but it feels very real, and the characters and their struggles are just as fully realized. There's a lot here to think about, and even more to remember.TO PARENTS: This book contains swear words and also frequent references to sex and alcohol. I applaud Plum-Ucci for doing this. Teenagers, as little as you might want them to know, are all too aware of these things. Any book that seeks to connect with teens on any kind of relatable level can't possibly leave out things like this. These are the tantalizing dangers of youth (and even adulthood) and pretending like they don't exist is only asking for the teens to go out and learn about them on their own. Plum-Ucci's book in no way glorifies these things, but since it is told from the perspective of a teen, it isn't particularly harsh about them either. It's unabashed, is what it is, and rightly so.As far as the slang: some have said that the slang/idioms used by the teens in the book are outdated and lame (do people still say \\"lame\\"?). I wouldn't know about that, living as a thirty-year old in Seoul, South Korea, but I would venture that any book that has authentic dialogue would probably be out of style in a few years anyway. Just a thought."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"I stumbled upon this book in a bundle of stuff handed down to me from a friend. I wasn't even sure it was something I'd like, but I thought I'd give it a chance before I took it to the used book store for credit. I was very surprised at how fast I read it. It's rare and wonderful for me to get greedy for a book I'm reading to the point that I want to put off all other things in the day. I couldn't put the book down until I found out what happened! A quick read worth the attention."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"\\"The Body of Christopher Creed\\" begins in a way that's a bit confusing. It's a bit difficult to keep track of the times (because there are changes). Even so, from the first word, the reader is hooked, trying to figure out what's happened and what will happen next.Christopher Creed, the loser everybody beat on and laughed at, has gone missing. Murdered, suicide, runaway... Nobody knows. All that remains is an extremely cryptic note that nobody can figure out. Torey Adams, our narrator and main character, becomes somewhat obsessed when he discovers he is mentioned in the note. He tries to figure out what happened to Christopher Creed, and gets into a lot more than he expected.There are quite a few excellent things about this book. The first is, strangely enough, the ending. Thoroughly satisfying and extremely heartwarming, the ending is the kind that makes a reader want to return to the book time and time again. Another impressive thing here is the writing itself. Clear, well-done - Torey's voice is one that is easy to follow but still impressive in every way.The best part of the book is probably the storyline itself, and the messages embedded in it. Small towns, discrimination, losers, and parental problems are all brought up and handled easily, in such a way that it's just interesting and fun to read. It's the kind of book that's almost impossible to put down.Truly a great story, a wonderful read, and an important one too. Enjoyable, thought-provoking, and interesting, \\"The Body of Christopher Creed\\" is a perfect choice for teens.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"All of his life Christopher Creed had been considered a freak, the target of the bullies at his school.

I felt like there was no end to the suspense in the plot once she got it started. This book really shows the depths of human nature as people point fingers at something they know they had something to take part in. It all starts out in the small town of Steepleton, where barely anything ever happens, when an outcast kid suddenly disappears leaving behind just a note telling the people goodbye. But, the town turns upside-down as people obsess about the disappearance as no one can decide whether it was a suicide, a murder, or a runaway because there is no body. The main character Torey, decided to take it upon himself to investigate the disappearance landing him and his friends the prime suspects. As you read on you find that a similar experience happened a long time ago but nobody talks about it. I wondered why these people would react the same way to the situation if they already know that the result would be disastrous. I really like the fact that she ended the book openly, so that she makes you believe whatever you want to believe not something she tells you. I also liked the idea of putting a story within a story (She made it so that the character Torey wrote the book by himself in therapy) and the replies to the letters he sent out with the story giving you a different person\`s perspective on the subject of Chris Creed\`s disappearance. The letters gave me insight on ideas I had not thought of about Chris's disappearance. There was a lot of profanity and adult concepts in this book, that some parents would not find the best for their children to be reading, such as murder, psychics, and many other ideas that can be interpreted the wrong way. I would recommend this book to a mature audience who would enjoy reading an unsolved mystery fiction. Do you think he's alive?"},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"I absolutely loved What Happened to Lani Garver, so I decided to check out this book by Plum- Ucci. The Body of Christopher Creed is definitely on my top 5 list of books that I've read (and that's out of a LOT of books, believe me...)Anyway, I won't give away the ending, but when you get there, you don't know whether to laugh or cry, be happy or sad. It's a book that fills you with all kinds of emotions. (Some parts scared the cra p out of me!) What this book is NOT is a murder mystery. Characters don't find and decipher clues, blah blah blah. It's not a mystery novel, which is good.Anyway, I'm a pretty bad reviewer, but I promise, you'll enjoy this book. I couldn't put it down, and it was finished in one day. (It's kind of long.) Even if you aren't a fan of reading, you NEED to read this book. It's not hard to follow, and it's sooo great."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"The Body of Christopher Creed by Carol Plum-Ucci is a thrilling and suspenseful novel. The main characters, who include Christopher Creed, his mother, Sylvia, Torey Adams, his mother, Susan Adams, Ali McDermott, Bo Richardson, and Chief Bowen, come alive throughout the book and bring the reader into a world of mystery and intrigue. The story takes place in a small town named Steepleton in New Jersey.Chris Creed, a teenage boy who many children disliked and considered the class &#65533;freak,&#65533; disappears leaving a note that makes everyone wonder what could have possibly happened to him.Bo Richardson, a tough boy with a history of problems and who had a prior encounter with Chris Creed, is considered to be involved with his disappearance. Sylvia Creed is convinced that Bo is responsible for her son&#65533;s disappearance and possibly even his death.Torey Adams tries to uncover the mystery of exactly what happened to Chris Creed. Torey is a popular, privileged boy who has led a rather sheltered life. He is also a close friend of Ali McDermott, the girlfriend of Bo Richardson.Susan Adams, a lawyer, comes to the aid of Bo Richardson when Chief Bowen tries to arrest him.The book is very well written, and it keeps the reader&#65533;s interest from the beginning to the very end. Does Chris Creed ever appear again? Did he really run away or was it a suicide or an abduction? Most importantly, was the disappearance of Chris the result of foul play? A boy named Digger Haines had disappeared from the same town thirty years ago. Could the two incidents be related? Did both boys just disappear or was murder involved in their disappearance?The book answers most of the above questions. The story shows how the people in this small town are quick to blame others for events that could have been corrected or changed by them. Perhaps if they had acted differently, Chris Creed would still be living in Steepleton. The author makes the story unfold with many interesting twists and turns about the present and the past. One question is never truly answered, and the author leaves the real answer up to the reader. Each person should read this book to determine the outcome for themselves. This book is definitely worth your time and effort."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"\\"Tolerance above all else\\" could be the underlying theme of this fabulous novel. In the town of Steepleton, it appears that tolerance of others is low on the list of virtues, with the town being drawn into separatism based on where one lives. When resident geek Christopher Creed mysteriously disappears, leaving behind an equally mysterious note, what ensues is an engrossing ghost story, bordering on mysticism, with a hefty dose of morality thrown in.Carol Plum-Ucci has a wonderful way with words, though some of her attempts at capturing the jargon of the day falls a bit flat in places, sounding contrived and trite. But that is certainly overpowered by the story itself. I recommend this story as an excellent mystery with no easy answers, and an unflinching look at life in a small town...warts and all."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"What happens when a kid disappears and there is no body, no witnesses, no suspects, no traces at all? What happens when a small town has no one to blame but themselves? When Chris Creed vanishes, Torey Adams, Ali, and Bo Richardson set out to prove that Chris' parents are at fault for his disappearance, whether he be dead or alive, people start to accuse. Torey's mom explains, &quot;Nobody wants to take responsibility. Nobody wants to admit they had a part in it. So, they spend a lot of time pointing the finger, and things just get worse and worse.&quot; I really liked this novel because it kept my attention all the way through, and it wasn't slow at all. Every chapter is left hanging, so it made me crave the next chapter. I only put this book down once, and hated even having to do that. I didn't really dislike anything in the book, but I will say that at times it could be confusing because there were a lot of characters to keep up with. I would recommend this book to ages 14+, but not below that because of some bad language, sexual innuendo, and adult situations. I really felt for Chris Creed and from now on, I'm going to treat the &quot;outcasts&quot; with respect, friendship, and dignity."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"It's hard to know what rating to give this book because the first third of the book was awful. The writing was so immature. It sounded like a totally unconnected adult trying to write like a teenager and failing at it. I really didn't know whether I would get through the book. But I usually like Printz award books. And, after 100 pages, the wannabe-a-cool-teenager speak ended and it got really exciting. I really enjoyed the last two-thirds of the book and it made toiling through the beginning worth it. I'm not sure how connected the author really is with teenagers. I'm a decade shy of my teen years myself, but as a teacher in both middle and high school, the inauthentic language was really a turn-off (as was her lack of computer knowledge)."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"Torey and the rest of his town are stunned when, in his junior year of high school, another junior in his class disappears. Christopher Creed grew up with a very strict mother, a former military officer. She ran his life down to the last detail and made it almost impossible for Chris to have a social life. Chris grew up weird, not quite knowing how to relate normally to other kids. As a result, he was often an outcast, picked on and beaten up. However, no one expected this disappearance.Before he left, Chris wrote a note and emailed it to the principal of the high school. The note talks about his lack of social skills, and states that Chris is about to disappear. The note could be interpreted as a runaway note or a suicide note. The problem with considering Chris' disappearance a suicide is that there is no body to be found anywhere in town. Chris didn't take money out of his bank account, and there seems to be no way to trace him.Mrs. Creed is troublesome. She seems to want to blame her son's disappearance on everyone else, rather than thinking she may have driven him away. Soon she turns on a rough young man with a bad reputation named Bo who once hurt Chris. Bo is secretly dating a friend of Torey's, though, and has a very sensitive and sweet side.Torey soon gets caught up in the mystery surrounding Chris' disappearance. He worries that Bo will be accused of murder if Chris isn't found. Much to the amazement of his other friends, who consider Bo to be lower class, Torey jumps into the investigation, trying to formulate his own theories about what may have happened. But will his involvement implicate him in the disappearance and possible death of Christopher Creed?I liked that the ending of this book wasn't fully conclusive, and I liked how Torey's character changed throughout the story. I would have liked to have seen a little better what the Creed family life was like, though."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"The Body of Christopher Creed centers around the disappearance of a high school junior in a prosperous small town called Steepleton in New Jersey. This boy's disappearance hits the town hard, because no one knows if someone kidnapped him, if he killed himself, or if he just ran away. The only evidence he left behind was an e-mail to the school principal saying that he wished he had another life and he is going to be gone. Christopher was always the social outcast in Steepleton, and classmate Torey Adams can't help but feel a little guilty about not treating Christopher better in school. This book is told from the point of view of Torey as he explains what happens to him as the result of Christopher's disappearance. Torey and his friends can't help but think that Christopher was murdered or that Christopher's own mother possibly had something to do with his disappearance. Eventually Torey finds himself actually being accused of murdering Christopher himself. This book contains a series of twisted events that cause Torey to get in trouble with the law, lose his friends and his girlfriend, rely on the help of other social outcasts at his school, and actually find a decaying body in an old indian graveyard. But, is this the body of Christopher Creed, or is it someone else? This book is an excellent read! It will keep you guessing right from the beginning. Carol Plum-Ucci has a very unique writing style that adds to the interest and suspense of this novel."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"I think that a lot of people have got this book wrong. They write that this book is teaching us to stop pointing the finger. This is right, but I believe that there is a deeper meaning to the book.I believe that the book is mainly about truth and the twisted ideals of society. I can really indentify with the central character when he declares that 'Jesus died naked.' and that we can handle so much violence, but we can't seem to be able to show the truth or handle that we can't."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"Not the best book. I really don't understand all the five-star reviews. It's unrealistic. The character development is weak. The theme is the only thing that gives it strength. But no matter how good the theme is, you still need the other elements to be strong for the book to be good. I don't get it. And I agree with the reviewer who said that the language is not an accurate reflection of how teens talk."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"As a high school English teacher, and supervisor of a student-led Book Club, I loved this book. It is filled with all the elements of High School U.S.A.--cliques, bullies, athletes, populars, not-populars,etc. I liked getting into the mind of Torey Adams and learning his views (and questions) on spirituality, relationships, etc. There is profanity and references to sexual relationships among teens, but I was impressed with the element of teen abstinence and \\"doing what is right\\" as well."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"I found this book to be very good. The reason I thought this was because it has a great story line of mystery, adventure, and action. It also has a great them to it. The theme came out to me as that you can't hang over something for a long time because if you do it will only drive you insane, adn make you mad at yourself and the world.I thought that this book was good and all, but I could'nt really focus on it after about 20 pages. So I read around a chapter or two every other night or so.The easiest aprt for me to read was toward the end of the book because thats when it got really exciting and the mystery startd to unfold.I think that this book is excellent for anyone who enjoys mystery stories. This book is also i think good for teenagers because this story is fiction, but a situation like this book could very well happen to any teenagers life."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"In the small town of Steepleton, the town outcast suddenly disappears. There is no clue as to where he has gone to or to what has happened to him. After everyone has figured out Christopher Creed has vanished, the whole town starts obsessing over what happened to Christopher Creed. The only thing anyone would talk about was how they thought Chris died. The Sheriff's department starts looking high and low for any trace of Chris, but none is found.Then there is Tory, a classmate of Chris who has known him since kindergarten, who couldn't care less about what happened to Chris. Then that all changes when he starts to obsess over what happened to Chris like everyone else when he starts getting annoyed by people who won't stop talking about it. He finds an old classmate, named Ali, who was Chris's neighbor, and he tries to find some clues as to what happened in Chris's house. Then Ali became apart of his obsession over Chris just like Tory, because she wants to somehow pin the disappearance on Chris's mother. Tory, Ali, and Ali's boyfriend, Bo, set out and try and found out what happened to Chris.Carol Plum-Ucci did a great job of pulling me in and making me kill just to know what happened next. the author did a great job too of talking about issues that high school students might face today. I also thought how the majority of the book is an e-mail is pretty clever because not many books are set like that. Tory is writing a letter to someone to see if she knew anything as to where Chris Creed could've gone two years after the incident in Tory's senior year at a boarding school. I recommend The Body if Christopher Creed to anyone, I couldn't put it down. You'll have to read and see what ever happened to the body of Christopher Creed."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"The Body Of Christopher Creed, was a well rounded book that got out of hand sometimes. It was brilliant in some chapters but then totally out there in others. Carol has her ways of getting a kid to read the book by lowering her writings to their level.

I feel that teens everywhere can relate to this book better than most classics we read in school. Not many of us can relate to chasing a murderous white whale in the 1800s or traveling up the mississippi river on a raft with a slave, but this book relates more to our everyday lives."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"This was an excellent book that I could not put down.

But nothing stopped Chris from hanging out with people who disliked him. Chris was so annoying that he was beaten up all the time. Everyone had a story or two about beating him up. Then one day, Chris disappeared.There were many rumors around town when Chris vanished: he ran away getting revenge, he was killed and even possibly he killed himself. Before Chris disappeared, he sent the principal an e-mail from the library computer, saying how no one liked him and how it would make everyone happy if he just left. Torey Adams was one of the people who had an \\"I beat up Christopher Creed\\" story, but he never wanted anything bad to happen to the boy. Torey's name appeared in the e-mail Chris sent to the principal and now everyone thinks he was involved with killing Chris. Adams knew he had nothing to do with Creed leaving, and he doesn't believe he is dead. So Torey decides to do a little investigating himself. He discovers that Chris' mother controlled his life and that he created a fantasy world inside his diary. Torey also found that Christopher Creed actually envied Torey.I would suggest this thriller to anyone in sixth grade and older because of the language this book contains. The Body of Christopher Creed has many twists and turns but I couldn't put it down. I felt like I was there with Torey when he was with his friends getting into fights and when he was sneaking around town and making prank phone calls. If you read this book, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"I thought this was a fabulous book; very suspenseful and realistic. I'm not going to summarize because everyone else has just done that. The characters were very realistic and beleiveable, and so was the situation- kids go missing in high school at least once a year. The only thing that bothered me about the book was that the author used the word 'mutter' way to much, and she used it inappropriately, which repeatedly got on my nerves. But other than that, it was fabulous.Also, why is everyone saying that this book was about treating outcasts nicely? That wasn't what it was about at all- it was about people not being able to accept the truth and beleiving lies instead, and how it's possible for people to become delusional. That was the point of the book; chris is delusional, his mother is delusional, renee and alex become delusional- it's all about people not being able to accept the truth, and how in small towns sometimes people preffer to live a lie instead."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"I didn't know what to expect from this book because it is the first book I've read by Carol Plum-Ucci.

You never know what's going to happen next. I kept reading and reading until I was finished."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"The Body of Christopher Creed Book SummaryBy Dylan SchrodeOne of the best books that I've read all year would have to be The Body of Christopher Creed by Carol Plum-Ucci. This mystery/thriller novel threw many curveballs at the reader, and always kept you guessing. The author does a great job of plotting out the characters and their motives. At the end of the book, she (Carol) tells the reader an interesting fact about Chris Creed that leaves the reader wanting more.All in all, this book is directed for an audience of 13 and up. The book starts out in the present life of Torey Adams, a regular High School student who gets caught up in the mystery of where and why Chris Creed had vanished. Torey is writing his story about Chris Creed and publishing it on the internet so people can read it and respond. You don't know why Torey does this until the last chapter of the book, where Carol wraps up the novel.The flashback of Torey Adam's story begins in his home town of Steepleton, New Jersey. He is an All-American Football star, has a popular girlfriend, friends, a nice car, a good family; all the good things in life. Steepleton is a town that has a reputation of being \\"perfect.\\" Sure, some people are drug addicts; some are flunkees. But for the most part, there aren't any gangs or bad people terrorizing Steepleton, It's just a easy town to live in. Until Chris Creed is suddenly missing.Nobody knew why Chris had vanished. Some say that he committed suicide due to the fact he was the geek in school. Chris was always bugging you about the stupidest things that didn't matter. That's why nodoby really liked him, because he was a huge pest. Others say that Chris had ran away and changed his name to get away from his mother. His mother was in the marines and she never let Chris have any social life. Not one bit. She kept him locked in his room, safe from the \\"bad\\" things, such as cliques, drugs, alcohol, etc.Torey had become more and more interested in what had happened to Chris and decided to start investigating the situation. He accidentally ran into his past friend, Allie, while looking for info on Chris. Coincidentally, Allie was also trying to get some scoop on the Chris crisis. Allie had been a neighbor and close friend to Chris for a very long time, and she had predicted Chris would snap any day. But where did he go was the big question.Throughout the rest of the book, Torey and Allie develop a good relationship among each other and work together to find out more about Chris. Along the way, Allie and Chris meet new people and challenges that all help them in finding out where Creed went. As the book progresses, Torey gives up his jock-like appearance, his relationship with his girlfriend, and even his relationship with his best friends, but will benefit from doing this in the long run.Many lessons can be learned from this story. The message I got from this book would have to be that being who you are is one of the most important things in life, and you shouldn't let someone rob you of your individuality."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"I bought this book to give to my 14 year old nephew and was pretty surprised when I started to read it by the language and dark edge it has as well as the talking about 'doing the nasty' with mention of the sounds etc. All this is alright but people should know that it is a bit raw and cynically oriented (like an adult's book!)."},{"Title":"The Body of Christopher Creed","review":"The Body of Christopher Creed was super!

The story was told in an awkard way. Torey, the main character in the story, looks back on the past and tells it in a way that it seems to the reader like it would be in present tense.Christopher Creed was a kid that everyone loved to pick on. He was the type of kid that got hit when someone was upset or pushed off the bleechers for a good laugh. Then one day he just disappeared with no signs of murder, suicide, or abduction.

My only complaint is that the material does tend to slant towards extragalactic astronomy. However, otherwise the material is extremely useful for someone looking for fresh material to work on. The references also provided within are great. The reading level is also easy, and is probably similar to Scientific American or Sky &amp; Telescope."},{"Title":"Unsolved Problems in Astrophysics","review":"As far as I have been able to see with cross-referencing and my own checks and double-checks, the information in this publication is accurate.

The book wasn't as suspenseful as many of the other reviewers professed, but it possessed just enough spunk to make you want to read it at a steady pace. The end was a little unrealistic and some of the dialogue was a little clich&eacute;, but it wasn't a bad read.

She successfully puts into words those emotions that are all too common to most of us. Surprisingly, she is able to speak not only for the women characters, but for the men as well. Babylon Sisters is a love story without all of the mush. What I liked most about this book was the complexity of the characters - they have layers and the more you find out about each one, the more believable the character becomes. This book would make a great birthday gift to a friend. If you're a fast reader you can finish this in one weekend."},{"Title":"Babylon Sisters : A Novel","review":"I loved this book, on many levels!I'm a white woman in the Midwest, whose reading tends towards mysteries and gory thrillers, or travel- or food-related fiction and non-fiction. I was looking for something \\"different\\" and \\"light\\" to read over Christmas, so a book by a black woman about black characters in Atlanta, dealing with \\"women's issues\\" and immigration sounded interesting. (See the editorial reviews for story line.)The mystery thread was engaging (even without anyone getting murdered!) as were the minor plot lines. I was afraid the \\"single-mother\\" and \\"romance\\" themes might be too sappy, but they weren't.The glimpse of 'black culture' was interesting and \\"natural\\". I liked the characters; you'd be lucky to have them in your circle of friends. It was refreshing to see well-educated, affluent black characters.There were references to books I've heard of but not read, so I'm now interested in seeking them out (e.g., the one that plays in role in the storyline).The author's style was so enjoyable.

It was interesting and I really enjoyed it, I do think that it could have been expounded on a little more, but it was a page turner and just watching everything unfold was good.

I think that Pearl Cleage did a good job on this story and I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Babylon Sisters : A Novel","review":"I loved this book and thought it was a book about women, not black women.

And if Catherine won't volunteer the info, then Phoebe will take matters into her own adolescent hands, thankyouverymuch! If my daughter pulled a stunt like what comes next in the book, I would haul her little behind home (from her exclusive boarding school, where she does whatever she pleases) and give her a good, old-fashioned whooping. The push-over mom is an annoying character, both in real life and in fiction. Grow a backbone. I don't know why this book got so many rave reviews. The first 3/4 of the book is unremarkable writing--nothing that a high-schooler couldn't have written. The last part was the best, with a nice twist or two, but nothing earth-shatteringly brilliant or anything that I will remember 2 months from now. The author has her own agenda to push, and by the end of the book, I was irritated and sick of the whole Sisterhood theme that she kept harping on, like a broken record. She was remarkably like a dog worrying a bone: she just would not let you be a smart reader; she had to keep repeating herself, just in case you were too stupid to get it the first 3 times she said something. She obviously has no confidence in the intelligence of her readers. Also in this book: a woman who rose from maid to successful businesswoman, the plight of an illegal immigrant from Haiti and an investigation about a prostitution ring. By the way, I have not found a new favorite author."},{"Title":"Babylon Sisters : A Novel","review":"This is a mystery,love story and adventure all in one.

Babylon Sisters returns us to Atlanta's West End neighborhood where we find our main character \\"Cat\\" struggilng to raise her sixteen year old daughter, Chloe.I loved this aspect of Babylon Sisters. It's rare to see such a portrait of African American motherhood-- Cat wants to be a supportive mother, comforting her daughter as the girl struggles with her first major heartbreak, only to have the daughter turn the tables. Now, Cat has to navigate the roads into and out of her own bruised heart.While the romantic angle and comedy will rope you in, a reader also gets a look into the world of our sisters who are less fortunate than ourselves. A sub plot involves Hatian immigrants who are exploited and forced into sexual slavery.As always in Pearl Cleage's novel, the characters (and the readers!) must force themselves to think globally. And the real hero is the Cat who saves herself as she saves those around her.Thanks, Pearl Cleage, for once again respecting your readers enough to give us another novel that not only shows your love for our community, your belief in a global sisterhood, but also challenges us to be brave!"},{"Title":"Babylon Sisters : A Novel","review":"This book was very entertaining.

Her daughter, Phoebe, is a bright senior who plans to attend the prestigious Smith College. The only thing missing in each of their lives is a man. For Phoebe it's the father she has always wondered about and just recently gathered enough nerve to ask her mother about. For Catherine it's the only man she's ever really loved-B. J. Johnson-the man who she had a relationship with over eighteen years ago that produced the one thing for which she wouldn't trade anything in the world: Phoebe.When Catherine is asked to help locate a missing Haitian girl named Etienne, she stumbles upon a prostitution ring preying on innocent, unsuspecting immigrant girls. Enter B. J. Johnson, world-renown war correspondent and newspaper man, who is doing a piece on female slavery in America. He turns Catherine's world upside-down while the two race against time to uncover the whereabouts of Etienne and uncover who is behind the exploitation of these girls. Meanwhile, Catherine struggles to find the words to tell B.J. about the daughter he doesn't even know exists. The lies and awkward situations abound as Catherine tries to cover-up the identity of Phoebe's father from her daughter until she has had time to tell B.J.The voice of the narrator, Catherine Sanderson, is delightfully refreshing in a literary world where books abound with run-of-the-mill narrators. The plot while set in modern-day Atlanta encompasses the globalization of our community by considering such timely issues as female slavery, the sexual rights of women, and the never ending battle to keep young girls safe in our own communities. The savvy Cleage even sneaks in a few below-the-radar references to American politics. Bravo to a sister who doesn't live or write in a vacuum!Reviewed by Deborah L.

After that, I was hooked and researched all of Ms. Cleage's works. After reading Cleage's other works, \\"Babylon Sisters\\" was the last read. I was not dissappointed. I appreciate the role of the characters and their place in life. Each character has his/her own story. I also like this piece of work because it introduces a real problem in this world, mainly for women and little girls. Babylon Sisters exposes its readers to the unpleasant world of human trafficking and its effects on family and community.I also like this book because it sheds light on and/or gives alternate views on tough choices men and women have to make regarding new life, meaning allowing new life to come into the world. The main character feels like she is forced to live a lie for the sake of her daughter by being dishonest about her daughter's father. I like the way Cleage bring these lives/lies together regarding the mother, father and daughter.

Finally, I found (another) one! If you remember any of her other works, especially my favorite, WHAT LOOKS LIKE CRAZY ON AN ORDINARY DAY, then you already no that Pearl Cleage tells a compassionate, intelligent story. BABYLON SISTERS is no exception.Babylon Sisters is the story of thirty-eight-year-old Catherine Sanderson, a strong black woman who's making a difference in this world. She's a woman who has dedicated her life to improving her community by working with immigrant women and helping them find jobs and housing in her hometown of Atlanta, Georgia. She has also raised a beautiful, intelligent daughter all on her own, and seventeen-year-old Phoebe Sanderson is finishing her senior year at a fancy, private boarding school and is all but headed to Smith College.But Catherine's peaceful, organized life is due for a few interruptions. In order to pay for Phoebe's expensive college tuition, Catherine takes on a job with a new client - the reknowned, eccentric black millionaire named Miss Ezola Mandeville. (Emphasis on the \\"Miss.\\") But Miss Mandeville, who runs a house-keeping business, appears to be involved through an unsavory business partner in a forced-prostitution ring with immigrant women. Catherine can't figure out exactly what they're up to, or even whether Miss Mandeville is actually knows what her partner is doing to her well-reputed business.At the same time, Phoebe has become ever more curious about the identity of her father, whom she has never met. In fact, BJ Johnson, the only man Catherine has ever loved, does not even know that he has a daughter. When BJ suddenly comes to Atlanta, Catherine is faced with the challenge of confessing to him that he has a seventeen-year-old daughter. To makes matters more complicated, BJ, a veteran newspaper reporter, knows more about Atlanta's forced-prostitution ring than he's letting on. When the savvy criminals realize that Catherine and her friends know too much, the close-knit group is faced with more than family drama. All of their lives are in danger.This novel has everything-good writing and a good story. Smart, intriguing, real characters. And it deals with real issues - poverty, the exploitation of women and children, money, power, greed, secrecy, love and trust. I love Catherine, and I especially love it that she is the kind of strong black women who really is real. She has taken care of herself and her family, and using her brains and her financial assets to do things that matter. No designer clothes or jacuzzis, but a superb education and exposure to the many different cultures of the world for herself and her daughter. And this book is about empowered women, and women empowering women, hence the title, \\"Babylon Sisters.\\" (If you don't get the title now, you'll understand it better as you read the book.) This book is one of the best black fiction novels that I've read all year. Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Babylon Sisters : A Novel","review":"Pearl Cleage returns to the literary scene with her latest book, BABYLON SISTERS, an endearing story about a single mother named Catherine Sanderson. Cat, as she is affectionately called, has been raising her daughter Phoebe alone since day one and has always been there for her. She home-schooled Phoebe, then later sent her to an exclusive private school. As her daughter nears graduation and prepares for college things seem to be great between them - except for the secret that Cat has been carrying for years, the identity of Phoebe's father. When Phoebe takes drastic measures to learn his identity, Cat must face the fact that the truth will be revealed and also deal with the pain that led to the secrets in the first place.Cat owns and operates a consulting business, which she named, Babylon Sisters. Through Babylon Sisters, she has helped countless young immigrant women and saved them from wolves in sheep's clothing. These women often found themselves living in substandard housing with exorbitant rent, being overworked and underpaid, and even forced into prostitution, but failed to notify authorities for fear of deportation. Cat became a voice for these women, not only helping them get out of their particular situation, but also serving as a spokeswoman for their cause. In anticipation of college tuition bills, she realizes she must get a job working for someone else so that she can continue to make ends meet. When one of her speaking engagements results in a meeting with Miss Mandeville, a community icon with a thriving business, Cat believes her prayers have been answered. But things are not always as they seem.This is one of those books that was completely satisfying. Cat narrated the story, but her voice immediately drew me into the plot. I could relate to her insecurities, her good intentions and even her stubbornness. The pacing of the story was superb and there were plenty of surprises. These twists not only added tension, but sometimes they added suspense while others provided humor and irony. I always find it difficult to review a book I really, really enjoyed for fear I won't do it justice, and this is the case with BABYLON SISTERS. The story touched me on so many levels, as a mother, as a daughter, as a woman in a relationship...and the list goes on. I highly recommend it.Reviewed by Stacey Seayof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Babylon Sisters : A Novel","review":"This was a wonderful story. Cleage always packs a big punch with her novels.

Listening to the Cd was fantastic. I was able to picture the novel in my mind's eye. I enjoyed the twist in the book (and I'm not about the give this away - you will have to read or listen to the cd for yourselves). The only constructive cristism I have is that I was a little disappointed by the ending. In my opinion although the story ended on a high - I feel the author could and should have written a chapter about the relationship between Cat and BJ.It was a pity that Sam disappeared half way through the novel; it would have been interesting to hear about his relationship with Ezola.

On the whole however I enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Babylon Sisters : A Novel","review":"Pearl Cleage, in her fourth novel, BABYLON SISTERS, has done an outstanding job of dealing with real women issues through using a combination of the thriller and romance genre. This book is easy reading that takes you on a roller-coaster ride.The story is told by Catherine Sanderson (\\"Cat\\") who, as a single mom, has been raising her daughter Phoebe for 17 years. She has provided Phoebe with a loving home, an excellent education and a warm, but firm, loving \\"modern\\" mother. Through these years, there have been some ups and downs, but that normally happens in any woman's life, whether she is black or white. However, through all the good things that Cat has provided her daughter, Phoebe still has one question that Cat can't answer truthfully, \\"Who is her father?\\" Along with some good things and meeting some trouble people, Ms. Cleage provides the reader with real life situations using excellent storytelling skill.To show you that the book is not only wonderful but has you draw back on your African-American classical reading, there is a reference to a character in a book I read long ago, however; I could not remember the character nor could I answer the question. This made me go back and pick up that book again and re-read it. (Read the book to find out what is the name of this classic African-American book.). Ms. Cleage also refers to some recent issues that will make you think. Her writing brings us bits of our history and shows us that we \\"as women\\" have many options; one of those options is not to give up on our self.Overall, if you want a good read that is written skillfully, READ THIS BOOK. It will take you on a wonderful literary ride."},{"Title":"Babylon Sisters : A Novel","review":"Pearl Cleage's Babylon Sisters is my favorite type of fiction book: one that I can curl up on the couch with and lose myself in for hours.

The story moved along very smoothly, but I especially like the fact that most of the drama was saved until the very end. As a matter of fact, I laughed out loud at the final sentence of the last chapter!I like books where the author pulls characters from a previous book and brings them forward into the new book. Pearl Cleage does that here, with the brief appearences of Blue and Regina Hamilton from her previous book Some Things I Never thought I'd do.If you're looking for a book that is enjoyable, but also makes you think, with a good positive storyline and themes of black empowerment and love for community, this book is definitely a must read!"},{"Title":"Babylon Sisters : A Novel","review":"The title of the story doesn't match its content.

This text appears to be lecture notes printed verbatim, typos, ASCII art, MATLAB graphs, and Microsoft Word typesetting and all, and put into a paperback book. At first glance, when you open the book it isn't very impressive. Akin uses some non-standard notation (based on what I've seen in other textbooks and literature), which to me made it like reading ye olde English...it can be interpreted, but just not as quickly as I'm used to.That aside, I found the book helpful. I studied it on my own to learn about adaptive finite elements. After and undergradute class, which barely brushes on the topic, and after a graduate class (I am in the early stages of my graduate studies), which took the \\"rigorous mathematical\\" stance and made the topic so damn esoteric and impossible to understand, I found Akin's treatment to be \\"just right,\\" to quote Goldilocks. I have a much better understanding of both the theory and implementation of error-estimating in FEA.Akin has a few other interesting chapters...he has a much better treatment on element interpolation that every other textbook I've seen. The examples are complicated enough to be in a FEA textbook but nowhere near useful. The structure of the book is a little confusing, and the chapters are unevenly balanced. In Akin's favor, the book isn't a collection of his papers, like most of the leaders in the field, and it is specifically written with seniors/early grad students in mind.The book is interspersed with FORTAN snippets. The code is well-written (from an educational point of view, but kind of slow and sloppy otherwise), and well-commented. I'm of the opinion that FORTRAN needs to be put to bed, but old engineers won't ever let that happen. I think it would have been better to have code snippets in pseudocode...and by god, put the entire thing in an appendix and highlight important sections via notes in the margin. This isn't a programming book, but at times it seems that the entire focus is on Akin's FORTRAN code. If you're that worried about implementation, get the Cook/MalkusConcepts and Applications of Finite Element Analysis, 4th Editiontext. Akin himself references it many times.So, I think this is one to buy as a supplement to your class textbook. I have yet to come across a decent introductory FEA textbook (I know ReddyAn Introduction to the Finite Element Method (Mcgraw Hill Series in Mechanical Engineering)has a lot of fans, but I don't agree with them). However, if you take bits and pieces from several books (this one included), you can get clear answers to any question."},{"Title":"Prototypes: The History of the Imsa Gtp Series","review":"Best example of the fantastic history of this form of racing...I was too young to attend most of these events but can get the sense of the history that was made by these incredible machines."},{"Title":"Prototypes: The History of the Imsa Gtp Series","review":"There is no better book at any price that covers the IMSA GTP series as well as this book does. Period."},{"Title":"Prototypes: The History of the Imsa Gtp Series","review":"It's a beautiful book and as others have said, if you want to get into the details on race and season results, alongside great photos, it is well worth it as most David Bull Publishing books are."},{"Title":"Samuel Barber: The Composer and His Music","review":"As a lifelong student of Barber and his music, I was thrilled at the depth and scope of this work. It contains many musical examples and, most tellingly, reveals what music Barber loved and was studying when he composed various works. And it doesn't pull any punches in its treatment of Barber's tendencies toward depression and alcoholism. I spoke to Barbara Heyman a few years ago and she said she was working on a companion volume but had no firm idea when it might be published. We can only hope it will be soon!"},{"Title":"Samuel Barber: The Composer and His Music","review":"Well, I thought the book was a respectable mix of biographical information and analysis, not too much of one or the other. It is organized (roughly) by opus number, meaning one can find virtually all the information about a specific work condensed in a particular section--with the overall outline being chronological. This structuring is easy and accessible.Theory hogs, like me, may want a few more examples--but if so, we're just being greedy. The author's analyses of the works are well-done, cursory without being useless. She neither fawns over her subject, nor butchers him. Perhaps a bit more biographical information would be nice--Barber's love life is always touched upon at tangents, never explained. But maybe such information is simply not to be found.The esoteric nature of the subject precludes me from recommending it generally--but for anyone with the slightest interest in Mr. Barber, this is certainly one of the best resources out there.And what do we say of Samuel? Reactionary, fuddy-duddy? Snobbish European turning his back on his American home, or a man who simply recognizes good music when he hears it? Or, like Brahms, a fusion of past and present who only appears conservative when compared with the silly extremists? I lean towards the latter.Barber enjoyed Brahms, and there's a similarity stapling the two together here. Both took a rich harmonic and modern language, Brahms with his soup of pivot chords and chromatic thirds, Barber with his polychords, changing meters, and quartal implications, reinvigorating ideas and forms that some describe as depleted. And both were, in some sense, fearless. Now of course neither was immune to public opinion--the failure of Anthony and Cleopatra cracked off a bit of Barber's heart--but nevertheless, we find two men who by and large did not care to defend their artistic choices. Barber wrote music of lyrical melodic line when the flavor de jure was prickly textures or avant-garde nonsense.I have no opinion on whether or not that was the right decision; but I bestow the highest respect on Barber's intense drive for perfection. 71 years he lived, and left behind a paucity--but a paucity of perfection. The concertos are jewels! The songs are staples (or should be)! Barber forced and tempered his creations: many works were revised after the first performance--and, which is to be respected all the more--usually made shorter by it. Excess notes deleted, and tight statements left behind.This book honors that aspect of him well, and I'm glad to have gotten to know him through it."},{"Title":"Samuel Barber: The Composer and His Music","review":"I read this book with the same excitement that I would a... thriller. It is exciting to find out so much about a manwhose music is among America's best! Barbara Heyman has captured thespirit of Samuel Barber's life and compiled it into a readableorganized format. Be sure to read all of the footnotes/endnotes.They contain some of the most wonderful tidbits of information.Authoritative writing!"},{"Title":"Samuel Barber: The Composer and His Music","review":"This is the authoritative biography of Barber. Heyman is a first rate scholar and has published an incredibly comprehensive work. It covers every detail of his life. It also corrects several inaccuracies of the previous coveted Nathan Broder publication. (Completion dates of several works that have been researched through his letters.)"},{"Title":"Samuel Barber: The Composer and His Music","review":"I'm currently researching Barber for my Masters Thesis. This is the best book available currently on Barber. The variety of information and sources she offers is excellent. In addition to the biographical information, Heyman presents each of his pieces in reference to certain time periods of his life and goes on to discuss these pieces in depth. An incredibly valuable resource for me and anyone interested in Samuel Barber."},{"Title":"Samuel Barber: The Composer and His Music","review":"Based on primary material, this book covers the life and work of Mr Barber, though with more emphasis on the \\"life\\" than analysis of the \\"work.\\" Not exactly a pageturner, but interesting."},{"Title":"Samuel Barber: The Composer and His Music","review":"Being a fan of (some of) Barber's music, I was interested in finding out more about him. I suspect an academic will find this book satisfying - it goes through his works in scholarly detail - but I found it uncompelling. I think the main problem is that Barber was not a particularly interesting guy - you will find no juicy tidbits here. Where this could have been interesting is delving into his personal life - but it doesn't venture there. I was disappointed. By the way my favourite Barber works are adagio for strings (of course), violin concerto, and the school for scandal overture."},{"Title":"Mobilizing Invisible Assets","review":"This fine book gives a good introduction to why you need to consider the &quot;invisible&quot; resources in an organisation, and how to focus on building them. The text is very readable, and far away from typical american &quot;verboseness&quot; in mega-sized textbooks.I think this is a textbook that should be read by all business students, to understand more about the issues of resources and assets that go into the Internet economy and brand management."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Croatia","review":"Finally a travel guide for Croatia. For several years, Croatia was left out of the various larger, multiple-country guidebooks; somehow it wasn't considered a part of Eastern Europe or Central Europe! I have worked in this country for about two years, and recently had the opportunity to explore the coast with the help of this book. The information was excellent and quite accurate, considering a year or more has passed since the publication and much has changed in that time. The only quibbles: some mistakes in the pronunciation guide, and the suggestion that people try swimming in the Drava River, which is polluted--a friend of mine wound up in the hospital for a week after taking a dip. My colleagues and I had to laugh at that recommendation! Like most tourist information on Croatia, the book is strong on the Adriatic and weak on the rest of the country--admittedly, not quite as spectacular, but with some places of interest nonetheless. The book is compact, the perfect size for toting around, and includes lots of intriguing historical sidebars. It will need updating soon, as the country is going through considerable change."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Croatia","review":"Shortly: this is the worst ever Lonely Planet Guide that I bought. I have just returned home from Croatia and this book didn't help me at all. I could have had a 5-pound stone in my pocket and it could have helped me more.Explained: the book is absolutely incomplete because it simply doesn't cover the north half of the country (about half the territory of Croatia). It misses towns like Sisak, Virovitica, Cakovec and it doesn't contain anything about the Osijek castle. I don't know why the writer ignored this part of the country, I suppose she might have liked the beautiful sea-shore better but this doesn't make an excuse at all.Then: it ignores some significant towns near the Bosnian border, like Knin and Sinj, I know these places aren't the most likeable ones but they have a historical significance - these were the cities most affected by the civil war and these places are a part of Croatian history and quite an important one.Moreover: even though she spent most of her time on the shore, what about Novi Vinodolski, Senj, Karlobag, Umag, Porec and the inner Istria? These places are worth discovering and there isn't a single word about them in the book.It is dated, because it doesn't contain up-to-date information about the country. For example: if you drive a car (having a picnic in the countryside) or walking around you should be prepared for mine fields - there are still many of them in the country. These fields aren't on the map and they are near main roads, too. The section on driving is incomplete in another aspects, too. There are also other failures and mistakes that I don't want to list, it would be too long to fit into a review.So I don't suggest anyone buying this book. Try something else. This time Lonely Planet is your worst choice."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Croatia","review":"I used LP Croatia side-by-side with the Rough Guide to Croatia during May and June 2006. I only visited Southern and Central Dalmatia including Split, Hvar, and Dubrovnik.LP Croatia is concise and had no serious inaccuracies but it lacked lots of the context, detail, and history that the Rough Guide provided. If you're just looking for places to go, how to get there, and where to stay I'd get LP. If you want more of a tour guide with lots of bios, background, art & architecture info, I'd take the Rough Guide. If I went again, I'd take both.Pros: Good logistical information on how to get around and where sites were. Good food sections (burek is amazing) and good language/phrase sections(except that the most important words were all buried). Also, did a great job of explaining how the private room accommodations work. Provided good, practical advice on how to get the best rooms, etc.Cons:Maps were sometimes inaccurate--Rough Guide's were generally better. This was largely because of the lack of street signs and lots of small alleys that trick you. GPS would have been very useful.Unusually, I think LP underrated some places--namely Dubrovnik.Doesn't prioritize where to go or what to see. For instance, Diocletian's Palace in Split was covered in graffiti and the city had little to offer.They need a section on \\"If you have to choose\\" between different sites and different cities that tells you which are the best sites overall for certain interests.Bottom line: LP Croatia was a solid travel guide but it could have provided more advice to the first-time traveler."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Croatia","review":"I believe this is the first comprehensive English language guide to Croatia and has been well worth the wait. The author has put a lot of effort into the book, and I especially enjoyed the short special features in boxed text throughout the text. The history is a great guide to a complicated country. I have always been fascinated by this part of the world and I certainly am even more inspired to get out of my armchair and see it now."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Croatia","review":"My husband and I just came back from Croatia and used this guidebook religiously for the past three weeks. We thought it was just great. All of the information was spot-on and the descriptions were amusing and accurate. The author clearly loves Croatia and offers in-depth insight into the country. We particularly liked her choice of itineraries and highlights. Traveling around Croatia is so complicated that we really needed to rely on the boat information. Here again, the book didn't let us down. We checked out a lot of guidebooks before settling on this one and we weren't sorry."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Croatia","review":"Croatia is magnificent country, it possesses an endless ammount of beauty and is a destination that can blow you away with its variety of unspoiled attractions and crystal clear water.Croatia offers travelers a large variety of experiences for all tastes and budgets and is relitively untouched and not overcrowded.If your planning a trip to Europe see the Croatian coast you wont be disapionted! Those were my experiences of Croatia.In my opinion the book is fair but does not do justice to Croatia.The history section does not give a good account of Croatias history and is misleading.Croatians are portrayed very poorly and there is an overwhelming bias against Croatia.I wont point out the many factual wrongs in the history section, but to justify my point the Bleiburg massacre of 200,000 Croatians at the end of World War 2 by Tito's Partisans was virtually overlooked and not mentioned!This is one of the most significant events in Croatias history and its not mentioned at all! Also Croatias struggle and suffering from the Serbian dominated Yugoslavia is not accuratly potrayed.The book shows Croatia fairly well and is very informative and easy to read but is to critical of Croatia. Considering that Croatia endured 50 years inside Yugoslavia (Croatia was virtually imprisoned inside Yugoslavia) and Croatia was 1/3 occupied by Serbian and the 50 billion dollar damage the war caused it is a miracle that Croatia is were it is today.I would recomend this book if you are interested in travelling to Croatia in the near furure.Since there is a lack of publications on Croatia this book will just have to do.I hope the authors fix their mistakes in the next edition and if they do so it can potentially be excellent."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Croatia","review":"Lonely Planet's CROATIA travel guide is worth a look for any traveler going to Croatia, although this 1st edition has its share of faults.Information on Zagreb is pretty limited.

In the meantime, Lonely Planet CROATIA is worth getting, but it can't stand alone for the traveler headed to Croatia."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Croatia","review":"For a first edition travel guide, this book is excellent. Full of useful travel information and historical context. However, Croatia is changing massively and rapidly. It went from communism to authoritarianism to... maybe democracy this year. It went through wars and occupation and is rebuilding every day. It experienced massive migrations and refugee flows. Some of the information in this book (particularly in Eastern Slavonia) was already dated as the book went to press, there needs to be an annual update."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Croatia","review":"My wife and I used this book recently on a trip through Croatia and found it a very good mix of broad and deep, offering plenty of the details we needed for our stay in Split and drive down the coast towards Makarska, as well as great recommendations on what to do and where to go in general.

I do like Rick Steves travel advice just as well so we are using this book as a supplement."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Croatia","review":"The lonely planet travel guide book for Croatia is a very good guide about Croatia but as a lesson on Croatian history the book is sadly lacking.A few examples to illustrate my point: a) In the history section it states &quot;Croation nationalists were rather miffed that Belgrade was made capital of the union, and assassinated King Alexander in 1934 in protest&quot; This comment is so absurd, why didn't the author write that it was a Macedonian that killed the King and that the real reason that the people were feeling miffed was the dictatorship imposed by the King years earlier.b) the author suggests that Croatia has an atrocious human rights record - this is complete distortion of the facts as afghanistan and burma are countries with atrocious human rights records. If this was so true would croatia in the early 90's have had most of the bosnian refugees? It definately did more so than France and Germany. As you can see the facts have been distorted and they do nothing to add value to the book and only cause hurt to the Croatian people who feel that they seem to be blamed for all the suffering in the former Yugoslavia.Thankyou i hope you take my comments on board."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Croatia","review":"This book is a wonderful help to anyone planning a trip to Croatia or as guide book while you are in Croatia.

It is so informative and I love it!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Croatia","review":"I just read through Lonely Planet Croatia and found that it treats Croatia mostly as if it has no connection to the outside world. Thus, despite the opening of Yugoslavia, there is little information on connections with Montenegro, with Bosnia, etc., making regional travel a difficult coordinating task. How many of these heavy tourguides can one carry along on a trip? Say you plan a week or two in Croatia but would enjoy a side trip to Bosnia or a trip into Montenegro. This book doesn't link you with the obvious, nor does it provide much detailed information on arrivals into and out of the country. As with most Lonely Planet tourguides, one must buy individual maps to supplement getting from place to place. For example, I was looking for boats, speedboats and ferries from Italy to Zadar, but aside from mentioning the Croatian telephone number of only one company, no departure/arrival times, rates, a website or other information was was provided.I'm going to give this guide the travel guide racism award of the year for its sidebar on Vlasi (Vlachs/Morlachs in the guide). It suggests that beating women was a regular feature of Vlach culture, suggests that the religious sistership (there is alos a brothership ceremony) of the Orthodox Church was for the formation of lesbian relationships in lieu of marriage (Such bloodbrother and bloodsister ceremonies, still in use today, link friends for life, are completely platonic and were often used for inheritance and political reasons - it brings another person into a family, i.e. literally makes a sister or brother of someone unrelated). The Vlasi are a nomadic and semi settled peoples of great antiquity in the Balkans and Eastern Europe with a great mercantile heritage, speak several related ancient latin-like languages, and, with the Illyrians, form part of the ethnic substata of Croatians although some Vlasi still exist today.More than that, the editor suggests that the term Morlach means Black Vlach becuase the skin color of Vlasi was supposedly darker than Croatians. Where she got this additional piece of racism is unfathomable, but the term actually derives from the Greek term Mavrovlahoi, as differentiated from the Kutsovlahoi and other Vlach groups in Greek. The mavro in this case is derived from a period of time in which these Vlasi were either famous for their black wool and/or carried black banners, the banners forming reasons why groups tended to be differentially called as White, Black, Red or Blue or other colors peoples in the early Christian to Middle Byzantine/early Islamic period documents. (cf. also banner terms of these sorts for various unrelated Turkic and Mongol tribes, among others.) It is interesting to note in this regard that Croatians as a people are listed in wrtings from 7th century Byzantine sources as being divided into a Black Croatians group and a White Croatians group. And they carried banners reflecting this.All in all, the book would not have suffered from the author attempting forays into areas in which she was basically unschooled if she had used printed space for more detailed information on the country."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Croatia","review":"Published by the premier travel guide publisher Lonely Planet, Croatia is a thorough, enjoyable, and superbly presented 320-page portable pocket guide to the richness and diversity of a great European nation steeped in history, culture, and ancient traditions.

So the ladies, headed by Cleopatra and Queen Elizabeth, took the opportunity to trespass. While they were playing pool below decks, the pirate Captain Kidd and his crew, unaware that the ladies were aboard, hijacked the boat and set out for Europe so they could do some looting.As The Pursuit of the Houseboat opens, everyone is discovering what's just happened. When the men realize that the boat is missing, they have no idea how to find it but, fortunately, Sherlock Holmes appears and offers his services. Meanwhile, the pirates and the ladies are shocked and horrified to find themselves sharing the houseboat. The rest of the plot involves the pirates and the women trying to outwit each other.The Pursuit of the Houseboat is more fun than A House-boat on the Styx -- it doesn't feel quite so much like a series of history lessons. There is still some slightly clunky humor that depends on understanding the historical allusions (e.g., Delilah is asked to fetch her scissors so she can cut the rope holding the anchor, and Queen Elizabeth tries to be discreet about her relationship to Sir Walter Raleigh), but The Pursuit of the Houseboat actually has an entertaining plot as Captain Kidd and his crew try to deal with the women. The more ancient men (those from earlier times, I mean) think this will be rather easy to do, but the modern men scoff and explain that women are different than they used to be and are not going to let themselves get pushed around by pirates. (This was written in 1897 -- good for you, Mr. Bangs -- I wish you were writing paranormal romance novels today!) Sure enough, the ladies of Hades (sorry, I couldn't resist) are up to the task!A House-Boat on the Styx and The Pursuit of the Houseboat are available on Kindle in the Halcyon Classics edition, which contains 48 works by John Kendrick Bangs for (at this writing) only $1.99. Both books are rather short and easily read in an afternoon."},{"Title":"Mrs. Jeffries Appeals the Verdict (A Victorian Mystery)","review":"In this installment in the Mrs. Jeffries mystery series, Smythe's friend, Blimpey Groggins asks Inspector Gerald Witherspoon's household staff, to investigate a murder. His friend, Tommy Odell, has been found guilty of killing a woman and is scheduled to hang for the crime in a few weeks, but Blimpey is convinced that Tommy is innocent. The staff agrees to help, but they realize it's going to be difficult to find clues in a case that is considered already solved. To complicate things further, it wasn't Witherspoon's case; it belonged to Inspector Nivens, Witherspoon's nemesis. Mrs. Jeffries and the rest of the staff have their work cut out for them if they wish to save an innocent man from hanging.Emily Brightwell has done it once again. Even after writing over 20 Mrs. Jeffries books, she manages to keep the series from going stale. Having the staff investigate a murder that is considered already solved was a great plot device and worked well. It also ups the animosity between Witherspoon and Nivens and opens up lots of possibilities for plot developments in future books in the series. What makes this series so good is how the characters continue to develop in each book and especially Inspector Witherspoon in this book. Some fans of the series will be disappointed that there's no Luty and Hatchet in this entry, but there is plenty of Ruth Cannonberry in exchange. It was also nice to see more of Blimpey and Brightwell adds a neat twist at the end of the book to make his character even more likable. The mystery is nicely plotted and while I thought I knew who the murderer was, I was pleasantly surprised to find out I was wrong.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Mrs. Jeffries Appeals the Verdict (A Victorian Mystery)","review":"Mrs. Jeffries and her band of amateur investigators are racing the hangman in the latest entry in this series. And they are at a disadvantage because the case was not handled by their own Inspector Witherspoon. Worse yet, the case was investigated by the dread Inspector Nivens, an ambitious detective who envies and despises Witherspoon.Late one night in an apparent street robbery, Mrs. Caroline Muran was efficiently shot to death and her husband was hit in the head. Soon after the crime, pickpocket Tommy Odell was found to have pawned Mr. Muran's pocket watch.After an investigation by Nivens, Odell was convicted of the murder and scheduled to hang. But a friend of Odell's mother doubts his guilt and asks the Witherspoon household's servants for their help - just a few days before the execution date.Others have doubted the thoroughness of Nivens' investigation. When the victim's brother - thought to have died in the US - turns up alive and well in London and asking questions, the investigation is reopened. Nivens is livid - and then he's beyond rage when the reopened case is assigned to Witherspoon.The victim was a good woman who ran the family business well and cared for the welfare of the workers. Mrs. Jeffries and her crew must sort through facts implicating people who had business or personal reasons for wanting her dead - and find the killer before more deaths occur.A strong book in the series. We don't see Luty or her butler, but the lovely and spirited neighbor Ruth Cannonberry lends her talents to this investigation."},{"Title":"Mrs. Jeffries Appeals the Verdict (A Victorian Mystery)","review":"Even though we don't get to see Luty or Hatcher in this book, it is still a very entertainlng book. In it we have Mrs. Jeffries and her crew trying to stop a hanging of a man convicted of murder. They are convinced that the man is innocent of murder, and they have to work against the clock to prove it. This series continues to remain fresh and new, and I look forward to each book."},{"Title":"Mrs. Jeffries Appeals the Verdict (A Victorian Mystery)","review":"I adore this series; indeed, it is one of my all time favorite cozy series ever, as it combines my two loves: Victorian England and a cozy mystery. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the author drops a huge clue - almost a giveaway - in the first few chapters as to who the killer is. In the previous books, I've always been surprised at the killer's identity when it is finally revealed, but in this one, Brightwell practically gave it away fairly early on.Other than that, I enjoyed the book. The staff at Upper Edmonton Gardens have become like family and Brightwell is superb at painting a vivid picture of Victorian England. Even though Luty and Hatchet weren't there, we got to see more of Ruth Cannonberry.Overall, this is a great book that fans of the Mrs. Jeffries series are sure to enjoy."},{"Title":"Mrs. Jeffries Appeals the Verdict (A Victorian Mystery)","review":"I enjoy these cozy English mysteries.

I think I shall read it again now that I have found it."},{"Title":"Green Mansions: a Romance of the Tropicla Forest","review":"JB Priestly wrote a book about time ('Man and Time') and in it he referred to a WH Hudson novel called 'A Crystal Age'. His couple of paragraphs about 'A Crystal Age' stimulated my interest but nowhere could I find the novel he referred to. However, I did find 'Green Mansions' and I have read it several times. It is a beautiful novel with an undertone of darkness (is death the darkness that we all live with during the beauty of life?). Perhaps 'Green Mansions' disappointed me a little after triggering my romantic nerve. I did, however, keep exploring the writings of WH Hudson - 'Long Ago and Far Away', 'The Purple Land', 'Idle Days in Patagonia' and the wonderful 'A Shepherd's Life'.On a recent trip to the States I visited a small specialist bookshop where it was suggested I might be able to get access to 'A Crystal Age' through abebooks.com. This was great advice. I have just finished reading 'A Crystal Age' and I concur with JB Priestley's assessment. 'A Crystal Age' is worth the effort of pursuing - it is a surprising first-person utopian novel in which Hudson's love of nature does not render him oblivious to the fact that there are downsides in all worlds - all imaginable worlds. Just like the dark shadows in 'Green Mansions'. The end of 'A Crystal Age' is so surprising - I believe very few readers would see what is coming - I certainly didn't as I rushed on towards it. There is a certain illogic to the ending, but there is also something that haunts me continuously. I hope the illogic has not been a contributing factor in this novel's failure to be reprinted. But why else has it not been picked up - I am sure there is a market.'A Crystal Age' is a stronger less romantic novel than 'Green Mansions', but it is also exceptional for many reasons. I don't hesitate in recommending 'Green Mansions' but I also urge readers to pursue 'A Crystal Age' - it is only a matter of time before I will be re-reading it myself. As for publishers who are looking for books from the past to reprint - give 'A Crystal Age' a look."},{"Title":"Green Mansions: a Romance of the Tropicla Forest","review":"My mother having read this book sometime before I was born in the 50's, was so moved that she named me after Rima.

Mr. Abel is vulnerable to his new environment's treacherous heat, its indigenous wildlife, the cruelties (as well as the hospitality) of its native peoples, and suffers periods of disease and starvation.Mr. Abel falls in love with a strange, beautiful, and exceedingly elusive young woman, named Rima, who has a rare affinity with nature and its creatures. Rima, whose mysterious family background figures strongly in the plot, is raised by her grandfather, Nuflo, after her mother dies. Mr. Abel accuses Nuflo of hypocracy, but eventually comes to respect him. Mr. Abel, despite his background and personal attitudes, learns to adapt to and eventually to accept nature on its own terms. As frightening and disturbing as many of the parts of this extraordinary book are, it is never less than mesmerizing."},{"Title":"Green Mansions: a Romance of the Tropicla Forest","review":"There are so many books to read, I hardlyever read any twice. After having GreenMansions stay in my mind since Jr. High, Iread it again in college. It was stillmysterious, wonderful, and romantic. Irecommend it to everyone over 12 years old."},{"Title":"Green Mansions: a Romance of the Tropicla Forest","review":"Green Mansions has become one of my favorite books. Hudson's incredibly detailed description of the dense forests in Venezuela is amazing, and the love between Abel and Rima is very touching. Rima's symbolism gives the book so much meaning, that will stay with the reader forever. I love it!"},{"Title":"Green Mansions: a Romance of the Tropicla Forest","review":"This book was most interesting, but also unusual. Definitely held my attention, but I did not like the ending at all. I guess I'm just an \\"everything works out for the best\\" ending kind of person!"},{"Title":"Green Mansions: a Romance of the Tropicla Forest","review":"I read the Classic Comic version of this book many times when I was a kid. I've only now just read the original and found it's haunting beauty lingered in my mind for the last 2 weeks. The description of Abels mental travails at the end of the book is a particularly memorable and inspired."},{"Title":"Green Mansions: a Romance of the Tropicla Forest","review":"I had heard of this book as it was an inspiration to scientists and travelers to the tropical forests of South America. I was intrigued by the book and ready for it's adventure. As I read the book despite my problems with suspending disbelief (I usually prefer non-fiction) I found myself wrapped up in it for several evenings. The story is absorbing and descriptions and writing excellent.Although one of the main characters is a mythical \\"bird woman\\", Rima, I continued on with the story, seduced by both her fragile beauty, her unusual history and predicament. I also enjoyed the enthusiasm and insight into the forest and it's people provided by the Abel the story's narrator and main character as he travels from the city on the coast to the interior of the continent and depths of Amazonia.Although this is a Victorian-era novel, it is not a difficult read, and it is a notable and well worthwhile book. A good non-fiction companion to this is Wade Davis's \\"One River\\" an account of ethnobotanists in the South American Andes Mountains and Amazon forests."},{"Title":"Green Mansions: a Romance of the Tropicla Forest","review":"Green Mansions starts off well, and the story picks up in the final third of the book, but in between the narrative falters to the point that I was tempted to abandon the book, something which I don't often do. The protagonist, Abel, is not particularly likable -- which I don't believe was the author's intent -- and even allowing for the time period in which the book was written, Abel displays a surprising degree of condescension towards the natives and white men alike on whose hospitality he often depends. My general dislike for Abel made Green Mansions all the more difficult to stick with through its protracted longueur. The religious/eco-mystical aspects of the novel, however, are intriguing, and the writing is lush and evocative. I don't regret the time invested in reading Green Mansions, but it's extremely unlikely that I'll ever feel a need to revisit the book."},{"Title":"Green Mansions: a Romance of the Tropicla Forest","review":"I am really shocked to see this book rated so highly and raved as a \\"classic\\", I find it incredibly boring and full of prejudice.*** SPOILER ALERT ***For the record, around the same time, I also read W.H. Hudson's \\"Far away and Long ago\\" which I really like and will give a 5-star rating, but I must judge this book by its own merit and not by my opinion of the author.To start, the story in this book is rather boring. Nothing really happens. Our hero, Abel, because of some misfortunes ended up living with some native tribes (\\"Indians\\"). One day he wanders into a forest and heard some bird-like noise. Eventually he found out this to be from a pretty girl (Rima) the only survivor of a lost race. Abel accidentally reveals the girl's ancestral grounds and together with the girl's adopted \\"grandfather\\" they set out to go there. They got there but did not find the girl's people, confirming Abel's theory that they are extinct. Then the girl decides to go home first and was killed by the Indians (the tribe that Abel initially lived with). Abel finds another group of settlement people to wipe out the entire tribe of Indians, and carries the Rima's ashes to the coast.But really, there is nothing much happening here, especially between Abel and Rima, and the descriptions of Rima is all idealistic and superficial. What's more, the author's (Abel's, as the book was written in first-person from Abel's perspective) attitude towards Indians is full of prejudice -- they are indolent, lazy and devious. The author's attitude toward the girl's adopted grandfather is also very mean-spirited. As described in the book, the old man rescued Rima's mother, then brought up Rima, and did no evil deeds (although he may have had some in the past), which is really a remarkably noble act, yet Abel always looks down on him contemptuously and snobbishly. To avenge Rima's death, Abel's action is nothing short of ethnically cleansing (the entire tribe, which hosted and fed him, was completely wiped out). This is simply deplorable.Of course, I understand we cannot judge a book written more than 100 years ago by today's standard -- I fully understand that. But even by literary standards, I find this book severely flawed."},{"Title":"Green Mansions: a Romance of the Tropicla Forest","review":"Those of you who have read Rand Johnson's &quot;Arcadia Falls - A Fable&quot; will find interesting parallels here, albeit in a Victorian idiom, as Hudson presents a moving and mysterious romance against a backdrop of great natural beauty, in this case the South American jungle."},{"Title":"Green Mansions: a Romance of the Tropicla Forest","review":"I loved this book many many years ago and was just as enchanted this time! Somehow it speaks to my inner senses and dreams,and has alot to teach us about human love and love of our mother earth."},{"Title":"Green Mansions: a Romance of the Tropicla Forest","review":"This novel which is uncharacteristic of Hudson,disappointed me because it resembled a romantic work of a lesser author. Perhaps Hudson didn't know personally the area of the Venezuelan rainforest to the degree he knew Argentina and Uruguay, and used the findings of the early explorer von Thurm, who studied the many indigenous people of the Guianas. It came over as repetitive and a bit like watching a modern romantic film on jungle life.The famous film \\"Green Mansions\\" of the fifties with Audrey Hepburn and Anthony Perkins is decidedly agonisingly horrendous, but I would much rather read Hudson's naturalistic books on the pampas and the gauchos which belong to a historical reality, even though now seemingly romanticised."},{"Title":"Green Mansions: a Romance of the Tropicla Forest","review":"Excellent book.

At times as I read, I am reminded of some of Joseph Conrad's profound works, except Joseph dealt little with the topic of love."},{"Title":"Green Mansions: a Romance of the Tropicla Forest","review":"The ending was great! Everything else is pretty much described by the previous reviewer."},{"Title":"Green Mansions: a Romance of the Tropicla Forest","review":"I first read this when I was 13 or 14 and never forgot the story. I just reread it 40 years later while vacationing in Central America, the perfect place for a tale of the rain forest. The language is exquisite - not a quick read, for I wanted to absorb the beauty of the descriptions and details. I recommend this to anyone with an interest in nature, for it is not only a wonderful love story, but also a vivid description of the Venezuelan rain forest and its indigenous people."},{"Title":"Green Mansions: a Romance of the Tropicla Forest","review":"If someone were to describe the entire feeling that explodes from this book, it would take an entire century. The emotions of the characters were undescribeable. They just poured right off the page. Not all love stories have page after page of adrenaline pumping literature. As the main character chases after his secret admirer, she leads him further and further into her invisible trap of love. Then the secret begins to unfold."},{"Title":"Green Mansions: a Romance of the Tropicla Forest","review":"The main male charachter has reason to leave civilization and travels far into South American jungles, meets with native tribes, and finds one which takes him in. They all seem happy with him until his curiosity gets the best of him, and he goes to a 'forbiden forest' so feared by this tribe he becomes ostricised for having been there.In the second part of this book he befriends a mysterious girl who lives in the forest and seems more farie than human. He finds himself doing things for her which he would have never thought he would do for another person.This is a clasic love story, intriguing, beautiful, and tragic. This was one of my first introductions to the classics of lliterature, and prompted me to find and read more of classic literature which has greatly enriched the scope of my reading experiences."},{"Title":"Green Mansions: a Romance of the Tropicla Forest","review":"Hudson, a noted naturalist during the Romantic/Victorian periods, grew up in the wild Pampas, and this book reflects a fascination with nature that most likely began during his childhood. Themes of civilzation vs. savagery and the untouched beauty of the tropics vs. development are found throughout Green Mansions, but these issues are encased in a love story that holds notes of mystery, fantasy, and romanticism.While the novel provides a good introduction to the naturalist writings of this period (and a much easier read than most of the more scientific prose being written at the time), I thought that the ending was not as developed as the rest of the book, in addition to being highly unsatisfying. The novel does, however, offer wonderful descriptions of the wild forests of the region, and develops fantastical characters, particularly in the case of Rima, the primary female character."},{"Title":"Green Mansions: a Romance of the Tropicla Forest","review":"William Henry Hudson's novel Green Mansions is an exotic romance that takes place in the South American rainforest. The novel is written from the perspective of Abel, a young man who had to leave the city he was living in for political reasons. During his time in the rainforest he meets Rima, who he describes as a bird-like girl, and her grandfather Nuflo. Despite these two, Abel mainly interacts with the Indians with whom he was living before he met Rima and Nuflo. The Indians are mostly referred to as savages.Green Mansions mainly focuses on the intimation of love and death, and the romanticism of nature versus the disturbing influences of civilization. However, Abel does not see any living creature during his stay in the rainforest as equal to him. He thinks of himself as superior to the Indians, Nuflo, and to Rima as well. He bases his sense of superiority on a better education, a greater intelligence, as well as a better physical condition. This sense of superiority is kept throughout the novel. However, his arrogance is one way to deal with his insecurity about many situations. Abel only seems to feel secure if he sees himself as superior to everybody else. This is the reason why he defines superiority based on the situation. Sometimes superiority is referred to as greater intelligence and in other cases as physical superiority.

It should be &quot;Data analysis using Matlab&quot; or perhaps &quot;Data Analysis in the Physical Sciences using Matlab&quot;, since the material is quite general and the book will be useful to many folks outside Earth Science.Matlab is fast becoming the lingua franca for data analysis in many branches of physical science and engineering. How far it will spread beyond this domain is a question. It remains to be seen whether biologists, psychologists and the like, will give up their point/click interfaces. And at the other end of the scale, high-level users will continue to eschew matlab for more application-specific languages (e.g. S+ and R for statistics) and more efficient languages (e.g. fortran for ocean-modelling runs that take months of CPU time). However, there is a vast range of users who find that matlab is a tool that fits the hand well. You'd be hard-pressed to find a physical-science laboratory without well-thumbed Matlab manuals scattered among the fortran manuals and the tables of integrals.Until recently, the problem with matlab has been a lack of good books telling how to use it in real-world applications. Matlab usage has spread mainly by word of mouth. That's terrific for high-level researchers since any form of communication (even about silly syntax errors) may very well lead to fruitful collaboration. But it's not so good for students, who need texts that start from the ground up, using matlab at every stage. Why should students learn data-analysis techniques from textbooks that are &quot;language-neutral&quot;, when they are most likely to be using matlab when they enter the research community? Wouldn't it make more sense for them to learn about fast fourier transforms, fractals, etc., by actually doing computations instead of reading about computations, by actually drawing graphs instead of looking at them?All of this makes me wonder why the market hasn't been flooded with great books about using matlab in science. But it hasn't.Middleton's book thus fills an important gap. In it you'll read a bit about probability, regression, principal component analysis, cluster analysis, time series, spatial mapping, fractals, etc. In other words, Middleton touches on many of the tools and techniques that are used daily in the physical sciences. The key is that he gives matlab examples of all that he does. (As you'd expect, these are on an enclosed floppy disk.)His approach is long on example and short on proof, and many readers will like this. I am a professor, and I'm not sure that I'd be happy using this book alone in a course, because of the &quot;short on proof&quot; aspect. But I may be an old fuddy-duddy. And, it must be admitted that a lot of science today is of the &quot;hey, let's try this cool technique in our field&quot; variety. (Who, of a certain age, has not seen catastrophe theory, chaos theory, fractal theory, wavelet theory, etc., wash over our fields like waves upon an unwet beach?)I am certain that Middleton's book will find a comfortable place on my bookshelf, right near my elbow, and that I'll be recommending it to students and to fellow researchers. It's not complete, and it's not as deep as I'd like, but it covers a lot of ground and it does it in a highly practical way. But it will get you up and running quickly, letting you focus on applying data-analysis techniques to your work and not on developing the techniques. Hey, even the point-click crowd would do well to glance at these pages!"},{"Title":"Data Analysis in the Earth Sciences Using MATLAB","review":"Being a graduate student, I don't much like this book. The theory description is not nough, and there're some mistakes in the Matlab programs.

A lively 18 year old has adventures no one could quite imagine when she leaves behind her sheltered existence to teach school out in the dust, wind, and sun parched plains of West Texas. For every step taken forward, Lucinda Eliza Richards becomes aware of the detours the must take to get there. Nature and humanity are ruthless and capricious and the plethora of obstacles and hardship is occasionally overwhelming. A very frank and fair look into these lives and times. Well written and honest."},{"Title":"The Train to Estelline","review":"This first book in the trilogy is the only one written in &quot;letters home&quot; form. I found Lucy's character to be real and believable. I could actually picture West Texas in the early 1900's. If you're looking for an action-packed suspense novel, this isn't the book for you.

It details the life of a young woman in 1911, facing the changes that come both in her life, and to the lives of the people she comes to care for and love. It is the details that ring true, the differences in stations in society, the hardships faced by families, and the expectations on a young , single woman.

Both are delightful. The letter/diary style of TRAIN chronicles the life of a young woman leaving home to begin her teaching career at the turn of the century.

Being a native of west Texas, I can assure you that the characters, both good and bad,ring true as stereotypes of rugged Texans at the century's turn.

What we had instead, was a series of thefts, double dealing, prostitution, murder, child abuse, and manipulative people. I don't need a book for this. Our newspapers and country lyrics are filled with the disappointment, heartache, and lowlife depicted in the book. It is a page turner, but for the wrong reason. I read the book to see how the author would write her way back to anything resembling good story telling.

However, if you want to get started coding solid ColdFusion programs, and develop your general knowledge of the basics of ColdFusion, this book is great.

The concepts taught are sort of scattered throughout the book and there appears to be no consistency in the order of topics covered throughout the Chapters.There is no real coverage of ColdFusion syntax, which is something essential to a beginner of any language. Although, general syntax that is required to complete tutorials throughout the book is given, it is not presented in a fashion that a beginner can truly grasp and follow. But those with a background in some web programming language will be able to pick up the concept that was intended to be taught. I should still note that a beginner will still be able to complete the tutorials throughout the book. But the order of the topics and the manner in which they are presented and discussed does not appear to be the best methodology for the absolute ColdFusion beginner.Although I still recommend this book to any web programmer who is interested in ColdFusion, if you are looking for a book to introduce you to ColdFusion, its syntax, etc., this may not be the book to buy.

Ernestine Hayes, a Lingit woman born into the Wolf House of the Kaagwaantaan clan shares an intimate glimpse into the very heart of the spirituality of her grandmother who cautioned her to listen, \\"To her words, to the wind, to the trees and the sounds in the night.\\" The legends, dreams, stories of home and survival are at once poetic, lyric, humble, and fierce. A first read revealed a complex story of loss, racism, a prodigal life \\"wondering in a dark forest called California, and a humble home coming, awakening and remembering who she is. A second read revealed a woman so rooted to the land, language, stories, and culture that she could not escape home, even though she did, in fact, leave home for 25 years, because home, the language, landscape, and legends of the Lingit people, were imbedded in her very bones and nature.This is a braided memoir that weaves strands from Ernestine's life and extended family, Lingit legends, the Lingit teachings of the grandmother and mother, dreams, and the tale of Tom into a cohesive narrative that doesn't shy away from the hard stuff--racism imbedded in the churches, government, schools, and white culture and the effects of alcohol, suicide, and homelessness.

Things like:1)what was it that cause Lucifer to stumble and fall out of favour?2)How did all these evil practices in the world come to being?3)Where did the concept of hell come from given that so many say it has no roots in the canon?The Lord filled in these and many other blanks through this book. We have no fear of spending eternity in hell because i've seen and heard scholars say that hell has no roots in the canon of scripture. As a result we pass it off as something to have no concern for. It is perfectly clear to me in my mind and spirit why the enemy would see to it that the books from which The Called was written (book of Enoch, the book of the secrets of Enoch etc) were buried and kept from men. These books expose Satan for the liar, cheat, thief and murderer that he is.In addition they also expose (as the canon does) his fate and the fate of those who follow him and don't accept the gift of salvation by Jesus Christ.

The range of subjects, both historical and biographical, and the number of books he has written is astonishingly large. Nor is he limited to a particular period, or place, as is testified by the diversity of his output which includes books on the Norman Conquest, the Young Pretender, Napoleon, the 1756-63 Franco-British War, the opening of the American West and Henry Morton Stanley. In \\"Villa and Zapata\\" he sets himself the task of telling the history of the Mexican Revolution with the focus on two of its principal participants, Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata.The Revolution kicked off in 1910 with an insurrection by the high-pitched, vegetarian theosophist Francesco Madero. Madero was essentially a Liberal, and aimed to over-throw Porfirio Diaz, the dictatorial ruler of Mexico since 1876. Having achieved this, not least with the military efforts of Pancho Villa, Madero turned out to be a remarkably weak ruler, and before long was assassinated by the deeply unpleasant General Huerta, and Mexico was plunged into a decade long war motivated in part by ideals, and in part by personal ambitions.McLynn strikes a good balance between telling the story of the Revolution and the story of his two main protagonists. Zapata is by the far the more impressive of the two, his peasant revolution in his home state of Morelos is described by McLynn and the constant pressure, and the many dilemmas Zapata faced, in trying to ensure it's survival are evocatively detailed. Villa is a much more volatile character, often brutal, then compassionate, a remarkably versatile guerrilla fighter who went on to fight large scale battles in a crude and crass manner.The regional diversity, and the accompanying pressures they exerted on events, are well detailed. McLynn also covers the international context, in particular that of the United States, and it's many interventions, including the landing in Vera Cruz and the invasion of Northern Mexico in order to hunt Villa down; the many battles fought in the course of the Revolution, including the campaigns of pacification, and some of the singular aspects to the fighting including the use of dynamite and locomotives as weapons of war. McLynn has also included some remarkable photographs of the era, in particular those of Emiliano Zapata, which are eerily haunting. The maps unfortunately, despite a thank-you in the preface for his map-man, are far from brilliant.Frank McLynn tells the story of the Mexican Revolution in an energetic prose, that is always readable, and hard to put down. Out the handful of McLynn books I've read this is the most satisfactory; if it has a fault, it is probably that he appears a little over confident of his opinions, though he does lays the evidence before the reader when he is giving those, and in general they seem reasonable. Well recommend for those interested in Revolutions, or Latin America."},{"Title":"Villa and Zapata: A History of the Mexican Revolution","review":"Highly readable and accurate historical narrative in an entertainingly sardonic voice.

This is not a book for a person that has not had a good grounding in 20th centry history. The terms used for discription tend to be based on the English use of the English language at times and not the American version of the english language. It was not a distraction for me but for some it might be. Some discriptions of the principal figures are compaired to persons of like actions in 20th century europiean history, it works well but might be noted in the reference section for those that do not pick up on the reference to the figure described. When spanish is used as a term it fits the passage and is well translated. The photos fit the language and the discription of the action in the book. It is a history book but it is also just a plain good read."},{"Title":"Villa and Zapata: A History of the Mexican Revolution","review":"the book itself seems to be well written. the download to my device was flawed. there is a whole section of pictures missing. so the weak rating takes that into account."},{"Title":"Villa and Zapata: A History of the Mexican Revolution","review":"ZapataBy Roger ParkinsonEmiliono Zapata was born in 1879 in Morelos, Mexico. He lived his live as a revolutionary leader but started as a lowly peasant. He decided to lead a revolution because of the overwhelming hold of the haciendas on peasant life. Zapata disliked this at an early age and this would later grow into a long and bloody revolution. The haciendas were rich plantation owners and peasants were required to work there. If any one disagreed with the system then they would be shut up by murder or beatings. It was as close to slavery as anything could be besides slavery in its true form. This is an interesting and informing book about the leaders and history of the Mexican Revolution.Zapata's early child life started out being born into a respected, poor family, with a history of being belligerent and quick to fighting. As like normal peasants he worked on a hacienda. Zapata trained horses when he was not on the hacienda.This book tells about all of the major battles leading to Zapata's death. One of these is the storm on Mexico City which came from all sides so the city had almost no chance of winning. But surprisingly it still took a while for the city to fall.Zapata and his Zapistas, or his troops, used guerrilla fighting strategies to attack the massive federal army of Mexico. One of his trusted allies was Villa and his Villistas who helped win many important battles. Without this help the revolution would have been worse.This book says that you don't have to be rich or famous to change the world. You could be extremely poor and still be someone."},{"Title":"Villa and Zapata: A History of the Mexican Revolution","review":"Book packaged very well and received in very good condition. Item arrived ahead of schedule."},{"Title":"Villa and Zapata: A History of the Mexican Revolution","review":"I purchased this book for my grandpa and he seems to love it. It came in great condition. I have not read the book so I will not comment on the content."},{"Title":"Villa and Zapata: A History of the Mexican Revolution","review":"Frank McLynn recaptures Zapata's And Villa's personality very accurately. The book begins with a background information on Mexico and the wars that eventually led to the rise of the dictator Porfirio Diaz and his iron fist rule over Mexico. During this time, the rich were getting richer; and the poor could not come out of debt. Eventually one man from the farm lands spoke his mind. Emiliano Zapata, a man who was for land reform from the south, spread his belief to the peasants and urged them to fight back. While this was going on, a stubborn, hot headed, ladies man was stirring up trouble in the north. These two opposite's, one peaceful acting on thought and the other short tempered acting on gut, were to set Mexico free. But after the revolution was over, neither of them would have suspected that it had only just began.I personally enjoyed this book very much. I have read many Mexican revolutionary books but neither of them have had such a detailed history of the revolutionaries as this book. Frank McLynn describes them and their personality very accurately and it gives you a deeper understanding of them and their motifs for fighting against Diaz. As you read the book, Villa's and Zapata's personalities are unveiled and their troubles are told. McLynn also explains how Villa's and Zapata's personalities are reflected in their battle tactics and politics. I highly recommend this book to those who want to know a better understanding of the Mexican revolution, and its reasons for starting. This book is very detailed and everything is explained making it easy for everyone to read."},{"Title":"Villa and Zapata: A History of the Mexican Revolution","review":"Starting a big book about a subject as complex as the Mexican Revolution can be a chore, but McLynn turns a complex, socio-economic crisis into the tale of two arrogant men. For that reason, his book is priceless. Although reading a biography about Villa and Zapata can realistically just skim the surface of the Revolution, the verve with which thje author tackles his subjects, and the respect he clearly felt for them make his book an enjoyable read. Romanticism does cloud his judgement - although he presents Villa's banditry alongside his derring do - but that makes the book better. He escapes the rigorous pedantry which hangs like a millstone over so much history, but remains accurate.This book is a great start for anyone approaching the Mexican Revolution, and a fascinating comparative biography of two flawed and contradictory characters."},{"Title":"Villa and Zapata: A History of the Mexican Revolution","review":"'Villa and Zapata' deserves reading twice, the book is so rich in detail and the Mexican Revolution was so fascinating and timeless. But it's likely only dedicated students and historians will give the book much attention.Emiliano Zapata and Pancho Villa were the most prominent and remembered among the constellations of men at war and movements in Mexico from 1910 to 1920, but the book's attention to so many facets of that decade of Mexican history - and how these melded into Woodrow Wilson's America and the First World War in Europe -- was its most remarkable feature to me.Permit me as a compliment to 'Villa and Zapata' to paraphrase at some length from two of its parts describing the deaths of those two prominent and remembered but very different warriors, and then briefly from the book's Conclusion.First died Emiliano Zapata -'On April 10, 1919, Zapata and his escorts rode down the hills towards a hacienda - in familiar territory, as he had taken it in early 1911. There were shops outside the hacienda, and Zapata stopped and conferred there with his escorts. Jesus Guajardo, who was to accept Zapata's surrender at the hacienda, came outside and joined Zapata and his escorts. Only one zapatista had entered the hacienda - Zapata's principal aid Miguel Palacios was discussing the handover of 12,000 rounds of ammunition. Outside Guajardo suggested to Zapata that they ride inside the hacienda walls for dinner. Zapata was wary but tired and hungry, and so he acceded, taking a bodyguard of just ten men. He mounted his horse and rode into the hacienda's plaza, as Guajardo's guard of honor stood at attention - paying their visitor a great compliment. A bugle sounded and the guard presented arms. The last note sounded and Zapata had reached the threshold of the building when the guards opened fire at point-blank range. Zapata died immediately, and Palacios and two of the escort also perished. The rest of the zapatistas fled for their lives.'Pancho Villa lasted four long years more -'On July 20, 1923, Villa drove to Canutillo in a large Dodge saloon with six men. In the town, at the intersection of Benito Juarez and Claro Hurtado streets, there was an old man selling candy and he cried out Viva Villa! It was a prearranged signal, and as Villa turned the corner he ran into a fusillade of bullets. He was killed instantly. The Dodge went out of control and hit a tree. One of Villa's companions managed to crawl under the car and play dead while a gunman ran up and pumped more bullets into Villa's head. Another companion managed to kill one of the assailants before making good his escape. Claro Hurtado was less fortunate. Trying to get away down a river bank, his way was blocked and he was gunned down when he turned back.'The book's Conclusion begins -'The Mexican Revolution was a ten-year Iliad, in which Villa, Zapata, Obregon and Carranza played the roles in fact which were played in myth by Agamemnon, Achilles, Hector, and Aeneas. Historians estimate that the death toll was between 350,000 and 1,000,000, excluding the victims of the 1918 flu epidemic, which added another 300,000 to the list of fatalities. Civilization's thin veneer was never thinner than in the Mexican Revolution, and the moral is surely that even in advanced societies we skate all the time on the thinnest of ice. And a seemingly trivial political crisis can open up the ravening maw of an underworld of chaos.'"},{"Title":"Villa and Zapata: A History of the Mexican Revolution","review":"&quot;Villa and Zapata&quot; is a good read and moves quickly along from start to finish. However, I don't know if the reader can actually believe anything in it. It contains no footnotes!This is a spurious practice in a history book. A Google search for &quot;Frank McLynn&quot; and &quot;footnote&quot; shows that many of his books contain no footnotes, according to their reviewers. Therefore he can make any statement he wants in the interests of a good narrative without too much worry about anyone checking it. Kind of post-modern, this desire to get away from facts and into the narrative.The lack of footnotes, combined with his prodigous output on a variety of historical subjects, makes his output suspect, in my view. McLynn's bio on the back cover says he is Visiting Professor in the Department of Literature at Strathclyde University. For a lit guy, he seems to write nothing but history and biography.McLynn lists his favorite books about Mexico in the Guardian and they're all fiction. OK, but where are the great history books, such as Friedrich Katz' definitive &quot;Life and Times of Pancho Villa&quot;?I would suggest the latter for the serious student of Mexican revolutionary history. It is just as interesting and has footnotes."},{"Title":"Villa and Zapata: A History of the Mexican Revolution","review":"This is a well-written, superb look at the Mexican Revolution and its two most famous revolutionaries. The author does a great job of outlining the backgrounds, motivations and actions of not only Villa and Zapata but also the other major players of the revolution such as Diaz, Madero, Huerta, Orozco, Carranza and Obregon. The author's writing style is such that this book reads more as a story than a dry textbook. Not being well-versed on the Mexican Revolution I truthfully had a hard time putting this book down as I wanted to find out how things turned out.

The only thing I did not like was that some details seemed like an assumption, besides that, It is a wonderful book and I suggest you read it, you will learn a lot."},{"Title":"Villa and Zapata: A History of the Mexican Revolution","review":"I have always been interested in the history of Mexico, and have several books that cover it in more or less detail. But I had never understood the events of 1910-1920 in Mexico until I acquired this book.The cast of important characters in Mexican politics, military affairs and civil war during those 10 years was large, and the conflicts and mistrust among them, combined with their differing objectives and views of what Mexico should become, were exceedingly complex; temporary alliances sprang up and broke up, various leaders betrayed other leaders, and at times there was no real government at all. Few of the main players lived long enough to provide perspective; they shot one another with great enthusiasm.Without burrowing too deep into minor issues, this book provides a clear, well-written account of who did what to whom, and how and why, during the years of the \\"Mexican revolution\\". It finally gives me the background I needed to understand the policies and structure of the PRI and its predecessors from the 1928 assassination of Obregon until the erosion of the PRI in the 1990s."},{"Title":"Villa and Zapata: A History of the Mexican Revolution","review":"Great book!

Eisenhower's \\"Intervention\\", which focuses more heavily on the US role in these events (especially the incident at Tampico and the seizure of Vera Cruz).The book does have a bit of a \\"bias\\" you should be aware of going in. He really seems to come across with the idea that radical revolution is good, and those who are not radical (like Madero) are to be dismissed. In the circumstances, he may not be wrong, but I prefer my history not to wear his opinion quite so blatently."},{"Title":"Villa and Zapata: A History of the Mexican Revolution","review":"Very well documented, interesting, a page-turner, however, occasionally, I got the impression the writer might be European. His use of Chihuahua City rather than the correct Ciudad Chihuahua had me going back to other sources to verify that Chihuahua became a ciudad in the early 1800s."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"Another chapter in the saga of Alvin Maker that seems to have no objective, form or substance. As I read this book I continually wondered when I would finally get to a part with some interest or relevance, I never found it. Follow Alvin as he whups up on the nasty white man and saves the blacks, injuns and French. Oh yeah, he starts to build his crystal city but not in any way you might have expected.Is it bad? No. What it is is boring. Too bad, I have been following this story from the very beginning and really enjoyed most of it. There must be some extremely virulent disease going through the fantasy/SF community that has wiped out the ability of many writers to actually finish stories. Hopefully they will come up with a cure soon.Unfortunately it will be too late for this one. It is DOA, terminally boring. I can't in all good conscience recommend this one, even to Mr. Cards most fevered fans. Hopefully he will put this puppy to sleep in his next volume."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"I enjoyed the realization of the Crystal City at long last, While Alvin had some new troubles and seems to have lost some of his abilities It was great to see the evolution of the altered history. Alvin placed the Crystal City where Joseph Smith built Navoo, of course this is a parallel, I wonder how the future will unfold now? Is Arthur Stuart a Maker because of Alvin's Teachings or because he has altered DNA? With So much Makery going on Peggy should give up trying to predict the future, or at least stop worring about it! What will America be after the war to come? What combination of factors will make Alvin willing to allow himself to die? Why on Earth wont he just make another plow of ordinary gold to get teh law off his back! It is a wonderful series, I love all of Card's Novels but this series makes me wish he did nothing else!"},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"I really am enjoying the entire series. Orson Scott Card is a very good writer. If you are looking for a bit of mysticism, spirituality, tradition and alternate worlds-enter here"},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"The Crystal City is the sixth novel in the Tales of Alvin Maker series, following Heartfire. In the previous volume, Alvin and Verily Cooper convinced Judge Adams that the witchcraft charges brought against Purity Orphan and Alvin were backed only by hearsay and outright perjury and that their knacks were given by God upon birth, so the court suspended the licenses for all interrogators (or witchers) for their grievous malfeasance in office. Since a licensed interrogator was required to prosecute a witchcraft charge, Judge Adams dismissed all charges against Purity and Alvin pending restoral of such licenses.Immediately after completion of the trial, Alvin and Arthur ran with the greensong toward Camelot to rescue Calvin and Peggy. Since Calvin was close to dying, Peggy convinced Gullah Joe to use powerful potions to raise Calvin to consciousness. Peggy then coaxed Calvin (with a little remote help from Alvin) into flooding the land near the river, thus driving all of the agitated slaves to higher ground. Thereupon, Peggy talked Calvin into storing his heartfire within a magical box just prior to his death. When Alvin arrived, he managed to repair enough of Calvin's corpse to support a small trickle of heartfire back into the corpse, which kept the repaired parts working while he moved on to repair other parts, until Calvin was restored to full life.Despite Peggy's best efforts, King Arthur and his advisors refused to listen to her explanation that the uprising was an unfortunate accident resulting in no real harm. Instead, they insisted on making an example of the slaves who had stirred up so much fear. John Calhoun wanted to hang a third of the slaves, but was finally convinced to execute only twenty of those involved in the uprising. When the news of these executions reached the northern territories, however, a great public outcry was raised against any further accommodations with the slaveholders.In this novel, Peggy is pregnant again and living in her father's roadhouse, but she has sent Alvin and Arthur down the Mizzippy to Neuva Barcelona -- i.e., New Orleans -- in an attempt to avoid the upcoming war over slavery. On the trip down the river, they have had several enlightening experiences and met a number of interesting people, including a failed storekeeper from Noisy River named Abe Lincoln. They also have had another encounter with Jim Bowie, a killer with a big knife who plans to join Steven Austin's expedition into Mexico.After reaching New Orleans, they find lodgings with Mama Squirrel, Papa Moose and their dozens of kids in a large boarding house. While they wait for some sign of their task, Alvin and Arthur help with the chores and gather information with the help of the kids and soon find that Neuva Barcelona is filled with plots and conspiracies. One day, as they are getting water from a public foundation, a young woman named Dead Mary asks Alvin to heal her mama, Rien, who has yellow fever. While not sure of his ability to cure the disease, Alvin goes with the young woman to a shack in swamp and repairs all the damage that he can discover with his doodlebug, focusing particularly on her liver and blood vessels, and clears away the rotting blood under her skin.Alvin's gross repairs help Rien to heal her own body, but doesn't even touch the disease itself. Rien becomes a carrier of the infection that spreads via the swamp mosquitoes throughout the city. As the disease spreads, Alvin continues to heal as many people as possible in the area around his lodgings, but other people notice that there is a circle of wellness centered on his boarding house. A crowd gathers around the building with torches, egged on by rumors spread by Jim Bowie. Then Arthur uses his knack to extinguish all the torches and the crowd gets really spooked and runs away.Alvin is summoned by the local voodooienne, La Tia, and learns that the townsmen are working themselves into a mob which will attack others in addition to his friends and himself. She says that he must lead an exodus of slaves and poor out of Neuva Barcelona. Calvin helps by shrouding the city in fog, then Alvin and Arthur lead the crowd of thousands out of the city and across Lake Pontchartrain on a bridge made of crystallized water. Gathering more migrants as they go, Alvin takes them all to the future site of the Crystal City.This story reflects the flight of the Hebrews from Egypt as well as the repeated escapes of Joseph Smith and his followers from persecution. The people following Alvin are not only black slaves, but also free colored and poor creoles. They are escaping not just de jure slavery, but also a climate of de facto persecution that limits their freedoms and threatens their lives.This migration culminates all prior efforts by Alvin to break the social constraints of class, color and wealth. This exodus does not wrest their promised land from the prior inhabitants, but instead tames an unwanted wilderness which they then open to all others who wish to settle there. Their new freedom will not be at the expense of others.This volume ends with the first foundations of the new utopia, but already the snakes have started to gather. The new city may be a paradise, but all the people therein will not be paragons of virtue. The next volume in this series should indicate how Alvin will handle dissent and corruption in the Crystal City.Highly recommended for Card fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of temptation, morality and social justice among people with powerful and fantastic talents.-Arthur W.

At its best is it excellent in the story layout and characters. It was classic \\"Card\\" but I thought he tried too hard to bring in components of the first five books and that detracted from the story line a great deal.Lets face it. We are avid readers of the \\"Maker\\" series and so much detail from previous books just pumped up the page count. I found the ending the most disappointing of all. When I hit the last page I felt as if I should be able to turn the page and finish reading the ending and it just was not there.What he did do was make me look forward to the next book to see how this one should have ended.

It's a perfect follow-up to the other books in the series, and it may very well be one of the greatest fantasy series ever written. Mr. Card is simply the best writer of his generation and perhaps one of the best in the world. I believe that this book will garner Mr. Card hundreds of thousands of more fans than he already has.

He can invent, fix, or destroy. This includes healing or killing people.Alvin's wife, the talented Peggy sees a future devastated by war and disease. She concludes that only her beloved has a chance to avert a pandemic disaster. She is not sure why she sends him to Nueva Barcelona (formerly New Orleans), accompanied by Arthur, his half black brother-in-law pretending to be his slave. They await a sign while staying with abolitionist friends of Peggy. When the plague strikes the Spanish controlled city, Alvin keeps his hosts, much of the poor, and Arthur disease free, but not necessarily safe. Still the real quest has begun. Alvin, seventh son of a seventh son, seeks his long ago vision of the Crystal City, a place where death awaits him.Volume six of the Alvin Maker alternate earth fantasy series is an exciting tale that can stand alone, but is better read after perusing its predecessors as THE CRYSTAL CITY rapidly moves forward the quest of the hero. Old favorites like the Red Prophet (see volume two) return and Moose and Squirrel amongst others help propel the adventure forward while other cast members enhance the understanding of the essence of Alvin Maker. Still as with the previous five tomes, this book belongs to the hero who must cross troubled waters without adequate bridges (or Simon and Garfunkle - not born yet) as the author pulls out the Ace of Spades from his deck.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"I don't know what happened to Mr Card but after enjoying the entire series which I found was excellent, this story was a very obvious disappointment. There were plot holes after plot holes. Things he's lead up to for 5 books were ignored and glossed over. It didn't even seem like the same author wrote it.Overall I loved the series and despised the conclusion. So the question is, do I still recommend it to others? I have no idea."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"Maybe my tastes are changing. I've really liked almost every Orson Scott Card book since I first read Ender's Game many years ago. I searched out books that weren't as well known or as easily available and found even greater appreciation for his work (check out Folk of the Fringe, Lost Boys and Enchantment for great reading). I followed him through several different series, some of which were just okay (the Homecoming series) and some were great. One series, The Tales of Alvin Maker was just a step below Ender, in my opinion...until I read the latest entry, The Crystal City.The characters were there, some action was there, but so much of the book was overblown soul searching that it got to the point where I was skipping paragraphs at a time, just to get on with the story. His wife misleads him, she does it for his own good, she should be with someone else, he should have more respect for his brother-in-law, he does what he thinks is best, his wife does what she thinks is best, Dead Mary loves Alvin, Dead Mary loves Arthur, Dead Mary doesn't really love anyone, blah, blah, blah.Card has some points he wants to get across, and Hey! - He wrote the book-so it is his right! But, come on, naming his creation \\"The Tabernacle\\", is just a little obvious. And just to confuse things, this comes after another character had just named it \\"The Observatory\\". I went back to reread that section just to see if there was a reason for naming it twice, but if there was, Orson didn't really get it across.When I had read the 3rd and 4th installments of this series, I actually thought this was going to be better than the Ender series. This was a huge let down. As a reader that has bought well over 25 Orson Scott Card books, I felt like this was a rip-off."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"I was glad to see a continuation to the Alvin Maker series because Heartfire left off with a cliffhanger. The rest of the story was begging to be told. So, when The Crystal City came out, I was overjoyed. However, it too left me hanging. To begin with, I was lost when the story picked up. There were characters involved that had not been introduced. Mr. Card seemed to assume that we would figure it out along the way. Also, many of the characters that were with Alvin at the end of Heartfire were not present in any form. Also in this book, the LDS culture and theology (which is present in all of Mr. Card's works) was overly dominant in The Crystal City. I do appluad Mr. Card for having the courage and faith to present his beliefs to the rest of the world in a form that is much like the parables of Christ. However, unlike The Folk of the Fringe, The Crystal City is not primarily about the Mormon church. Therefore, it was suprising to see the LDS theology overpowering the story of Alvin Maker. Again, this is not saying that Mr. Card should leave his religious beliefs out of his writing. It is the case, however, that when theology or any well known story is used to pattern a novel after, the novel becomes very predictable and in this case, becomes more like reading the story of the Mormon migration. In fact, I found myself checking the included maps, to see exactly where the tabernacle was being built because I was so sure that Mr. Card's purpose in this book was to present his readers with a glimpse of Mormonisim.All in all, the Alvin Maker series is one of Mr. Card's best series. And I thouroughly, enjoyed the continuation of one of the best fantasy series that I have had the pleasure of reading. Cheers to you Mr. Card. I patiently await the continuation of the Alvin Maker series."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"I thought Card was losing his way with \\"Heartfire,\\" but it was such a good adventure saga I overlooked its weak points (e.g., an annoying Balzac; little development of overall plot). Not true with \\"The Crystal City,\\" where all that happens is Alvin Smith getting himself one step closer to creating Nauvoo and to getting himself shot in a Carthage City jail. The characters are worth the effort to read, but so many things have been left behind. The love of Margaret and Alvin, so important in \\"Prentice Alvin\\" and \\"Heartfire,\\" is practically non-existent. So too the Unmaker. Where is Cavil Planter? What happened to Verily and Purity?However, I will continue to read the books in this series. I know Card's got at least one more, and I'm dying to figure out how he works polygamy and destruction of private property (e.g., printing presses) into his plot. I just wish he'd finish the same thing he started. If he has to kill Alvin off at the end, I accept that, just so long as he's true to the series doing it."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"It's been a while since I last read any Alvin-books, and I think \\"The Crystal City\\" might have felt better had I read the previous ones first to refresh my memory. It doesn't work all that well as a stand-alone, but, of course, it would be pointless to expect that from book 6 in a supposedly 7-book series.\\"The Crystal City\\" had pretty much all those things I have grown to love during the series, and many of the annoying bits as well. I expected Calvin would've gained a bit of common sense after \\"Heartfire\\", but unfortunately I was wrong - there has hardly been any character evolution for him, he's always stuck being the completely selfish and stupid little brother. Luckily, after some thoughts that ominously remind Calvin's, Arthur Stuart gets a good arc and truly gives the feeling that he's growing up. Peggy gets the ungrateful part of the anxious expecting mother and is, in my opinion, a bit too whiney and passive in this part of the series. Alvin, on the other hand, has had the problem of being a bit omnipotent, and I liked it that there were moments when he wasn't able to fix everything, and got into dangerous situations that actually felt dangerous instead of something that he could manage with a passing thought.Plotwise, this book continues the saga logically, sees the return of several old acquintances and the entrance of several interesting characters who will probably play a noticeable role in the next part, and most of all, as the name suggests, offers some real revelations. And it's an enjoyable read with a good balance of action, humour and drama, although it certainly has the problematic feel of a middle part, something that actually doesn't have a beginning or an end and only leaves the reader with more questions and high expectations for the next one."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"It pains me to give this book only 3 stars because I love Orson Scott Card's writing so much, however I didn't feel that this final installment of the Alvin Maker series (was it the last one? It sure didn't seem like it) was quite as good as its predecessors. The plot flow seemed almost elementary compared to Card's usual standard, and as other reviewers have pointed out, the ending didn't seem to conclude the series. I definitely have to say this is the worst book by this author I have ever read (although it is by no means bad, considering all that it has to live up to). It's probably a must-read for those who have already enjoyed the Alvin Maker series, but it's unfortunate that Card chose to end this saga with a mediocre book."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"The story begins by with a huge knowledge gap between this and the previous book. Some years have passed and the character dynamics have changed considerably without much in the way of background being provided. Similarly, the book ends leaving the reader with the distinct feeling that there is room for another book. That is, the story is not finished. I felt that the book was unworthy of the previous five and appeared to be written to fulfill a contractual obligation. I did not feel as though the author's heart was really in it (in fact, it could almost have been written by somebody else) although it is a good yarn. Orson Scott Card fans must read the series, but be prepared for some disappointment with this last book."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"After waiting four years for the sequel to Heartfire, Orson Scott Card finally delights us with the further tales of Alvin Maker in The Crystal City. From the beginning, we are transported into the wonderful world of magical alternate history as only Uncle Orson can show us. Alvin and his brother-in-law, Arthur Stuart, are in the Spanish town Nueva Barcelona (once known as New Orleans) on a mission of unknown determination, by Alvin's wife, the \\"Torch,\\" Peggy Smith.Card writes in his usual Alvin series voice, providing frequent jabs and slapstick conversation among the characters, who argue among themselves in admiration. Although I think the snappy dialogue went a tad overboard in this book, I was nevertheless entertained with the story.The book is an easy read, and went too quickly. After the early difficulties in the book, I think things wrapped together far too neatly toward the end. And it appeared that Card was rushing this one. It seems that something has been left out.I have to remind myself that the Alvin books are written easily, so that youth can read them, and not be upset that we didn't explore the depths of characters who should be behaving like adults.At 340 pages, it's well worth the short time it takes to read it. I understand that Orson Scott Card has one more book in the series and then he'll wrap it all up. Let's hope he takes less than four years to write this one."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"I was very much looking forward to this novel after having read the other books in the series. I avoid purchasing hardbacks whenever possible, but I decided to give in to my need to hear the rest of the story.What I loved about the series was the world that Orson Scott Card created, which is still present in this book, but the magic of the world is not there.The other novels felt more like a complex journey, literally of travelling and spiritually to look at one's purpose in the world. This book lacked that insight and left me feeling that it was just filler and/or a way to close out the series.I don't regret having purchased the book but I do have to admit I was disappointed. I am a long time reader of OSC's novels and I have at least one more waiting to be read but I would suggest that you check this one out from the library. I would also suggest that you do finish the series if you started to finally see the city."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"This is the sixth book in the ingenious Alvin Maker series. In this alternate North America of the 1850s, folk magics work. Blacks make charms from personal items, Reds use the forces of nature, and Whites have knacks; inborn magical talents. Alvin Maker, born Alvin Miller and known as Alvin Smith, is the seventh son of a seventh son and was expected to have an ususually strong knack. He is even stronger than that: apprenticed as a blacksmith, he discovers he has the powers of Maker, one who understands the essences of all things and can manipulate them. Yet as this book begins, Alvin is despairing again, because despite his awesome powers, he was unable to save he prematurely born child.If you're reading these book reviews, there's an excellent chance that you've read books 1-5 already, and want to know whether this book finally hits the money note. Does Alvin finally get to build his Crystal City? Does he at least figure out how he will do it, or where, or with whose help? And is this book worth reading?If you've read the other five books, yes, you should get this one. It has much more plot and character development than the fifth book, Heartfire. In the last volume, Alvin dithered and fretted about how he was going to build his city, but didn't find himself any closer to his goal; he didn't even find himself closer to beginning it. In Crystal City, Alvin begins on another vague errand, sent by his future-seeing wife who is doing her best to avoid an all-out war she sees in almost every possible path.Alvin meets two of Peggy's abolitionist friends in Neuva Barcelona, the unfortunately named Moose and Squirrel. (This odd reference to Rocky and Bullwinkle is merely another of Card's fans on his Hatrack River discussion group; some of the other books suffered by including characters from the bulletin board whether or not they advanced the plot.) And once again, Alvin's attempt to improve things makes them worse. By curing an old woman dying from yellow fever, Alvin finds the entire city now under threat from the plague. And by keeping Moose, Squirrel and their 55 children (of various races, their household is an illegal school for blacks so they follow the letter of the law by not allowing the children to recite their lessons aloud) healthy while all around them are dying, their neighbors pay more attention to the unusual domecile.Several characters from the previous books return, including Tenskwa-Tawa (the Red Prophet of volume 2), Jim Bowie and Steve Austin, and Verily Cooper. Calvin reappears in Barcy, still seething with resentment toward his older brother. Arthur Stuart is growing into a man and discovering his abilities are more than anyone expected from him. Some strong new characters develop in this work, especially La Tia, a voodoo queen with powers rivalling his own, who gives Alvin a much more ambitious mission than he ever expected.We also meet this universe's Abraham Lincoln, but I think that was not an effective device. Most charcters from Alvin's part of the world take a new last name when they enter a profession, yet the historical characters Lincoln, Bowie and Austin did not. It would have been better if they had more appropriate monickers, and let us figure out who they were supposed to be (I'm thinking of Turtledove's alternate America where the CSA remains a separate country; many of his historical cameos are not fully identified).This is clearly not the last book of the series, but we are getting closer to the end. Alvin learns more about himself, his abilities and limits, and how to teach others to work toward a common goal. Yet the book ends with plenty of unresolved familial and political tensions, so there's at least another novel waiting. It would be appropriate to finish this series about a seventh son of a seventh son with book... seven."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"This applies to the whole series. I enjoyed reading it, but I doubt I'll ever re-read it. At the end of this book I was left feeling unsatisfied. Orson Scott Card seems to be able to start series with a lot of promise but never seems to be able to finish them. They just sort of peter out."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"I read straight through all six books because they were that good...until I got to the sixth. It almost felt as though Card made it up as he went along; as though there was a disconnect to what had come before. Too much was left hanging and not completed. I felt cheated. Even if at the time, Card planned another series to go into the future, it was poor.The subplots were weak, some sidetracks into different ventures went nowhere, which, in my mind, did nothing but flesh out the alternative history, and the story meandered around until they SUDDENLY reached the promised land . Alternative Histories naturally change history and portray another reality. However, I think Card failed dismally in how he portrayed Abe Lincoln. For me, it didn't work. Maybe because some people should be left alone.After the whole buildup of searching for how to build the Crystal City, the book had a weak ending. I understand that life gets in the way of miracles, but by the time everyone was in place, the city was being built, the golden plow had revealed its purpose, there could at least have been something exciting to mark the event. Instead, Alvin spends time moaning about how things are going to fail, Peggy cries because she sees his future, but won't tell him, (What else is new?), and Calvin shows up completely unchanged. Or maybe, as readers, we're supposed to supply our own ending...like Arthur Steward will become powerful enough that he will overcome the evil brother Calvin and save Alvin's life, even though Alvin's full of bullet holes.Sounds like the unmaker wrote the sixth book."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"A lot of people obviously had a negative reaction to this final volume in the saga of Alvin Maker. Instead, I'd like to applaud Card for this difficult effort to wrap up a complex and much-loved series. I know it wasn't an easy task, but it was absolutely demanded by fans of this wonderfully imaginative world. While much of the wonder of the story has faded, and this ending certainly seems rushed towards an easy conclusion, this is still a good book, providing adequate closure to the series. Here's props to OSC for finding a way to tie up all the loose ends and finally bringing this story to a close.As most of the readers of the series know, this story wasn't initially planned to get as far as it has. After the first three books, Card let the story rest and didn't know if he'd ever come back to it. After much encouragement by fans of the series, he decided to bring it back. At some point after that, he must have decided to bring it all the way to a conclusion. I know it is hard to believe, but when Card initially wrote about the vision of the Crystal City inRed Prophet, he didn't really have a firm idea of where that promise would really lead, much less how he would actually get his young character Alvin there. Similarly, many of the other grand events that were foreshadowed throughout the series were not fully formed ideas when they were promised, and left Card with a daunting task to complete this series in a fulfilling way.In THE CRYSTAL CITY, the plot is obviously directed and limited towards a definite conclusion to the overall story. The previous couple of books, notablyHeartfire, seemed to aimlessly wander, introducing new plot threads and characters that really didn't add anything to the series as a whole, but rather seemed to be filler for a series that the author wasn't sure where to take or how to finish. Finally, in this book, Card had made up his mind to finish the story and just did it. No fooling around, no stretching it out, just completing the story.This book does come across as rushed, set on a crash-course for the inevitable ending that no reader doubted could be much different than it turned out. And there was an obvious effort to wrap up loose ends of the story in the most efficient (or easiest) way possible. And sure there are a few plot threads from the previous books that were radically altered or just allowed to fade into the forgotten. But this book at least brings a satisfactory closing to a much-loved series.So, with THE CRYSTAL CITY, Card successfully brings his beloved story to an end, mercifully putting a series that had lost its inspiration to rest. Fans of the series should enjoy the closure to the story. Readers new to the series are encouraged to pick upSeventh Son, and let the magic begin."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"Card's \`Alvin Maker' series takes us down an alternate timeline to a pre-industrial America where folk magic competes with religion and science as the path to success. If you haven't read the first two volumes: \`Seventh Son' and \`Red Prophet' leave this page now and go check them out. Not only will further installments make little sense without that background, but they're nowhere near as good, and once again, this one is certainly no exception. The bottom line on the series is this - if you liked Volume 3, \`Alvin Journeyman', where the drop in quality first began, you'll probably like the rest, too, although it seems to this reviewer as though each new addition is just a little weaker than the previous one.In this volume, Alvin brings his people - the outcasts, the enslaved, and the downtrodden - across the great river to the site where he will build his long-awaited Crystal City. Hallelujah! At last something is happening in this series. Unfortunately, what's happening is not very exciting, and it's taken us yet another complete volume to get there. On the plus side, Card's prose is always easy reading, and fans of the series will probably get through this tome pretty quickly. But if Card plans to continue with this series (and it would be a serious mistake if he didn't since the end of this installment is pretty weak) he needs a payoff that makes all this buildup seem worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"Loved all of the books in this series and all the way up to the end it was a great journey but it sort of felt unfinished. I wish that there was more to the ending."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"I have never read an OSC book I didn't like. This one is one of the better ones, though. The characters (as always with Card) are well developed and easy to care about, the situations are bizarre and engrossing (Alvin meets Abe Lincoln in this one), and the book leaves you wanting more. I read this in three days. Why didn't I give it five stars? Well, because I've read Ender's Game and The Lord of the Rings and a few other classics, which this book does not measure up to. It didn't leave a strong impression on me, but it was about as entertaining as books get anyway. Not something that will stick with you forever, but it's thoroughly entertaining. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"For those of us eagerly waiting to learn what happens next to Alvin Maker, &quot;The Crystal City&quot; does not toy with us. In this, the sixth novel in the Alvin Maker series, all of the previous elements come into play. Alvin's work is far from done at the end of this book, but Card has fulfilled much of his promise to his readers. As we watch Alvin's dreams become real we also watch the author's. He continues to thrill us with famous characters in this alternate history. The rich dialects stick with me, and I catch them in my speech for days.Once again Orson Scott Card skillfully recaps the action of the previous books through the thoughts of his characters, so we learn even more about the past. Readers will benefit from reading the previous books in the series first. (Seventh Son, Red Prophet, Prentice Alvin, Alvin Journeyman, and Heartfire) The only flaw of this book is that it tries to cover too much of the story within two covers.Card has developed as a writer throughout this series. Each novel in this series is different from the others. &quot;The Crystal City&quot; is not primarily a story of action (although there is no shortage of miraculous actions). Instead it is a story of relationships-- trust, love, forgiveness, and hope. There is no final battle with the Unmaker at the end of this tale, and some readers may be disappointed by that. But there is triumph nonetheless. While I would eagerly read future books in the Alvin Maker series, I shall be content if this is the end."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"At first, I was wary of this book-- my problem with Orson Scott Card is that he can't finish a series-- Children of the mind was horriffic, as was xenocide- so I was a bit nervous when I picked up The Crystal City. This book however, is a strong addition (and end?) to the Alvin Maker series-- by far, his best series (as a whole) to date. It ties up many loose ends, and ends on a positive note. As always, Card's writing sucks you into his world-- i couldn't put this book down. Some minor problems:1. It's a pretty good stand-alone book, but there are some parts where the reader might get confused if they have not read the other books in the Alvin Maker series (read them!)2. Alvin Maker's archnemesis-- the Unmaker, seemed not much more than an afterthought-- there are few worthy enemies in this story, (and not as much conflict) which sorely disappointed me. Mr. Card's forte is his character studies, and the book falls short in this area3. There was no real resolution-- the book ends on a happy note, which is odd, given how many times disaster is foretold throughout the story.my only hope is thus that the ending was left open because he plans to write another book in the series-- if not, it is a disappointing ending."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"When his wife sends him to New Barcelona (New Orleans), Alvin Maker goes even though he is uncertain of his goal. What he discovers is Yellow Fever and oppression. Even Alvin's 'maker' powers are unable to completely defeat the disease, but he resolves to do something about the oppression faced by slaves, freed blacks, and the French inhabitants of the city. Like Moses, Alvin must find a way to lead the oppressed into a promised land. Unlike the Israelites, however, Alvin's task is doubly challenging because he doesn't want to violate laws and force other people out of their country.Along with his friends, Abraham Lincoln and Arthur Stuart--who is quickly becoming a maker himself, Alvin struggles to find a path. Unfortunately, Alvin's brother Calvin, Steve Austin, and Jim Bowie have other plans and do everything they can to hamper Alvin. And Alvin's pregnant wife looks into the future and sees only destruction and death for everything that she and Alvin have fought for. But although the power of the unmaker is overwhelming, Alvin refuses to give up his dream of a Crystal City of Makers, working together to build something wonderful and something that will last beyond his own death.Author Orson Scott Card creates a wonderful and enduring character in Alvin Maker. Card has become one of the best SF/Fantasy authors writing today and THE CRYSTAL CITY reflects Card at the height of his power. Although THE CRYSTAL CITY is an engrossing read, for me it lacks some of the pure emotional power of the earlier novels in this series. In THE RED PROPHET and ALVIN JOURNEYMAN, for example, I often found myself in tears at the pure power of the story. CRYSTAL CITY falls somewhat short of this. That doesn't, however, make the novel less than engrossing and enjoyable.If you're new to this series, you'll find your enjoyment enhanced by starting at the beginning, SEVENTH SON. If you've been following the series, you'll definitely want to read this one."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"I love, love, love Orson Scott Card's Alvin Maker series, but he is just pushing it now. It's time to let it go man! This book isn't a complete waste of time, but it's not something I would read instead of say, doing laundry. It's just not that good."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"I was looking forward this book after having read the first five, an i'm looking forward to another one soon!!! GreatJob Mr. Card"},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"Originally posted at FanLit.The Crystal City is the (maybe) final novel in Orson Scott Card's TALES OF ALVIN MAKER. This series started off strongly with Seventh Son and Red Prophet, but it bogged down during books three and four (Prentice Alvin and Alvin Journeyman) and I was ready to give up. However, since I had already downloaded the audio version of the sixth book, The Crystal City, from my library, I decided to finish the series. (My library didn't have the fifth book, Heartfire, so I just read a plot summary of that one.)Alvin and Peggy are married and have lost a child. Alvin continues his work as a Maker, trying to prepare people for his Crystal City, while Peggy is trying to end slavery. Alvin and Arthur are now in New Orleans. When Alvin heals a woman with yellow fever, she is well enough to go outside and spread it among the city, starting a plague. Alvin tries to heal as many as he can and, in the process, is suspected of witchery. It's looking like a good time to leave New Orleans, so when a woman asks Alvin to lead thousands of runaway slaves and French refugees across the Mississippi river to freedom, he agrees to do it.Thus The Crystal City is the Exodus story and Alvin is both a Moses figure and a Jesus figure. He teams up with his old friend Tenskwa-Tawa, the Red Prophet, to lead 5,000 people out of slavery and into the promised land. Other highlights include the introductions of Jim Bowie and Abraham Lincoln and, finally, Alvin's dawning understanding of his purpose and the beginnings of the crystal city.The Crystal City was hard to get through for the same reason I had trouble with books three and four in this series. The plot drags because there's too much brooding interior monologue and far too much teasing banter amongst the characters. Almost every conversation on nearly every page of the novel is snarky or sarcastic. This is usually playful (e.g.,\\" I hope I grow up to be as perfect as you!\\") and it feels very realistic, but it becomes incredibly boring after listening to it for so long during this series. I had to skim some of it in order to finish The Crystal City. I listened to the audio version, so basically I sped up the narration to about triple the normal rate in parts, especially the dialogue. The Blackstone audio versions are very good, by the way, though I always had to speed them up. The narrator Stephen Hoye is particularly excellent in this series.It's not clear whether there will be any more books in the TALES OF ALVIN MAKER series. The ending is open and some readers will be disappointed that it doesn't tie up all the loose ends. I'm at the point that I don't care. Either way, I'm done with Alvin Maker."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"Following the previous books on the Alvin Maker series, we see Alvin and companions reaching out to further his dream of the Crystal City.

If you read the first 5, like me, you are likely going to read this no matter what I say, but consider buying it used or borrowing it from a friend! Unlike the first 5 novels, it is predictable and there is little additional character development. I know Mr. Card has strong Mormon beliefs, but in the end when the Crystal City's tower is named a &quot;tabernacle&quot;, that was just a little too much for me. I don't know if I hope there is a 7th book or not."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"&quot;The Tales of Alvin Maker&quot; series by Orson Scott Card has been my husband's and my latest joint reading project. We recently finished Book 6 in the series, &quot;The Crystal City.&quot;The series is set in an alternative version of Colonial America, in which various political entities hold interests in the North American continent and which people of various descent are steeped in magic that is common to their race.Thus, European settlers have &quot;knacks&quot; of varying degree and ability. The indigenous people move in harmony with the &quot;Greensong&quot; that encompasses all life. And people of African descent utilize physical objects, like poppets, to work their magic.The hero of the series, Alvin Maker, was born the seventh son of a seventh son -- a combination that blessed him with a particularly powerful knack. Although he was apprenticed as a smith, his true profession is that of maker, and Alvin wields tremendous power over natural forces like stone and metal.As the story progresses through successive volumes, Alvin gathers like-minded people to him in an effort to build the Crystal City of a childhood vision. And he learns, as his ability matures, that a maker is part of what he makes.A visit to Orson Scott Card's Web site (www.hatrack.com) recently informed us that the story is projected to encompass a total of seven volumes, which means there's only one left. I have great respect for Mr. Card for having established a finite, concluding number for the volumes in his series, because having read other writers' ongoing epics, I know the temptation to use familiar characters or locale can be a powerful one.Of the several multi-volume epics we have read, the authors' success has been varying. One of the biggest pitfalls, we've noticed, is that sooner or later the need to rehash past events for continuing readers or bring new readers up to speed tends to bog down the narrative if not handled with care. In the case of the Alvin Maker series, however, there is just enough &quot;boilerplate&quot; to keep things moving, or to offer an insight into the hearts and minds of Mr. Card's characters. The story continues moving forward, with new insights and revelations awaiting the familiar cast.So here's looking forward, in excitement mixed with regret, to the release of &quot;Master Alvin.&quot; This is an excellent series, to be enjoyed while it lasts, and re-read fondly when it is over. And if &quot;The Crystal City&quot; is any indication of what is to come, Mr. Card is wrapping things up at the peak of his storytelling powers as channeled in &quot;The Tales of Alvin Maker.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"I enjoyed this newest contribution as much or more than the previous works. It is a fabulous adventure, and I am awaiting the next installment very impatiently. It is not apparent as yet whether Mr. Card is actully going to produce the next installment, I hesitatingly admit, but I believe there is more to tell in this adventure. Here's hoping. At any rate, this book was a very good investment. Hope you enjoy it as much."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"Card seems to be building towards some kind of crisis, but this volume just advances each character a bit, kind of slow overall, but a very enjoyable chapter in a wonderful saga, none-the-less."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"This book was interesting because I liked the characters. Other than that, though, it felt really... incomplete. It seemed to skip (although referring to) a lot of things that'd happened since the last book in the series, and how the action fit in with everything that was going on in North America at the time just wasn't clear.OSC is usually better than this; one wonders if he's starting to slip. Personally, I doubt it, but then I'm not objective; I love the guy and suck up whatever he writes. :)"},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"I felt a little let down by \\"Crystal City.\\" The quality of the writing and of the characters is still excellent: that's not the issue. But it just didn't feel very climactic for what seems like it ought to be the last book in the series. Maybe if it hadn't been named \\"Crystal City\\" I'd have felt better about it being just a link in the chain.I also found myself scratching my head and wondering if I'd missed a book in between Heartfire and Crystal City. There seems to have been at least a year in between the stories, which in any of itself isn't a problem except that they keep referring to things that happened - the death of a baby, Arthur's breakthrough, meeting Abe and Coz, rescuing a boatload of slaves, the splitting up of the Verily / Fink / Alvin / Arthur / Audobon crew, Peggy's acquaintence with Squirel and Moose... there seems to be a good book or two in there that we didn't get to read. Maybe he will fill in some gaps later the way he's done with Ender's universe?Finally, the Crystal City story itself just didn't seem to be long enough. There was so much going on that didn't really get much detail - especially the role of Abe, Coz, and Verily in getting the charter, the invasion of Mexico, Arthur's return, the journey north, etc. It almost felt like some of those details were too boring to write about... but that doesn't make sense considering the time he spent on similar topics in \\"Journeyman\\" and even \\"Heartfire.\\"The book ended in such a way that we were left hopeful for another installment. I certainly hope we get one: as a climax for a really great series, this just didn't fit the bill."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"In _The Crystal City_, Orson Scott Card's 6th book in the Alvin Maker series, Alvin starts an epidemic and builds a bridge, Arthur Stuart gets kissed and runs to Mexico and back, Calvin postures, Verily sulks and Margaret sighs. That's about it.Before embarking on _The Crystal City_ I went back and reread the entire series, as it had been five years or so since I was through them last and I wanted to be sure everything was fresh. I was, once more, delighted by the voice with its smooth use of early American colloquialism, impressed by the obvious knowledge of history and folklore that went into them, captivated by the engaging characters and astounded by the scope of the work. &quot;Boy,&quot; I thought, &quot;This is one Great Series!&quot;Then I came to the current volume. And I was really disappointed. It purely does not compare with its companions in any way. The story was frankly boring and the Biblical allegory--which was very suave and subtle in the earlier works-- was just ham-handed. I don't object to Alvin's spending the entire book leading a group of slaves to freedom, but it doesn't make for very interesting action and the subplots weren't developed enough to alleviate the tedium. The language was mundane, without any of the personality I had come to expect. The earlier books seemed to be told by a breathing human being; TCC resembled a recitation by a history prof counting the days until retirement. The characters were flat. The characters we had seen before were not developed any further and the new characters were not developed at all. In previous books even minor characters had personalities and stories, but only lip service was paid to that here: note the stunning difference between _Heartfire's_ Denmark and TCC's Old Bart. Historical characters were inserted to fill the formula, but not even Abe Lincoln really added anything. And as for Papa Moose and Mama Squirrel, well, I read the reason for them in the Acknowledgements, but I personally think using those names was a REALLY BAD CHOICE. Every reference to &quot;moose and squirrel&quot; catapaulted me into a realm that had nothing to do with Alvin Maker and Co. I'm sure you know the one I mean.I don't mind that TCC started about five years after _Heartfire_ and that Alvin was in a really different place than one might have expected. I do mind that the story behind this wasn't really told. It's as if Tolkein had finished FOTR with leaving Lorien, skipped TTT altogether and started ROTK with &quot;Well, now that Saruman's been vanquished...&quot; There was just a huge chunk missing, and I think that chunk would have been a great deal more interesting than the story Card chose to tell. It almost seems to me that Card has written himself into a corner with this series; his characters can no longer grow and change and have real human experiences because that might tarnish them. Good and bad are established, but there are no longer any of the shades of grey that make people interesting.Though TCC ends with some events that foreshadow a possible cotinuation of this series, it also sums up enough -- with &quot;curtain call&quot; appearances by most major characters fromt he series -- that Card could stop here without much harm done. Unless he makes some radical choices for this universe, I hope he does stop. I really wouldn't like to see this series devolve any further. The spark is gone and laying this series to rest before it decays would be a mercy."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"The sixth book of the Tales of Alvin Maker feels a lot like the increasingly tired books at the end of the Ender series. It's not that the book is boring--I read it in two sittings--but although the plot is fine, it's simply not as well crafted as the earlier volumes in the series, and it shows. For one, the earlier books had a distinctive narrator, a sort of folksy presence that was clearly of the world of the book, but that is completely absent from this book, making the book read more like notes for a screen play than a coherent whole. Secondly, there's no overarching plot arc that makes this book stand alone the way the others in the series could--it feels more like the collected other adventures of Alvin Maker, and not like a coherent whole where the plot tensions pull the book to its conclusions. Third, the book has a strange quality that it does not take place immediately after the events in Heartfire. There's nothing wrong with that, per se--it might even be interesting, except that in this case a lot of the emotional tension from the previous book is just gone. Peggy and Alvin are separated again, their baby stillborn, and although you are told about Alvin's guilt in not being able to save his child you don't get to see it, and it carries little weight--it feels for most of the book that they've drifted apart, but I'm not sure that's the intention. At the end of the last book, Verily Cooper has found new love, but Purity is almost entirely gone from this book, with some hints that their romance went nowhere. Calvin is back, but all the rapproachment between him and Alvin is gone--which is probably realistic, but very unsatisfying after the last book where we see a seachange in Alvin's brother. Because of the flat narrative voice and this bizarre missing chapters, the book tells us a lot, but shows us nothing, and as a result, we don't feel at all like we're there, the way Card mananges to do in the previous five books. The first five books are so exceptional, so satisfying, that it is probably not surprising that it was hard to sustain it further, but I hope that if Card gives his readers another installment, he will care more about the craft that makes his best books worth reading over and over again."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"Alvin Maker, or Smith, still after five books has not found himself or the Crystal City of which he dreams. Sent to Nueva Barcelona (New Orleans) by his wife Peggy, he more or less accidently becomes Moses to an Exodus of slaves and other downtrodden people. With yellow fever and soldiers not far behind, and the seemingly impenetrable Mizzippi ahead, he must try to lead these people to freedom. Meanwhile, his uncontrollable younger brother, Calvin, is stirring up trouble on an expedition to conquer Mexico . . .Good, but not great, continuation of the Alvin Maker series. As you can tell by the title, Alvin finally begins his Crystal City (and not surprisingly, since much in this series parallels Latter Day Saints beliefs, it seems to be on the site of Nauvoo, Illinois.)While we meet Abraham Lincoln in this series (an Abe who apparently did not buy a barrel of law books at a cheap price to enable him to study law on his own), Lincoln's explanation as to why he doesn't have a last name reflecting his profession is weak. Most of the people who don't have such last names are historical characters in our world (William Henry Harrison, for example). It's not a new complaint, but--Card should have thought this through. He's inventive enough.With Alvin seeming to parallel Joseph Smith, and with his people defying the U.S. to some extent, the groundwork seems to be laid for this universe's equivalent of the U.S. attack on Nauvoo and death of Joseph Smith, which eventually led to Brigham Young and his people's trek to Utah. How this will play out in Card's works should be interesting.Finally, Card really, really, should update his political maps to show the developments he has mentioned through the series--the new states, the closing-off of the Trans-Mizzippi, etc. The maps are the same as at the start of the series, though this book's version does show Springfield and Crystal City--the latter on the WEST bank of the Mizzippi. It's more an annoyance than anything else.Recommended, if you've read the previous five."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"It's been five years since the last installment in this series, which is a long time without fuel to maintain the energy and enthusiasm this series originally engendered. As an alternate history where people have 'knacks' for doing things, from repairing barrels and bones to seeing the future, its fire came from its ideological underpinnings, of the fight between those who build and those who destroy, of machine versus nature, of the rights of all to be self-directing autonomous individuals versus the cultural assumption that some are better than others, and those inferior beings are suited only for slavery. While much of this underpinning is highly relevant to this latest installment, it does not seem to bring with it the deep emotional involvement that would have made this story come alive.Alvin Maker is the prime mover here, a man conflicted between his incredible abilities and the knowledge that regardless of how much he builds, however much good he can accomplish in the world, the Unmaker will be following right behind, tearing down all he can accomplish. Alvin's dream of a city built by Makers seems further and further off, as he becomes embroiled in actions to save many of the slaves and poor of the city of Nueva Barcelona (New Orleans) from both yellow fever (that he unwittingly helped to spread) and its other bigoted and superstitious citizens. Almost as a side plot, his brother Calvin becomes embroiled in a foray by Steve Austin and Jim Bowie to conquer the Mexica, with Calvin's typical disregard for the consequences or moral rightness of his actions.The depiction of the historical characters that dot this novel, from Abe Lincoln to Bowie, is definitely problematic. All of them seem to have no depth, all are portrayed with only the sheen of their legendary characteristics, from Abe's honesty to Bowie's fighting drive, with no signs of other human foibles that would have made these stick-figures into something real. The plot itself is reasonable, a modern alternate version of Exodus with Alvin as Moses, and its final resolution points the way towards where this series may ultimately be headed. But I found as I was reading that I was looking for something more concrete to the action; too little description, not enough supporting details, an almost dreamlike feel to what could have been a very gritty slice of life under very unappetizing conditions.While Card has a long list of those people who helped check this manuscript for continuity errors with earlier volumes, and obviously their efforts did help eliminate most of those kinds of problems, I did find it a little amusing that the maps on the end papers clearly show Alvin's Crystal City located on the wrong side of the Mississippi river.Card does manage to make most of his moral points without clobbering you over the head with them, and some of the final section shows at least a willingness to concede that not all that is man-made is bad or that all that is nature-derived is good. But the fire that drove the earlier books, of their implied Great War between good and evil, is not here. Clearly, Card is planning at least one more book in this set, where perhaps the anticipated and long delayed war against slavery will combine with Alvin's dream of a better world to form a heart-wrenching finale. I do hope so.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"Like the Ender seriers did with Children of the Mind and the Homecoming series did with Earthborn, the Alvin Maker series sputters to a conclusion (hopefully) in The Crystal City.Not that this book was terrible, but it just didn't seem to have any purpose other than gettin Alvin and his followers to the Crystal City, and there just wasn't anything interesting enough that happened along the way. I think they were all too good, and too powerful, that you knew they would always do the right thing, and you also knew that they always could, so there wasn't any doubt about the conclusion.If you've read the rest of the series, you'll probably want to read this book just for closure, just don't expect much."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"I had to go back and see how long it had been since Uncle Orson had published the last volume in the Tales of Alvin Maker, but I waited until after I read Book 6, &quot;The Crystal City.&quot; It had been about five years, but without ever going back and jogging my memory I was able to pick up the narrative thread in the ongoing story. Besides, I was encouraged by both the title and the cover art for this novel that Alvin was finally going to take that golden plough out of his poke and finally lay the ground for his city, and in that regard I am not disappointed. However, this is still not the climax of the tale.Orson Scott Card's Tales of Alvin Maker series is set in an alternative America where some people are born with knacks, a magical ability that is both a great gift and a deep burden. Alvin, the seventh son of a seventh son, is a &quot;maker,&quot; who can make things and fix things, using his doodlebug to get a sense of what needs to be done. After the death of his newborn son, Alvin is persuaded by his wife, Peggy (a &quot;torch,&quot; who can see the various paths into the future that a life might take), to go to Barcy (the New Orleans of this world), and so he travels down the Mizzizippy with young Arthur Stuart on a flatboat with Abe Lincoln and his friend Coz.This matters because while Alvin Maker has his dream of the Crystal City, Peggy is concerned with preventing the great war that she sees coming over the issues of slavery. In this America the United States is put one of several &quot;countries&quot; competing for the North American continent. The south consists of Crown Colonies, Spain controls Florida and Nueva Barcelona (Louisiana), and the French still have Canada. Meanwhile, the descendants of the Aztecs are still performing human sacrifices in Mexica and Alvin's friend, Tenskwa-Tawa, the Red Prophet, controls the lands to the west of the Mizzippy. Beyond the Hio Territory where Alvin was born in Hatrack River, the Wobbish Territory where Vigor Church and Carthage City can be found, and even beyond the Noisy River Territory, Alvin needs to find a place for his Crystal City. Because when he saves a single life in Barcy, the act changes everything and forces a series of issues. The establishment of the Crystal City is obviously a major moment in the series, but clearly it is not the big payoff.As always, it is interesting to see Uncle Orson's take on some of the figures of American's history. If he liked John Adams, he likes Abraham Lincoln any more. However, Stephen Austin and Jim Bowie do not fare well, and Alvin has to worry about the latter almost as much as he does about his younger brother Calvin. I know there are those who want to read these stories as a religious allegory, but I have enjoyed taking the narrative at face value and I remain ignorant enough of the major tenets of Mormon theology so that I do not see anything more here than the American ideal dressed up in alternative clothing. However, I find it hard to believe that there is only one volume left in the series, because there seem to be too many threads left to weave together."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"Its been a long time since I read the earlier books in this series, so many of the details of the earlier events have become fuzzy. Consequently, I was concerned about picking this up and finding myself confused by jumping into the middle of the story. Happily, this book stands well enough on its own that this didn't happen. Card continues to be a terrific storyteller, with compelling characters who make you care about what happens to them. His alternate history, based on a reality in which magic is real, is also convincing and provides a thoroughly interesting backdrop to his story. However, it is the character interactions in this book that are the most enjoyable. The dialog is filled with verbal swordplay that is both biting and funny, and which also sounds true to life. The only criticism I can offer for this book is that the ending, while hopeful, is also so open ended that it practically screams that Card intends to continue writing books for this series."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"First, some background on my experience with the whole series: I picked up the Alvin Maker books because I'd just finished the 8th book in the Ender/Shadow series, and was generally happy with all of them. The first three in this series (Seventh Son, Red Prophet, Prentice Alvin) were incredible, and presented rich possibilities for a great sequence, which I assumed would obviously be 7 books. OSC really had some good ingredients for a memorable good/evil epic.Then came the 4th book with its insufferable courtroom drama, poorly-handled romance, annoying developments with Calvin and complete lack of the things which made the first three so great. Well, OK, I thought, maybe he's just got to lay some groundwork for the rest of the series. People love him, people hate him, OK I get it. Now get back to the awesomeness for book 5, please. Instead, what do we get? Another courtroom drama, a near complete lack of maker awesomeness, and a front cover (ppb) that looks like a freaking trashy romance novel, so terrible that I can't read it near other people without being made fun of.Almost despondent, I get book six (The Crystal City). Good, I think: finally we can get back to the maker awesomeness. In one sense, it's there. The bridge, the river, the bricks (don't want to spoil anything by being too specific here) were pretty cool. But as a whole, I was again disappointed! I can't necessarily put a finger on it, but at the end I was just thinking \\"Hmm, so that's it, huh. If he ever makes a book 7 I'll read it, I guess, but if not, meh.\\"I hated the entire Calvin plot right from the beginning, and Peggy is only a good character when she's around, not when she's controlling events from afar or writing stupid love letters. Arthur Stuart had some real potential to be a great character, but since this book takes place several years after the 5th, I think we should have seen more maker awesomeness from him than we got.Furthermore, at this point the use of real historical figures, which at first was pretty cool (Blake, Tecumseh, Harrison) has really started to get tiresome. I put up with John Adams and Daniel Webster as essentially being placeholders in 4&5. I put up with the long ridiculous asides with Adams mentally stacking himself up to the other statesmen, which seemed to me just another way for OSC to explain to us that he hates Thomas Jefferson. I put up with Balzac and Audubon, because at least they had some funny lines. But here, we have Abe Lincoln playing no useful role whatsoever, and Jim Bowie as a one-dimensional bully. Either give these people some life, or just use one of your stock puppet characters instead; you can't make a character instantly interesting by making them a famous person.So now, looking back on it, the progress of the Alvin Maker series gives me context: I can see why I had slight misgivings with the Ender series. It's because the ending sucked, and all the things which made the first two books so good is just gone in the last two. Same for the Shadow series. There's nothing worse than an author who can't fully develop their good ideas."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"I have been a huge fan of card for over 20 years, but this book is horrible.

The answer is a definitive \\"YES\\".This book follows Alvin as he leads a group of runaway slaves to freedom and Calvin and Arthur Stuart on a foray into Mexico. The narrative is ham-handed and preachy, and the introduction of potentially interesting characters, like Abe Lincoln, is handled very badly. The main characters are not developed any further, and subplots and arcs which may have turned interesting are abruptly dropped or fade away.Alvin's brother Calvin was set up as the villain in the last couple of books, but this subplot is allowed to fizzle out and Calvin fades away into the background. A hero is only as good as the villain is bad, so this shows that Alvin is no hero at all. In fact, as in the last book, Alvin is downright annoying.Don't even get me started on the golden plow.... \\"THAT'S IT??!!\\" is the nicest thing I can say. If there is a seventh book in the series, I will not waste my time."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"This book, the sixth in the Alvin Maker series, is just as entertaining as the first five. I enjoy Card's style of writing and like the fact that he creates a historical science fiction so well. In this story many of the characters of previous books are reintroduced and the author, at times, only gives vague information as to their history in the story, so I don't suggest that anyone read this if they haven't read the other five (but of course the others were great too so there's no reason to not want to read them). I do feel that this book has less of \\"something,\\" but I'm not sure what exactly it is. I do still advise people to read it, especially if they're wondering what will happen to all these folks in the next book."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"I disagree with some of the people who reviewed the other works in this series. They did what teachers do. They analyzed the books to the point at which they drained the pleasure from the reading. I think that the entire series needs to be read and considered as a single body of work.Crystal City is amazing fantasy. It continues a story that teaches a lot about slavery and prejudices in early America. Prejudices that continue today. The story also teaches a lot about native America lore, beliefs and practices.My ONLY complaint is that Orson Scott Card did not complete the series with this volume. He obviously left room for another volume.A good friend told me that these stories portray Mormon philosophy. While it is true I need to be hit over the head with a sledge hammer to see symbolism, I have NOT seen it in the series. Maybe I don't know enough about that religion!"},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"This is an epic quest journey, somewhat akin to Stephen King's \\"Dark Tower\\" series, but without the overwriting that makes Mr. King's books lethal weapons if dropped on your foot. This is a fantasy that takes place in an alternate America, one in which some people have \\"knacks\\", that is, the ability to do unusual things . Our hero through the six books of the quest so far is Alvin Maker, who can do a lot of things very well, but he's burdened with an overcautious conscience, that often propels him into trouble, and keeps him from using his \\"knacks\\" to extricate him from these troubles. I like the series because we meet historical characters in often quite different contexts from their historical reputations, and the geography of the country is greatly different from actuality. It's a tale worth telling, and a tale I enjoy very much reading!"},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"This book is about a man called Alvin Maker who is filled with magical abilities and trying to find out what to do with his life. It takes place in 'a magical America that might have been.' Along with his wife and friends he meets along the way, he strives to build 'The Crystal City,' or the city of Makers. The only problem is no one knows how, including himself.If you liked the rest of 'The Alvin Maker' series, you will enjoy this book as well, but if you haven't read the series, I advise you not to read this book just yet as you won't understand a lot of it. In my opinion it was an excellent book. The way Card changed America in the book is very interesting and the storyline is original and great. Overall, it was an incredible book."},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"Of all the books in the Alvin maker series, Crytal City is by far the worste. The reasons for this are two fold but in essence you get tired of Alvin's Whinney attitude throught out the entire book.He is almost afraid to do anything for fear of corupting someone with his powers.Their is almost no mention of the unmaker in the book. Hence Alvin has no real villian to pit himself against. As such the book becomes a moral dialogue about the wrongness of slavery, bigotry, and discrimination.As such the story gets bogged down in values. Values of an America that never was.Safe travels:David"},{"Title":"The Crystal City: The Tales of Alvin Maker, Volume VI","review":"Overall I gave the book a good rating and if you've read all the rest in the series until now then you should read this one too.

However, if you insist on doing so, you can still do much better than \\"The Golden Hawk\\". I recommend \\"The Saracen Blade\\" instead. It shares with \\"The Golden Hawk\\" (and apparently many if not all of Mr. Yerby's novels) a multiple-women-vying-for-the-hero plot and the occasional passages of purple prose (really just soft porn). Yet \\"The Saracen Blade\\" is better researched and a far more interesting and plausible story.The plot of \\"The Golden Hawk\\" (as with \\"The Saracen Blade\\") is depressing -- even somewhat nihilistic -- and it's that fact, and the almost complete lack of humor in the story, and certainly in the protagonist, Kit Gerardo, that keep me from recommending this book, or the work of Frank Yerby.Lovers of historical adventure will do much better with the works of Rafael Sabatini, Baroness Emma Orczy, and Alexandre Dumas. All three authors put the reader into a well researched and illustrated historical time and place, but offer far more enjoyable plots, with adventure, romance, heartbreak and sadness, nobility, triumph, and humor.I also strongly recommend Anthony Hope's \\"The Prisoner of Zenda\\" and Sir Walter Scott's \\"The Talisman\\", \\"Quentin Durward\\", and \\"Ivanhoe\\"."},{"Title":"The golden hawk","review":"I first read this as a teenager 50 years ago, along with many of Yerby's other books.Yerby was indeed a pro and master of his craft, small wonder that his novels were bestsellers in their time.Sadly, his time has passed. I recently reread The Golden Hawk and The Saracen Blade. Romance/adventure plotlines come off as corny by today's standards, overall style is quite dated.Still rates four stars.

With contemporary deficiencies a given, I definitely recommend his books to HF fans."},{"Title":"The golden hawk","review":"Golden haired Kit Gerado is filled with all kinds of lust. There's his lust for revenge against the Spanish grandee, Don Luis del Toro. There's lust for wealth from the Spanish Main as he goes gadding about in his pirate ship. There's lust for the flame haired Rouge, a rape victim who turns pirate herself to exact revenge against all men. And there's lust for Bianca, the delicate betrothed of Kit's mortal enemy. Bianca falls in love with Kit after he does such romantic things as holding her hostage on a cesspool of an island where she's almost raped, is eaten up by tropical insects, and nearly becomes lunch for an alligator. I ask you, how could she NOT love him after all that?As typical in Yerby yarns, the women show their affections for their men in subtle ways like shooting them in the head, whipping them, or testifying against them in court so that they're pronounced guilty and sentenced to hang.Add to this epic battles both on the sea and on land, capture, torture, a daring escape, and a smattering of actual history and you have a rollicking romp of a story."},{"Title":"The golden hawk","review":"This is a wonderful book.

But then I realize that he is just a poet and is probably suffering his own distasteful form of ennui as I am. But he is a good student and probably punches a clock every morning before his organic toast and orange juice and rolls up his sleeve to do some gritty hard labor at the typewriter. After all, he's produced 501 sonnets here in what 55 minutes? Don't get me wrong, he is one of the better modern writers of the sonnet, I just don't buy his 69 year old angst. This coupled with the fact that he bungles so many good starts with half-thought pearls that go to soft matter in a spance of ten syllables and more often than not sticks in stilted endings that don't properly body the &quot;carriage of rhythm&quot;, that I feel nauseated and throw the book down to the floor. I just think he writes for volume like Bukowski did or Berryman in his later before-suicide-tomes and that it somewhat hurts the work in that anything goes and nothing is spared. As a result there are many shining points, but mostly of zarconia rather than diamond light. That said, I just as eagerly pick it back up the next slosh and go-around in the tub hoping for some sparkling moment and sometimes find it, albeit not to the grandeur of say Berryman or droll Cummings, but I find them nonetheless.&quot;Why can't I sleep?

The content of many of the poems contained in this book is similar to the great beat poets of the 40's and 50's. While the poetry rarely contains the anger found in Ginsberg's poems, the language occasionally lapses into crudity. Therefore, it may not appeal to all readers, but for those who want a down-to-earth picture of life presented in, of all things, sonnets, this book is definitely worth your time."},{"Title":"Access 97 Developer's Set","review":"I've bought every edition of the Developers Handbook since Access 2.0, and convinced every employer of mine during that period to buy a copy, too. I used to be amazed at how I could look for the solution to some Access problem in three other books and never find it (or even clues that helped!); then I'd look in Getz et al and find the *exact* solution, on a silver platter.In the past few years, I'll admit, I have on a very few occasions looked for something I didn't find. Once the answer was there, in quite thorough form, but I missed it because I looked in the index instead of the table of contents! The only reason I even mention this is that the Developers Handbook is the *only* technical book I've ever come across from which I have, almost subconsciously, begun to expect not just excellence, but PERFECTION! I realize how terribly unfair this is, but I can't help myself.I'm pleased to see the scope of the Developers Handbook being expanded into SQL Server and Visual Basic, since high-end Access development can no longer be done in isolation from those tools. Having a resource like this one provided by Ken Getz, Paul Litwin, and Mike Gilbert is far from the worst reason you could have for choosing Access, SQL Server, and VB over some other set of tools.If you're a developer and value your own time, you'll want this book. If you employ developers and you're lucky enough to have one or two who will actually *use* a book if it's available, buy this book now. The only way it won't pay for itself is if *nobody* ever opens it. And I'm not even sure of that.

The material is presented with a first person view. The &quot;Event Model&quot; is broken down so that you really know what happens when you create event driven functions. Coverage of VBA classes is a charm. An entire chapter for printer control is an award winner. I can't sing enough praises of the Access Developer Handbook. Pick up a copy and you'll see for yourself. Note: The book assumes you know some VB or VBA, and a light knowledge of the Access environment.P.S.

Great chapters on string handling in the enclosed VBA book as well.Werd."},{"Title":"Introducing Existentialism","review":"I am a big fan of the \\"Intrudicing...\\" series. I think that Appignanesi has done a marvelous job in editing this series, and in fact has done something socially and intellectually important by bringing these books into the world. Furthermore, his Intruducing Freud was great.However, this book was stunningly bad. Rather than share with us the major tenants and concepts of the major thinkers of Existential Philosophy, Appignanesi chose to take us on a \\"personal journey\\" of his, wherein he confronts with us the contradictions, paradoxes and impasses that make up existentialism's concerns. Which ended up being the author sharing his many personal thoughts on the subject, in the most confusing and convoluted manner possible.Let me give you a quotation from the book, as an example: \\"What is freedom grounded on? Satre replies: on the nothingness of consciousness which effects a \\"psychic gap\\" - and imaginitive distance - between myself and the world of non-conscious reality. Out there is only an undifferentiated plenitude of Being-in-itself whose material resistence to me gains form and significance by my activity of consciousness. The person is solely this act of Being-for-itself, hence its terrifying freedom.\\"Yes, that is Appignanesi talking, not Sartre. And no, context does nothing to improve upon its needless opacity. The entire book is like that, throwing in complex concepts like \\"Being-in-itself\\" vs. \\"Being-for-itself\\" without explainging them at all, and then throwing in something like \\"freedom\\" on top of it out of nowhere.Clearly he is a very learned man, with tremendous depth of knowledge, and many talents in thinking and writing. However, he seemed to take this book as an opportunity to show us how god-awful deep and serious he is, and the tremendously overwrought gravity of his own reflections. As well as to show us all how tricky he can be with language, and how he is at least as smart as Sartre, and possibly smater than Husserl too. A shocking amount of the book discusses Appignanesi's own opinions about the nature of existenced, rather than elucidating the fundamental concepts of existentialism. Not to mention (and yes, this part is perhaps the most astonishing) a photo of Richard Appignanesi's face appears on nearly every single page! (Looking quite deep and troubled, I must say.)I just have to say, Richard, hey man, guess what: yes, many of us have gone through depressions and dark periods in which we have deeply questioned the very nature of reality, and the value of continuing to live. But that doesn't mean that your every rumination on the subject is of interest to the rest of us. If it helps, picture me picking my nose. This activity and the results it yeilds are usually of great interest to me. But this does not mean it is interesting to everyone else! If you want to write a book about the deep thoughts of Richard Appignanesi, that sounds great. However, the title of the book should then be Introducing the Deep Thoughts of Richard Appignanesi, and not Introducing Existentialism. Unfortunately, in that you yourself are the editor of the series, there was no one to tell you this. Perhaps we will both get lucky, and someone will direct your attention to this review. I invite you to take the book out of the series, and either re-write it, according to the advise you probably give to all of the other authors in the series, or, better yet, have someone else write it. There would be no shame in this act. The presence of this book in the series diminishes the efforts of the other authors whom you have edited, and cheapens their work. It would be the honorable thing to do. (Perhaps even Sartre would agree.)"},{"Title":"Introducing Existentialism","review":"I recently became a big fan of the Introducing series, but I'll have to say that this book is both frustrating and disappointing. I do not know much about Existentialism (hence why I bought the book) but I can point to what appear to be some problems with the book with what little I know. For example, the book spends a lot of time concentrating on Husserl, who is arguably not an existentialist philosopher. One of Sartre's central concept of \\"bad faith\\" in mentioned only once on page 19 and is not really explained. The famous \\"Existence precedes essence\\" quote of Sartre is nowhere to be found. There are probably other major concepts that are missing or not clearly explained, but again, I don't know enough (perhaps even less!) about the subject after reading this book.Another criticism is the style. Most of the Introducing books tend to go in chronological order or in some logical order showing the development of a particular subject. This book is framed more as the author's own journey into solving particular puzzles that are supposedly connected to existentialism, but it in no way elucidates the subject. It jumps from subject to subject, few of which appear to deal with Existentialism in any way (or in any way that is clearly explained). The writing style tends to be a little thick and phrased in such a way to make the meaning more obscure (e.g. \\"Heidegger rightly means that the 'crisis' of science is not its own but ours by unmindfulness of how science came entirely to occupy our horizon of 'being in the world'.\\" p. 59). It reads like someone trying to make a simple concept sound more profound by superfluous wording and meaningless analogies. It's like the really pretentious guy at the cocktail party who tells stories about himself and make everything that happens in his daily life sound like an epic of spiritual fulfillment.In short, this is not an introduction. Without knowing any better, it appears to be the author's attempt to explore what are probably no more than footnotes of Existentialist philosophy and perhaps some of his own interpretations of what other philosophers saw or meant. I did not buy this book to read someone else's dissertation on some marginal concepts. I want to be spoon-fed the basic concepts as conceived by the principal philosophers of the subject. The Introducing Philosophy and even Wikipedia provide a much better overview of the subject in a few pages than this book."},{"Title":"Introducing Existentialism","review":"First, of all, I agree with just about everything that READER \\"READER\\" had to say about this book (except the part about the nose-picking - that's a word-picture that I just didn't need).When I picked up the book, I immediately thought, \\"Who is this guy on the cover, and why does it look like he's trying to do a really bad imitation of Johnny Cash (ie, the Man in Black)?\\" I had to go to the reviews at Amazon to find out! Once I found out, the question shifted to \\"What does this guy have to do with anything?\\" The answer, as I found, was nothing much. Although obviously an intelligent man (with the long-suffering face of a constipated bloodhound), Appignanesi really should stick to editing. I wanted/needed a book that would explain the finer points of Existentialism to me. I ended up with a book that led me meanderingly through one man's personal diary of angst and philosophical confusion. I closed the book feeling as if my brain had been pounded with a flannel-wrapped sledgehammer. Blech!To be fair, Zarate's illustrations are top-notch. I got quite a chuckle out of seeing Sartre with his pants down. (As I turned the page, I prayed Appignanesi wouldn't follow suit....)Do yourself a favor, bypass this book totally. Pick up 101 Key Ideas: Existentialism (Teach Yourself series) instead. Cheaper, and much, much more bang for the buck.Oh, and by the way, wanna find out more about despair and ennui for real?

While it does offer an interesting comic book style history lesson into the arguments of/between existential phenomenology and phenomenology, it moves so quickly that the subtle differences between them seem blurred as the subject changes from page to page. If this book is used, I'd reccomend supplementing it with some other introductions into both existentialism and phenomenology. I'd reccomend Existentialism: From Dostoevsky to Sartre for an Existentialism only introduction. I'd then reccomend further reading into phenomenology, the main difference being that phenomenology tends to believe that all concepts, not only objects, can be proved indefinately. Although, Husserl differed from this, leading into existential thought.

As a non-academic, I found this rather murky reading. It could be that the series title: 'Introducing' did not actually intend the material to be \\"introductory\\", but I certainly took it as such. Thus the lower rating; (2 1/2), if I were able.The general character of the book, especially in the art style, (I felt), focused so very much on and of 'despair', that I couldn't help but think that, despite (likely) being MILES ahead of myself at the level of intellect and analysis, I daresay the author himself, (Richard Appignanesi) may have missed the 'point' of existentialist thought, which (I) take to be:* \\" 'Who we are' is based on the choices we make; that 'who we are' is 'up to US'; overcoming ourselves.\\" *Again, perhaps too basic for his seemingly (to me), hyper-complex palate.Having said that, I did not come away from the book without gleaning some \\"knowledge\\", and despite the aforementioned \\"murkiness\\", I DID find it quite interesting; more however as a personal existentialist journey than an introduction to the concepts of existentialism.

I picked this book up at my local bookstore and thumbed through it quickly. Seeing pictures I naively assumed it was laid out more like a graphic novel, and thereby an \\"easy read\\". Not so. I was expecting clear definintions and a buildup of theories and ideas but instead was thrown headfirst into Nazi occupied France and bombarded with seemingly unrelated events and people who I guess are pioneers of this philosophy? As in my title, I think I should feel pretty smart if I can just make it to the end of this book and have a fraction of an understanding of what existentialism is. If not, I'll at least expand my vocabulary use. Unless you are a college graduate, you'll need a dictionary to to follow along with all the verbage, and maybe even wikipedia to lookup all the people referred to so you'll understand how they pertain to the story."},{"Title":"Introducing Existentialism","review":"Please, please if you're considering reading this book.......go to your cupboard and pull out every box of cereal you can find and simply sit down and read the nutritional info for each: the reading will be much more interesting.

It outlined complicated concepts taught by the existential philosophers including Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre and Camus. The authors used cartoons to express the abstract philosophical concepts brilliantly. If you are writing a paper on any of these philosophers where you have to compare and contrast their ideas, I recommend this book. It helped me understand the subtle differences between Husserl and Heidegger's philosophy more clearly so that I could write a comprehensive paper on them with confidence. It also explained German terms such as \\"Gleichschaltung\\" through pictures and captions."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"As both a booklover and mother of young children, I find Michael O'Brien's book gives me a great starting point to know how to steer my children into literature which not only nourishes their brains and imagination but their spirit as well. Frankly, it's hard to know where to start, and as O'Brien puts it, most parents know something isn't quite right with some books but find it hard to put one's finger on it.The best parts:1) O'Brien does not downplay the attraction nor importance of imagination and fantasy writing, something which some might completely quash in their fear of where this can take youngsters. Instead, O'Brien speaks of the importance of this, of symbolism, imagery etc which can contribute to our understanding of our place in the 'bigger story' of life and of the battle etc. However, his analysis of HOW literature can influence our imagination, understanding, and moral formation is wonderfully discussed. Feel free to disagree with his opinion about snake/dragon symbols (I personally suspect O'Brien is more correct in this than not) but at the very least, he gives pertinent arguments and the tools to help discern what is good, bad, and more or less desirable together with the or the downright dangerous.2) The appendix at the back is FANTASTIC, although not extensive, especially as it details books for every age group. - Probably the main reason I bought the book.The worst bit: The appendix is so long that the actual book finished much sooner than I expected which was disappointing. However, I found more of this in Michael O'Brien's subsequent book \\"Harry Potter and the paganisation of culture\\" which looks more extensively at other literature, film and such popular occult fantasy such as the Twilight series and others. Both together are a good pair.As a voracious reader, I started to read some \\"classic\\" novels in my youth that very easily could have led me astray - and had begun to. It was a God-send to me that an older and much respected friend of the family (normally very gently spoken) called these books 'RUBBISH' in such a vehement manner that I never read one word more from them ever after. As mortified as I was (I was actually recommending them to my best friend in with the secret intention of appearing very intelligent and sophisticated to everyone, including this older gentleman)he promptly bought me back to earth which I will be forever grateful for! I include this anecdote purely to convey the importance of adults, parents, friends, whoever, to positively assist the young in their pursuit of GOOD literature and shunning the bad. And being able to back our opinions up rationally if need be. If we don't, who will? I don't want the media and world view shaping my children. I want them to be able to think for themselves and judge according to God's standards.O'Brien's book gives much food for thought and inspires us to feed our children with truth, beauty and goodness whilst also understanding the battle we fight against the opposite. Thanks Michael O'Brien, and more please!"},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"This book is written for parents concerned with the not-so-blatent messages that our kids are receiving from movies and books.

Why waste time on the bad or mixed when there are plenty of good ones to fill our shelves?O'Brien's critiques of specific books and movies help sharpen a parent's awareness of the messages in various media that is being taken in by our kids, allowing us to better filter those messages in accordance with our values.When I first read his critiques of movies I had greatly enjoyed as a child and teenager, such as \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Aladdin\\", I was defensive and found myself wanting to dismiss the points he brought up. However, I realized that I had been influenced by those films the way I didn't want my kids to be influenced (sympathizing with the protagonist and then seeing everything they do--right or wrong-- as either acceptable or excusable).The list in the back of this book is particularly helpful for discovering quality books for specific ages."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"Michael O'Brien's work is all too rare. At first it is hard to believe that we and children are so vulnerable to the confusing attepmt to resymbolize good and evil in children's stories across the dominant media. However, the strength of our sleepy disbelief is simply wiped out by the delicate yet forceful sanity of his arguement, that of an experienced and gentle father, as well as, perhaps, the potentially historic writer of fiction he is in his own novels for all ages. He speaks with the moving poetic authority and conviction of the good, exciting and troubling real experience required to make any arguement as sound as his actually is."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"I purchased the book primarily for the book list. But so many of the books are out of print, they are sold only as used with no review, no picture of the cover, you would just have to go on faith that the author was right.Also, I searched the list for something with a Native American theme, there was very little. The book list is for a very \\"White\\" audience, not much diversity.The author strikes me as rather a strange person, isolated in his conservatism.I ended up purchasing books by authors I already knew, Virginia Lee Burton, James Herriott, Rosemary Wells.The main part of the book was just strange and the book list turned out to be almost useless."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"This is book makes Catholicism look bad. Rooted in fundamentalism, this piece takes a stab at the first amendment of the US constitution and tries to claim that binary dilliniation of everything is good. Well, I'm sorry but some things are not all good and all evil. Mankind has created enough of each though. Those that follow these similar mentalities are the same people who are willing to murder eachother and violate their own religious laws to make a statement that their religion is better than someone else's. They are the terrorists, they are the suicide bombers. We don't need this in America. These people think that there is no medium, they think that everyone else is evil. By teaching our children only unconditional love and unconditional hate, they do not learn how treat everyone else as \\"thy brother (or sister). They learn to respect only those exactly like them, and they go off and join the KKK or something. In an age where parental fundamentalism is spreading like a plague, we need to remember the goal is peace. Freedom of religeon and expression is what make America great, and this book uses that freedom to protest it's existance."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"Mr. O'Brien's treatment of fairy tales, Tolkien and Narnia is interesting and informative. His list of recommended books at the end is very useful. However, he is too rigid in his interpretation of dragons. Dragons are not necessarily symbols of Satan. What about the dragons in the Psalms (in some translations at least) that are exhorted to praise God? It would be unfortunate if children, on Mr. O'Brien's advice, were to be denied the pleasure of reading &quot;The Reluctant Dragon.&quot; Or Laurence Yep's Chinese-dragon series. Or Patricia C. Wrede's delightful &quot;Dealing With Dragons&quot; and its sequels. There is nothing harmful about these books, or about Madeleine L'Engle's, Lloyd Alexander's and Stephen Lawhead's fantasies, all of which celebrate virtue and the victory of good over evil."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"I am thoroughly impressed with O'Brien's thoughtful dissection of children's literature. The status quo mentality for most children's books is currently along the lines of \\"This is great! Children will love this! It's getting them to read!\\" As an elementary teacher, it is tempting to buy into that enthusiasm for any book series that children are eating up. But the author shows tremendous insight by pulling back the curtain and asking, \\"At what price?\\"It is a fascinating premise for a book. When you look at how radically literature (and films as well) have been altered over the last 50 years, it is certainly time we start questioning where we are headed. In the forward, David Sloan states, \\"In this collection of essays, we are not told where that line is; we are told how to recognize it.\\"The book's thesis is excellent, and he works hard to persuade us without coming across as damning or alarmist. There are some places where I felt maybe he was being too sensitive, but then I just had to ask myself if being too sensitive to sin was a bad thing. The cohesiveness of the essays is somewhat disjointed; there is not much connectivity between the different chapters, which can be a little jarring. A brief summary of some of his key points, paraphrased in my own words.-The dragon, a centuries-old Western symbol of evil is being made into a friendly, misunderstood creature.-Children's moral compasses are still developing and need literary characters that exhibit heroic virtue. Their young minds do not understand flawed heroes.-That being said, they are very drawn to rebellion and dangerous things because they see them as cool, often wanting to emulate behavior of their favorite characters.-He discusses Disney movies for quite a while, concerning how the movie counterparts of classic literature have been changed to reflect less virtue.-He examines several popular science-fiction authors (including Madeline L'Engle-who I loved as a kid) and the subtle New Age influences they slip into their writing.-In his conclusion, Are Christians Intolerant? (great title) he reasons that yes, we are, and that it is good to be prejudiced against harmful things the same way it is right for a mother to be biased against snakes, wolves and other predators.-An outstanding reading list is provided at the end. What an enriching resource! Almost 100 pages of reccommended lit for children, teens and adults. This tremendous list made my wife decide we needed our own copy of this book.It is interesting to note that some of the most convincing examples of twisted children's literature and film are not even mentioned in this book, because they hadn't yet come to the author's attention. Published in 1998, Harry Potter was just starting to take off, and the phenomenally successful Shrek movies were yet to be released. When you think about how these two characters appeal to children, I became pretty convinced that O'Brien was certainly on to something. In that sense, I believe his book will continue to be prophetic of what we are to see unless we start making more conscientious decisions as consumers.And that's what I enjoyed the most about \\"Landscape with Dragons\\" -that it empowered me to make my own decisions awarely; I didn't feel the author was trying to convince me to read the same books as he did, watch the same movies, and banish anything heathen from the home. Instead, he encouraged to look deeper. Look beyond the surface. I don't think I will read books or watch movies the same way. This book has given me another lens to look at literature and film through, another tool to appreciate their worth (or lack thereof). I would definitely reccommend this for any parents and teachers who have ever read a book and felt \\"Something is not quite right with this.\\" This book just might open your eyes to what that something lying under the surface is."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"I enjoyed this book. Not being Catholic, there were a few points on which I disagreed theologically with the author. However, for the most part, I found both his worldview and his musings on the decline of western culture thought-provoking and accurate. This being said, I actually purchased the book based on recommendations of the wonderful 90+ page booklist in at the back of the book. There is a warning at the beginning of the booklist, that some people might not find every book in the booklist appropriate for their own children, and I must say that is a very true statement. For example, one book recommended for young children focuses on Buddhism and reincarnation, and another is about a million cats fighting and destroying each other until only one is left. There are numerous examples like this. While I do think the author does a great job of alerting parents to some of the problems we face today in choosing children's literature, I think the author could have done a better job in creating his list, or at least, putting a brief warning on books containing material that some Christian parents might find objectionable. It makes me wonder of he even read all the books he listed! As the author stated, making sure our children grow to be healthy spiritual creatures requires constant vigilance. Another good list of a 1,000 books for children--also containing a some questionable recommendations-- is located at [...]. There is quite a bit of overlap between the two lists, and this list is free."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"This book has wise guidance for parents who suspect that something has gone very wrong in what our culture serves up for consumption by children, but are not quite sure what it is or what to do about it. O'Brien reveals the pagan themes that are increasingly dominant in children's literature and films, discusses why they are destructive, and offers constructive alternatives. Especially illuminating (and entertaining!) are his analyses of the Disney films of the last 25 years. Included at the end is a very extensive list of recommended books for children of all ages. My only complaint is that his analyis is largely limited to the fantasy/science fiction genre of children's literature which is, admittedly, the most popular. But I would have been interested in his analysis of other genres, say historical fiction or (non-fantasy) adventure stories. This complaint is not decisive because O'Brien not only gives examples of dangerous literature, but educates parents to analyze literature for themselves."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"When I first started reading, I thought that O'Brien was just being an alarmist. Having heard his full case, however, I must agree with what he says. This is a must-read for all Christian parents."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"This book has cropped up so many times in so many different conversations, that I realized I had to read it. Now that I have, I am of the opinion that every Catholic parent, teacher, or serious writer/artist ought to read it as well. Agree with Mr. O'Brien or not, his argument is thought-provoking and requires serious reflection.In brief, \\"A Landscape with Dragons\\" posits that much of the literature meant for our children today is demythologizing in nature in that it inverts the classical symbols of Christianity so that the scary is made to appear friendly, the dangerous is made to appear misunderstood, and the diabolical is made to appear harmless. Meanwhile, the good is made to appear hypocritical, the holy becomes buffoonish, and the pure becomes boring. The end result of this trend is the creation of de-Christianized, re-paganized children and ultimately, the warping of society's moral sense.O'Brien's initial concern in \\"A Landscape with Dragons\\" is the representation of serpents or dragons in modern literature as friendly, good, or tame creatures. He posits that this trend turns on its head the scriptural symbolism of the serpent/dragon as a representation of the devil. But his central thesis goes well beyond this. O'Brien points out that much of what the world presents as \\"the good\\" or \\"conventional wisdom\\" is actually gnosticism, thinly disguised:\\"If you watch this, you will know more, be more grown-up, more smart, more cool, more funny, more able to talk about it with your friends. Truth is what you believe it to be. Right and wrong are what you feel right and wrong are for you. Question authority. To become what you want to be, you must rebel. You make yourself. You create your own reality.\\"If these messages sound familiar, it is because you probably read them in the book of Genesis: \\"If you eat of the fruit, surely you will not die. You will become like God, knowing good and evil.\\" It's hard to deny that these messages saturate children's books and movies and such sentiments are often found coming out of the mouths of the \\"heroes\\" of these works. O'Brien rightly points out that these tantalizing ideas are infinitely more damaging and destructive than overtly evil messages that are easily detected.So parents need to be vigilant to make sure their children aren't ingesting harmful messages with their tacit approval. O'Brien understands that this can be an arduous task, but provides a helpful scale for parents to rate materials aimed at their children. He then goes through several popular books and films and analyzes them according to this scale. As A Landscape with Dragons is now 12 years old and was written before the Harry Potter phenomenon, the books and movies O'Brien critiques here are a bit dated: A Wrinkle in Time, The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, the Goosebumps series, etc. But his thesis is solid, and I think the majority of his points are well made, even if he does carry them a bit too far in spots.Lest he be accused of double standard, O'Brien also critiques the works of Tolkien and Lewis using the same criteria and highlights several questionable passages, particularly in Lewis's Space Trilogy.O'Brien is not merely a critic, however. At the end of the book, he provides over 100 pages of suggested reading material for children and families, compiled by the good folks at Bethlehem Books. He also offers parents some guidelines for how to determine if a book is good for your child to read. Here he includes one bit of sage advice that is often neglected--pray about it. This section alone is worth the price of the book in my opinion.My feeling upon completing this book is that Michael O'Brien is on to something. Does he go overboard in spots? Yes. Is he perhaps overly scrupulous? Maybe a little. But his central thesis, buttressed in many places by Aquinas, Chesterton, Lewis, Tolkien and others, is hard to deny.This is a long review and really, it only scratches the surface of this discussion. In short, if you are a Catholic parent, read this book. If you are a Catholic writer or artist, read this book. If you are a Catholic scholar studying literature, philosophy, or theology, read this book. It is that important."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"I found this book to be an eye-opening study on the effect and presence of neo-paganism found in pop culture and children's literature. Especially noteworthy is the section on Disney's animated films, in which O'Brien calmly and rationally analyzes and exposes certain trends in these films. This book will be particularly appreciated by parents, but it is also a fascinating read for students such as myself, and all those interested in culture and media."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"Very helpful with its list of recommended titles, and very educational as to what to look for in books for our children."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"Very insightful! I have yet to read a Michael O'Brien book and be dissapointed! This has changed my perspective on appropriate books and movies for my children. We cannot take anything for granted with raising our children. I definitely recommend this book to any parent striving to live their Catholic faith and raise their children accordingly."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"Mr. O'Brien explains what makes fairy stories good or bad. He doesn't tell you what to read or what to avoid, he tells you how to know yourself if a book is good or if it is to be avoided. If you have ever felt uneasy about something your children were reading or watching on t.v. but you weren't sure why you felt uneasy, YOU NEED TO READ THIS BOOK! Even if you have never felt that way, you need to read this book!"},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"In this volume, Michael O'Brien has provided both and invaluable service to parents (like myself) who want their children to read, but who are also concerned about much of the reading material currently available. He has analyzed children's literature, concentrating especially in the genre of fantasy and fairy story. He has clearly and cogently demonstrated how neo-paganism has become the dominant worldview of many authors in this genre.Unlike many Christian authors, O'Brien has not made the mistake of throwing the baby out with the bath water. He does not lump all fantasy literature together in one category and toss it out. He carefully demonstrates the difference between good and bad fantasy literature, or, if you will, authentic and inauthentic fairy stories.I do have a few points of contention, but they are minor, and detract very little from the overall value of the book.1) CS Lewis is identified correctly as an Anglican -- a member of the Church of England -- but incorrectly as a member of that church's Evangelical wing. Lewis, in fact, attended a &quot;High Church&quot; parish, and strongly resisted political factions within churches.2) JRR Tolkien is correctly held up as the model by which modern fantasy and fairy story should be judged. Having said this, very little actual analysis is provided for Tolkien's writings.3) Similarly, in the book's &quot;blurb&quot;, Charles Williams is held up -- but then not analyzed in the text. An analysis of Williams would have made O'Brien's concerns about Lewis' novel &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; make more sense. (I'd still disagree with O'Brien on this one, but his case would have been stronger and easier to sensibly defend.)4) O'Brien's analysis of Anne McCaffrey's &quot;Pern&quot; stories needed either to be fully developed, or eliminated entirely. O'Brien is using the image of the dragon as a neo-pagan symbol as one of the cornerstones of his book, and tries to place McCaffrey's &quot;good dragons&quot; within this context. To me, it was unconvincing.Overall, an excellent book. As a final note to parents, O'Brien has helpfully added a lengthy appendix listing good (and usually available) books for children of all ages, arranged by level of difficulty and author. An extremely helpful resource for homeschooling parents."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"An excellent and inspiring book. I use the word \\"inspiring\\" in the old fashioned sense of \\"it made me take action\\" not merely \\"it made me feel good.\\"I re-read this book every year or so, not only to dip into the wonderful appendix of recommended books, but to rekindle my courage and dedication to raising my sons. O'Brien writes in mythic tones as he recommends mythic literature. The old stories dealt with \\"powers and principalities\\" of good and evil, and O'Brien reminds us that it is ever so. Our children become flush-faced and wide-eyed at such stories, but we have allowed ourselves to be diluted and deluded into thinking that gray is the only reality. We lose not only black and white, but the primary colors as well!O'Brien is a Catholic, a Christian - and is both unapologetic and unobtrusive with his convictions. That is, he makes clear the traditional rationale for his thinking, but the reader neither has to agree nor adopt those convictions to come to the same conclusions.There are some books which one revisits again and again, and some authors you look forward to meeting and talking with. This book (and his Sojourners novels) and this author are in that category."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"I'm a single twenty year old who has no children. I had read all of O'Briens fiction novels and was thirsting for anything by Michael O'Brien. So I bought A Landscape With Dragons and read it twice over completely enthralled with what I was reading. All of my sneaking suspicions and intuitions about the culture I basically grew up with were not only confirmed, but were enfleshed, and brought out in way that was spiritually horrifying yet courageous in Michael O'Briens sustaining, powerful, sinewy way. But again, as in all of O'Briens work, one is thankful that he doesn't simply do right-wing hugging. No, he convincingly calls us to prayer and implants succesfully, as always, that ferment and spear in our conscience. Chesterton is always for me, a huge formation in the way of looking. O'Brien is always for me, a huge formation in the way of seeking sanctity in order to be looked upon."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"O'Brien has issued a wake-up call to conscientious parents in his latest book. We cannot take it for granted anymore that the entertainment aimed at our children is worthy of their attention. In fact, it may be harmful. The classic stories which teach us about good and evil (fairy tales, myths, classical literature) are being replaced or modified. The Dragon, the symbol of evil or chaos, is being tamed, leaving our children's souls in danger. O'Brien cites many examples of this in popular books and movies. I found his take on Disney movies very insightful and a little scary. Disney invariably belittles authority and religion, especially Catholicism. Yet this company is the world leader in feeding our children their steady diet of movies and videos. One only has to watch the Esmeralda dance in &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; to question Disney's idea of 'family entertainment.' O'Brien doesn't leave you in the lurch, however, as he helps us discern what is good entertainment for our children. He also provides a comprehensive list of good literature -- and, thankfully, there's a lot of it out there. I hope every parent and educator reads this book. It is too important to be missed."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"The essential message of this book is that minds are at war for the redefinition of the way you and your children will think, and by implication, children of generations to come.Traditional fairie tales expressed the influence the unseen world has on the world in which we live, but did so within the framework of a clear understanding of good and evil, right and wrong. Today's fairie tale is blurring the defining lines between these elements and creating a powerful, new (yet ancient) understanding that is degrading moral conscience and inviting young people to explore powers traditionally understood to belong to the 'dark side'. They even encourage friendship with any 'good' denizens of that dark side.The original edition of this book was sub-titled &quot;Christian and pagan imagination in children's literature.&quot; The second edition more clearly focuses on the immediate problem with its sub-title, &quot;The battle for your child's mind.&quot; I read the original edition and was thrilled with the clear presentation of the dangers. This second edition is even more in-depth in its handling of the concepts and issues.The reviewers of this book who speak negatively seem the rightful victims of the very forces exposed in the book. They give clear evidence of missing the point.The point is not, &quot;Are all snakes bad? Aren't any dragons good?&quot; The point is that there is a malevolent mind, unrelenting, intent on destruction, at work at every level in our world, especially operative with tremendous effect in modern literature and visual media. To miss this point is to be a victim of the hypnotic forces of deception.Those who read C.S. Lewis's 'Narnia' series will remember the Marsh Wiggle who burned his own foot in the fire in order to break the witch's hypnotic power over them. This book will help you burn your own foot in the fire so you can wake up.Our culture is in motion, changing form, calling evil good and good evil, and many who are committed to 'good' are embracing the new forms as acceptable. When our culture has finally changed completely, will there be anyone there who will even know what happened?This is a vitally important book. It is sound, sane, insightful, spiritual, discerning, and will enable readers to establish and maintain oases of light in the new dark ages that are already upon us. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"Michael O'Brien presents a text written specifically for parents who are concerned or questioning what children should read. He creates a ranking system that can help guide a parent's thinking. He also gives numerous examples and details on how to rank books and to discern the content. O'Brien specifically address Christian and pagan influences in children's lit.I am a divinity school student studying religion and literature, with a special emphasis on children's/teen's literature and spirituality. There is an abundance of children's lit that focuses on magic and pagan influences. There's also an abundance of children's lit that intricately mixes Christian and pagan worlds. O'Brien's book help his audience think about the complexities this can cause. And he does so in an objective and informed manner.How do you decide what is good for your children? And, when/if you allow them to read something which clearly has some or a lot of Pagan emphasis, how do you talk with your kids about it? O'Brien does not shy away from giving his opinions, but he also does not just slam the door on the discussion.Chapters one through three give PERSONAL reflections from a father's perspective and experiences of raising his children and struggling with various issues. Chapters four, five, and six really get into in-depth details and dilemmas. The latter chapters were most helpful to me as a student.As a big fan of C.S. Lewis and Tolkien as well as J.K. Rowling, I am always on the lookout for good books that provide a solid critiques about fantasy literature and spirituality. O'Brien certainly makes a positive contribution to the field.*NOTE* O'Brien's book was published in 1998. It'd be great for a new updated edition to come out and address Harry Potter as well as the Witch's Night Out series, which makes Harry Potter seem like the last thing to be concerned about. It does not particularly focus on the Harry Potter series, but identifies several books in children's lit and breaks their storyline down thoroughly.I also think O'Brien's scale (Ranking books 1 to 4 in regards to Christian and Pagan trends) could be improved, but, with that said, O'Brien tackles a lot that others do not, so I can live with these needs for improvement!Lastly, O'Brien's attitude towards dragons in literature is harsh. He limits the image of a dragon to personified evil, though he does so powerfully. IF you can particularly look over his personal reflections and focus on the meat of the book in the latter chapters, then this is a great book. It does not \\"ride the fence\\" like so many other books attempting to address Christian and pagan influences in children's lit."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":". . .and other concerned parents who want their children to read good literature.Mr. O'Brien does a great service with this book by demonstrating the secular and pagan influences in much of what passes for children's literature these days. He carefully explains the difference (for Christians) between acceptable and unacceptable fantasy in a clear and cogent manner (and he sets quite a high standard!)Portions of the book could have stood more detailed analysis. I agree with a previous reviewer who suggested that the \\"Pern\\" series was given short shrift. I also disagree with O'Brien's analysis of C.S. Lewis' \\"That Hideous Strength\\". But these are minor points.Of special interest to the homeschooler is the detailed appendix which provides literally hundreds of safe and age appropriate titles for readers of all ages.All in all, a remarkable and timely book."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"Much of Mr. O'Brien's book is very interesting, and he is correct that how we use myth and legend reveals a lot about us. I found his comments about the movie &quot;Dragonheart&quot; very interesting. He also provides many good recommendations for parents. I depart from his reasoning when he seems to imply that if a dragon or snake is handled as a good character makes a book anti-Christian or anti-God. He seems to feel that snakes and dragons are inherently evil. He even comments negatively on people who keep snakes as pets (not something I want to do, but not because snakes are evil). Creation was made by God and has now fallen. No one part of creation is any worse than any other part (Acts 9: 9 -16). It is man's acts that are evil or good."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"When I worked for a Christian homeschooling program, this book was considered essential. It's reccomended in their catalogue, and they've quoted it in their publications. Michael O'Brien is a superb writer. His style is eloquent, charismatic, and compelling. While I haven't read his fiction,\\"Landscape with Dragons\\" stands as his definitive piece of non-fiction.First of all,it's worthwhile to cover this book's strengths. Many parents are unaware of their children's reading habits, or blissfully ignorant of them. After all,yaoi (homoerotic Japanese manga with male same-sex relationships) and slash fiction (homoerotic fanfiction about well-known characters,such as Frodo&Sam; getting passionate on their way to Mordor) are popular among teenaged girls--yet the Christian press is generally unaware (though Focus on the Family unsuccessfully whipped up hysteria about Harry Potter). O'Brien makes a strong argument about parents knowing what their children read&offering; guidance. He also argues-rightly-that Gnosticism has become fashionable in fiction,along with paganism. This was before the Da Vinci Code was a bestselling book. He sees the Gnosticism in Star Wars&the; amorality of recent Disney fare. One wonders what he'd think of the straight-to-DVD fairy tale sequels touted by Disney. Gnosticism presents the allure of secret knowledge,power,along with contempt for the physical world. O'Brien also sees the promotion of atheism in children's fiction-prescient,considering the atheism of Philip Pullman's Dark Materials trilogy,which has outright hatred for religion and God. O'Brien doesn't suggest censorship (like Laura Mallory on her crusade to ban Harry Potter from Georgia schools),but instead offers the alternative of parental guidance.Now,on to the weak arguments. O'Brien uses the dragon for his \\"a symbol can mean only one thing\\" argument. That works in propaganda,NOT art. For example,night represents darkness&evil; in John's Gospel,but it represents goodness&love; in Shakespeare's classic \\"Romeo and Juliet.\\" O'Brien makes the laughable argument that Disney's \\"Pete's Dragon\\" was the root of all evil,the radix malum,in that company. He also argues that Dungeons&Dragons; lures hapless children into the occult. D&D; is escapist fun;it's gone on for at least 3 decades. Most people haven't been corrupted by it. O'Brien counsels parents that if their children are into D&D; or questionable fantasy literature,they should engage in fasting. That strikes me as manipulative--and ultimately counterproductive. It's a misuse of Mark's Gospel passage about \\"driving out demons through fasting and prayer.\\" Turning D&D; (and according to O'Brien's website,now Harry Potter as well) into a reason for exorcism is ridiculous.Dungeons&Dragons; isn't a destructive habit like drugs or sexual promiscuity. He also counsels parents against innocuous books such as Ursula LeGuin's Earthsea series and Madeleine L'Engle's Time series. After all,Madeleine L'Engle is openly Christian,and her series is a different way of showing a Christian viewpoint.O'Brien's non-fiction introduction to fantasy literature is a good starting place. He has commonsense advice, and his writing is engrossing. \\"Landscape with Dragons\\" is like a seaport;it's a jumping-off point,but the rest you must steer the course yourself."},{"Title":"A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind","review":"Michael O'Brien, author of &quot;Father Elijah,&quot; now turns his hand to the theoretical side of literature - of Fantastic Fiction, in particular, in his worthy book, &quot;A Landscape with Dragons.&quot;Focusing on the image of dragon as evil incarnate, and modern society's movement towards &quot;cutesying&quot; of the dragon image, O'Brien touches on a very real and terrifying shift of moral view in our time. From &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; to &quot;Dragonheart,&quot; O'Brien traces literature (and film) from its excellent Christian viewpoint to the neo-pagan inverse of morality. He also includes words of encouragement and means of discernment for the concerned parent, as well as many pages of recommended reading in the appendices.However, O'Brien falls short in two major areas. First, he attempts to absolutely equate theology with literature, which is a false and forced conclusion. Secondly, he spreads his argument too far and thus too thin - and leaves several gaps in his rationale, which make his critique a lesser force against the societal dragon.To begin with the first: O'Brien tends to lean, at least in this book and on this subject, more towards the ultra-conservative point of view, seeing all literature as basically black or white, evil or angelic. If the morals are bad then the literature is as well. However, this does not take into account the hundreds of completely a- and immoral books written supurbly next to the hundreds of excellently moral books written excruciatingly. He makes no allowances for literary merit apart from moral quality.Likewise, although he is justified in fearing and condeming magic in practice, he makes two distinctions between the use of &quot;magic&quot; in Fantastic Fiction - either miraculous or demonic. He makes no allowances, nor does he touch on &quot;magic&quot; which is inherent (&quot;indifferent magic&quot; as it were), such as the &quot;magical&quot; element of fairies, or singing swords, or eternal trees.His argumentation, too, was too widely dispersed. He did not limit himself to solely tracing the use of the dragon image through literature, but looked at several different images through at least two mediums, with several tangental lines into child-rearing, the state of society, and discernment of spirits. While all of these are good topics to speak of, and are handled fairly competently in the book, they have little to do with his thesis and weaken the argument.Because of the broader nature of his argument, several important works are not mentioned at all. The most notible gap lies in his critique of Disney films, wherein he completely ignores Disney's most blatantly &quot;new age&quot; film, &quot;The Lion King.&quot; His critique of &quot;Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; also left much to be desired, since from his comments it appeared that he had not read the original work.This is not to say that &quot;A Landscape with Dragons&quot; is a failure - quite the contrary. Merely, I should have liked to have seen it a bit more thought out, a bit more tightened up, a bit more focused. As an means of encouragement and support to parents who rightly mistrust the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books, this is an excellent primer. But for those who have been reading in the genre and fighting for God's place back into this realm, his conclusions are often too hasty. Be that as it may, it is my ardent wish that &quot;A Landscape with Dragons&quot; may bring people to the Lord and spare a generation of children from the wrath of the dragon."},{"Title":"Playboy June 1969","review":"Many gorgeous women have graced the pages of Playboy magazine over the years, none more so than Miss January 1968, Polish American beauty, Connie Kreski.Connie was born Constance Joanna Kornacki to Stanley and Sophie (Sacilowski) Kornacki in Wyandotte, Michigan on September 19, 1946. She had two sisters, Margaret and Christine. Connie attended Our Lady of Mt Carmel High School in Wyandotte. She was a cheerleader and also worked as an usherette at the Wyandotte Theatre. After graduation, she enrolled at Mercy College in Detroit in their nursing program.Connie was discovered by a Playboy staffer while attending a University of Michigan football game.The blue-eyed, 5'5\\"\\" Polish Baltic blonde beauty was twenty-years-old when she was photographed for Playboy by Larry Gordon. The stunning photo layout included ten pictures of Connie. Her pride in her Polish heritage was apparent when she chose \\"Kreski\\" as a pseudonym for her pictorial.In September 1967 Connie left Michigan abruptly after her mother learned of her upcoming Playmate pictorial. A newspaper article at the time revealed Sophie Kornacki took tranquilizers to cope with her daughter's decision to appear nude in Playboy. For Connie, a two week holiday in London turned into a stay of more than a year. While in England she did some modeling, bought two Pekingese, and bumped into producer/director Anthony Newley in the elevator of the London Playboy Club, who immediately arranged for a screen test and signed her to the title role in his 1969 film, \\"Can Hieronymus Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe and Find True Happiness?\\" Connie was featured on the cover of the Londoner magazine and was photographed for Vogue by David Bailey.In tribute to her ingenuous, fresh-faced, nubile beauty, Connie was selected as the Playmate of the Year and featured on the cover and in a pictorial in the June 1969 issue of Playboy, which included seven photos taken by Mario Casilli. As Playmate of the Year, she received a Playmate Pink Shelby GT 500.Los Angeles Times writer Joyce Haber mentioned Connie in a newspaper column a few days following the sensational murder of Sharon Tate. Connie had been dating Jay Sebring, Tate's former boyfriend (and another victim of the Manson clan), but on the fatal night of August 9, 1969, for some unknown reason, Connie declined to attend the get-together at the Tate-Polanski house.Connie had several minor television and film roles from 1969 to 1977. Time Magazine mentions her as the girlfriend of actor, James Caan (\\"Show Business: Gentleman Jimmy,\\" Apr. 07, 1975). The article states they had been in a relationship for three years up until that time and that Caan's nickname for Connie was \\"Polish.\\"Connie eventually married Louis Edleman. Their son, Zachary, was born and died in 1987.Connie met an untimely death at the young age of forty-eight in Beverly Hills, California on March 21, 1995 due to a stroke. Her address at the time of her death was 9031 Phyllis Ave. #4, Los Angeles, CA, 90069.Connie Kreski was a rare and remarkable beauty and an inspiration to all Polish American adolescent males in the late 1960's.*****************************************Information from Playboy, January 1968:Moving Up in the World...our new year's playmate tests her wings from a nest all her own ...Connie Kreski has patterned her life style on the maxim carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero -- enjoy today, trust little to tomorrow. Miss January, who doesn't claim to be a Latin scholar, interprets this as a call to the active pursuit of pleasure. \\"I want to get out into the world and see and do everything I possibly can,\\" she says. When she was accepted as a Playmate, therefore, 20-year-old Connie acted on two of her immediate priorities: She moved into her own pad in suburban Detroit (her home town) and then flew off to London for two weeks. \\"London swings just as much as I heard it did -- maybe even more,\\" Miss January reports. \\"Just shopping for clothes could have taken up all my time if I'd let it -- the Mod shops in Knightsbridge sell the wildest outfits I've ever seen.\\" Now the possessor of a half-dozen new microskirts, Connie is one member of the young generation who doesn't believe in never trusting anyone over 30: \\"Men that age usually have resolved their hang-ups and are confident enough to be themselves. And that's fine with me, for it allows me to be myself.\\" And what is that self? Says the 5'5\\" beautiful blonde, \\"Just a girl who wants to live life to the hilt for the next ten years or so and afterward settle down to raise a family.Miss January 1968, Connie KreskiWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW35-23-36Height: 5'5\\"Weight: 118Birthplace: Wyandotte, USAInterviewAMBITIONSComplete my nursing studies, and then . . .?TURN-ONSBikinis and the beach.TURNOFFSFake people.MY IDEAL EVENINGA small party with fun people.FAVORITE PERFORMERFrank Sinatra.HIGHER EDUCATIONI'm enrolled at the Mercy School of Nursing in Detroit.MY FRIENDS KNOWMany people seem to think I'm a dumb blonde, but I'm smarter than most of the people who talk down to me.IN MY FUTUREI'd love to travel more and get married (maybe when I'm 30).Text accompanying the photos:*This sporting life: \\"I'm an outdoor girl and I intend to always stay that way,\\" says Connie Kreski, who exercises often for the sheer joy of it - and her fine form. \\"When I was in grammar school, I played basketball and softball, went horseback riding and hiking,\\" Miss January recalls. \\"I still like to try new sports.

After a few hours of packing, Connie said, \\"I hadn't realized just how much stuff I managed to accumulate over the years until I tried getting it all together.\\" When Connie arrives at her new address, date Larry gives her a helping hand with housewares, before he and Paul begin hauling in more formidable furnishings. \\"My friends couldn't have been more helpful,\\" says Connie.

When all her paraphernalia has finally been unpacked and is more or less in order, Connie changes into a football jersey she received when she was a high school cheerleader; then Miss Kreski and her friends relax after the rigors of moving day with an impromptu party.*One of Connie's housewarming gifts from the group is the Twister party game; above, she and Larry are competing contortionists, as Paul and Mimi watch the acrobatic action from a safe distance. After the boys leave, Mimi (who's accepted an invitation to sleep over) and Connie ignore the TV in favor of a serious chat, before bedding down after a hard day's night.**************************Information from Playboy, June 1969:Playmate of the YearJanuary's Curvaceous Connie Kreski, Well On Her Way To Cinematic Stardom, Now Reigns As The Premier Gatefold Girl Of The Past TwelvemonthBeauty and talent, particularly of the cinematic variety, abounded among 1968's delightful dozen Playmates. But editors unanimously concurred that our first was also foremost and hailed January's Connie Kreski as undisputed Playmate of the Year. Her ingenuous freshness and femininity, so apparaent in Playboy's photographic uncoverage, was immediately recognized by England's Anthony Newley as well. The actor-author-producer-director literally bumped into her in the elevator of our London Club a little more than a year ago: he screen-tested her the next day and signed her within the week for a title role in \\"Can Hieronymus Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe and Find True Happiness?\\" - the Freud- and fun-filled fantasy previewed in Playboy last March. Connie remained in London after her debut before the camera on the island of Malta. \\"I should have been born in London,\\" says 1968's choicest centerfold. \\"I love the people and especially the feeling of openness and space. There's grass all over the city. It's so much prettier than Detroit, my home town.\\" Connie's favorite relaxation in the capital of Mods and miniskirts was predictably pedestrian - walking in Hyde Park with her two Pekingese, Emil and Fang (\\"When somebody knocks on the door, Fang hides under the bed!\\"). Now back in the States under contract to Universal, she is improving her acting skills through intensive study with the studio's excellent drama coach, Vince Chase. \\"I guess I'll be playing teenagers for quite a while,\\" says Connie. \\"I look about fourteen in most shots but that's fine with me, because I know I can handle little-girl roles. Of course, I hope to get good enough soon to try my hand at more demanding parts.\\" Despite her sudden immersion into the film industry, she hasn't forsaken the live-for-today philosophy she espoused 18 months ago in her Playmate premiere. To guarantee some diversions from her work, her material rewards as Playmate of the Year will include a Ford-powered fire-breathing Shelby GT 500. As alternate transport, she may elect to use either her custom-built ten-speed Schwinn Varsity bicycle or her Harley-Davidson M-65 motorcycle - both, of course, like her new car, in Playmate Pink. \\"I'm an outdoor girl and I intend to always stay that way,\\" she told us last year, so she'll be given Hart skis, Henke ski boots and PK poles, and she'll be stylishly swathed for the slopes in a rabbit jacket from Alper Furs and ski fashions from Peter Kennedy; for riding back to the lodge, she'll have an Artic Panther snowmobile lined in leopardskin, with boots, from Artic Enterprises. Connie can also make the warm-weather scene in a wardrobe of Jantzen swimsuits, relax at poolside in a Calypso marina jacket and plumb the briny with a snorkel, Tahiti mask, Caravelle fins, Jaguar Club spear gun and Grisbi knife - all from U.S. Divers. Should she encounter any sharks - pool sharks, that is - a Brunswick custom billiard cue with monogrammed case should stand her in good stead, or she can bowl them over with a new ball, also from Brunswick. For her less strenuous activities, our winsome winner will be dressed in a combination of Aris custom gloves, forward-looking fashions from Walter Homes' Vibration collection and imported shoes from Thayer McNeil. To highlight Connie's on- or off-camera appearances, she'll receive a selection of Saunda cosmetics and a wardrobe of Brentwood Bellissima wigs, and she'll be further adorned with a Lady Hamilton diamond wrist watch, a gold Rabbit Pin with a ruby eye from Maria Vogt and an Azalea Pink Linde star-sapphire ring designed especially for our January jewel. Rounding out Connie's gatefold grab bag ia an AM/FM stereo unit from G. W. Electronics, on which - if her vocal attributes come anywhere near her visual ones - she may soon hear the finished products of her Monument Record Corporation contract. She can then toast her success with a full case of Paul Masson Magnum brut champagne - or write home about it all on her new Smith-Corona electric typewriter. With a nationwide tour of Playboy Club cities in her future, Connie now looks forward to the Stateside traveling she regrets missing in the past. \\"Outside of Detroit, I've only been to Chicago and Los Angeles,\\" she says. \\"I really haven't seen much of America.\\" Judging from public reaction to our winning Playmate's magazine and screen debuts, it's apparent that America hasn't seen enough of Connie, either.Text accompanying the photos:*\\"Circumstances have pushed me into acting now and I love it,\\" Connie tells us. Her new Playmate Pink Shelby GT 500 should provide attention-getting transportation to and from the Universal sound stages.*\\"The best part of film work is meeting really creative people,\\" Connie says, relaxing before a studio call.*\\"Being a Playmate, beginning an acting career, and now getting elected Playmate of the Year - it's all happened so quickly that it doesn't seem real to me,\\" Connie says. \\"With all those beautiful girls in competition, I find it hard to believe.\\" Considering Miss Kreski's manifest assets, her success seems not only believable but inevitable.*\\"Too many producers emphasize looks over acting ability,\\" says Connie. \\"I hope to combine both in my career.\\"**************************A list of Connie's film and television roles, 1969-1977, from IMDB:\\"Aspen\\" (1977) TV mini-series (uncredited) ....

A.E. Taylor is a true guide to what Plato actually says and provides useful classical context that will keep out the most egregious error. This is an essential volume in any philosopher's library.One of the greatest thinkers of the ancient world, Plato instigated groundbreaking inquiries into morality, ethics, and the quest for happiness that continue to inform and influence philosophical discussion today. In this outstanding work of scholarship, a renowned expert on Plato presents a scrupulously accurate historical view of the great philosopher's life and works. Distinguished by its dispassionate scholarly analysis, Professor Taylor's discourse is refreshingly free of the biases that have frequently tainted other studies.A brief introductory chapter acquaints readers with the known events of Plato's life. The author then proceeds to an illuminating examination of the philosopher's voluminous writings, including the minor Socratic dialogues, as well as such major works as Phaedo, Symposium, Protagoras, Republic, Phaedrus, Timaeus, Laws, and other influential dialogues. The final chapter, \\"Plato in the Academy,\\" attempts to pin down?with the help of some of Plato's former students, such as Aristotle the philosopher's beliefs about numbers. In a substantial appendix, \\"The Platonic Apocrypha,\\" Professor Taylor examines writings that have sometimes been attributed to Plato, including several letters, and offers cogent reasons for accepting or rejecting them as Plato's work.Praised by Dean William R. Inge of Theology as \\"a great book, an honour to . . . British scholarship,\\" this volume is an invaluable guide for students, teachers, and other readers interested in philosophy."},{"Title":"Plato, the man and his work,","review":"This review departs to some degree from the traditional amazon review. For those who are simply trying to decide whether to purchase this book or not I suggest ignoring my review and looking to the other reviews. I will list some of the pros and cons of this book as I see them but my review is aimed more towards those with a serious interest in Plato as opposed to those who are simply looking for a basic introduction to some of Plato's ideas.I think Taylor's book is worth reading whatever camp you fall in (despite some flaws). If you are new to Plato and are just looking for an introduction this book is probably as good as any and if you are a serious Plato enthusiast Taylor is still worth reading despite being a bit dated.I should also point out that I am not a Plato scholar so my review should be read as what it is: a review by a graduate student in philosophy with an interest in Plato but no real credentials.The first pro of this book is that it is one of the only books that deals with every single Platonic dialogue (I know Catherine Zuckert's bookPlato's Philosophers: The Coherence of the Dialoguesdoes as well but I have not read it yet). It is, therefore, good for anyone who is looking for analyses of some of the dialogues that are not treated as often in the secondary literature. This also allows A.E. Taylor to provide a unified portrait of the Platonic philosophy and to highlight themes which appear in all, or most, of the dialogues.One con of Taylor's method, in my opinion, is that he attempts to follow a chronological reading of Plato based on stylometric dating. Personally I think that the attempts to date Plato's writings stylometrically are seriously flawed (there is some evidence that Plato continually reworked his dialogues throughout his life which would make any stylistic chronology impossible).Unfortunately there is probably no other doctrine neutral way to date the Platonic dialogues (and any chronology based on doctrinal changes would wind up being circular). For the reader who is interested in this problem I suggest taking a look at the article \\"Re-reading Plato: the Problem of Platonic Chronology\\" by Jacob Howland. Not only does Howland argue that all attempts to provide a chronology of the Platonic corpus are seriously flawed but he also argues that this is not in anyway a hindrance since the interpretative method of reading the dialogues in conjunction with each other, so that they are each able to shed light on each other, tends to produce deeper and more interesting interpretations than the interpretations which attempt to determine the \\"development\\" of Plato's ideas based on a chronological reading. It might be helpful to give an example of what I mean. One of Plato's most famous doctrines is that knowledge is recollection. In the Phaedo Cebes describes this doctrine in this way, \\"According to this, [the doctrine that learning is recollection] we must at some previous time have learned what we now recollect. This is possible only if our soul existed somewhere before it took on this human shape. So according to this theory too, the soul is likely to be something immortal\\" (72e). Cebes takes the theory about learning being recollection to be a proof of the immortality of the soul. I have been told by those who read Greek that in this passage and the lines following Plato is contrasting and playing with the distinction between recollection (anamnesis) and memory (mneme) and that Cebes misunderstands recollection in terms of memory (something we have known at a previous time in a temporal sense rather than the a priori in the more modern sense). We can see this misunderstanding if we compare what Plato says about recollection in other dialogues. In the Phaedrus Socrates says, \\"a human being must understand speech in terms of general forms, proceeding to bring many perceptions together into a reasoned unity. That process is the recollection of the things our soul saw when it was traveling with god\\" (249c). Here we see that recollection is not the memory of things we saw in the past but rather the gathering of many perceptions under one common form. Plato, of course, still speaks of this mythically as 'when we were traveling with god' but it would be a mistake to take Plato's myths literally (it would take me too far afield to explain why I believe that). The point of all of this is that in order to pinpoint the mistake Cebes makes in regard to recollection as an error we have to read the dialogues together. We could say that the Phaedo is an earlier dialogue and that Plato changed his mind. But we have very little, if any, evidence for doing so (why could the Phaedo not be later than the Phaedrus in which case everything would be reversed) and we would have a much more impoverished understanding of a fundamental Platonic doctrine (the notion that learning is recollection); whereas if we read the dialogues together they are able to shed light on each other and give us a much fuller understanding of Platonic philosophy.There is also some evidence that Plato himself composed the dialogues in terms of tetralogies and there is clearly a dramatic narrative tying many of the dialogues together. It seems more logical to me to read the dialogues in terms of the succession Plato himself devised rather than relying on a dubious chronology (I believe Zuckert follows this method in her book and Joseph Cropsey follows the same method in his bookPlato's World: Man's Place in the Cosmos).A.E. Taylor wrote this book at a time when it was still widely believed that we could make some fairly solid pronouncements about the chronology of the Platonic dialogues and this becomes a central part of Taylor's interpretations since he believes, \\"To understand a great thinker is, of course, impossible unless we know something of the relative order of his works\\" (pg16). While this is, I believe, a flaw of Taylor's method it is not a terribly serious one and I believe most of what he says about Plato does not depend for its validity on the validity of his chronology. This should not be a reason to entirely avoid Taylor, therefore, but should be kept in mind while reading.Another con of Taylor's book, which is also a pro to some degree, is his tendency to read Plato anachronistically. There are two main ways in which he does this. The first is that he tends to read Plato in terms of Christianity, as for example, when he writes, \\"the ideal of Socrates and the Christian ideal are fundamentally identical\\" (pg192) or \\"The conception set before us in these pages is manifestly the Hellenic counterpart of the 'mystical way' of Christianity\\" (pg181). The good part about all this is that Taylor definitely recognizes a religious dimension to Plato's thought which is not always recognized by analytic interpretations of his philosophy but which is essential to a genuine understanding of Plato. When Plato claims that the objects of thought are the truly real in contrast to the objects of sense perception he is not simply devising a theory about predication, or the status of universals, and when he argues for the superiority of thought over sense-perception he is not simply making an epistemological argument about the sources of our knowledge. These doctrines are tied to what we might call a doctrine of salvation, or a doctrine about the ultimate human good. This becomes clear in the Phaedo where Plato argues, \\"the soul of every man, when it feels violent pleasure or pain in connection with some object, inevitably believes at the same time that what causes such feelings must be very clear and very true, which it is not...every pleasure and every pain provides, as it were, another nail to rivet the soul to the body and to weld them together\\" (83c-e). Taylor recognizes this religious dimension in Plato which puts him above many analytic commentators on Plato (an analytic philosopher might abstract the arguments about the immortality of the soul from the Phaedo and attempt to determine their validity without recognizing the Phaedo as a dialogue about how the philosopher should live in order to achieve the ultimate human good). But ultimately I think Plato's ideas have more in common with his own religious context (Orphism, Pythagoreanism, and even, perhaps Indian religions) than they do with Christianity. Taylor's reading of Christian ideas back into Plato leads to at least some distortion (this statement has to be qualified to some degree since Christian writers incorporated a great many of Plato's insights into Christianity which is almost certainly the reason for the similarities that do exist between them but the problem arises when the similarities are reflected backwards rather than forwards, i.e. when Christianity is read back into Plato rather than Plato being read forward into Christianity).The other way in which Taylor reads Plato anachronistically is the way he tends to see modern debates reflected in the debates taking place within Plato's dialogues (like the debate over the epiphenomenality of consciousness). In some ways it is good that Taylor reads current debates (at least current at the time Taylor was writing) back into Plato. It allows us to see the almost miraculous way Plato was able to anticipate nearly every important philosophical question in the entire history of Western philosophy.And there is certainly nothing wrong with reading Plato in the light of our current concerns. I think one of the reasons Plato speaks to us today is because he was, in a way, living in a time analogous to our own. We often tend to think of Plato as living at the beginning of Greek civilization because our historical record becomes scanty as we move backwards from Plato (particularly in the dark ages after the Mycenaean collapse but before the classical age). But in reality Plato was closer to the end of Greek civilization. The Greek religions were losing their hold on young minds who were filled with new scientific ideas (one sees this in a number of the dialogues: one sees it in the Pythagoreans Simmias and Cebes in the Phaedo who are already ignorant of the religious aspects of the Pythagorean school to which they belong, one sees it in the new scientific explanations that are being offered for the old myths as in the story of Boreas in the Phaedrus, one sees it in the demands made for rational defenses of the superiority of justice in the Republic since the religious injunctions are losing some of their force.). We too live in an age where a religion which has existed for two thousand years is beginning to lose its hold to some degree in the face of new scientific ideas. Plato was such a giant, I think, because he held onto both ends of the chain at once. He did not entirely abandon the religious teachings of the past but he rescued them from their mythical form and presented them in a form that was acceptable to the more scientifically minded (perhaps we are waiting for something similar). For an example of what I mean we can again turn to the Phaedo where Plato has Socrates say, \\"It is likely that those who established the mystic rites for us were not inferior persons but were speaking in riddles long ago...There are indeed, as those concerned with the mysteries say, many who carry the thyrsus but the Bacchants are few. These latter are, in my opinion, no other than those who have practiced philosophy in the right way\\" (69c-d). Plato does not reject the old mystery religions outright - he merely rejects their literal interpretation (if the reader is interested in my personal opinion I think the modern atheists make the same mistake when rejecting Christianity that Plato seems to be arguing against in this passage- that is, they view Christianity as if it was just uttering nonsense rather than speaking in riddles which have to be deciphered - they think that when they have rejected the literal truth of the stories of the Bible, for example, that they have thereby refuted Christianity). I think that Taylor sees all of this fairly clearly as well and he is to be applauded for that.But Taylor's method of reading Plato in terms of the subsequent history of philosophy, or of translating Plato's arguments and ideas into the terms of more modern philosophers is no longer the preferred method of reading Plato (for example, when he says that \\"for Socrates and Plato, no less than for Kant, immortality is a postulate of the 'practical' use of 'reason' (pg207), or, when he uses the intrinsic/extrinsic distinction in scholastic philosophy to explain arguments from the Phaedo (pg204)). These interpretations are not necessarily incorrect and certainly help the reader familiar with Kant and scholastic terminology to understand Plato's point but we can no longer assume that something as simple as the translation of Plato into Latin was in anyway 'innocent' or left the substance of Plato's theories intact. We can no longer simply read backward and assume that the tradition as it has been handed down to us, and which has been derived in large part from Plato, accurately represents Plato's own thought. I think Heidegger is largely responsible for awakening us in this regard because despite Heidegger's many flaws (both personal and philosophical) he really made an attempt to go back and read the Greeks on their own terms (before all the Greek terms had been translated into their Latin versions, and before the problems Plato was dealing with had been solidified in the tradition). Heidegger really is responsible for a revolution in the way we read Plato, at least in the Continental tradition, and Taylor's book seems a bit dated in comparison in my opinion. For the reader who is interested in some readings of Plato that I think are superior to Taylor's in this respect I would recommendPlato's Sophist (Studies in Continental Thought)by Martin Heidegger,Being and Logos: Reading the Platonic Dialoguesby John Sallis,Self-Knowledge in Plato's Phaedrusby Charles Griswold jr.,Plato's Parmenides: The Conversion of the Soulby Mitchell Miller jr.,Paideia: The Ideals of Greek Culture Volume I: Archaic Greece: The Mind of Athensby Werner Jaeger (the second volume is the volume on Plato but it will not let me link to it directly; just click on the little plus sign by the paperback version and it will expand and show all three volumes), andOrder and History (Volume 3): Plato and Aristotle (Collected Works of Eric Voegelin, Volume 16)by Eric Voegelin.Two more books I have read on Plato since I first wrote this review that I thought were excellent and definitely worth mentioning are:Plato and the Good: Illuminating the Darkling Vision (Philosophy of History and Culture)by Rosemary Desjardins. Desjardins offers a really interesting and exciting interpretation of Plato's metaphysics, which is, in many ways, quite different from the standard interpretations of Plato's metaphysics that you get in standard introductions, but which I think has a great deal of textual support in its favor. The other book isToward a New Interpretation of Platoby Giovanni Reale. Reale was part of the Tubingen school so he attempts to read Plato in light of the unwritten tradition but his interpretation of Plato's metaphysics is quite similar to Desjardins' in a number of ways.As a final word I will simply repeat what I said at the beginning: despite the flaws of Taylor's book which I have attempted to spell out in this review I think his book is still worth reading. Taylor is a good writer, he gets a lot right, and many of his interpretations are very thought-provoking. I simply suggest that the reader keep some of the limitations of Taylor's book in mind while reading."},{"Title":"Plato, the man and his work,","review":"If you want to understand Plato, I can heartily recommend a two-step process.First, read up on him in Copleston'sA History of Philosophy, Vol. 1: Greece and Rome From the Pre-Socratics to Plotinus.

It is not light reading lets put it that way. But if you can persevere and get through it you will learn a lot about Plato.The emphasis is on 'the work' rather than 'the man'. Taylor recommended biographies by Grote, E. Meyer, and his hero Professor Burnet if you want those biographical details.I read this book over an extended period of time while finishing quite a few other books in between. Having to read this book quickly like for a college class would in my opinion be a form of mental torture. There's too much information.I had already read some of Plato's dialogues plus the Timaeus and Critias, The Republic, and The Laws. Taylor's book is a good review and overview of those plus many others although The Republic is only talked about at a high level.Taylor saw three main phases of Plato's life:1) early writings which include the Socratic dialogues and some other books2) Academy period where writing slowed down a lot3) later writings which include The LawsThe Socratic dialogues were apparently written to preserve information about Socrates and may have been based on actual conversations with Soc.I still do not understand what the motivations were for executing Socrates. It sounds like he was feared by the authorities for some reason. This strange man chose to accept his execution rather than deny his principles even though he could have probably avoided it.Taylor says that Plato viewed the doctrine of the forms as his unique contribution to philosophy. I did not gain an understanding of the forms from this book but it sounds like Aristotle's Metaphysics may provide this.I'm most interested in the more mysterious and esoteric aspects of Plato's life and writings. However those are the very things that were never well known about Plato even during his lifetime.According to the legends Plato traveled to Egypt and experienced the Egyptian initiation process at some level as had Pythagoras. During those experiences the initiates came into direct contact with the mythological gods.I have read also that Plato was criticized by the other initiates for allowing some of what he heard in Egypt to make it into his writings. The initiates were sworn to secrecy and this type of information could become dangerous in the wrong hands. Perhaps The Parmenides contains some of those metaphysical secrets.Taylor provides one of the stupider interpretations of Plato's misunderstood and often contradicted Atlantis story. Taylor says Plato used the story to talk about events that happened during his own lifetime and Plato was telling history in reverse. This is an example of how someone like Taylor will try to answer mysterious questions by referring to main stream, orthodox academic sources.Even so it's hard to imagine how many books someone like Taylor must have read in his life.Taylor held Plato in very high esteem and considered Plato to be a literary genius but I'm not sure exactly why.Jeff MarzanoThe Secret Teachings of All Ages (Reader's Edition)Edgar Cayce's Story of the Old Testament From the Birth of Souls to the Death of MosesFingerprints of the GodsAtlantisInitiationInitiation in the Great Pyramid (Astara's Library of Mystical Classics)Fulcanelli: Master Alchemist: Le Mystere des Cathedrales, Esoteric Intrepretation of the Hermetic Symbols of The Great Work (Le Mystere Des Cathedrales ... of the Hermetic Symbols of Great Work)The Giza Death Star Destroyed: The Ancient War For Future Science (Giza Death Star Trilogy)Mythic Troy: The Complete Story Legend Archeology and IntuitionOccult Ether Physics: Tesla's Hidden Space Propulsion System and the Conspiracy to Conceal It (2nd Revised Edition)"},{"Title":"Business Communication, Anniversary Edition","review":"As a professional technical communicator, I found this book to be about middle of the road. The explanations are well done, but some of the cases are poorly researched. For example, in Chapter Five, an example letter has a product manager writing to a software vendor, asking that the program documentation be supplied. The software vendor responds that the programmers had somehow failed to write the documentation. This is nonsense; programmers don't write documentation, technical writers do. That aside, however, the good example/poor example format is very helpful to beginners. The section on oral presentations was very good, especially in the emphasis on audience research. The author again, however, undercuts herself by specifying \\"Windows-based presentation software\\", as if PowerPoint were the only presentation software on the planet, or as if it didn't run on the Macintosh platform at all.All in all, this is a good first start for a beginner, but don't take everything here as gospel.

The book is scarce today, likely because it can be seen as favoring or justifying slavery (it doesn't) or justifying the Southern cause (doesn't do that either). What it does do is help one understand how the non-slave owning Southerner was sucked into the maelstrom of the Civil War to serve as cannon fodder on the side of the South and how southerners of the time deceived themselves as to the justice of their cause. Understanding some of the intellectual approaches to justify human slavery that were used in the South before the Civil War, such as selective quotation of scripture, history and philosophy, may help people understand the intellectual discontinuities in nativist and similar movements in the United States today."},{"Title":"The Republic (Non Fiction)","review":"I won't waste time trying to summarize Plato's \\"The Republic\\". Most people (I would guess nine out of ten) who have read this colussus of classical philosophy, read it because they were forced to by their college instructors.

As one of those college instructors who makes their students read this, I always recommend this edition. Sterling and Scott's translation is as good as anyone else's, so why not save my students a few bucks?

Not to a literal Ruling Class or Soldierly Class. This is why the book still has value and freshness today. They're explicit about it, too. (An early mention in Bloom: \\"...First we'll investigate what justice is like in the cities. Then, we'll also go on to consider it in indivdiuals, considering the likeness of the bigger in the idea of the littler.\\" / 369a.) In no way do they mean to suggest totalitarianism on earth, but that the Soul must develop a Ruling Element. It's astonishing how so many take spiritual work in a literal sense. The book only was written as a guide to developing the Soul. The ancients in particular worked from the inside out. Only confused modern minds could take the huge ALLEGORY of this great work as a literal recipe for a society on earth (then knock it as being communist, ant-like, scary or whatever). And it is as funny, lively, clever and compelling as anything written today. Well, more so, of course. Talk about ant-like: this work easily beats or at least informs the best of today's work. I suppose it's only natural that ants misunderstand their view of giants. They should work harder, not at being clever, but at getting a better view. It's not that hard!

The Republic is a classic, and like Shakespeare, or the Mona Lisa, needs no review or comment. This is not to say that I agree with everything Socrates-Plato says, but that this book lifts you higher, weather you agree or disagree.Tom Griffith deserves an award for rendering a bouncy translation that makes the text come alive. This translation ranks among my favorites. Its strength is that it renders the Greek into a colloquial, conversational English, as opposed to the stiff and ossified academic dronings that make higher education such a joy!He follows the pattern set by Seamus Heany (\\"Beowulf), and J. B. Phillips (\\"The New Testament in Modern English\\"), where the language illuminates the text, and engages your mind. Too often, the translators' end product-the language-gets in the way of the ideas and joys of the text. I was able to plow through this book in a fortnight because the language flowed so well.I wish we could get more translators to get the gift of tongues, and to render these classic texts into the tongue of angels!"},{"Title":"The Republic (Non Fiction)","review":"Plato's famed Republic is that idyllic land where philosophical principles have re-formed human nature into something grander than ourselves. The fundament that underlies this golden state is an inquiry into the nature of justice, which Plato embodies in the Guardians of this state. They are the elite, a caste apart within the larger commercial society, in which \\"mean employments and manual arts are a reproach.\\" They lack any of the normal impulses that reward a citizen with love, family, and material comfort. Instead, they are a communalist group, in which even monogamy is too restrictive for the laws under which this elite must live. Eugenic officers put the best to the best to improve the breed, with the eternal goal of elevating this sub-race of gaurdians. Men who distinguish themselves, usually in war, are honored with their pick of the fillies, the only material reward they are allowed. Plato rarely mentions women except at the end of a discussion, with a phrase like, \\"Oh, yeah, and women too.\\" Presumably, the highest reward for a woman's service is her own say in the choice of stud.These Guardians, and this society as a whole, are maintained on a rigidly censored information stream. It is subject to broad blacklists, including whole rhythms of music, forms of worship, and essentially all of visual art. In fact, the latter section of this book includes a diatribe against representative art, abstract being unknown. Ivins, in his history of print and the spread of knowledge, claims that the Greeks' condemnation of visual art held back Western civilization for a millenium. They could have invented block printing, except that slave-copied manuscripts were so convenient, and could have created accurate image reproductions, except that philosophical purity raises one above the need to deal with actual objects in the physical world. Instead, knowledge lay locked in medieval scriptoria until Gutenberg and his motley crew set it free.My two biggest problems with The Republic, however, lie in its first and last sections. The first is a condensed example of more techniques of invalid reason than I have names for. Plato accepts the conclusion as premise, creates false dichotomies, terms the irrelevant as opposite, and generally displays every foul punch and groin kick of disputation that now grace our headlines. The student of debate where viciousness dominates reason must study these first fifty pages.The last section, of course, is the one in which Plato proposes the Noble Philosopher as the grand lord of his republic. These other-wordly beings would live in their cloister of Truth, occasionally to descend from their Empyrean heights to grace us with more of their dicta regarding the proper functioning of the world. One can only assume that Plato would have taken that burden upon himself.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Republic (Non Fiction)","review":"After reading The Republic in various translations over the years, I decided on this one for a high school course I will be teaching.

And that being the case it seems ridiculous to try and do anything more here than make a minor footnote to a footnote. The point as I understand it though of Whitehead is that if you wish to understand the basic terms and questions upon which the debates of the philosophical tradition are carried out you should know this work.I will make no attempt to summarize or to condense the many questions including the central one of the meaning of Justice and a Just Society which are at the heart of this work.I will just write down a few impressions, a few memories from the reading which took place many years ago .The first is that the work is conducted by a method of dialogue, what is called the 'maieutic ' method in which the philosopher Socrates the main character of the dialogues and Plato's great teacher acts as a 'mid-wife' bringing out the ' inherent truths ' in the mind of man through talking to others. It is all there in us pre- existent according to this view and the Truth simply needs to be brought out.This Truth however has a baffling meaning in the Central Myth of the Republic. This is the Myth of the Cave . The philosopher descends into the Cave and seeks in isolation to know the Ultimate Truth. But what he sees are the shadows of the shadows the fleeting images of sense which can hint at but not really convey ultimately the final truth. And the final truth in Plato's system and world is the Impersonal Abstract Idea which in turn is constructed of all other Ideas. It is as if we arrive finally at One but this one is not the personal G-d of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob but truly a God of the Philosophers somehow beyond and containing us all.At another level this is the great Political guide book of the Western world, and in Karl Popper's accusation the real blueprint for Totalitarianism and dictatorship. The three- part society depicted here is ruled in the end by the Philosopher- King elite, the know-it- alls who keep order by keeping everyone else in order. Liberal democracy is not Plato's final station for the Evolution of the Idea.All in all this is a too rich, too suggestive too meaningful work to write about seriously in a review like this. This work pervades the whole philosophical tradition that follows from Aristotle and through the neo- Platonists and on down to our own day.As for the dialogues and the figure of Socrates and Plato's relation to his own teacher these also are large questions endlessly explored and to be explored.Again who reads this work carefully has a real clue as to the nature of Western Philosophy. But who reads only this work knows Philosophy without the religious and ethical components the Biblical Literature will supply."},{"Title":"The Republic (Non Fiction)","review":"Excellent...very inexpensive. Great translation. If you need a copy of the Republic, GET THIS."},{"Title":"The Republic (Non Fiction)","review":"The Cornford translation of Plato is still one of the standards, even though other translations might well be better in this age. To get to the point: Socrates' greatest student was Plato. In \\"The Republic,\\" Plato, through the voice of Socrates, provided the keenest metaphor to describe his understanding of the problem cod defining \\"reality.\\" His allegory of the cave serves as the takeoff point. Socrates describes the situation to Glaucon thus:[Socrates]: Imagine the condition of men living in a sort of cavernous chamber underground, with an entrance open to the light and a long passage all down the cave. Here they have been from childhood, chained by the leg and also by the neck, so that they cannot move and can see only what is in front of them, because the chains will not let them turn their heads. At some distance higher up is the light of a fire burning behind them; and between the prisoners and the fire is a track with a parapet built along it, like a screen at a puppet-show, which hides the performers while they show their puppets over the top. . .Now behind this parapet imagine persons carrying along various artificial objects,including figures of men and animals in wood or stone or other materials, which projectabove the parapet. Naturally, some of the persons will be talking, others silent.[Glaucon]: It is a strange picture. . .and a strange sort of prisoners.[Socrates]: Like ourselves. . .; for in the first place prisoners so confined would have seen nothing of themselves or one another, except the shadows thrown by the firelight on the wall of the cave facing them, would they?. . .And they would have seen as little of the objects carried past. . .Now, if they could talk to one another, would they not suppose that their words referred only to those passing shadows which they saw?[Glaucon]: Necessarily.[Socrates]: And suppose their prison had an echo from the wall facing them? When one of the people crossing behind them spoke, they could only suppose that the sound came from the shadow passing before their eyes. . .In every way, then, such prisoners would recognize as reality nothing but the shadows of those artificial objects.Next, Plato has Socrates examine what happens if someone is taken from the cave out into the light of day. This person then comes to understand that all is illusion and shadows in the cave--whereas earlier that person had defined the images as reality. In this sense, through education, one could come to see reality and escape the confines of the cave. And when that person would re-enter the cave, he would realize the nature if illusions and be able to try to illuminate with his (or her) wisdom the lives of the people in the cave. This, of course, would be difficult since the denizens of that dark region would not themselves have directly experienced the light of knowledge.Who is best able to see what is outside of the cave? The philosophers, of course. Plato believes that there are absolutes, \\"forms,\\" out there in the \\"real world.\\" Circles that we humans craft can never equal the ideal type \\"out there,\\" what we might call \\"circularity.\\" There is an abstract idea of circularity, the perfect circle, the essence of circleness. This is the truth of the object. Only through training can a person begin to understand and appreciate these forms, these ideal types. Only those whose passion and talent is the pursuit of knowledge and who can come to possess wisdom are able to see these \\"forms.\\" Only then can the subject properly \\"see\\" the object, in this case circularity. Note, in contrast, the arguments by the Sophists that the subject is incapable of properly perceiving and understanding reality--even if there is a reality to be apprehended!And, in his metaphor of gold, silver, and bronze, Plato makes this even more explicit. Each person, he claims, is dominated by one of three elements--appetite (bronze), courage (silver), and wisdom (gold). It is in our nature at birth which one of these characterizes each of us. Only those whose central core is gold can ever hope to see the forms and understand the absolute truth that exists. The rest are, in effect, condemned to a life in the cave. Education is needed to take the raw material within a person and shape that individual's capacity to come to see truth, to apprehend the forms or ideal types.In the end, then, only a few can ever come to know reality. And it takes them much of their lives before they are adequately enough trained to accomplish this Olympian goal. It is unsurprising, of course, that Plato argues that these few, these philosopher-kings (or queens, since he accepts that women may be capable of these same feats of intellectual insight), should also become the rulers of the ideal society. That is the nature of his \\"Republic.\\"This is one of the great works of political philosophy. Its assumption that there is a \\"special class\\" suited to rule is open to question. His elitism will not sit well with many readers. The belief that humans can apprehend objective reality is also open to question. His sense that individuals are predestined to serve as \\"producers,\\" \\"auxiliaries,\\" or \\"philosopher kings/queens\\" (yes, he felt that women might become leaders, an unusual conclusion for the time) will not convince many contemporary readers. However, this is one of the standard translations and provides a credible entr&eacute;e to one of Plato's greatest works."},{"Title":"The Republic (Non Fiction)","review":"Cornford's translation is best, of the three I've read, for several reasons.First, the reviewers of the Penguin version express the shocking misreading and NONreading of Republic as a totalitarian or political manifesto, which indicates the forest being lost for the trees in the heavily over-annotated Penguin version by Desmond Lee.Second, this version omits all needless words. Gone are the politening classic Greek rhetorical flourishes; absent are the constant yes-yes-yes of Glaucon and Adiemantus. Single Greek words instead take single English equivalents. So the wholeness of the arguments shines forth and is immediately grasped, unlike in the classic Jowett version where everyone is so courteous it obscures the message.Third, Cornford is a scholar trained in the English system of the Classics, and as such enjoyed access to men who actually PRACTICED the teaching of Republic, an extraordinary rarity now the book is regarded and mistaught as an ancient political document.My experience is that the aim of Republic is to heal the soul of the reader by revealing the nature of the Good insofar as it can be revealed and demonstrating the order of goods in the healthy human soul. The politics exists to demonstrate this by analogy.Platonism enjoyed 1000 plus years as a system of education of the soul; it is therefore the most successful pedagogy in human history.If you miss the good of the book you have missed the book itself: on this rock is founded Aristotle's biology and ethics, Aquinas' natural law, and Freud's groundbreaking analyses of the nature of instinct:The three-part soul or instinct is the clinical basis of human nature and remains self-evidently useful as a tool for analysis of disorder in the soul and discovery of the Good.

His philosophy has endured throughout thousands of years, and has influenced almost every branch of Western thought - politics, philosophy, art, religion, morality, and so on. For a simple example, this is the man who talked about the immortality of the soul. An idea that is still alive in the everyday believes of Western civilization.Therefore, a reading of Plato is a must to understand, not only political philosophy, but Western thought in general.With that said, The Republic is his most known and important work. It is a Socratic dialogue (a discussion between a fictionalized Socrates (Plato's teacher) and other philosophers), where the main focus is reaching a consensus of what is \\"justice\\", as well as illuminating the ideal society. The Republic can be uninteresting in the beginning, and towards the end, but the work in general is interesting and thought provoking. Plato's style is simply, in my opinion, a joy to read.The Dover edition offers a cheap choice of the Republic, and I would advice it to anyone interested in reading it.

The first thing that stands out is that the book's layout is similar to a novel; this is unlike standard academic texts which have standardized line numbers. Furthering the novel notion, it appears that the book is edited to increase ease of reading, i.e., words and phrases are altered so it has better flow. Now, for many works, modernization is practical, but in philosophical literature alteration of the words of a text can drastically alter the message. Given that people dedicate their careers to translating Plato accurately, one should take translation issues seriously.This book is good for familiarizing yourself with the text for party type situations, however for any serious discussion a better version can be had.

Plato is and will always be up to date! I like this publishers books, they are nice and of good quality!"},{"Title":"The Republic (Non Fiction)","review":".This translation of Cornford is the best one that I've found for clarity and understanding. The translation itself is not exact or literal, as I find strict adhesure to the literal as corrupting the clarity with exactitude and awkwardness. No doubt if you rather a more exact translation then you must look perhaps to Allan Bloom's, which is totally a good one, and much more so it's the 100+ page interpretive essay of Bloom that makes his book totally worthwhile.Cornford further divides \\"The Republic of Plato\\" into 6 Parts with multiple chapters in each part! And to top if off with an introduction in italics before each new topic that he has divided into separate chapters. This is extremely helpful to piece all the thoughts together and I find it a hell of lot more helpful then the traditional 10 books/divisions found in Bloom's translation, and most others.You can't help but admire Socrates how he reasons so well how truth is always a paradox and not one-sided, as in that of justice verses injustice, how Thrasymachus argues the stronger are the ones who control and benefit, While Socrates argues the weaker are that ones that benefit from requiring the need of the stronger's art of practicing justice in order to receive the injustice he dominates from the weaker. It's incredible paradox and argument. Of course when the stronger becomes less strong and the weaker less weak a balance of justice occurs but not with radical equalitarian methods of communism or totalitarianism, but rather with wise Philosopher Kings and the Guardians that protect the society.Socrates government has some totalitarian attributes, as in the sharing children and censorship, while other aspects, such as the training of the Guardians, the Philosopher kings, and most assuredly, his analysis of comparison of oligarchy, democracy, timocracy and despotism, including the nature of individuals in such systems makes this highly interesting material. And none of Socrates words in Plato's writing and Cornford's translation are obscure and overly abstract. There is no Immanuel Kant language, or Hegel, here.What a great thinker Socrates was. It may be more accurate to say what a great thinker Plato was in his description of Socrates. His continual quest for truth, virtue and in the case of Plato's Republic, justice. At first his idea of justice is very noble and always intriguing, thought provoking and honorable. However, what begins as an intellectual idea of what justice is, ends up being a logically formed government that intellectually, or scientifically, measures, analyzes and controls the creativity of man, a government that epitomizes what centuries later labeled as the Enlightenment, which demystified the artistic man into a pragmatic and positivist being. While democracy based on a rational system of \\"rights\\" developed from the likes of Hobbes, Locke and Mill, what ultimately resulted was a Marxist censorship government of control that emulated itself much in line with this Plato's Republic, the extreme rule built on scientific and rational means of communism and totalitarianism.It becomes utterly frightening to hear Socrates speak so eloquently and intelligibly on what reads as good common sense of a cities justice, training, rule and protection that history has revealed as governmental experiments that were tried, tested, enforced, controlled and in turn, destroyed the chaotic, non-rational elements of creative value producing ability in human society. The results of such totalitarian and authoritarian regimes, all built on the seemingly rational and coherent science of common rule and radical equalitarianism have proved themselves horrendously disastrous.Some examples are: the youth should be trained as soldiers for the city. All scripture, the stories of Homer and the gods, must be censored and altered to shine only a positive or molded light that conforms to the leaders decision. The leaders, while only those of older age would be qualified, would receive a life carefully censored, trained and observed from youth, and would supposedly then become completely wise as philosophers kings, and in this way cannot bring injustice to their rulership. In addition, all music, poetry, art is censored. People who need lifetime medical attention should not receive such and die, (their much better off this way!) as they are nonproductive to the growth and science of what constitutes an ideal and perfect city.Socrates/Plato's descriptions of the two world view and the allegory of the cave are in themselves absolute masterpieces and have literally shaped Western civilization as we know it and are truly behind the majority of ideas and teachings we currently believe and are raised in.Ultimately, I found Socrates argument on Philosophy verses Poetry amazing and understand why Nietzsche completely rebelled and attacked Socrates. I then venture to the East as in the Vigyan Bhairav Tantra and Osho's commentary on such, as in some of Krishnamurti, Buddha, Krishna, Mahriavara and the idea of something beyond the mind/Apollonian/head rationalism of Socrates and the heart/Dionysus/emotion irrationalism of Nietzsche. To Socrates the mind and reason are superior to the emotions and feelings. To Nietzsche it is in the realm of emotions, in the passions of irrationalism and the art of creativity where the superior strength of man exists. To the East it is neither, but the mind and heart act as instruments of something of a Higher realm, the Consciousness or the Self, which exists outside the mind. Here I will agree with all three modes of thought: that fundamentalism and one-sided truths are bogus and for lower and ignorant thinkers. However, it was Socrates who failed to understand the depth of significance in the irrational, while Nietzsche recognized the foolishness and stupidity of biblical literalism and morality codes based on fundamental reasoning.The irrational is what molds the rational, while the rational chisels it's form. It's the passiveness of Yin and the tension of Yang, which when let go and surrender are simply the Tao.The ending of the Republic is worth the read. It is here Socrates supports immortality of the soul and reincarnation and it's amazing how you can see this is the precursor of the bible. The last book or account is symbolic and mythological on the pattern of the universe, the same as the book of Revelation is in the bible with its judgments of the just and unjust and depiction of a heavenly Jerusalem. Socrates also speaks of the winner of a race receiving the crown and the idea of Tartarus, as repeated in the letters of St. Paul. The men who wrote the bible and decided it's cannon are no doubt imitating the Republic of Plato, not to mention Dante and others who were heavily influenced by this book. And what a book it is!"},{"Title":"The Republic (Non Fiction)","review":"Translation is key when buying a book like this. The Republic is a must read for anyone and everyone, but not Dover Thrift.The translator Allan Bloom has served me well for the past 5 years."},{"Title":"The Republic (Non Fiction)","review":"in the Republic, Plato. envisioned his ideology of what a free and fair society should look like. the book emphasises on the perfection of a perfect society, which will be free of corruption, discremination, race division, and partiality.the author was aware of the alarming rate of corruption gripping the world we are in. he sketched a plan for a state to be run and maintained. a state that will based on law and order. specifically, Plato was hitting the nail on justice and equity of law, he stressed that a society should not be making laws based on a portion of the jurisdiction rather order should be maintained on equality and fair justice.The book is a treaty on how a social society and a normal state is to be ressuracted from the clamouring segregation of the rich state and the poor society. in his work of art plato pulls the trigger of justice towards equity, unity and peace of justice. its such a great book, it is more than the wordings on it because it contains ancient landmarks of literary work of art, the work has been done long ago, and it grammer complex needs not be rushed but remember that the day a man stops reading, he stops growing intellectually. how i wished books were paste. i could have kept reading each day first thing as i woke up from the sleep.

The true philosopher lives and acts based on these universal truths which are unchanging, universal laws.But what is this great knowledge ?I really didn't understand his point until the final pages, really the very last page.That's where he talks about how everyone chooses their 'geniuses' (guides) before they are born.Some are blinded by greed and lust so they choose to become tyrants in this life.Others choose more wisely such as the great adventurer Odysseus who, disillusioned with adventure, chose a simple life.So the point is the people who should be running society are those who have chosen wisely before they were born based on the great truths (justice, moderation, etc..)Then the sisters of fate weave everyone's choices together:\\"Mortal souls, behold a new cycle of life and mortality. Your genius will not be allotted to you, but you will choose your genius; and let him who draws the first lot have the first choice, and the life which he chooses shall be his destiny.

This work is an intriguing analysis of inequality in the world. It is also useful in that he also discusses all the problems with measuring exactly how much inequality there is between nations and even within nations.He begins by noting that the common currency for individual and national level income can't simply be per capita income, since some currencies have greater purchasing power than others. Even if one reduce all monetary systems to the dollar, the same problem exists. In some countries the dollar will buy a lot more because prices of goods and services are pitched so low; but if those people then go to the United States or Western Europe, their dollars won't go very far at all. So, Milanovic opts for what he calls \\"Purchasing Power Parity.\\"Then, he discusses various ways of determining the extent of income inequality within countries. Readers will be introduced to that hardy statistic, the Gini Index, as well as other approaches to the subject. The heart of the book is an analysis of global income inequality. One of his findings is rather troubling. Most countries never advance up the ranks from the lowest tier (4th world); more countries are apt to drop from higher to lower tiers. He traces the dynamics from 1960 to 1978 to 2000, and the picture depicted is not very pretty. The world is not becoming more equal in terms of income distributions within societies in the near past.He explores many other issues over the course of this book, but the preceding provides a clue as to what he is dealing with in this volume.His conclusion? Only a world government can attack global economic inequality. Logically, it makes sense. Practically, it has two chances of coming about--slim and none, and slim has left town (to use the old phrase). Perhaps readers will disagree with my assessment of the likelihood of this solution coming about. But that is the stuff of debate and discussion over important issues. Overall, not always easy to plow through, but it is an intriguing book and it raises quite a few issues that are sure to stir debate."},{"Title":"Worlds Apart: Measuring International and Global Inequality","review":"Anyone interested in the distribution of income on an international and world basis must read this book. It is a thorough and rich analysis of the topic. The best of its kind!"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"I was on vacation in Sun VAlley and bought several books and hated them until I found Missing Links. I counldn't put it down because of the humor. The characters were very funny as well as the situations they found themselves in. I read it everywhere I went for about 48 hours and my family wasn't mad because I had them laughing with me as I described it to them. I won't forget that vacation cause of the great book I found. Not many people can write funny books but Rick Reilly has a great talent. I can't wait for his new book to come out. I have never sought out an authors web site before but I wanted to let him know how much I loved his book."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"I've never laughed so hard over a golf book!

Exceptionally funny and believe it or not I learned to play golf on many courses not unlike Ponc. It made me miss my old &quot;Chop&quot; buddies from New Mexico and Denver. We actuall played a course that had drained water hazards with nuclear hazard signs warning the golfer not to retrieve their ball due to possible radio-active contamination. Of course we weren't about to let a little glow in the dark action keep us from our $3.00 Belata's! I could definitely relate to this book!

Reilly knows he's funny and shows it , but the sentimental parts of the book hit the bottom of the cup as well.If you don't laugh you probably flat-lined weeks ago.There's a good chance you'll cry as well , but laugh and cry is a cliche , and Missing Links doesn't fall victim to the cliche (sand) trap. Highly , highly recommended."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"This is absolutely the funniest book I have ever read.

Would not recommend to anyone who knows me and the style of writing I choose to read"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"I have always been a huge fan of Rick Reilly's work, but I was hesitant to purchase Missing Links due to my general dislike of fiction. However, I was shocked to see that, like Bob Costas' review on the front cover, it was almost impossible for me to put the book down. The story line was brilliantly executed, the writing was the familiar, witty banter that I'm used to from Reilly's ESPN columns, and it simply was a heartwarming story to read. I'm not even an avid golfer, yet I had no problem reading about the intricacies of the game, its players, and more."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"When this book was first published, I was working at a bookstore. This title became my favorite recommendation for men who came in looking for something to read. My husband, a golfer, had read the book, and he just loved it! So many times, I heard him chuckling out loud as he read the pages. The true test of a good book, though, is the fact that one recommendation turns into a chain. My husband shared the book with his friends and family, and they ended up buying copies to share, too. Customers that I recommended the book to came in and said, \\"I gave my copy away; I need another,\\" or \\"I want to buy that golf novel for a friend.\\" While this story could be one of those hokey, cliche novels, it is not. It has a good plot line, strong characters, and a balance of humor and sentimentality.Golfers will certainly appreciate the tale of these 4 fellows and their efforts to get into the swanky golf club next door. But the storyline and characters are accessible to even us non-golfers. You only have to be familiar with the sport, the fact that there are swanky golf clubs, and the snobbery to be able to get absorbed into this story.If you are looking for a light, entertaining, well-written novel, Missing Links is highly worth considering."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Great book, actually found in a used book store.

The first couple chapters were hard to get through but I wound up enjoying the book. I don't plan on reading the sequel though - I've had enough 'muni' reading. There are other similar books (The Edict, The best course that never was/the greatest player that never was) worth reading."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Back when Reilly was writing for the L.A. Times, he seemed destined to become the next Dan Jenkins. But he has spread himself way too thin, and now is a caricature of a sportswriter cartoon. The jokes in this self-assembling book seemed telegraphed by Western Union. And Reilly's well of ideas has run bone-dry. The book is like a really bad, really obvious sitcom. Time to click the remote."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"I read this book in an hour &amp; don't see what all the fuss was about. You see every joke coming - it's as if each one is picked off a joke factory conveyor belt. Rick Reilly has to be the most over-rated, over-hyped writer in the history of sportswriting. Missing Links made me nostalgic for a time when humor had subtlety and actually made me think."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Based on an article in the Wall Street Journal and the previous reviews, I bought this book and Dead Solid Perfect by Rick Reilly, for my father-in-law, an avid golfer and reader.

The real story was better than this made up trash....maybe i'll write a book some day."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Rick Reilly is a jerk and i am very angry for wasting my time reading this book and his article in Sports Illustrated.

He bad mouthed my favorite sports city therefore the book is boring!"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"This is by far one of the funniest books I have ever read.

In both instances, the characters were trying to meet a particular challenge. In Missing Links the challenge was to be the first to play a round in the elite golf course next door, where, I suppose, the grass is greener on the other side.This book was a perfect choice for summer vacation reading. Quite entertaining and not too taxing. Sprinkled among the details were allusions to local features that someone from the East and older than 40 would remember.I enjoyed the book and recommend it to anyone seeking light reading and entertainment."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Wow. I'm really surprised at all the positive reviews of this book. Did we read the same novel? I had to force myself to finish this, and I'm a big Rick Reilly fan. Another page, another recycled joke written a much flatter tone than Reilly normally uses. Maybe if he'd gone with a 3rd person perspective instead of a 1st person I would have been more receptive. As it was, I never really got the sense that this was a real person/character telling this incredibly predictable story. There are some nice touches in this book, notably when he's talking about golfing with his uncle and really developing a passion for the game. But, more than anything, those touches are way too few and far between. Unless I'd recently received some sort of lobotomy, I'd move on to different book."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"I haven't been reading many golf books lately, but I think Rick Reilly has just gotten my interest to a whole new level. You have to be patient with the book and forget your expectations, especially for those who aren't versed in Reilly-isms.

A great read, has all the characteristics of a classic golf story. Can't wait to read the sequel!"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"For a long time, I had one favorite golf novel: \\"Dead Solid Perfect.\\" I bought it in college and laughed so hard while reading it I had tears in my eyes.

The only chance most Ponky players have of seeing the Mayflower is through the hole in the hedge that separates the two layouts.From the origins of \\"the bet\\" to the conclusion of \\"the match,\\" this story kept bringing smiles to my face. The ending is perfectly in line with the characters, and as much as I might have hoped for something different, it fits like a golf glove.Some might see the foul language as a negative, but keep in mind that this is written about a sport that promotes cursing like no other. :)I highly recommend this book for golf fans, Rick Reilly fans, and just fans of enjoyable light reading!

I'm sure everyone know who Rick Reilly is, he is the ONLY reason to read Sports Illustrated. This novel is no exception to the Reilly Rule (Read anything he writes). I would read the phone-book cover to cover if he wrote it. Missing Links is the story of a group of &quot;chops&quot; that play on the worst muni in the country (Ponky). When I started reading it I was hooked right away, the characters are original and pretty funny as well. The writing is pure Reilly at his best, witty as well as poignant. I found myself laughing out loud on the NYC subway,which got me a few looks from the other passengers. I figured that the book would be just one big laugh. I was wrong there was actually a part or two that got you all misty! Still the events of the book are so funny don't be surprised if you miss your stop on the train or stay up all night to finish the book. My favorite part was how Two-Down got the Lexus! Pure Genius! Just take my word for it and buy it. You will NOT be sorry."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"The book Missing Links by Rick Reilly is a book about a group of low class friends who play at the worst golf course in America called Ponky. The group of friends, called Chops, loves their golf course even though it is inhabited by a sewage treatment plant and run down billboards, and where the cups are pulled out of the ground like volcanoes. Other than the Chops unstable jobs, Ponky is their life.One day while the Chops were playing a game with another frivolous bet on the line Crowbar, a fat chop who never plays golf, said something to disturb Hoover, a 120 pound die hard golfer. Hoover got so mad he took out his 16 foot ball retriever and swung it at Crowbar. Hoover missed and ended up making a large hole in a hedge through which they could see the Mayflower Country Club, the snootiest most exclusive club in America, right next to the worst course in the world.The Chops were mesmerized by the beauty of the Mayflower and Two Down made a bet where everyone put in [money]whoever played the Mayflower without any other Chops with them got the money. Everyone tried hard to get into the Mayflower, but the Mayflower only invites people with [money]who are the descendants of the people who came to America on the Mayflower. To find out what happens you will have to read the rest of the book.I recommend Missing Links to any golfer that has a good sense of humor.

Rick Reilly captures the fun, friends, and atmosphere of the game with amazing clarity. To capture this setting a certain number of off color words are required.Imagine my suprise when I bought the paperback version and found that it had been edited. Now we can ponder the deep literary meaning of the words &quot;frick&quot; and &quot;boink&quot;. Buyer beware! The paperback version is not the same.I have never known of a book to be edited between the hardback and paperback versions.

The bet ends up affecting their friendship and their lives. After many (often hilarious) schemes, things work out for our heroes. Reilly is best known as a columnist for Sports Illutrated and this is his first novel.. As such it is a great effort.

Although the characters and the situations are exaggerated, the story is good, funny and even has some moral value to it.I had two complaints that kept me from rating this book a \\"5.\\" First, the author tries way too hard to be constantly funny. Even though typical for this genre of writing, the non-stop wisecracks, witticisms and one-liners were, in my opinion, overdone.My second complaint was the extensive use of the word \\"frik\\" and its variations. I know very few golfers who use that word regularly. They either use the real word, or they use this polite variation on rare occasions. In this book, everyone uses the polite variation(s) all the time. Very annoying and very out of character-especially for the \\"chops\\"!!!Having aired these two grievances, I now suggest that, if you like golf novels, go get this one right now. Reading it will be time well spent."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"If you like golf or just a good funny read, this is the one for you.

They weren't. I loved it, although I did not find it as funny as some did. Actually, a few passages brought a tear to my eye. As soon as I finished it, I gave it to my wife, who has since passed it on to a friend of hers. Missing Links and Miracle on the 17th Green are now my two favorite golf books."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"If you play this crazy game, if you love to gamble on the golf course, and if you have a regular group you play with, this is one book you can't pass up. Once started you can't put it down. I found myself laughing out loud several times. I'm ordering a couple of copies for my golfing buddies right now!! I belong to a &quot;Mayflower&quot; type club but I still golf regularly with my &quot;chop&quot; buddies at another course. Read the book and you'll understand why."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"This book is exactly how it was descibed to me by fellow Amazon reviewers, impossible to put down. Reilly intertwines golf and life better than any who have attempted before. This is definitely a laugh-out-loud book and I just hope he writes another novel about golf."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"If you love golf and you want a great laugh, be sure to read this book. I know that you will find it more enjoyable than any instructional book on golf. A tale of friends whose home course is the worst muni course in the states and an ensuing bet they make to see who is the first to play an exclusive private club. If you play golf with a group of friends you will surely find one or more of them depicted in Reilly's characters. Found it much more interesting than &quot;Fast Greens&quot;."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"It's about time someone wrote a book as funny as Caddyshack! That comparison is most obvious after one reads the jacket of Rick Reilly's hilarious look at municipal golf, class envy, and the ecstasy known only to golfers as a good, long, hard driver. Non-golfers can pass on this book. Golfers won't be able to put it down. Witty, sharp, and full of new golf expressions (as if the game needed any more!), this book should not be passed up by any golfer who can at least read on a TV Guide level. Rick, we're anxiously awaiting your sequel!"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"One of a very few books that can make me laugh out loud almost every page. But there is no place in this book for the sobering and depressing family history, especially with regards to the main character's father and brother. Still, this book is a MUST read for all golfers, and especially those from Massachusetts, although I don't think it refers to Ponkapoag Golf Course, a muni in Canton, MA, but rather to Franklin Park Golf course in Dorchester."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"No doubt legions of readers will make a pilgrimage to the Ponky (if there really is one) much like baseball fans to the &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; in Iowa. Every chop in America can relate to the characters in Missing Links. The only difference is that the ones in my regular game don't have the integrity of those in the book. Highly recommend this book to all golfers with a sense of humor (or perhaps more importantly, to those who need one)!"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"All I can say is that if you are 30 something and play golf with the guys or gals every week, you HAVE to read this book! Not only is this the easiest reading book I've ever put in front of my eyes, it's also the funniest, the wittiest, and the most inspiring story of life I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Thanks Mr. Reilly!!!"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Thank you Rick Reilly. Your coverage of the game of golf throughout the years has always focussed on the true essence of the game: the passion it evokes. Your novel-Missing Links- was no exception. Missing Links demonstrated in a hysterical, yet often times romantic way how the game connects us all: rich and poor, scratch and hack, father and son, man and woman. Good writing."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Golf the sport is not in its truest form at Augusta National, or Pebble Beach, or Sawgrass. It is at its best on the everyday courses of America, where hackers try to keep their scores low and their blood alcohol content high.That is the world Rick Reily writes about in his unroarious book, Missing Links. Centered on the shenanagans of four duffers who try to play 18 on an exclusive course, the book is really nothing more than an insightful, biting look into America's real golf world. Let's face it, forks: there is a cementhead and a two-down at every public course in America.If you play golf- if you have seen golf-hell, if you know what golf is, you should read this book. It is absolutly hilarious, dead on accurate, and a joy to read."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"This book, dealing with a group of addled golfers and a hideous municipal course and their attempt to play the country club next door, should be on everyones reading list.Reilly's incredibly varied, vivid cast of characters bring to life this hilarious tale of class envy and the American Dream.You don't need to be a golf fan or even play the game to completely enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Missing Links has to rate one of the best book I have ever read overall. It is a witty and refreshing look at frienships and society in a golf surrounding.Mr Reilly has made numerous golf fans happy with this book. I am not sure he can come up with another novel of this quality (but I sure hope he does)."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"I don't know too much about golf but the descriptions of Ponky, the worst golf course in America, had me laughing out loud.The situations that the characters find themselves in, in an attempt to play at the exclusive Mayflower Club, are hilarious!I recommend this book to any lover of comedic fiction, whether you understand the game of golf or not."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"This was by far the most entertaining book that I have read thisyear! For any golfer from Hack to &quot;Expert&quot;, you will thoroughlyenjoy this angle. You will never see golf the same! Sure Winner!The book is a little slow in the beginning, but don't letthe first few chapters sour your taste buds! You will have ahard time putting it down! Rick Reilly comes from left field,but, most golfers will be able to appreciate his work!"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"This is the funniest, cleverest golf book ever written. Twice I laughed so hard I cried. Unfortunately, it was late at night and the shaking of the bed awoke my wife; she wasn't happy nor did she understand. Rick Reilly is the greatest; rated R"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Started reading on the plane from Detroit to San Antonio, by the time i arrived and was settled into my room, i didn;t leave till it was done..."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"I liked the book. I like Reilly's style, even as it borrows generously from Jim Murray and Dan Jenkins...I thought the characters were overly broadly drawn..having waited tables at a posh CC outside Washington for 7 summers, I can tell you I never ran into anyone like everyone he describes... the first several chapters, Reilly tries too hard... I almost put the book down... you don't need to make a joke every paragraph...once he got into the very appealing story, the writing got a little tighter... i think Reilly is pretty good at exploring what makes us tick and as such shouldn't feel the need to try to make us laugh every few seconds... this isn't a golf book... it's a book about relationships with golf as its cover... well, done, Rick... next time, write less self-consciously..."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Being an avid golfer and having been employed in the golf world I could not believe how repetitious and boring this book was. I could not finish it, nor could my girlfriend who has the same background as myself and was a reading teacher for 25yrs. There are much better books available and we found this purchase to be a total waste of $."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"This is just the funniest golf novel ever written. No questions, no other opinions necessary. If this isn't funny for you, you really don't understand golf and the people who play it. Rick Reilly does understand and has given us a wonderful collage of characters and feeling for the roots of the game. Please Mr Reilly, write us another one of these . . ."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"This is a very entertaining book (and not just for a golf book). Great golf, funny characters, an enjoyable story, this is an entertaining read. If you golf and you like to read (even if you don't like to read), pick this one up. (It is not for the young reader though. This book is as irreverent as any book out there.)"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"I paly the game of golf. There are many books about golf. I have read a lot of them, but not one like this. It has it alll, to the hacking gambler's, to the snooty country club members. The desciption of the courses makes you feel like you are right there in person. I can think of another non-stop, laughing story and that is Caddyshack. If you like this book then try The Glory Game at Goat Hill. I could not put this book down. I had too keep reading too see what crazy thing they did next."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"This book was great, it shows what a little friendly betting can turn into. It helps pass the time with fun but in the end only your true friends stick with you. It is all fun when you win little bets but everything will even out in the end. This book shows that in a fair way. While I was reading this book, it almost seemed like my friends of the past. Even though this was a story it hit close to home for me. This book like every book has a few stale chapters but it had more good chapters than bad chapters. The second half of the book went really fast, I couldn't put it down. It ended sadly, how Raymond Hart dated one of his friends daughters from Ponky. He friend went to the hospital to die from cancer and she left Ray a note explaining things.All in all, I am not much of a reader and I couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"The most hilarious, yet moving book about golf snobs and slobs. All hacks who have a regular team game, (with customary bets) will especially enjoy this story. Going to buy copies for all the duffers I play with."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"This is a very quick engaging read. I don't even golf but, I couldn't put this book down! I was up until 3am finishing this book! Have kleenex on hand. GREAT!"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Bought this book for a cross country flight and found myself laughing outloud in the airport!! My wife was truely embarressed!! An intriguing look at golf from the view of the municiple golfer just dying to get to the other side - &quot;the private club&quot;. Trust me, you will not be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"I loved this book and will undoubtedly reread it many times in the future - particularly when I need a lift or an attitude adjustment regarding taking my own play too seriously."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"This book will provide many laughs for everyone, golfer or not. Was a real treat to hear my wife (not a golfer) laughing out loud while reading links. Get it, read it, pass it on, you will not be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"This was one of the funniest book that I have ever read. The author turns a phrase better than anyone I've ever read. Go grab a can of fresly squeezed Bud and enjoy the laughs."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"The Chops are a group of friends who like to bet and play at the worst golf course in America in Rick Reilly's novel, Missing Links. The Chops' golf course is called Ponky which was built on top of a dump and has things like a nuclear waste plant in the middle of the course. The story goes on as the chops make a hole in a bush and see the Mayflower Country Club on the other side. This leads them to make a bet too see who could be the first to play this fantastic course. This bet could ruin the relationships of the chops or it could bring them closer then ever.I would recommend to anyone that wants a good laugh. I would not recommend it to younger kids because it has plenty of foul language in it. It has a lot to do with the fun side of golf not the technical side. Like the cover says it will take three burley men to get you away from this story."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Bob Costas is right, you can't put this down. Thank goodness my flight was delayed, because I read straight through (7 hours). Great story, great golf, great friends."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Reilly's blue-collar novel about a group of gambling-crazypublic-links hackers is the perfect read. You'll laugh so hard, youmight break a rib! This book is in it's 8th or 9th printing now.... I am reading Slowmo right now, and Reilly's takes are outrageously funny. Either as a gift or for yourself, Rick Reilly entertains."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"This is simply a great book for sports enthusiasts. I could not put it down. It is funny, entertaining and witty. A must read."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"This book would make a great movie -- it's a great read too, but this has the potential for being among the top golf movies ever..."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"I was on vacation in Sun VAlley and bought several books and hated them until I found Missing Links. I counldn't put it down because of the humor. The characters were very funny as well as the situations they found themselves in. I read it everywhere I went for about 48 hours and my family wasn't mad because I had them laughing with me as I described it to them. I won't forget that vacation cause of the great book I found. Not many people can write funny books but Rick Reilly has a great talent. I can't wait for his new book to come out. I have never sought out an authors web site before but I wanted to let him know how much I loved his book."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"I absolutely loved Missing Links. How many times have you ever laughed out loud while reading a book? It is a &quot;gimmee&quot; with Missing Links. This is a must read for any golfer! During the summer, I play the real Ponky in Canton, MA. I hate to say it but Rick did not exaggerate [that much] the dreadful yet comical playing conditions. On the same note, he also splendidly captured the true makeup of muni-hackers - bad golfers, good people. This book is a fun, quick read. The characters are easy to relate to and brilliantly described - plus they actually exist! I would highly recommend this Dan Jenkinsesque novel to both golfers and non-golfers. If Cementhead can not make you laugh - you need help. It is a magnificant story about the have versus the have nots; the coupon-clipping capitalist versus the proletarian; the cleft chinned versus the genetically deficient. I encourage you to learn about life and golf in this soon to be classic"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Without exception, the funniest and most entertaining book on golf I've ever read. If you can read more than 5 pages without doubling over you have not an ounce of Chop in you. I've read it a second time in an attempt to dog-ear all the pages with a memorable line -- and it's nearly every page! Already bought 10 copies for friends -- Hoover, 2 Down, Thud and the gang -- which has reinvigorated our regular game. This book &quot;very much does not suck.&quot; Thanks Rick. Looking forward to another 18 at Ponky"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"I read the second book in this series, &#34;Shanks for the Memories,&#34; out of order from this one but fell in love with the characters anyway. This was a great way to see how the characters got to that point. However, this was a bit more serious than I expected from the previous novel I read in the series."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"This book was an entertaining read, everyone needs a little escapism now and again. Ending is a bit campy but overall a good book."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"After the first year I included the word golfer in my personal description I realized there was no 12 step program strong enough to help me. We would spend many afternoons time at the clubhouse over pitchers of beer and stale, free popcorn wishing for the days when caddies were somebody else. We shared stories, desires and frustrations. All about our life as golfers. A few years later I started playing at country clubs instead of dog tracks. To my surprise I realized I had more fun shooting over concrete ditches, and actually having a shot that worked over the man-hole cover off the 4th green. I thought I was destined to play with Judge Smailes and Dr. Beeper the rest of my life. I wanted golf to be fun again. I didn't want it to feel like a job, or television interview. Then I read Missing Links, and realized there were other certifiable folks with the same twisted view that life was better when you are your own caddy. Even if your swing looks resembles a man trapped in a moving car with a bee."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Missing Links is an outstanding book that everyone can read. The book is about a middle-aged man and his friends that all play golf at a course called Ponky. When the course was first built, it was decent but over the years, it's been let go. These guys all have a stay at home job so they are out on the golf course everyday. One morning whn they are out on the course, one of his friends get's a club stuck in a bush. So they all try and pull it out, and as a result they rip a hole in the bush. The hole gives them a great view of one of the greatest courses in the world called The Mayflower Country Club. This club is as private as you can get, you have to have a special invitation to have a chance in getting accepted. All of them had heard of the golf course right next-door but none of them had ever seen it. The course is well protected by fifteen foot brick walls all around and guards patrol day and night. I'm not going to tell you much more about the book because that would give away the rest of the book. This book would be good for high school age and up because of the language. This book is for fans of Rick Reilly's writing and for sports and golf fans everywhere. Missing Links was one of the best book that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"This book was great, it shows what a little friendly betting can turn into.

I'm not a golfer, but Reilly manages to communicate the spirit of the game in such a way that even somebody who doesn't know what a &quot;balata&quot; is can understand why people love it. It took me awhile to figure out that this book is not about golf. It's about the importance of relationships and family over the things money can buy. He is really an excellent writer with something to say, and golf is merely his vehicle for doing so.Why did I hate this book? The foul language and crude sexual references were really unnecessary. I found myself wanting to read passages to my wife and children, except I couldn't because of the language. I think the story could have been told just as effectively without it. YMMV."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Gary McCord said it well: \\"full of characters from the other end of the food chain.\\" Here we meet a golfing foursome who love the game and play at a Muny which in more ways than not sounds like a blown-up putt-putt course than a normal golf links.There's a tunnel that plays into significance on two holes, one through and the other over, with a sewage treatment plant, etc. to create unbelievable ambiance for the linksters.Betting and competing as they do with intense love for the game and the competition, they discover just over the barrier, the world of golf at Mayflower Club. Similar to playing at the Nordic Hills Resort in suburbian Chicago within eyesight of famed Medinah but never to get in. We tried, guard wouldn't even let us enter to even turnaround.Funny, but not one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Reilly writes with a lot of heart. Good thing because we all need a little heart from time to time. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The golf, the characters, the golf, etc.My favorite line: \\"I love golf for all the times when it's just the twilight and you and the crunch of your spikes on the fall leaves.\\"Yeah. That about says it all."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Good book about the kind of golf most people play- not the exclusive country clubs we see featured in golf magazines, but the run down muni's who could use a few extra groundskeepers, a little more grass on the fairways, and a ball washer or two. Reilly does a first rate job of describing the world of a bunch of blue collar hackers, with all their foibles and eccentricities. The plot is well crafted, too, although maybe a little storybook in the end.The one criticism I have of the book is that while he does a good job of including women and ethnic minorities among the regulars at the muni, he resorts to every cheap stereotype imaginable when it comes to describing a couple of homesexual characters. While a writer wouldn't dare use cliches about women, african-americans, or the disabled for cheap laughs or as plot devices anymore, apparently Mr. Reilly sees nothing harmful in portraying gays as sexually deviant, deceitful, lisping caricatures."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"I bought this expecting something much wittier, and less like rejected lines from Jay leno's monologue. There are about 3 jokes per page, and each one is telegraphed by Western Union - meaning they're all at least 90 years old. Reilly seems to have potential - it would be nice if he didn't fall back on faux folksiness all the time."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"The author comes off like one of those cocktail party bores whose unfunny jokes get increasing painful to listen to. He can't stop, less his audience walks away. Guess what: They will."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Occasionally Rick Reilly deigns to actually &quot;write&quot; for Sports Illustrated, though usually he seems to toss off the first thing that comes out of his head. Which makes for some pretty uninspired prose. Which is what he seems to have done in this rather flaccid, predictable book. Alas, strings of assembly line one-liners do not make a good read."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"I really enjoyed this book. If you enjoy golf, you will identify with the many colorful characters and games that Rick Reilly weaves in and out of this hilarious tale. Reilly does a fine job of exploiting the age old rivalry between the \\"haves\\" and \\"have nots\\" and reminds us that the grass is not always greener on the other side. It is a fun, easy read with just the right balance of substance and humor for the universal golfer. Rick's imaginative plot twists keep you wanting the book to never end. Whether your game is scratch, duffer or if you have never played, you will enjoy this one."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Lots of insight to the game of golf. Rick has a tremendous sense of humor and it shows itself well in this book."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Perhaps the funniest golf book ever written, this short novel has it all. More golf witticisms, jokes and one liners than you've ever read before. Kept on the tip of your tongue these'll have any golf buddy or group laughing instead of playing. It even has a plot and a fairly good one. You'll want to order extra copies of this book for gifts to friends, relatives and customers.Read it and weep (from laughing)"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"I read this book on a long flight back after burying my mother (an avid golfer) and I laughed the whole way. My trip was the typical international flight of bad food, layovers of epic proportions, seat-mates from hell, bumped seating etc. but didn't care. I laughed from page one, sobbed when I started to run out of pages, and laughed/cried (not a pretty sight) at the end and promptly went straight back to page one while driving frantically to the library to see if he'd written any more books.I've always enjoyed Mr. Reilly's articles in Sports Illustrated and this book is a testament oh his abilities (yes, that's a compliment...no I'm not his wife) as an accomplished writer. I just wish he's write more books!"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"I won't bore you with a preview of the book...Just take my advice, buy the damn book, even if you are not a golf nut you'll love it."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Great book by a great writer.This book has left me in stiches every time I have read it. I think it could make a great movie, based on its great dialogue and character interaction.If you want to laugh out loud, this is a great book, but it also melds a nice story about love, fun, and redemption nicely."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"This is the only comic golf mystery novel I've ever read, but I hope it won't be my last. It passed all three tests:1. It fairly represents, within the bounds of editorial license, the game of golf2. I laughed out loud often reading it3. I didn't guess the answer to the mystery, which was compelling enough to keep me reading even when there weren't as many laughs.Anyone who liked Caddyshack and is a golfer will like this book."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Missing Links is an outstanding book that everyone can read.

At the same time, through the characters, he emphasizes that the grass may be greener on the other side, but getting over to the other side may not be worth becoming another person.

If you have ever played golf and had a real gambler in your foursome then this book is for you. Reading this book on an airplane is difficult because people stare as you laugh out loud at the zanny adventures or the development of the characters. I have given this book as a present probably 20 times and have always gotten rave reviews from the recipient. So take my word, that if you enjoy golf and have a sense of humor you will love (and I mean love) this book."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Reilly's columns in SI are good, but it would be difficult to imagine just from reading them (even regularly) that he had this laugh-out-loud novel in him. This is a golf junkie's dream book, but few readers could love the game more than Reilly.....or write better about it. Everything about the game comes through in the book: reverence for tradition, elation, frustration, aesthetics. Even someone like me, who often wonders what is so mesmerizing about golf (and both my sons have their PGA cards!)can appreciate the devotion---filtered through outrageous humor --- that Reilly manifests in every page, even the sex scenes. It's enough to make you take up golf to see whether the euphoria, rare and fleeting as it is portrayed to be, can be as good for you as it apparently is for him and his characters. It would be a quick read, if it weren't for the great lines that have you lingering to try to commit them to memory. Even if you could, they could hardly be delivered with the spontaneity of the Ponky habitues. Enjoy it; I really did!"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"A lot of blurbs claim that u cant put a book down, sometimes there true, but mostly there not. In this case it is very true. I have never read such a captivating book. I read the book in one sitting, starting at 1pm and finished at 4:30 in the morning. A truly amazing book!"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Rick Reilly has proven once again that he is the best writer on the planet. Stick, Two Down, Hoover, Cementhead, Thud, Crow Bar, and Chunkin' Charlie make up a cast that will not only entertain you while you read the book, they will stay in your memory for time to come. Reilly uses his knowledge of sports and his knowledge of life to create this extraordinary novel."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Rick Reilly accomplishes what many attempt and few achieve: a truly funny book which also deals with some of the important things in life. I haven't had as much fun reading a book since Michael Lewis' Liar's Poker. If you're even thinking about it, get this book!"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"This is a fun book. A little bit over the top, perhaps, but I don't think there are any pretenses that it won't be. Rick Reilly could have wrote a snoozer with the somewhat stereotypical & one dimensional characters, but instead they all seem to come together.The insults & side gags are great, the quest to win \\"the Bet\\" has a lot of twists & turns and (somewhat) unexpected interconnected threads.There are some truly funny situations, and even the running jokes seem to hit the mark.A lot of people will call this \\"Caddyshack, the novel\\", and I think it's really the highest compliment. I don't find too many books to be laugh-out-loud funny, but this one is.The sequel, \\"Shanks for Nothing\\", while entertaining, is no where near as good as Missing Links."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"This is a fun story that pits the slobs against the snobs (ala Caddyshack). I liked it enough that I'm going to read the follow-up novel, Shanks for Nothing.Appropriateness: If you or your child like Reilly's writing in Sports Illustrated, a word of warning, he's writing for a different audience... there is a pretty fair amount of swearing, crude humor, and sex references."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"If I hadn't been a devoted fan of Rick Reilly, it would have been around the 12th day of the deep freeze of Hades before I picked up a book about golf. I read it in one sitting, laughed so hard I had tears running down my face, and thoroughly enjoyed the book. And as I said, I hate golf.Don't bother picking it up if you're looking for masterfully crafted literature, deftly developed and believable characters or any of the other hallmarks of writing-for-the-ages. Pick it up if you enjoy Rick Reilly's column in SI, and you want a light-and-funny-read.Hey, it's summer. Grab a beer, find a comfy lawnchair and prepare to be amused!"},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"Sitting by my wife's bed in the delivery room waiting for our first child to arrive was when I had the pleasure to read this book. It was a very stressful time but in between her labor pains and exhaustion I escaped into this book and laughed (quietly) again. Having played the game since I was very young, I appreciated every descriptive detail of both courses and each character within the story. I have been there and played with each character at one time or another. I highly recommend this book to all golfers and non-golfers alike; it's that good!!! Mommy and baby turned out fine."},{"Title":"Missing Links","review":"I'm not much of a fiction reader. I only read this because I enjoyed Mr. Reilly's recent works -- Who's Your Caddy? Missing Links is an entertaining novel about six golfing buddies, all with distinct personalities. The character development done by Mr. Reilly is nothing short of spectacular. There are enough twists and turns in the book to keep the reader turning the pages. At the same time, there aren't so many characters that you're wondering who is who. It's a shame the book had to end, rather abruptly I might add. You don't have to like golf to enjoy this book. Highly Recommended for Everybody!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"A Different Kind of Man (Harlequin Superromance #1319)","review":"A DIFFERENT KIND OF MAN by Suzanne CoxJanuary 21, 2006Amazon rating 3.5/5\\"In A Different Kind of Man, Emalea LeBlanc is a psychologist and avid motorcyclist, who also scuba dives with a search and rescue team. When Jackson Cooper comes to town, it is obvious he rubs Emalea the wrong way. Jackson is built like a football player and gives the impression of someone who would cause bodily harm if provoked. Jackson, who doesn't know that Emalea comes from an abusive family background, has his own baggage - he feels responsible for the death of his wife and child.Jackson relocated to the small town of Cypress Landing (not too far from New Orleans) due in part to that tragedy. He was hoping for a more peaceful existence, but as the town's new investigator, he soon finds himself in the middle of a dangerous case. He worries that what happened to his wife and child will happen again to Emalea if he gets too close to her. A secondary plot involves a young boy whom Emalea is counseling - his family background is very similar to what Emalea had to endure for the first twelve years of her life. While at first this subplot seems unrelated to the rest, the story lines merge by the end of the novel.\\" - Complete review at BookLoons - M. LoftonWhile this isn't going to be a favorite of mine, the story line in itself was interesting, with several layers of story line going on at one time. This superromance had more adventure than I care for in a romance, but nevertheless it was an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Genealogical Research in England's Public Record Office: A Guide for North Americans","review":"I ordered a copy of this book hoping to discover new information about the PRO that would help me plan my research there. This *very* slim volume barely skims the surface of the topic, and contains much out-of-date information, such as references to the Census Room and St. Catherine's House. At the very least a new edition is called for, and this one should be withdrawn. I think all researchers would be far better served by one of the publications directly from the PRO (such as Jane Cox's 'Never Been here Before?') or the excellent guide to UK research, with vast amounts of information on the PRO, by Mark Herber - 'Ancestral Trails'. Save your money for one of these. My copy of Ms Prowse Reid's volume will be in the mail back to amazon.com in the morning."},{"Title":"Genealogical Research in England's Public Record Office: A Guide for North Americans","review":"he Public Record Office in Kew, outside of London, is one of the richest genealogical repositories in the world, equivalent in many ways to our own National Archives. Its records reach all the way back to the Domesday Book of 1086 and forward to the vast accumulation of census records, probate documents, and emigration records that make it a natural magnet for anyone undertaking English or Welsh genealogical research. The purpose of this book is to help North Americans make the most effective use of its records. Significantly, it also identifies many of the most important PRO records available in large North American institutions such as the Family History Library in Salt Lake City, the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., and the National Archives of Canada in Ottawa.Among the topics covered in the book are emigration and immigration records; censuses; nonconformist church records; birth, death, and marriage records, and military, taxation, court, and Parliamentary records. Also included are logistical information about working at the PRO, a discussion regarding the organization of PRO records, and a list of aids for identifying the records--not to mention a comprehensive bibliography containing complete citations to every book mentioned in the text, and a subject index.Highlights of the new 2nd edition include the creation of a new PRO research facility in central London called the Family Records Centre, featuring microfilm copies of census records and records of births, marriages, and deaths, etc.; the PRO's amazing progress in making its services and records available on the Internet; and the latest addresses, telephone numbers, and fax numbers for local record offices in England and Wales."},{"Title":"Only With Passion: Figure Skating's Most Winning Champion on Competition and Life","review":"Always projected as a fascinating ice princess, I was hoping for something more interesting. Very little in terms of an intimate portrait and advice on becoming a champion skater.Christine Brennan did a better job capturing intimate glimpses of Witt in a few pages in \\"Inside Edge\\" compared to this entire book. I wanted to read more about growing up in GDR, how her friendship with Roz Summers developed, the controversy of the government spying on her, more biographical information about HER and her skating. The impression given is that she was a machine told what to do and she did it - including this book. True skate fans, skip this one."},{"Title":"Only With Passion: Figure Skating's Most Winning Champion on Competition and Life","review":"I am a big figure skating fan. I have read every skating book out there.I thought Katarina's story would be interesting. While not my favorite skater, her background would certainly be worth the read.I was wrong. For one thing, this book seems to be set up in a way where Katarina is giving advice to a fictious up and coming skating star. Never quite sure if this girl actually exists or not.Also, this book is preachy and....boring, boring, boring.Where are the great skating stories, the background info on skating in Germany?What about Katarina's fears and thoughts on life in general.None of this in this book.Skate right by this one."},{"Title":"Only With Passion: Figure Skating's Most Winning Champion on Competition and Life","review":"This book contains the musings of Olympian figure skater, Katerina Witt, who has won gold medals in two consecutive Olympics, four world championships, and eight national championships. She ruminates on the rigors of athletic competition and on the life lessons she has learned along the way. Turning forty years old this December, she offers some fairly general advice to the young on what it takes to be a top athlete. She does so from the perspective of what she has discovered in her own quest to be the best.There is very little that is truly intimate about this book, as it is, for the most part, quite banal, although Ms. Witt does offer some relatively minor revelations about her life. Still, the tone throughout the book remains remote and dispassionate, notwithstanding the title of the book. There is some commentary about other figure skating greats but nothing the least bit controversial or eyebrow raising. It is clear that Ms. Witt reserves her passion for the ice, as there is none infused in this somewhat tepid book. Only those who are rabid fans of figure skating will get a modicum of enjoyment from this book."},{"Title":"Only With Passion: Figure Skating's Most Winning Champion on Competition and Life","review":"Throughout the 1980s and early '90s, East German Katarina Witt dominated the world of ladies' skating. In her autobiography, Witt describes what skating has meant to her, as she details a coming-of-age story being \\"told\\" to a young up-and-coming skater, Jasmine.The book is a fast read, and while it is mildly interesting, it is also very repetitive. Katarina skates past her childhood in the GDR, briefly mentioning her parents, and glosses over the competitions she has had in her life as well. There is virtually nothing about her Olympic bids in Sarajevo, Calgary, and Lillehammer, and little is mentioned of her famous rivalry with American Debi Thomas. Instead, the book focuses on advice Witt has for young skaters - namely, stay true to your dreams and don't give up.When compared with what is perhaps skating's most famous memoir, \\"My Sergei\\" by Katia Gordeeva, this book falls far short. There is virtually no emotion, and the character Katarina is supposedly telling the story to may or may not exist (it's not made clear whether she is real or not). Little insight is offered into the world of skating, either at the amateur level or professional (Katarina doesn't talk about her years on Stars on Ice at all).Overall, this book is decent, but by no means great. It is emotionless, and mildly intriguing, if more for its outrageous title than anything else. Looking for a great skating book? Try \\"My Sergei\\" instead."},{"Title":"Only With Passion: Figure Skating's Most Winning Champion on Competition and Life","review":"I read over this book in the waiting room of my Dentist's office. All in all I think this book is a good guide for parents of aspiring skaters. On a personal note one has to really ask if it is worth sacrificing a childhood for a medal?. These skaters have to train relentlessly for years.In the process they miss out so much of childhood which when lost can never be replaced. I have no children of my own but given what I saw during the whole Lillehammer Nancy Kerrigan / Tonya Harding scandal someone needs to watch over these young athletes so they do not lose contact with reality. I wish Ms. Witt had the courage to write more about her life in the former East German sports machine as it is especially relevant today when we read about athletes and doping scandals. I think Ms Witt like so many of the former Communist Bloc athletes were products of a system that treated them like racehorses to be bred and trained. Many had health problems in later life due to the strange performance enhancing drugs given them. Ms. Witt was hosting a TV show in Germany called \\"The OSTALGIE Show \\". Ostalgie is term used by Germans as nostalgia for the good aspects of life under the old regime. I wonder if Ms. Witt has read \\"Faust's Gold: Inside the East German Doping Machine\\". The problem with nostalgia is no matter what the past is always better because one can be sentimental about the good and forget the evil."},{"Title":"Only With Passion: Figure Skating's Most Winning Champion on Competition and Life","review":"I am not a skater but I am a great fan of Katarina Witt since my childhood..I have grown up with watching her skating programmes and when I was a little girl I was wearing my rollerblades at home and I was Katarina Witt:)collecting all the flowers -that my mum,grandfather,and other family members that I made them throw me flowers:))-but due to the lack of skating arenas I have never been able to start to skate seriously although I was very talented and willing but I always admired Katarina Witt.This book is really good for me to observe the mentality of the East German approach for sport and emposing being ambitious and tough to their sporters.I have read some comments regarding this book before ,some people say this book will not be a good example for young skaters in mean of nutrition but I want to say that in these years we were not as conscious as today regarding nutrition.Remember we were still watching the Cigarette Advertisements on TV.So the nutrition mentality has changed a lot in all over the world and Katarina just told her working conditions frankly .She did not give this as an example to be copied of..Besides today's teenagers and their trainers are so conscious that they will only take the parts that will be helpful to them from this book they are aware of what's good or what's bad..On this book I reccomend to the readers that when you read for example Olympics part from the book ,it will be more fun to read the Olympic parts and after to watch Katarina's that show on youtube ..Thanks a lot to AMAZON for providing this book !!NIL"},{"Title":"Only With Passion: Figure Skating's Most Winning Champion on Competition and Life","review":"Tear your eyes away from the winter spectacle of the Turin Olympics and treat yourself to multiply talented skating superstar Katarine Witt's most intimate memories. She tells them all to a young girl whose name she kindly changes to \\"Jasmine,\\" a young girl who comes to her in need of advice. Witt sees Jasmine as a version, perhaps, of her younger self, the self that grew up behind the Iron Curtain, indeed behind the Berlin Wall only to become a pawn of the feared Stasi. As Jasmine spends a week luxuriating in the presence of the adored Katarina, she asks her mentor a series of penetrating, even probing questions and these questions, together with the Delphic replies Katarina makes in response, form the backbone of this wise, witty and winning little book. Some may say, it feels like only about 30,000 words, far too short for a book costing $23.50, but i say, it was just the right length.Jasmine asks about dating, and of course Katarina, as one of the most beautiful women in competitive sports, or indeed on Planet Earth, has plenty to say about it. Did you know the she once dated East German rock singer Ingo? In fact he was her first serious boyfriend; they met at a \\"youth festival\\" and fell madly in love. Those European \\"youth festivals\\" sound like fun. If I'm correct, that is where ABBA met each other a bit further north! Anyhow the government soon separated the young lovers. Jasmine then asks Katarina if it is true she once dated \\"McGyver\\"! Yes, she uses the name McGyver, almost as if she could not remember the actor's name who played him! (Richard Dean Anderson.) Instead of getting huffy, Katarina smiles sadly and reflects on how neither she nor Anderson were willing to move to the other's continent and that killed the romance, which however was quite \\"intense.\\" What's little known is that McGyver himself (RDA as his fans call him) isn't a bad skater himself! In love, Witt advises,\\"if you want to become really serious, to have the relationship work, then somebody has to play second violin.\\" Doesn't she sound charming and old world, where we in California might say, \\"second fiddle\\"?Katarina also discusses her famous nude appearance in PLAYBOY. And she puts it in context, the context of the way that in Europe, particularly her country, nudity is natural. Until she was sixteen she walked around topless everywhere. Reading her life this way, you realize that an appearance in PLAYBOY was just like breathing in and breathing out for Katarina Witt. Ahe is magnificent, the Princess Caroline of Monaco of the ice world. Long may she reign, in the USA at any rate, for she admits that in the US audiences are warm and love an old skater, whereas in Europe the attitude is much more, you're old, get off the ice. In America, she says, she was shocked to see Dorothy Hamill still feted and hailed and worshipped by audiences even in her late forties! Wouldn't happen in East Germany, Hamill would be relegated to cooking strudel for the younger players."},{"Title":"Only With Passion: Figure Skating's Most Winning Champion on Competition and Life","review":"I found this book to be a fascinating look into the life of a remarkably strong and independent woman. It isn't gossipy, but it is honest and unapologetic about what it was like to grow up as an elite athlete in East Germany and to have to compete with the expectations of a country on your shoulders. The format, in which Witt gives advice to a young skater who is going through some of the same things Witt went through as a teenager, is unusual, but it worked for me. Witt can be funny, observant, and revealing about her own insecurities and failures in love. But she is a strong woman who seldom second guesses herself, and is a pretty amazing role model for young women athletes today."},{"Title":"Only With Passion: Figure Skating's Most Winning Champion on Competition and Life","review":"A book in English from this legendary skater whose celebrity transcends her sport is long overdue, and this one is a most welcome treat. While not strictly autobiographical, it feels like an extended, intimate conversation, and Witt is remarkably candid about her life experiences and opinions. Swift ably captures his co-author's voice, as he has done to great effect in his other works. This is a thoroughly pleasurable read for the skating fan, and should not be missed by anyone who admires strong, independent women."},{"Title":"Only With Passion: Figure Skating's Most Winning Champion on Competition and Life","review":"I wonder why Katarina stirs clear about her real life and her close involvement with the Stasi, and how it ruined and destroyed people's lives, it would at least have made a more interesting read than this dull book.Ho hum, it has been said that Ms. Witt was never a very naturally gifted figure skater, that even her wonderfully choreographed programs were never easy for her to do.It's also rather odd that for such an unrepentant and strident communist to take advantage of all the opportunities western life has given her, but she doesn't seem in the least bit grateful. Everything is about her, her, her. Definitely NOT a good role model for young girls or women."},{"Title":"The National Pastime","review":"It's always difficult to find a book that isn't cloaked in modern day cinicism, and that's why THE NATIONAL PASTIME is one of the most refreshing books I've read in years. If you lazily daydream about your little league days, big league chew, and your first triple, then this will stoke the fires of nostalgia for you as it did for me. What i liked most is that I got the sense that the author is probably not that different from you or I--just a life-long fan who wants to share his passion for the greatest game ever played. The only difference may be the remarkable skill and wit with which he chronicles our nation's pastime. He'll make you want to get a stick ball game gong in the back yard."},{"Title":"New Employee Orientation Training (Pergamon Flexible Learning Trainer's Workshop Series)","review":"Really liked this book.

This not only tells the Enemy that your prayer is as \\"it is written\\", just as Jesus dealt with the devil, but keeping scripture before your own eyes and ears builds up the faith you need in desperate situations. God is a faith God, and this book (as well as ALL of the \\"Prayers That Avail Much\\" books) is a wonderful instructional tool, and you will be amazed at how soon and how much of God's Holy Word will become a part of you as you constantly pray these faith-filled prayers."},{"Title":"Prayer That Avail Much For Grandparents: James 5:16 (Prayers That Avail Much (Paperback))","review":"What a blessing this book has been during the past three years since my first grandson was born.

The result is an easy to read and entertaining book that gives a general picture of the women of Western Europe (using various surveys and censuses) as well as concentrating on specific areas to give a human face to the statistics (personal accounts, diaries).

The accounts start in a setting of religious war, famine, plague, witch hunts, and economic upheavals that make the 1930s Great Depression look gentle. We are introduced to real women from these centuries telling their stories with candor. There are thread-spinning \\"spinsters\\" who lose their jobs en masse, Catholic nuns breaking out of cloisters for vocations beyond chastity, and Protestant wives doing likewise with less institutional support. Hufton's contributors trace the mainly volunteer-driven rise of education by and for females. They portray Europe's ancient caste-like divisions of roles or virtues for men and for women, shifting at roughly the speed of a melting glacier. From seeing initiative by females as the original source of evil, society begins to trust tapping women's potential for innovation.--author of A Galaxy of Immortal Women: The Yin Side of Chinese Civilization"},{"Title":"Plane geometry,","review":".If you can find a copy of Welchons \\"Plane Geometry\\" get it.Mine is a 1933 edition, co-authored with W. R. Krickenberger. It was part of a two-volume set, with \\"Solid Geometry\\" as the second volume of the set.Plane Geometry is the source of Aristotelian Logic, and if you pick this book up and begin reading it, you may be induced, as I was, to begin studying Plane Geometry. I did some online research of the subject, and I found that Welchon and Krickenberger have a unique understanding of the subject, and online websites end up being a presentation of information that is droll and uninspiring.Also, I compared this book with some modern texts, like Shaum's Outlines book on \\"Geometry\\" Third Edition, and I swear, that it seems like a paraphrase of the Welchons & Krickenberger book on \\"Plane Geometry\\".As with so many subjects, I find that when I buy books published before the age of Computers, and even Television, and sometimes published even before Radio, the knowledge presented is better.I find myself doing a great deal of visualization while studying this subject, trying to recover what the Ancient Greeks had as a vision.I got lucky, and in fact, I think my discovery of the Welchon & Krickenberger books was the answer to a longstanding prayer. The 2-volume set cost me $3.00 in a bookstore.The instruction is motivating, entertaining, and my note-taking is an energetic activity.I keep my ruler, compass, pencils, protracter and blank printer paper handy in a plastic case which I carry into my favorite coffee shops, where I can concentrate with some tea at hand."},{"Title":"The Ethics of Giving and Receiving: Am I My Foolish Brother's Keeper?","review":"Are you constantly receiving requests for donations? Are you in a quandry about giving? How does one know which causes are worth supporting? Do you find it difficult to decide who is and is not deserving? &quot;The Ethics of Giving and Receiving&quot;, is somewhat like a crash course in charity and benevolence 101, in that it explores how to do good wisely. You may or may not agree with the stated assertions, but you will find them interesting. For example, - philanthropy should be linked with justice which creates standards for wise giving; those responsible for their own misfortune should be sent to the end of the receiving donations line. On the other hand, empathy and compassion is needed to guard against being too strict and too judgemental. Join the debate, read the book. It was written for an audience of intelligent inquirers.

She tells you how it is - plain and simple. She takes real-life paranormal investigations and describes them in a storytelling style that teaches and entertains.

Weaver is one of those psychic-mediums that knows the nuts and bolts of her subject material. She's still as \\"ghostbuster\\" with husband John and is an active psi authority in Pennsylvannia for her teaching and consulting.

Calling the disease Acne Rosacea is a step backwards for all. No one is really calling it acne rosacea anymore. It is different enough from acne that the moniker is just confusing. Further, treating it like acne may just be the worst thing you can do.The book is more of a template for \`generic health researching' than anything specific to rosacea. The information is of such a generic level that a sourcebook on the next medical topic is just a search and replace away.I thought that I might get to see some new information, but alas I was disappointed. On Page 4 we read&quot;All too often, patients diagnosed with acne rosacea will log on the the Internet, type words into a search engine, and receive several Web site listings which are mostly irrelevant or redundant&quot;Sadly this is the opposite of what you find. The National Rosacea Society comes up as a PageRank of 1 on Google. As much as we chastise the NRS, they do provide a very good starting point. If people were to start their search at the #1 rosacea web site then they will be on the right track. I'm not sure the same can be said for this book.Later they promise &quot;a chapter dedicated to helping you find your peer groups&quot;. They end up only mentioning a prescription drug page at rosacea-control.com, CureZone and MedHelp (of which CureZone didn't mention rosacea at all, and MedHelp timed out). Again they never mention the NRS or the Rosacea Support Group. I could keep going - the section on books doesn't mention the best text we have, the pages of links doesn't mention the Open Directory Project Categories ...The Guidelines chapter is too short to contain anything useful. They talk about &quot;another type of rosacea called vascular rosacea&quot; this statement left me wondering if they had any idea what they were saying. Surely just paraphrasing the standard classification for rosacea would have been ideal introduction, especially when you are unsure of the topic you are addressing.The whole aim of the series of books seems to be to give you information that you can't find on the well known \`rosacea internet'. I have to say from my reading of this book there are scant new resources worth noting.In the end the authors would have done better to embrace what they knocked in the first few pages. A trip to google.com, drop the \`acne' bit at from \`acne rosacea' and surf the first few sites you find. After that you will be in front of this book, and have something else to do with your $USD 25."},{"Title":"America's Condemned: Death Row Inmates in Their Own Words","review":"Read about Death Row in the words of the men that sit day by day hearing the second hand click toward their death.This book has some fowl language but I'm sure this is how these men with nothing to lose really say.The author has done an outstanding job of documenting the tension and disgust of the men that have no choice but to wait for state death keepers to come to their cell door for the final opening and final closing.I read this books in 3 1/2 hours!"},{"Title":"America's Condemned: Death Row Inmates in Their Own Words","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read on Death Row Inmates.

Very informative and opened up my understanding about death row."},{"Title":"America's Condemned: Death Row Inmates in Their Own Words","review":"AMERICA'S CONDEMNED, written by two Dallas Morning News reporters, Dan Malone and Howard Swindle, is the end product of the responses they receive from the estimated 3,000 questionnaires that in 1994 and 1995 the sent to death row prisoners throughout the country. The resulting book is a combination of sociology and social work with case studies - sometimes just thumbnails, sometimes covering a few pages - to illustrate the statistical responses to the questionnaires.Among the survey answers summarized in the book are - for example - the incidence of early drug or alcohol abuse and early criminal behavior among the condemned, and the history of criminal behavior in their families. In addition, the authors present various facts about capital punishment and its implementation in the United States.What results is a well-written but randomly presented hodgepodge, at times interesting, but ultimately uncompelling, particularly since the sociological results gleaned by the authors are basic and pretty obvious. In my opinion, by far the best part of the book is an intelligent 11-page essay on the subject of criminals and criminality by San Quentin inmate Michael Wayne Hunter.Finally, AMERICA'S CONDEMNED feels more like a long series of newspaper articles, which it may or may not have been, rather than a coherent book. It's not horrible by any means, but I wouldn't consider re-reading it nor can I recommend it."},{"Title":"An appeal in favor of that class of Americans called Africans,","review":"Difficult to find book written by Child in its original format, a bit difficult to read due to its type set, but none the less it is as it was.

In this book, young Siebren's world is small and lonely. He lives in a tiny seacoast village with his parents and younger brother. Then he goes with his grandfather to visit his old great-aunt. He finds a stray dog to care for, meets an aunt and uncle he never heard of before, and slowly his world becomes a little wider. What's remarkable is the way Mr. DeJong uses simple incidents to illustrate the fearfully powerful emotions of children as they try to make sense of the adult world they glimpse. His grandfather is gruff and no nonsense; his aunt loving and warm; and his uncle, a deaf-mute, a little frightening at first. Siebren begins to understand that adults aren't perfect, but can be surprisingly comforting and companionable when he opens up to admit some of his deepest fears. This book, along with many others by Mr. DeJong, is a more than adequate tonic for anyone feeling a little too sadly cynical and jaded."},{"Title":"Journey from Peppermint Street","review":"It was magical when I read it, and magical when I re-read and re-read it, and now it's magical for my own children.

But most of the book is in black and white, and the examples are pretty cheesy. The color insert section is there but it is dedicated to the display of some artists.

For a beginner, the information is sparce and difficult to follow. For someone more experienced, the topics contained are much too basic.

Other books in the Bible series are worth reading but this is not one of them (definitely check out any of the books by Deke McClelland). There are many items that are not covered or are given just a passing mention. For the size of the book, it contains much less solid content than it could. All in all, I was very let down by this book and would recommend others to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Illustrator Cs Bible","review":"This has to be the ultimate guide for Illustrator as it covers everything.

The author has a kind of subdued humor that I particularly likeand the instructions on how to treat the hive seemed quite complete. Infact using this book as a guide I installed three hives yesterday morning.After that experience I realized that there were two things left out that theauthor should have included. Perhaps if there's another edition he willadd them.First, there needs to be an explanation of the consequences of beingstung and not flicking the stinger out. If one does not do this the stingerwill work its way down under the skin and become irretrievable. Thenthat whole stinger becomes something the body reacts against. Bonneyaccurately stated that for many people bee stings are no big deal andat the same time asserted that one should immediately flick the stingerout. All this is quite accurate. What was left out was an explanationof the consequences though of not more or less immediately getting thatstinger out.On the third hive I was stung multiple times and lost track of whereall the stings were. At the time the stings hurt a lot for a minuteor two and then faded to insignificance. Now almost twenty-four hourslater I know exactly where each stinger is that I failed to flick out.And it has dawned on me that this painful reaction is going to persistfor many days.Second, one step in installing a package of bees is the hanging of thequeen cage between two frames suspended by a metal disk that comes onthe queen cage. I was all prepared for that possibility. (I read andreread Bonney's step-by-step instructions at least three times.) WhatI wasn't prepared for was queen cages with plastic strap and withouta metal disk. Therefore I didn't have the proper tools to attachthe queen cage to a frame.Now Richard Bonney had no way to anticipate this change of practice. Butwhat would have helped is an explanation of why it's so important tosuspend the queen at the top. Yesterday morning I didn't know what todo and left the queen cages on the bottom of each of their respectivehive bodies. Now almost twenty-four hours later, I wake up realizingthat the queens might die because the worker bees aren't going to clusteraround the queen at the bottom of the cage to keep her warm.It's still a good book. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Beekeeping: A Practical Guide","review":"This is more than a &quot;how-to,&quot; beginner's guide to beekeeping: it is a homage to a remarkable creature.

As a professional geologist, I have enjoyed some of the beautiful mountain scenery of India, continental USA, Mexico and Hawaii, and how mountains form is of great interest to me.I found 'The Origin of Mountains' to be a very thought-provoking and excellent work. The book is indeed ground-breaking in that it makes the reader realize what processes really create mountains, and how there is a large discrepancy between field facts and models. For example, although many plate tectonic treatments picture a subducting slab diving beneath another plate and causing both folding of rocks and mountain formation, the authors emphasize that such simplistic cartoons have nothing to do with reality, in that folding has nothing to do with mountain building, and the production of mountain topography is a much later event. Always, folding and rock deformation are succeeded by peneplanation, then uplift of the plains to produce plateaus, and it is the erosion of these uplifted plateaus which creates mountains. Mountains are, ironically, created by &quot;epeirogeny&quot; followed by erosion, and not by &quot;orogeny&quot;, though etymologically orogeny means mountain formation but has lately been applied to the process of folding and deformation.The book has 13 chapters: 1. Introduction; 2. Simple plateaus and erosional mountains; 3. Fault block mountains; 4. European mountains; 5. Western North America; 6. The Andes; 7. Asian mountains; 8. Mountains with gravity structures; 9. Volcanoes and granite mountains; 10. Mountains on passive margins; 11. Plains and planation surfaces, drainage and climate; 12. Problems of mountain tectonics; 13. Science and the origin of mountains.Mountains from all over the world, and of all types and tectonic settings are described. The book is rich in illustrations, with a nice colour photograph of the Chilean Andes on the cover and numerous black and white photographs inside, which are clear enough. The line drawings/geographic maps are all quite clear and neat, though a weakness of this book, perhaps its only substantial weakness, is that many of the geographic maps do not show either a scale (e.g., Fig. 4.23), or latitudes-longitudes (e.g., 3.4), or both (e.g., 4.17, 11.23). It is very difficult in these cases for readers unfamiliar with the particular area to grasp its exact location and extent. Some vertical profiles of local areas (e.g., Figs. 8.2, 8.8) do not have the trend of the profile or the depths/heights marked on them. Line sketches of Mt. Snowdon in Wales (Fig. 2.13) and Stone Mtn. in Atlanta (Fig. 2.21) do not convey to the reader an idea of their size. This good work would have been even better had the line drawings been perfect. Of course, there also are many line drawings in the book that do not have these shortcomings.A good aspect of this book, written by two well-known and reputed geomorpholgists, is that even if you are not a geomorphology specialist you could learn a lot, or clarify your concepts, with the book. Many topics in geomorphology (planation surfaces, drainage patterns, etc.) are described, with descriptions of worldwide examples. However, a glossary of technical terms at the end would have been helpful. Still, a useful index and a bibliography of well over 400 references (up to year 2000) are given.I go on to make a few other relatively minor comments. The authors observe that in fold belts many rivers follow the axes of anticlines, and they argue that the anticlines may have formed *after* the formation of the river valley, due to isostatic uplift along the valley. I think that this is interesting and plausible, but I am not convinced that this is so in every case of a river following the axis of an anticline. As I understand, the process of folding at shallow depths produces brittle deformation in the form of pervasive cleavage parallel to the axial plane of the fold, and on large scale anticlines the existence of this cleavage could well lead to selective erosion by streams and production of a river valley. The authors' discussion of nappes being driven by gravity, and not horizontal compression (as postulated in plate tectonics) (Chapter 8) is very interesting. The Mexican volcano Popocatepetl (Chaper 5), contrary to the authors' statement, is quite active; the other two large Mexican volcanoes Pico de Orizaba (Citlaltepetl) and Iztaccihuatl are inactive. Coastal monoclines at passive margins are not all with 2 degree seaward dips (Chapter 10); the Panvel monoclinal flexure in western India shows lavas dipping seaward by 18 degrees or more (see H. C. Sheth, Tectonophysics 294, 143-149, 1998).I very much appreciate the authors' view (Preface): &quot;Sadly, in our opinion, Earth Science has become too concerned with theory, models, and dogma... We hope, in our small way, to encourage people, from students to professionals, to have a new look at mountains, without reference to pre-conceived theories, but with attention to what can readily be seen.&quot; The last chapter is about theories and bandwagons, the neglect of landscape evidence, and orthodoxy and disregard for ground truth. The authors' feeling is that (pp. 300-301) &quot;Plate tectonics as a general principle has been enormously helpful in many aspects of geology, but its practitioners have neglected the ground surface, and have often been uncritical in their time scales... we are not totally converted to the religion [plate tectonics]. You can believe what you like, but please don't send missionaries!&quot;In summary, with its few minor weaknesses, I highly recommend this book. The paperback edition at ~US$50 is pretty good value for money, noting its scientific content (observations, ideas and the global coverage) and also its good production. It is a book which deserves a careful reading by everyone interested in and impressed by mountains, and it is a book which deserves a place in every Earth Science library."},{"Title":"The Origin of Mountains","review":"I bought this book as I was interested in something valuable about mountain ranges, but after reading it I have a feeling this is more a work of the geomorphology vs. geology kind!! I'm definitely disappointed, and a bit amazed at its contents.There is something curiously anachronistic in the way the authors tackle their stated goal to analyze the origin of mountain landscapes. Their train of thoughts seems to develop along the lines of those glorious theories and ideas that shaped geological thinking as gods-of-the-gaps before plate tectonics finally started making some sense (or at least, so it seems thus far) of geologic evidence on several observational scales. Here we find mountains interpreted in terms of geotumors, mushroom tectonics and the good old geosynclines...The latest developments (and by latest I mean some solid four decades of research) in structural geology and global tectonics are dismissed as a scientific fad, while the authors focus instead on exogenous processes as the main producers of mountain landscapes. Personally, I certainly agree that erosional processes do shape what we see up there (give or take stuctural and lithologic controls). Yet, what brought and thrust those landscapes upwards in the first place, we're not given to know... Except for some really dubious claims, like the irrelevance of active plate margins, the absence of compressive deformation along the Pacific margin of South America and even in the Himalayan region (which is somehow the most compressed place in the world after Rome's subway) or revamping the role of gravity tectonics, interpreting thrust faults as huge crustal slabs sliding downward (...but then just what pushed those rocks upwards first?!?). A proposal is even advanced for the origin of anticlines as isostatically rising up after fluvial erosion partially removed the lithostatic load of the above-lying landscape. It all sounds so Davisian: the continents were just higher once, but then they started crumbling down, and mountains today should be viewed as mere leftovers of erosion...I just wanted to learn something more in-depth about mountains, but I seem to have read a book from the nineteenth century or something like that, when geologists where still fumbling through vague theories. It was valuable nonetheless back then, but we have moved on today. Perhaps plate tectonics and structural geodynamics aren't perfect at present, we can't understand just everything yet (especially not me, because I'm into sedimentology) but at least we have a sensible and coherent framework to advance and test hypotheses. Ollier and Pain have simply ignored it all.They get two stars anyway, not just one, because science benefits greatly from counterviews and discussion, not from generalized, passive agreement about any given topic. If the views expressed in this work ever had to be accepted by some members of the geological community, then they sure will stir a heated debate of such importance as to contribute very much to testing and reasoning about the validity of the plate tectonics paradigm. My point is, nonetheless, that criticizing the mainstream needs the support of valid evidence, not obsolete, misleading notions. It should be a step forward, whereas this book just feels like a giant leap backward...I really liked two of Ollier's previous books, the one on regolith geology was actually excellent, but this time I even wonder whether the publisher bothered to submit this book to any reviewers before going through the press??Or maybe I really haven't understood a fat nothing about geology yet...."},{"Title":"The Parasite","review":"This is my favourite Campbell novel without a doubt. The story revolves around Rose who begins to have weird out of body experiences years after using a oujiboard. This book like all Campbells work is unsettling, well written and has great characterisation with well drawn, realistic relationships between characters in contrast to Koontz et al cardboard cut out stereotypes. More than any of his other novels this has some deeply scary and memorable scenes that will stick in your memory for a long time."},{"Title":"The Parasite","review":"I picked this up after reading an enjoying a few of Ramsey Campbell's short stories in various horror compilations. This is strange to think back on now, as my big problem with this book is that it feels like an underdeveloped short story that was needlessly padded to novel-length. It is a shame, because there are seeds for a good story buried in the mess, but they don't really appear until about 2/3 of the way through the book. By that time, they have been smothered by poorly executed and repetitious exposition. By the end of the novel (admittedly the strongest part), the payoff is too little, too late, and largely predictable. The potential for a good story was there, but bad execution seems to have squandered it. I cannot recommend this book. A good horror/supernatural suspense novel should never leave a reader bored and uninvested in it's protagonist, but that's just what this book did."},{"Title":"The Parasite","review":"This is the slowest moving horror story I have ever read. It's not that slow to start- the odd things begin fairly early on. But the events drag horribly- much of the book is spent in denial of what is happening. Worse, none of the characters is very likeable. Not that they are dreadful people; they are just people I couldn't care about. Even the protagonist, who I feared for at first, is portrayed too flatly to seem real. One character, who it seems like will be important to the protagonist's development, just disappears halfway through the story and we never know what finally happened to her. The story is frustrating, more than anything. Even the end seems a cheat; a Deus ex machina appears to take care of the monster. Ultimately, it doesn't really, but we're still left to wonder what the Deus ex machina was and why it intervened. This is a poor novel that might have been a good short story or novella."},{"Title":"The Parasite","review":"I read this book a couple of years ago...and yes it is confusioning @ times...I still liked it...But not as scary as I would of liked....More Occult and Astral Projection stuff...But a Mild thumbs up..."},{"Title":"The Shield - America's 1st Patriotic Comic Book Hero (The Red Circle Series)","review":"A new superhero hit the newsstands in January,1940. A hero that would wear a costume featuring the red, white, and blue of old glory. A patriotic superhero who defended America from its enemies...Nope, if you guessed Captain America you were wrong. It was The Shield, who would make his debut a full year before Captain America, in the pages of Pep Comics #1 from MLJ. This trade paperback, billed as America's First Patriotic Comic Book Hero, collects eight classic stories from the Golden Age of comics.While the Shield certainly influenced the creation of Captain America, The Shield was influenced no doubt by Superman. With the creation of a special chemical formula and a suit that allowed him to absorb those chemicals, the Shield had enormous powers, allowing him to withstand temperatures of 2000 degrees, bend steel walls, leap great distances and travel as swiftly as a bullet. In his secret identity, he was Joe Higgins, a G-Man working directly for J. Edgar Hoover. This volume collects the Shield stories from Pep Comics #1 - 5, and the three stories from Shield-Wizard #1.In the opening story, the Shield is sent on a mission by Hoover to break up a \\"Stokian\\" spy ring operating in the U.S. and creating great havoc. In those days the villains were fictional such as the \\"Stokians\\" or the \\"Mosconians\\" but it isn't too hard to tell who they are supposed to be. In the second story, American oil tankers are disappearing near Puerto Rico and The Shield is sent to investigate. He finds the \\"Nordics\\" are pirating the ships of their precious oil and the Shield metes out some serious justice.From Pep Comics #3 comes a tale with a very futuristic slant as mysterious enemy planes are dropping mines into the N.Y. Harbor. The enemy planes are too fast to be caught by our planes and the Shield takes on the case. He finds the planes can transform from aircraft to watercraft and follows them to a great, undersea lair.Story four is a two-part epic. In a tale that pre-dates the attack on Pearl Harbor by over a year, the Shield travels to Pearl to foil a plan of the Mosconians to cause a volcanic eruption that will wipe out the island. The story concludes in Pep Comics #5 as the Shield tracks the Mosconians back to their Washington D.C. hideout for the climactic battle. The final three stories are actually prequels to the above as we see the Shield's origin told in detail for the first time and we follow him on his first few cases as a G-Man as he battles saboteurs and a crime syndicate.Also included on the back cover is reprint from Pep Comics #66 from 1948, where the Shield says his goodbye to the members of his fan club as he turns the club over to Archie Andrews. By the late 1940's, superhero titles had fallen out of fashion with kids and the Shield was no different. But like so many Golden Age heroes he would be re-born in the Silver Age, but that's a story for another time.The Shield was created by writer Harry Shorten and artist Irv Novick, one of the greats of the Golden Age. These stories bring back such a sense of wonder and awe that is lacking in many superhero books today. Novick's style was simple, but clean and very representative of the era. The Shield's stories were eerily prophetic, especially those stories about Pearl Harbor, written well before December 7, 1941.So many classic Golden Age heroes have been lost over the decades and faded to obscurity. What a credit it is to the people at Archie Comics to put these classic stories into a great collection like this and to preserve such an important piece of Americana."},{"Title":"The Shield - America's 1st Patriotic Comic Book Hero (The Red Circle Series)","review":"This book contains a collection of comic books stories featuring The Shield (Comics first patriotic superhero) that waere originally published by MLJ Comics in the 1940's. MLJ Comics was the original name of Archie Comics back in the 1950's.The Shield first appeared in \\"Pep Comics\\" and was originally the lead feature. Archie then appeared in Pepe Comics #21 (I believe) and then became a hit taking over as the lead feature with The Shield becoming a back-up feature. Eventually, with the loss in popularity in superheroes after World War II, The Shield soon disappeared from the pages of Pep Comics altogether.ORIGIN: Upon the murder of his father, an FBI Agent and partner of a then young FBI Agent named J. Edgar Hoover, young Joe Higgins swears to pledge his life to fighting crime. Over the years, he exercises his body to physical perfection and becomes a scientific genius. He creates a star-spangled costume made of indestructible material which protects the wearer from harm. Joe Higgins follows in his father's footsteps and becoms an FBI Agent while also secretly aiding the FBI as the star-spangled, patriotic mystery man, The Shield.Later on, like many superheroes of the time, The Shield was given a kid sidekick named \\"dusty.\\" Also for some mysterious reason, The Shield's star-spangled costume seemed to lose it's indestructible qualities.The Shield had a short resurrection in the mid-1960's. when the original Shield is turned into a steel statue by a super-villain, The Shield's song, Joe Higgins, Jr., takes on the mantle of the Shield to bring man who turned his father into a steel statue to justice and to continue his father's fight against crime and evil. He also became a member of the superhero team, The Mighty Crusaders. (With The Shield's costume mysteriously regaining its indestrtible qualities again).Earlier in the 1960's, when Joe Simon and Jack Kirby were working for Archie Comics, they created a whole new version of the Shield atttempting to do what DC Comics successfully just did back then wit h The Flash and Green Lantern. the comic book was called \\"Private Strong: The Shield.\\" It only lasted for one issue.In the 1980's, Archie Comics tried to bring back The Shield and The Mighty Crusaders again with the original Shield being turned back from a steel statue to human again.DC Comics licensed The Shield twice from Archie Comics to revamp the character like they did with The Flash and Green Lantern once in the 1990's and the second time just recently. Both attempts were unseccessful.Well, now you can finally get to read the stories of the original Shield in this book."},{"Title":"The Shield - America's 1st Patriotic Comic Book Hero (The Red Circle Series)","review":"The Shield is an excellent read for the time period in which it was written. Pep Comics which introduced the Shield did it's best to teach kids about Truth, Justice, Patriotism and Courage and it's not a bad lesson to teach kids today. The Shield (Joe Higgins) - 1940Joe Higgins' father, Lieutenant Tom Higgins, was working on a formula that would grant super-strength to American soldiers. Tragically, Tom Higgins was killed in an act of German sabotage known as the Black Tom explosion, which was an attempt by the Nazis to acquire the formula. In the aftermath, Tom was framed as the saboteur. A chemistry student, Joe continued his studies after his father's death and completed the formula himself. He used the process on himself, gaining greath strength and invulnerability and deriving the name Shield from the process.After clearing his father's name, Joe joined the FBI and let only J. Edgar Hoover know of his dual identity. He soon recruited a young partner named Dusty Simmons after foreign agents were responsibly for the death of Dusty's father, giving them a common tragedy.The character's time in the spotlight was short-lived, lasting only a few years before the character of Archie skyrocketed in popularity and Archie Comics decided to shift their focus away from superheroes. (issue #50)This is Pep Comics 1-5 and Shield - Wizard #1.Created in 1940 by Harry Shorten and Irv Novick for Archie Comics, the Shield was actually the first patriotic American superhero who wore a costume patterned after the flag, predating Captain America by over a year. He quickly became the publisher's most popular superhero.This book like lots of comic magazines of the time are heavily influenced by Superman but I highly recommend this book if your a patriotic superhero fan along with the Shield I recommend Captain America and the Fighting American which is more set in the commie scare of the 50's.

His story is witty, eloquent, and moving. I have never had much interest in surfing, but that didn't change my enjoyment of the story. I particularly relished the parent-child dialogues and the amusing, self-deprecating recollections of childhood cognitions."},{"Title":"On a Wave: A Surfer Boyhood","review":"On a Wave is a wonderful memoir that has less to do with surfing than 70's American life as seen through the eyes of a sensitive(and poetic) young boy. Remember Tang, Pam, Pop-Tarts and the music of &quot;Won't You Marry Me, Bill?&quot; The book's honesty and candor and almost total lack of self-pity make On a Wave a touching and memorable story. If you take it to the beach, be sure to bring a couple of tissues."},{"Title":"On a Wave: A Surfer Boyhood","review":"I loved this book. It has a special closeness for me because I live in South Melbourne Beach- not far from Surf Road and Sebastian Inlet, where much of the book takes place. It was touching to read Thad's experiences here, as mine have been much the same- learning to ride alone on the deserted beach, the wildness and strangeness of a very special place.. he captured it perfectly, and I'm glad to report that it still has the same magic. A great book that will bring a tear to your eye more than once."},{"Title":"On a Wave: A Surfer Boyhood","review":"I'm not a surfer, never even thought about surfing much, but once I started this book I couldn't stop thinking about it. Ziolkowski's book is a very deftly written story about coming to know the world through a focus on one thing -- the wave, in all its shifting, complicated, living grace. By studying that one thing with all his heart, the writer finds a way through the ordinary struggles of coming of age, but through some extraordinary ones, too. ON A WAVE artfully evokes a time and a place, and also a time of life. It's one of the best new memoirs I've read for a while. It really does share some of the strength and character of Frank Conroy's STOP TIME, which is serious praise indeed."},{"Title":"On a Wave: A Surfer Boyhood","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book as it provided me with insight into a time and place that I often wondered about. I took special interest in this book as I was born and raised in Melbourne Beach, attended the same elementary, junior high, and high school as the author, and even lived on Avenue A for several years. However, what really drew me in was my love of surfing, and of my father (who was one of the characters in the book). Although I was but a twinkle in my father's eye during the time of the novel, the vivid descriptions of the surfing and of the characters were impressive. I too found myself longing to return to surfing, as I have long since traded in my wetsuit for a business suit. The author's description of the lure of the ocean, and his love of surfing, really hit home for me. There is a certain innocence in adolence that we often fail to appreciate until it has passed. Although I agree with the character Stan Dryden's recommendation to Thad that he focus on school and get a stable job in a corporation, I also think that it would be a mistake to completely walk away from Thad's first love . . . surfing. Upon finishing this book, I was left with mixed emotions . . . a sort of sadness and hope at the same time. It reminded me that my childhood days were truly over, but that the child in us is always there."},{"Title":"On a Wave: A Surfer Boyhood","review":"Excellently written, &quot;On A Wave&quot; effectively evokes the angst of growing up and searching for identity.

The writer brings you into his world in a way that anyone, especially someone of his era, can understand. I wish there was more! I was an avid surfer in Southern California, as a kid. But then came college, a job, life in a big city, marriage, kids, and soon you just forget about the surfing lifestyle, how it feels, what it means. I was hooked on this book from the prologue. And if that was all this book was about, then it wood have been a very enjoyable, good read. However, this book is so much more. It not only brought back the emotions of surfing, but also the emotions of childhood and growing up. I am so stoked to have found this book, and will pass it on to all my friends and family. I think I pull my board down from the rafters of my garage and clean it off this weekend. Who knows what could happen!"},{"Title":"On a Wave: A Surfer Boyhood","review":"This book took me back to a time that I am having a hard time remembering, now that I am slightly past 40. I used to see Thad in the hallways in high school, but sadly never got to know him. I also remember seeing a picture of his little brother Adam in Skateboarding magazine, as a profile for an up and coming skateboarder. Thad captured the mood perfectly of that brief time in the 70's where nothing else mattered but surfing (and girls). Several years ago, I rediscovered the almost religious feeling you get out in the ocean surfing with your buddies. While a lot of guys my age, at work, play golf on their off time, I've hooked up with several guys who like to arrive at the beach at day break, sip 7-11 coffee and paddle out in the lineup.

It's not just about a surfer searching for perfection, but a boy searching for himself in post-Vietnam era of sunny Florida, where everyone is tan and bleachy-haired, Led Zeppelin is on every radio, and pot is as prevalent as palm trees.The story begins with the author at ten, still reeling from his parents' divorce and craving diversion like any normal kid. But it is surfing that becomes his ultimate grace, giving him confidence and the room to dream outside the troubles at home. When his family begins to unravel, his heartbreak at dreams realized and lost will strike a sympathetic chord in anyone who is connected to the sea, to family, and to one's true self. The author's search for his identity comes full circle--beginning, ending, and beginning again--on a wave."},{"Title":"On a Wave: A Surfer Boyhood","review":"I loved this story of a young boy's passion for the ocean easing his growing pains.

How refreshing it is to read someone who gives techniques and information without some mystical mumbo-jumbo. The Flute of God is the real thing for people who want to begin directly connecting with Spirit and to discover our higher nature as Soul. The sections on the creative imagination are simply astonishing."},{"Title":"The Flute of God","review":"According to Paul Twitchell, the author of The Flute of God, Spirit or Divine Spirit is a creative Current from the heart of God, which creates, sustains and dissolves all matter in due course. This Spirit can be seen as Light and heard as Sound by whoever is open to it. We are totally dependent upon this Divine Current of God. But most people are unconscious of this fact.To work with this Spirit to better our lives, we need to understand its nature and laws. For instance, the Law of Cause and Effect is a fixed law of the Holy Spirit that must be obeyed by all or adverse consequences would follow, according to Twitchell.We are all made in the image and likeness of God; that is the higher side of every human being. This is what Twitchel calls Soul. According to him, when we identify with the body, we become paralyzed with fear and so cannot enjoy the best of life that the children of God are entitled to and capable of. This is clearly stated on page 140:\\"The true purpose of any seeker is to know Soul as his beingness. This leads into wisdom and one becomes immortal. Those who know that the source of intelligence is Soul, attain immortality; those who do not know it remain attached to the material body and senses and are therefore subject to birth and death. Become conscious of the immortal Soul. When this consciousness of the immortal self is gained, all fear vanishes. Fear of death rises from ignorance, which makes us forget our immortal nature and identify ourselves with the material body, which is subject to death.\\"This book is to be read several times before one could absorb all the esoteric wisdom within its golden pages. Even though i have read it for over thirty times and still browse through it now and then, the deep spiritual truths it contains still ring with freshness each time i open it.I truly recommend this book to anyone who is seriously looking for proper understanding of themselves, the psychology of Spirit and how to work with it, as well as gaining the higher knowledge of God. Twitchell also introduces and discusses HU, the ancient, holy name of God. This powerful word goes hand in hand with learning the deeper wisdom of God.You can learn why our dreams often don't come true, the effect of wrong thinking to our overall wellbeing as well as how to manifest our heart's desires, and many more from this intriguing book."},{"Title":"The Flute of God","review":"The Flute of God, by Paul Twitchell, is a primer on the Spiritual Laws of Life. (I also recommend a book by the same name:Spiritual Laws of Life) Just now, I opened the book at random to give a flavor of what is contained within. On p. 129, Paul writes, \\"This mental attitude [dwelling in the secret place of the most High] is of immense value in setting the individual free from worry and anxiety; as a consequence, our lives become more efficient and happier.\\" That pretty much expresses my experience with it in a nutshell.The Flute of God is about who you really are--Soul, immortal and creative. Unlike some other teachings, it is NOT about how to manifest things, although you will learn how to be more creative and better care for yourself. It's about why you are here--to serve not just yourself, but all life. It teaches you the real meaning of \\"Seek first the Kingdom of God and all else shall be added unto you.\\"This is not an easy read, but it it a compelling one. It is clear that Paul gathered wisdom from many sources--both physical and spiritual--and did an amazing job of converting these universal truths into a words. These things are a challenge to get your mind around! But somehow, he managed to get the job done.If you want to run your life better, read this book--and then share it with someone you love!"},{"Title":"The Flute of God","review":"This is the one book that I have read over and over through out my life.

An amazing work for an amazing time."},{"Title":"The Flute of God","review":"This is a 1969 copyright and Twitchell was still fine tuning his new creation of Eckankar. Actually, there are some interesting concepts and factual information contained within this book, but Twitchell does not give his sources. Instead, Twitchell plagiarizes from other sources like \\"The Path of the Masters\\" by Julian P. Johnson. Twitchell is actually Westernizing the teachings of Radasoami Satsang and making himself the Living Master (mahanta). Since Twitchell was not given the leadership role (or even close to it) by his former Master Kirpal Singh (not Sudar) he decided to make himself the Master of all Masters. Twitchell accomplished this by creating a lineage of (Eck) Masters and had one of these (Rebazar Tarzs) initiate him as Mahanta (a title Twitchell created). By the way, Eckankar sees the \\"God\\" of other religions as a 2nd or 4th Plane (heaven) God. The position of Mahanta resides on the 14th Plane and the one true \\"God\\" for members of Eckankar (Eckists) is called SUGMAD.

Most enjoyable!

The insurance company has a liability in an accident, and thinks the victim is a malingerer who is claiming a whiplash injury of the cervical vertebrae. But whiplash can't be shown on X-rays. After the injured receives a settlement there is often a rapid and miraculous recovery. Juries don't like any spying that entraps plaintiffs. So they developed a scheme: send the plaintiff to a dude ranch to show he can take part in physical activities. If the man asks to take his wife the company will settle the case. But if the man leaves his wife at home they know he is a cheap chiseler. Lam will go to this dude ranch to observe Helmann Bruno, get acquainted with some unattached girl, and create rivalry so Bruno will start to show off. Then Lam will provide the names of witnesses to Bruno's actions. Lam will also find out about his character, his background, his likes and dislikes. But Lam doesn't like the idea of putting a girl into an embarrassing position. Breckinridge tells of the problem in using a regular female operative: the pair can work too closely together.In Chapter 2 Lam lands at Tucson and meets \\"Buck\\" Kramer. [There is an amusing conversation.] Lam meets an artist, Faith Callison, who paints and also takes motion-pictures of people enjoying themselves. She sells copies to guests, and in one case an insurance company. Chapter 3 tells what a day at a dude ranch is like. There is a light and noise from the adjoining cabin, and it wakes up Lam (Chapter 4). In the next chapter Lam investigates the Bruno household to discover more about their background. In Chapter 6 Lam goes to meet Breckinridge and report his findings. Homer's wife asks a few questions and telegraphs her attitude. When they go to see the insured defendant they get a surprise! The police are also looking for Foley Chester. Lam continues his investigation of Melita Doon, who visited that dude ranch. But other facts make Breckinridge anxious to settle, and Lam is sent back to make a deal.Donald Lam returns to the dude ranch, and meets a new guest Alexis B. Melvin. Melvin is a lawyer for Bruno and had his own investigation (Chapter 13). Melvin has motion pictures showing Bruno at the dude ranch, a trap maintained by the insurance company to get people to overexert themselves! Lam reports to Breckinridge, and is told to settle the case in 48 hours (Chapter 14). When Lam arrives at Los Angeles Sgt. Sellers meets him and the scam starts to fall apart. Lam figures out the facts behind the mystery. Lam \\"knows how these things are\\" (Chapter 15).The addition of \\"head rests\\" to automobile seats since the late 1960s has diminished whiplash injuries. The requirement for police reports has liminated fraudulent accidents as in this book. But stealing a corpse from a hospital seems highly improbable."},{"Title":"Captain Teachum's Buried Treasure","review":"Good book to use at the beginning of a treasure hunt. There is so much to look at and talk about in the illustrations. It also teaches us to keep looking for our treasure - it is out there somewhere. Fun book for pirate hungry children."},{"Title":"Maria Chapdelaine:","review":"When recalling the past we tend to idealize it, to view it with fondness and nostalgia, and to hold them up as the best of times. But the question becomes, were those times really that good? Why do we recall them with such fondness? Why do we hold them up as a paragon for how we should live our lives today? Invariably we find some fault or failing of or present age, something we wish we could change. We idealize and objectify the past, remembering the good and forgetting the bad. \\"Maria Chapdelaine\\" is hardly a nostalgic trip down memory lane. The Quebecois who populate the book are living a hardscrabble life that wouldn't seem out of place in the American South, and yet the simple life is all they know. Like Southerners the Quebecois life revolves around family, farm, and faith. In some respects \\"Maria Chapdelaine\\" reminds me of Margaret Mitchell's \\"Gone with the Wind\\"; both are reflections on a society that is passing from remembrance, which is being changed by outside influences and events. Both authors wrote their novels as their societies were beginning to change and adapt to modernity and outside influences and they both served as a means of capturing the essence of the world that was passing from memory. And much like \\"Gone with the Wind\\", \\"Maria Chapdelaine\\" is about the concept of place, how you are perceived by others, and the role of community in enforcing conformity. While there is considerable difference in the central characters, the themes remain similar. Maria has to make choices that are shaped and informed by the environment she lives in. While Scarlet is rebellious, Maria is chaste and demure, the embodiment of the ideal of womanhood for Quebecois. Like Scarlet, Maria is conflicted over potential suitors, the adventurous Francois Paradis, fellow neighbor Eutrope Gagnon, and Lorenzo Suprenant, who has rejected the country for the city. This troika of suitors represent the three directions Quebec was being pulled in. All three men are symbolic representations of Quebec: Francois representing Quebec's voyageur past, Eutrope the present, and Lorenzo the future. Maria's heart is truly with Francois (the past), but when he meets and untimely end Maria ultimately rejects Lorenzo (the future), settling instead for Eutrope (the present). The world around Maria seeks to ratify the status quo, to glorify the ideals of family, farm, and faith. While it appears Maria wants to break free of that life and transcend it, those thoughts are nothing more than passing fancies. The passing of her mother amidst the trapping of their hardscrabble existence should have been motivation for Maria to chose Lorenzo and leave her environs, yet she sees her mother as the embodiment of perfect womanhood and knows she must stay. While Scarlet is headstrong, impulsive, and pragmatic, Maria is stoic, contemplative, and something of an idealist. To leave her family and her place would be a betrayal. She is as much a part of the land as is Eutrope.In a sense \\"Maria Chapdelaine\\" is almost existential. Maria's community feels far removed from the outside world, as though forgotten and abandoned. The power's that control the characters destiny are far removed and detached, and there is little these characters can do to take matters into their own hands. They are left to their own devices and must cope with the world as best they can. You can learn as much about a society from reading the literature it produces as you can from reading its history and that is true here. Literature is not only a reflection of a society, but also its shared common heritage and values. Yet some themes are universal, which is what makes \\"Maria Chapdelaine\\" relevant and important. Maria seeks to belong to a community, to a place. She seeks the validation and ratification of those around her and seeks guidance from those institutions that are central to her life. The peer pressures of her community force conformity, meaning Maria stay in the community and marry Eutrope. We see a little of ourselves in both Maria, attempting to relate to changes in our world and grappling with challenges both great and small. We often see ourselves as living lives removed from the larger issues of the world, distant and removed. Yet with dignity and grace and humor we cope with those changes and look back on lessons learned with fondness."},{"Title":"Maria Chapdelaine:","review":"A deeply moving novel about the permanent things of life and the great joys they bring to a person's life, despite all the problems and sufferings that are endured.

Maybe it would have been his last! But his mythic hero, Nathaniel Bumppo (a.k.a. Natty, Deerslayer, The Long Carrabine, Hawkeye, et. al.)had such a mid-19th Century following that Cooper was practically guaranteed an eager, receptive audience for his tales.I won't say straight out that &quot;Deerslayer&quot; is a terrible book. If nothing else, Donald Pease's introductory essay informs us of several plot complexities that are intertwined with Cooper's personal life, such as the re-invention of Natty Bumppo to buttress and justiry Cooper's real-life legal property claims. But, if &quot;Deerslayer&quot; is not a terrible book, it is for hundreds of pages something less than scintillating. Why? I think it comes down to this. Patient readers can endure quite a lot of moralizing, or wide swaths of verbosity. But put the two together and it's hard to endure.The story takes place on Cooper's real-life ancestral home, Lake Otsego in mid-upstate New York (my friends tell me the pronunciation is &quot;Otsaga&quot; with a short &quot;a&quot;) where we first encounter a youthful Natty Bumppo and his unlikely fellow traveler, Harry &quot;Hurry&quot; March, an indestructible, Paul Bunyonesque figure whose credo can be summarized as &quot;might makes right.&quot; Natty (given the sobriquet, Deerslayer, by his adopted Delaware tribe) has arrived at the lake to join his companion, Chingachgook, (the &quot;Serpant&quot;), in his quest to liberate his future bride, Wah-ta-Wah, who was kidnapped by a band of Huron Indians. Harry March has come to the lake to capture the heart of Judith Hutter, who along with her father, Thomas, and simple-minded sister, Hetty, live on the lake, occupying either a floating ark or a fortress-like structure built upon the lake.Eventually, the Hutters are surrounded by dozens of fierce Huron warriors, who are on the warpath during the opening days of the mid-18th Century French &amp; Indian Wars. Seemingly, it was all there for Cooper to capitalize on: just a handful of isolated white settlers, whose only protection from scalp-seeking, torture-minded skulking Hurons is a crank sailing craft or a lake home on stilts. But Cooper rejects his own dramatic setting to stage a morality play, and a heavy-handed one at that.A word about the Hutter sisters. Diametrically opposed siblings are at least as old as the Bible, and Cooper employed them in several novels, including &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; and &quot;The Spy&quot; (far superior works than &quot;Deerslayer&quot;.) Hetty is Cooper's example of purity and innocence, but we can leave her to the Hurons, who display an admirable level of respect and reverence for the frail-minded girl. I suspect she would have fared much better in the hands of so-called savages than in the typical 18th Century colonial settlement. It is her vain, beautiful and high-tempered older sister, Judith, whose character is of more interest, and requires in my opinion a little rehabilitation.It is never made explicit by Cooper (no doubt it would have scandalized his audience) but I think it's fair to say that Judith Hutter -- much to her regret later on -- granted her last favors to at least one colonial British officer (maybe several.) And, if this is a mis-reading of the text, she most certainly did &quot;something&quot; to set the colonial tongues a wagging. Whatever her &quot;failings&quot;, they would not be recognized as such by modern day readers (perhaps her vanity and self-centeredness would go unnoticed as well.) There was, however, little tolerance for a Judith Hutter in the 18th Century, and Cooper would have never permitted Natty Bumppo -- young, virginal and selfless -- to fall in love with this high-spirited young woman. (Besides, it would not have chronologically tied in with his future exploits.)But I'm not entirely convinced. Judith Hutter possesses several admirable traits, not the least of which is intelligence, bravery and a certain loving devotion to her frail sister. She also recognizes Natty Bumppo's virtues, as well as her own faults, and is more than willing to embrace the former and cast off the latter. Her love for Natty is obvious for hundreds of pages, but somehow he doesn't quite get it! In the end, the girl must swallow her pride and make explicit what even modern day women would find nearly unthinkable -- she makes an outright marriage proposal. Alas, Natty Bumppo is simply &quot;too good&quot; for her.To use a modern day expression, Cooper is over the top with the virtuous Natty Bumppo. At some point, self-abnegation is just another form of narcissism -- only more complex than the garden variety of narcissism possessed by Judith Hutter (and other mere mortals.) In his introductory essay, Donald Pease points out that the rejection of Judith Hutter balances the brutal rejection Natty Bumppo receives at the hands of Mabel Dunham in an earlier Leatherstocking tale, &quot;The Pathfinder&quot;. Maybe. But consider this. To honor his parole from the Hurons, Natty Bumppo chooses torture over Judith Hutter. And, ultimately, he chooses a famous rifle over her -- a gift she lovingly gives to him in recognition of how much he would appreciate such a weapon. It comes down to this: torture and guns over Judith Hutter! Hmmm.... I'll leave that one for modern day psychologists.I've given &quot;Deerslayer&quot; three stars because Cooper is, after all, one of our nation's early literary masters, and &quot;Deerslayer&quot; is not without its moments. There's a wonderful give-and-take scene between Natty Bumppo and the Huron Chief, Rivenoak, as they negotiate the release of Thomas Hutter and Harry March. (My advice to modern day corporations: don't bother with negotiation consultants -- save your money and read Chapter 14.) And for those who still believe in the right of every American to bear arms, take it from the author who created our nation's first true literary sharpshooter. There's a haunting, prescient admonishment about leaving loaded guns lying about the house (pages 219-220.)"},{"Title":"The Deerslayer","review":"Cooper's final Leatherstocking Tale, The Deerslayer, depicts young Natty Bumppo on his first warpath with lifelong friend-to-be, Chingachgook. The story centers around a lake used as the chronologically subsequent setting for Cooper's first Leatherstocking Tale, The Pioneers. Tom Hutter lives on the lake with his daughters and it is here that Deerslayer (Bumppo) intends to meet Chingachgook to rescue Chingachgook's betrothed from a band of roving Iroquois. A desperate battle for control of the lake and it's immediate environs ensues and consumes the remainder of the story.Throughout this ultimate Leatherstocking Tale, Cooper provides Natty much to postulate upon. Seemingly desiring a comprehensive finality to the philosophy of Bumppo, Cooper has Natty \\"speechify\\" in The Deerslayer more so than in any other book, though the character could hardly be considered laconic in any. Though the reason for this is obvious and expected (it is, after all, Cooper's last book of the series), it still detracts a tad from the pace of the story as Natty picks some highly inappropriate moments within the plot to elaborate his position. And, thus, somewhat incongruently, Cooper is forced to award accumulated wisdom to Bummpo at the beginning of his career rather than have him achieve it through chronological accrual.All things considered, however, The Deerslayer is not remarkably less fun than any other Leatherstalking Tale and deserves a similar rating. Thus, I award The Deerslayer 4+ stars and the entire Leatherstocking Tales series, one of the better examples of historical fiction of the romantic style, the ultimate rating of 5. It was well worth my time."},{"Title":"The Deerslayer","review":"\\"The Deerslayer\\" is the sequentially first in the Leatherstocking series of America's first, great, professional novelist, James Fenimore Cooper. I read it in preparation for a trip to Cooperstown, New York and I am glad that I did. Set in upstate New York in the 1740s, it provides the reader with an idolized introduction to the society of white and red of this colonial frontier.The criticisms that the dialogue and actions are totally unbelievable, while justified, do not detract from the story. While the simple, faith-filled actions of the \\"Feeble Minded Hetty\\" and the dialogue between Deerslayer and Chingachgook seem highly improbable, the do hold the readers' interest. While I am generally not one to pick up readily on character development, this novel is an exception. The contrast between Deerslayer and Chingachgook, the romance between Chingachgook and Wah-ta-Wah, the romantic web among Judith, Hurry Harry and Deerslayer, and the varying responses to changes in circumstance coming from sisters Judith and Hetty all contribute to the persistent popularity of this work.Despite all the criticisms directed against Cooper as to form, the one thing that cannot be denied is that this book is very difficult to put down. I found myself always wondering what would come next and what would happen to the characters whom I had come to know. Whether you are looking for an insight into early American literature or just a good story, your search should lead to \\"The Deerslayer\\"."},{"Title":"The Deerslayer","review":"Race relations, environmental concerns, independent womanhood, the importance of personal character, survivalism, heroism, religion, cultural relativism, nature v. nurture, independence v. inter-dependency--sound like the latest hot topics in American TV, movies, and magazines? Actually, these constitute the bevy of themes that James Fenimore Cooper explored as foundational to the American experience when he wrote *Deerslayer* in 1841, setting it even farther back at the time of the French and Indian War, 1754-63. Some readers, not surprisingly, are put off by the ornate writing style of the early nineteenth century, but it doesn't hurt us post-moderns to turn off the TV and take a slower pace, interacting slowly with the writer and his thoughts. In Natty Bumppo, we find the first--and definitive--delineation of the American hero: selfless, dependable, restrained, tolerant, cagey, and moral. A generation raised on anti-heroes sometimes has a bit of a problem with the morality of Bumppo, but since 9/11, we have seen a revival of the American ideal that Cooper first defined in his Leatherstocking Tales. Don't give up on this one because of the language. Sit a bit and mull it over. You'll find Cooper will deliver remarkably well."},{"Title":"The Deerslayer","review":"James Fenimore Cooper wrote his Leatherstocking tales out of chronological order. The Deerslayer or The First Warpath was the last of the Natty Bumppo novels and because Cooper had matured both in age and artistic ability it is perhaps the best.From the beginning we know this is a darker novel than the preceding tales. In the first few pages Deerslayer's companion, Hurry Harry, asks the young man, \\"...Did you ever hit any thing human, or intelligible: did you ever pull trigger on an inimy that was capable of pulling one upon you?\\"Bumppo's answer is, of course, no. He is at the beginning of his career. He is known as Deerslayer by the Delawares because that's what he does. He has yet to take a human life. As soon as we read this we know this novel, above all else, is a coming-of-age story and someone's life is ticking away....In the interim Deerslayer meets Tom Hutter and his two daughters, the dark-haired Judith and the feeble-minded Hetty. The family lives on a castle-on-piers in the middle of Lake Glimmerglass, a secluded spot akin to the Garden of Eden -- the perfect setting for a coming-of-age story. Except things are not what they seem. This area is actually more of a haunt of savagery, with not a little of it supplied by both Hurry Harry and Tom Hutter against the local Native American tribe, the Hurons.Judith Hutter, however, is the engine that drives this story. She's a woman with questionable morals, and though she's somewhat older than Deerslayer she falls in love with his open honesty and his natural way of looking at the world. In a telling exchange she asks him if he has a sweetheart. He answers:\\"She's in the forest, Judith--hanging from the boughs of the trees, in a soft rain--in the dew on the open grass--the clouds that float about in the blue heavens--the birds that sing in the woods--the sweet springs where I slake my thirst....\\"Judith perseveres. Has he never heard the laugh of a girl he loves? Deerslayer remains true to form:\\"...To me there's no music so sweet as the sighing of the wind in the treetops, and the rippling of a stream from a full, sparkling, natyve fountain of fresh water, unless...it be the open mouth of a sartain hound, when I'm on the track of a fat buck.\\"In the pages that follow Deerslayer kills a man, a Native American attempting to take his life by deceit. He earns the reputation as \\"Hawkeye\\" for his deft shooting and helps Chingachgook secure the safety of his future wife, Hist. (She will be mother to the Last of the Mohicans, Uncas.) Further violence and treachery abound as Deerslayer is captured by the Hurons and tortured. Tom Hutter dies in an extremely gruesome manner and there's the mystery of Judith's past --even down to her parentage-- to be solved. But her love for Deerslayer is true and in the end she gives him her father's gun, a weapon of exquisite manufacture and excellent bore, which he will make famous--the long rifle, Killdeer.In the end Deerslayer leaves Judith after yet more tragedy ensues. The novel ends fifteen years later with Hawkeye returning with Chingachgook and a stripling Uncas to Lake Glimmerglass. Everything has changed. The castle is abandoned and in disrepair, and the graves can no longer be found. Hawkeye tries to find out what happened to Judith, and we are awarded a glimpse of her fate, but no more.As I said earlier this is a fairly dark book in the Leatherstocking Tales, but well-written. It's a good story and the characters really do come to life. There are the usual elements of humor and long-winded conversations but they don't detract too much from the overall enjoyment of this tale. Cooper also doesn't hold back in showing that violence, both necessary and ignoble, can come from anyone for any reason...at anytime.This is one great book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Deerslayer","review":"The last book James Fenimore Cooper wrote about Nathaniel 'Natty' Bumppo (Hawkeye) and the Mohican chief Chingachgook is the first from a chronological standpoint. 'The Deerslayer' is a fontier adventure set in New York state in the decades before the Revolutionary War.Overall it is a good read, though Cooper's dialogue can get very repetitive. I often found this frustrating but, on the other hand, I could certainly believe these young, rustic characters would converse the way Cooper presents.Cooper is a good enough writer to comfortably show his characters limitations. For example, in one scene Hawkeye worries that an ornate chesspiece is an idol and runs on about the evils of idolatry while a more sophisticated character is amused at his simplicity. Elsewhere, one of the female characters lectures Chingachgook about his wife in a way that is pretty condescending. Such well-intended misfires were probably common on the frontier, and I found them to be good characterization even though these scenes weren't really relevant to the plot.Charm or no charm, it's impossible to read Cooper without noting that his plots are often glacial in their pacing. Frankly, this will be a deal-killer for many modern readers. However, I prefer to accept the slower pacing in this book. This was frontier America in the 1700s, not downtown New York City in 2008. Things and people would have moved at a slower pace. For me, the pacing is an element of the setting and characters. It's certainly true that when the action does kick in Cooper's writing becomes surprisingly tight. Inconsistent pacing or integrity of vision? You be the judge.Cooper's main flaw that cannot be debated about or excused is his habit of painting 'tableaux' scenes that make you want to toss your lunch. He has a dreadful tendency to insert sour notes of Victorian sentamentality, which are as dissonant in his rustic tale as as a loud fart during a violin solo.Bottom line, I enjoyed 'The Deerslayer' although, admittedly, I adapted myself to Cooper's pacing and intentions. I also believe that, if you read the novels in their actual written order, 'The Deerslayer' will be a very touching coda because it provides some interesting back story: the origin of Killdeer, Uncas' mother, and there's even a tantalizing hint about how Natty came to be among the Delawares. Cooper does a fantastic job of 'ending with the beginning.'At the end of the day, the Leatherstocking Tales stand alone in their depiction of frontier life. Though Cooper wrote decades after the foundation of America, he gives me the feel of the colonial frontier and our American heritage like no other author I can think of. For this reason, his works are an American treasure."},{"Title":"The Deerslayer","review":"The Deerslayer is so much more than just &quot;the adventures of Natty Bumppo&quot;. Cooper (incidentally, a flunky of Yale College!) creates in Deerslayer, or more aptly nick-named, Hawkeye, an idealistic, forthright, honorable man, who although born into a lower station has more &quot;class&quot; than a nobleman. Deerslayer, set in the early 1700's in the area of Lake Mohawk, New York, not only provides a vivid portrait of this beautiful natural area, but philosophizes religion, spirituality, race, women and men, nature and technology, good and evil. Deerslayer even contemplates the subjects of sex and incest. As we approach the millenium and are faced with extremely difficult choices, a visit back to our forefather's ruminations on these timeless issues can only aid us, and it's good action-packed entertainment, as well! (This book is also geographically accurate - it even mentions the Susquehanna River that flows through the valley where I grew up!)"},{"Title":"The Deerslayer","review":"The story of Natty Bumpo named the &quot;Deerslayer&quot; by his Native American friends/enemies is a classic tale of American independence and self reliance.

A must read for anyone looking for accurate descriptions of life in the wooded frontier"},{"Title":"The Deerslayer","review":"This book definitely must be read in the context of the culture in which it was written. I won't comment on the story line, it has been well reviewed by others. It does contain a good story, but is somewhat verbose, over descriptive, and slow, if viewed from a modern perspective. It is more mythology than history, but offers much insight into America of the 18th and 19th centuries. The characters are well developed, but Cooper can be a bit repetitive in this regard. It also contains a large amount of racial prejudice, but (not to excuse this), it must remembered that this is the way our country was in the mid 1800s. (That's when the book was written, it is set in the mid 1700s and probably accurately reflects the culture of that time, too.) Slightly counter balancing the racial bias, it does raise questions about the behavior of the European Americans also, asking how we could preach &quot;love thy neighbor&quot; while murdering the Native Americans and stealing their lands. On the whole, I found this book to be entertaining and educational, I did get caught up in the story, found the characters to be empathetic and would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Deerslayer","review":"Beautifully written and descriptive, this first of the Leatherstocking tales introduces Natty Bumppo as a raw backwoodsmen with exceptional hunting skills but qualms about fighting. His grappling with the issue as he protects a pair of maidens under siege begins to give birth to the 'Hawkeye' so well known in the follow-up novel \\"the Last of the Mohicans'.The pace can be a little plodding, as chapters follow the plot's progress at almost hourly increments. That said, the action is gripping, the writing is otherwise crisp, and the characters have excellent depth."},{"Title":"The Deerslayer","review":"I enjoyed this book for the most part, although I do agree that at times Cooper did get a little bit too wordy. Unfortunately, the reviewer from Louisville, Kentucky does not realize that while he claims Cooper got too wordy, his review takes up half the screen. I think that the ending was very fitting. I feel for the poor idiot who had to marry that moron Judith, because, as we all know, all women are Communists."},{"Title":"The Deerslayer","review":"This is the most overly verbose and wordy novel I have ever read. Cooper is a very poor writer, in that, in reading this book, I felt like I was reading a very rough, stream-of-consciousness type diatribe that was more concerned with the surroundings of the forest rather than the characters and the action. I explicitly remember reading one passgae in which one of the &quot;evil&quot; Indians throws a tomahawk at Deerslayer, and while it's flying at him, Cooper proceeds to fill us in on the trees again and how green they are FOR THREE PAGES. Then, abruptly returning to his narrative, he very point-blank says that Deerslayer catches the tomahawk. I remember readign this and thinking, &quot;Waitaminiute! Where did this come from? What tomahawk? I thought we were talking about the trees?&quot; And, as another reviewer put it, Deerslayer comes off as being very one-dimensional. I don't know about anyone else, but I prefer more 3D characters who are more human, who struggle with internal conflict and interests. With Deerslayer it was very much, this is right, this is wrong, I always do what is right, and I stay away from women because that leads to weakness and the trees will no longer be as green. I remember reading the Cliff's Notes for this and at one point, in the summary section, the author of the Notes says that the trees are &quot;still green.&quot; I think this could have been much better if Deerslayer was more human, had some internal conflict and the action and interaction between characters were the focus, rather than the trees being green."},{"Title":"The Deerslayer","review":"I like what James Fenimore Cooper used in describing the war for independence. The way that he potrayed the characters is very good and he brilliantly described how the Indian war went. He described the Deerslayer as a white intelligent man who always have good explanation for every question. He described his friend Harry or March as a person that always jump into conclusion.

Over 16 read them in the order they were written and try not to be too disappointed in with this later effort."},{"Title":"The Deerslayer","review":"Seeking to reprise his earlier success with The Last of the Mohicans, James Fenimore Cooper went on to write several other tales built around his heroic character Natty Bumppo (called \\"Hawkeye\\" in Mohicans and \\"Pathfinder\\" in the book of THAT name). In this one our hero is known as \\"Deerslayer\\" for his facility on the hunt and is shown as the younger incarnation of that paragon of frontier virtue we got to know in the earlier books. In this one, too, we see how he got his most famous appellation: \\"Hawkeye\\". But, this time out, our hero comes across as woefully tiresome (perhaps it's because we see too much of him in this book, where he's almost a side character in Mohicans). Yet some of Cooper's writing skills seem sharper here (he no longer avers that Natty is the taciturn type, for instance, while having the fellow forever running off at the mouth). But, while there are some good moments & excitement, this tale really doesn't go all that far -- and its rife with cliches already overworked from the earlier books. The worst part is the verbose, simple-minded self-righteousness of our hero, himself, taken to the point of absolute unbelievability. He spurns the love of a beautiful young woman (though he obviously admires her) for the forester's life (as though he couldn't really have both), yet we're expected to believe he's a full-blooded young American male. And he's insufferably \\"moral\\", a veritable goody two-shoes of the woodlands. At the same time, the Indians huff & puff a lot on the shore of the lake where Deerslayer finds himself in this tale (in alliance with a settler, his two daughters, a boorish fellow woodsman, and Deerslayer's own erstwhile but loyal Indian companion Chingachgook -- \\"The Big Sarpent,\\" as Natty translates his name). But the native Americans seem ultimately unable to overwhelm the less numerous settlers who have taken refuge from them in the middle of Lake Glimmerglass (inside a frontier house built of logs and set in the lake bed on stilts). There is much racing around the lake as Deerslayer and the others strive to keep the few canoes in the vicinity from falling into the hands of the tribe of marauding Hurons who have stopped in the nearby woods on their way back up to Canada (fleeing the American colonists and the British at the outbreak of English-French hostilities -- since these Hurons are allied with the French). And there are lots of dramatic encounters, with some deaths, but the Indians seem to take it all with relative equanimity, while trying to find a way to get at the whites who are precariously ensconced out on the lake. (It seems to take them the better part of two days, for instance, to figure out they can build rafts to make up for their lack of canoes -- and why couldn't they just build their own canoes, in any case -- and how is it they don't have any along with them since it's obvious they'll have to cross a number of waterways to successfully make it back to the homeland in Canada?) The settler and the boorish woodsman, for their part, do their stupid best to attack the Indians unnecessarily, getting captured then ransomed in the process, while Deerslayer and Chingachgook contrive to get the loyal Indian's betrothed free from the Hurons (it seems she has been kidnapped by them -- the reason Deerslayer and Chingachgook are in the vicinity in the first place). In the meantime the simple-minded younger daughter of the settler (Cooper seems to like this motif since he used a strong daughter and a simpler sister in Mohicans, as well) wanders in and out of the Indian's encampment without sustaining any hurt on the grounds that the noble red men recognize the \\"special\\" nature of this poor afflicted young woman (Cooper used this motif in Mohicans, too). In the end there's lots of sturm und drang but not much of a tale -- at least not one which rings true or touches the right chords for the modern reader. Cooper tried to give us more of Hawkeye in keeping with what he thought his readers wanted but, in this case, more is definitely too much. --- Stuart W.

And the book ended in such a goofy non-realistic morose way, that I wish I had stopped reading a few chapters before the end and imagined the ending happen the way I would have liked it to.So I was dragging through the beginning, loving the middle, and depressed when I finished. Very odd sensation to read a book and get those kinds of feelings..."},{"Title":"The Deerslayer","review":"Okaay, so I haven't read it all but I just wanted to say Deerslayer is a pretty neat story so far.

Abramson provides a lucid framework for understanding the dynamics of the information economy--a virtual theory of everything. Innovation isn't enough; bubble's are normal; a regulatory and legal framework is necessary for consistent advancement; most important, the choices we make now as a society will affect the direction and growth of the information economy. Read this book--then everything else you read about about the technology, law and economics of the information economy will make sense."},{"Title":"Digital Phoenix: Why the Information Economy Collapsed and How It Will Rise Again","review":"Abramson is the ultimate story teller. This collection of essays provides a multi-disciplinary foundation to understanding how we became global citizens of the Information Age. Whether your interest lies in law, economics, politics or computer science, you will find the time invested in the book very worthwhile. Read it once for an overview; read it again to become truly knowledgeable. Keep it at hand as a reference."},{"Title":"Digital Phoenix: Why the Information Economy Collapsed and How It Will Rise Again","review":"Don't be scared...this is MIT press, but popular writing. Abramson nails it: why it happened, what's apt to happen in the future.

Worthy of reading twice: once for the stories, once for the underlying arguments."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy: What It Is, With All the Kinds, Causes, Symptoms, Prognostics & Several Cures It; In Three Partitions with Their Several Sections, Members & Subsections Philosophically, Medicinally, HIstorically Opened & Cut Up","review":"although i have yet to finish this treat, i have enjoyed reading it so far. i'm not an english major so it is a little more engaging than what i'm normally used to. but i can feel my brain growing as i steadily crawl through the pages.

This for all of you autodidacts who love poring over your unabridged editions of the OED in search of abstruse verbal arcana and the history of obsolete verbiage (Ahem, I include myself in your number, of course.). This is one aspect of this Gargantuan tome, and the most delightful one. The other aspect is rather more nebulous: What exactly is this book about, and why was it penned? The obvious answer to the first part of the query is &quot;melancholy.&quot; But melancholy, as here laid forth, is a seemingly ubiquitous and all-encompassing malady, as it were. &quot;For indeed who is not a fool, melancholy, mad?&quot; And who knows exactly why it was penned? So little is known of Burton and the incidents of his life: Save, of course, that he was well-acquainted with the unfelicitous side of things. - There is a sweetness in his accounting of it though, that is oddly reminiscent of the subaqueous tones of Debussy. One is not surprised either to find that Keats was one of Burton's readers.-The same dulcet sadness lures us into a kind of bittersweet repose, as in the opening lines of the poet's &quot;Ode To A Nightingale.&quot;-Burton had a calling and this book was his answer to it.- All arguments in re the whys and wherefores are really for naught.- He had a calling and his answer remains a unique monument in Western literature, to be treasured and pored over again and again by all of us logophiles and solitary scholars...And anyone else, by the way."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy: What It Is, With All the Kinds, Causes, Symptoms, Prognostics & Several Cures It; In Three Partitions with Their Several Sections, Members & Subsections Philosophically, Medicinally, HIstorically Opened & Cut Up","review":"Despite translating thousands of worthless Latin quotations, the editor of this edition leaves large passages from the section on Love Melancholy, which Burton waggishly wrote in Latin, untranslated. Burton demands enough of one's patience; one shouldn't have to put up with this sort of nonsense from his editor, even if one's Latin is good. After plodding through over a thousand pages, the reader has earned a little titillating trivia. Also, if you've forgotten your Latin, Burton's notes are left untranslated. Finally, I'll say that although Burton is amusing, the book is too long with too little content. Go back to his sources, read Swift, read Marcus Aurelius, read Kierkegaard on religious despair; and then, if you have time, read Burton-- or skim him."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy: What It Is, With All the Kinds, Causes, Symptoms, Prognostics & Several Cures It; In Three Partitions with Their Several Sections, Members & Subsections Philosophically, Medicinally, HIstorically Opened & Cut Up","review":"Like Montaigne's earthy Essays, but more witty and ironic like Erasmus, sharp and scathing like Senecca, funny and entertaining like Rabelais etc.The preface suggest that Burton (aka Elephantus Jr.) spent a long time in the Vatican library sourcing obscure and horded texts.

And even then they wade gently through a few pages rather than simply plunging in and learning, perhaps for the first time, that words are more intoxicating than any drug could be. There is no melancholy in the book, at least not to the extent that one might think because of the title. Instead the intrepid reader finds that Burton has attempted what we now know to be the impossible: to master the sum total of human knowledge in one book. Astoundingly, Burton did not know that it was impossible, so he went ahead and tried anyway. He came damn near close to succeeding.Robert Burton was typical of many contemporaries, many of whom tried to be a master of all trades, but it was only he that came close. Burton's love of learning and his dry and droll wit excuse his failure to such an extent that we do not even care that he failed. Rather, we focus on his successful attempt to draw us into the magical world of knowledge for its own sake. His critics have been merciless in their snippets that TAOM is no more than a collection of informal and disorganized essays on man's dissatisfaction with the universe. They complain loudly of his wild abandon of Latinate phrases that pepper every paragraph or his frequent mention of obscure authorities that exist nowhere else save this book. Yet, I suggest that wild abandon has its charm too. If one considers his book as a very nearly unlimited number of paragraphs, each of which exists in its own self-contained universe, then that paragraph sheds light on the human condition itself. Human beings have eternally sought knowledge of the macro universe and its mirror, the microverse. It is only in such seemingly unwieldy tomes as TAOM that humanity may find answers. The beauty of Burton is that the effort to find Eternal Truth is worth the effort. One need not be a grad student of literature to know that."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy: What It Is, With All the Kinds, Causes, Symptoms, Prognostics & Several Cures It; In Three Partitions with Their Several Sections, Members & Subsections Philosophically, Medicinally, HIstorically Opened & Cut Up","review":"There have been recently some reviews complaining of shoddy paperback editions of this book, published cheaply and with many dubious errors, lacking translation of the Latin, etc. (These problems are due largely to the publishers' use of outdated or uncorrected texts.)

I have been involved with many editions of this work over the years, and have a couple of things to add to what's been so eloquently said. First, it's a reference book and not a novel, and therefore shouldn't be read in a continuous way. It becomes tedious and incomprehensible. Like grandma used to say: \\"Take small bites so you don't choke!\\" There are parts of it that are dated but much that is totally applicable today. Second, it is a book about society, and the hypocrisy of the way different people get treated:\\"A sheep-stealer is hanged for stealing necessary victuals but a great man in office may safely rob, pillage, and destroy, and be honored for good service, and no man had best find fault with him.\\" This prefigures much of Enlightenment thinking and can be seen to relate to Culturalist Analytic thinking, like the works of Karen Horney. Third, it is a historical contemporary look at the Jacobean age, and even the Elizabethan world. If you're interested in the cultural climate of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, here is an overview of what was known and opined by a scholar. One wonders how melancholic he really was (in the modern sense) since the preparation and writing of such a compendium certainly requires motivation and energy, not generally associated with chronic depression. I would suggest the Preface and the Digression of Air as fascinating views of knowledge in the early 17th century. Even if you don't like it (which I didn't for about 5 years), it tends to grow on you as long as you go slow!"},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy: What It Is, With All the Kinds, Causes, Symptoms, Prognostics & Several Cures It; In Three Partitions with Their Several Sections, Members & Subsections Philosophically, Medicinally, HIstorically Opened & Cut Up","review":"The book deserves 5 stars, but not this electronic edition.

There is a deep psychological teaching that mixes itself with high spiritual principles, esoteric Christian Gnosticism in its raw form, and countless viels that keep such things hidden from the eyes of the average literary scholar... Why would Burton write in such a way? The same reason Dante did...But what is it that Burton is trying to show us, with his quotes from the Alchemical Master Galen and Latin stanzas?Why must we understand the \\"Anatomy of Meloncholy\\"? The anatomy of our own suffering and the suffering of the world...The Master M refers to Burton in his books of Occult Mysticism.For us, as common \\"modern westerners\\", to understand such esoteric psychology-and not have to learn Latin, Tibetan, Sanskrit or Chinese, we must study the books of SAMAEL AUN WEOR. He writes in such a way as to unveil those truly hidden mysteries: \\"Know thyself and thy shall Know the universe and all its Gods\\".Find the book of \\"Revolutionary Psychology\\" or \\"The Perfect Matrimony\\" by the said author. These books are amazing supplements to books like Burton's. These books give the western student a strong foundation in the psychological aspect of Occultism. SAMAEL AUN WEOR's books can be a bit difficult (to find), as they are continuously being translated from the original language (Spanish). Yet they can be bought from any Gnostic Institute (www.gnosticinstitute.org)."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy: What It Is, With All the Kinds, Causes, Symptoms, Prognostics & Several Cures It; In Three Partitions with Their Several Sections, Members & Subsections Philosophically, Medicinally, HIstorically Opened & Cut Up","review":"This book is almost unreadable.

Everything, I say! Talk about motormouth. He goes on and on long after anyone could possibly find him interesting. Oh, how this man needed an editor.Third, he is viciously anti-Catholic. Yes, I know it was (is?)the fashion in England for the best people to be anti-Catholic, but this guy can't be beat for vitriolic, venomous, bigotry.

Is it a book, a poem, a history, an epic? Well, I think it is all of those and many more. The Anatomy of Melancholy is, without a doubt, the best book ever written, bar none.It was compliled from all the books of the 17th century and is not really about melancholy, per se. It is, rather, Robert Burton's view of mankind and mankind's condition. All mankind. And all conditions. It is about melancholia, sure, but it is about everything else as well. Melancholia was just Burton's excuse to write about everything under the sun in a strikingly original way and then have the nerve to remind us that there is nothing new under the sun. This is a book filled with both endless quotes and endless quotable material and, to the surprise of many, it is a comic masterpiece. Perhaps &quot;the&quot; comic masterpiece. Burton chose to publish this book as having been written by &quot;Democritus Junior,&quot; and if that doesn't give you a hint regarding the humor that follows, then not much will.If you like good literature, you'll love this book. If you like psychology, you'll love this book. If you want to seem pretentious, you need this book. Mostly, however, this is a book for people who love words. Burton may have seemed like a raving madman to some, but he was a man obsessed with a love for the English language...and it shows.The Anatomy of Melancholy wasn't meant to be read from the first page to the last; I have never met anyone who did that and one would have to be more than a little mad to even try. Just pick up the book. Open it to any page. You may find lists, digressions, bits of 17th century prose, quotes, much Latin. Whatever you find, it is sure to please if you only give it half a chance.The Anatomy of Melancholy is definitely &quot;the&quot; desert island book. The only problem with taking this wonderful book to a desert island with you (or anywhere else, for that matter), is its size. If you have the one-volume edition, as I do, it can be terribly unwieldy. I once tried reading it on a trans-Atlantic flight and had difficulty keeping my grasp...physically. I highly recommend the three-volume set, if you can find it. If not, make do with the one-volume. Just don't go without. That would be a terrible mistake.Be warned: this dense and brilliant book is extremely addicting. Once you start leafing through the pages and writing down your favorite passages, you'll find you never want to be without the book. And, as you'll come to see, that won't be such a bad thing at all."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy: What It Is, With All the Kinds, Causes, Symptoms, Prognostics & Several Cures It; In Three Partitions with Their Several Sections, Members & Subsections Philosophically, Medicinally, HIstorically Opened & Cut Up","review":"Of all the editions of THE ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY that have ever been published, this may be the best for the general reader. The NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS CLASSIC edition wisely reprints the great 1932 Everyman's Library edition, with its wonderful introduction by the noted bookman Holbrook Jackson. (Readers are advised to skim or skip the rather pretentious new introduction by William H. Gass.)Unlike the &quot;all-English&quot; edition referenced..., the Everyman/NYRBClassic edition gives the Latin tags as Burton scattered them through his work and translates each and every one, either in brackets immediately afterward, or (sometimes) in an endnote to each of the three volumes (now bound as one). I've tried to read the &quot;all-English&quot; edition, and it's disappointing, because it turns out that Burton wanted readers to read the Latin tags whether they could understand them or not. He included their syllables in the rhythm of his prose, so as you read this edition, you can almost hear him quote, then translate, then continue onward.No booklover should skip this one, and this is the edition to have."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy: What It Is, With All the Kinds, Causes, Symptoms, Prognostics & Several Cures It; In Three Partitions with Their Several Sections, Members & Subsections Philosophically, Medicinally, HIstorically Opened & Cut Up","review":"Don't be misled by the title of this book, nor by what others may have told you about it. In the first place, it isn't so much a book about 'Melancholy' (or abnormal psychology, or depression, or whatever) as a book about Burton himself and, ultimately, about humankind. Secondly, it isn't so much a book for students of the history of English prose, as one for lovers of language who joy in the strong taste of English when it was at its most masculine and vigorous. Finally, it isn't so much a book for those interested in the renaissance, as for those interested in life.Burton is not a writer for fops and milquetoasts. He was a crusty old devil who used to go down to the river to listen to the bargemen cursing so that he could keep in touch with the true tongue of his race. Sometimes I think he might have been better off as the swashbuckling Captain of a pirate ship. But somehow he ended up as a scholar, and instead of watching the ocean satisfyingly swallowing up his victims, he himself became an ocean of learning swallowing up whole libraries. His book, in consequence, although it may have begun as a mere 'medical treatise,' soon exploded beyond its bounds to become, in the words of one of his editors, &quot;a grand literary entertainment, as well as a rich mine of miscellaneous learning.&quot;Of his own book he has this to say : &quot;... a rhapsody of rags gathered together from several dung-hills, excrements of authors, toys and fopperies confusedly tumbled out, without art, invention, judgement, wit, learning, harsh, raw, rude, phantastical, absurd, insolent, indiscreet, ill-composed, indigested, vain, scurrile, idle, dull, and dry; I confess all...&quot; But don't believe him, he's in one of his irascible moods and exaggerating. In fact it's a marvelous book.Here's a bit more of the crusty Burton I love; it's on his fellow scholars : &quot;Heretofore learning was graced by judicious scholars, but now noble sciences are vilified by base and illiterate scribblers.&quot;And here is Burton warming to the subject of contemporary theologians : &quot;Theologasters, if they can but pay ... proceed to the very highest degrees. Hence it comes that such a pack of vile buffoons, ignoramuses wandering in the twilight of learning, ghosts of clergymen, itinerant quacks, dolts, clods, asses, mere cattle, intrude with unwashed feet upon the sacred precincts of Theology, bringing with them nothing save brazen impudence, and some hackneyed quillets and scholastic trifles not good enough for a crowd at a street corner.&quot;Finally a passage I can't resist quoting which shows something of Burton's prose at its best, though I leave you to guess the subject: &quot;... with this tempest of contention the serenity of charity is overclouded, and there be too many spirits conjured up already in this kind in all sciences, and more than we can tell how to lay, which do so furiously rage, and keep such a racket, that as Fabius said, &quot;It had been much better for some of them to have been born dumb, and altogether illiterate, than so far to dote to their own destruction.&quot;To fully appreciate these quotations you would have to see them in context, and I'm conscious of having touched on only one of his many moods and aspects. But a taste for Burton isn't difficult to acquire. He's a mine of curious learning. When in full stride he can be very funny, and it's easy to share his feelings as he often seems to be describing, not so much his own world as today's.But he does demand stamina. His prose overwhelms and washes over us like a huge tsunami, and for that reason he's probably best taken in small doses. If you are unfamiliar with his work and were to approach him with that in mind, you might find that (as is the case with Montaigne, a very different writer) you had discovered not so much a book as a companion for life."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy: What It Is, With All the Kinds, Causes, Symptoms, Prognostics & Several Cures It; In Three Partitions with Their Several Sections, Members & Subsections Philosophically, Medicinally, HIstorically Opened & Cut Up","review":"The Anatomy of Melancholy may be a worthwhile read.

NYRB has reprinted the three volume Everyman's Library edition in a rather thick paperback. This is not the first time the three volume Everyman's Library edition has been reprinted in one volume. Everyman's Library had a one volume edition in the 1960's and Vintage had an edition in the 1970's, but these have been out of print for many years. Except for some minor changes such as a new introduction by William H. Gass, and the removal of the out-of-date select bibliography the NYRB edition is identical to the earlier reprints.There are disadvantages to this reprint. Perhaps the biggest is that this reprint does not take advantage or even acknowledge the 70 or so years of scholarship that has come and gone since it was published in 1932. In the 1990's Oxford University Press issued a multi-volume scholarly edition of the Anatomy but the price is prohibative for most readers. You should know that NYRB edition is still good as a reader's copy, but it is not a scholarly edition.Another problem is the editorial decision that Holbrook Jackson made to clear away Burton's anotations that were originally printed on the page, and moved them to the end of each partition. Instead of looking on the page for Burton's citations the reader is flipping back and forth to track them down. Burton sometimes has a great deal of fun in his marginal glosses, and you will miss them if you are not careful.A third problem is the index. If you wanted to find Burton's references to English writers such as More, Shakespeare, or Spenser you would be out of luck if you used the index in the NYRB edition, but you wouldn't be if you were reading Shilletto's 1893 edition. In that edition authors Burton quotes are listed and you have no trouble tracking most of them in Burton's Anatomy.These days I am more likely to read one of the 17th century editions of Burton's Anatomy or Shilletto's edition, but it is good to have Burton available again in a popular edition, even though this one is not ideal."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy: What It Is, With All the Kinds, Causes, Symptoms, Prognostics & Several Cures It; In Three Partitions with Their Several Sections, Members & Subsections Philosophically, Medicinally, HIstorically Opened & Cut Up","review":"Usually available only in expensive private editions and nineteenth century complilations, the New York Review Books paperback edition of Robert Burton's \\"The Anatomy of Melancholy\\" is handy and relatively cheap. It reprints the sixth and final edition that Burton issued, each edition expanding with afterthoughts by the author. The original in 1621 was one-half the size of the last edition.Burton was an Oxford scholar who had spent much of his life in Christ Church College of that institution accumulating quotes, ideas, and general collectible wisdom from the classics. His self-styled anatomy of the causes of melancholy is both ponderous and witty--quite in tune with Burton's styling himself as \\"Democritus Junior.\\" Democritus, you will recall, was a Greek philosopher of the 5th century BC who developed the idea of atoms forming the basis of the universe. He was also sometimes called the \\"laughing philosopher\\" because of his wit.Burton himself has a good time with this kind of humor, and his book is not at all a gloomy analysis of melancholy. What it is is a compendium of every kind of thought on the subject, and is replete with Latin quotations and Greek philosophy. It is a museum of myth, ignorance, and insight. Written in a uniquely antiquarian style, it is a treat for the modern reader. Like Sir Thomas Browne's gothic prose, Burton's is unique as well as intriguing. His book is meant to be dipped into, not to be read straight through. The wonderful thing is that it's not just a classic but a readable classic. It is, yes, antiquarian, but happily antiquarian.I loved it."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy: What It Is, With All the Kinds, Causes, Symptoms, Prognostics & Several Cures It; In Three Partitions with Their Several Sections, Members & Subsections Philosophically, Medicinally, HIstorically Opened & Cut Up","review":"Don't be misled by the title of this book, nor by what others may have told you about it. In the first place, it isn't so much a book about 'Melancholy' (or abnormal psychology, or depression, or whatever) as a book about Burton himself and, ultimately, about humankind. Secondly, it isn't so much a book for students of the history of English prose, as one for lovers of language who joy in the strong taste of English when it was at its most masculine and vigorous. Finally, it isn't so much a book for those interested in the renaissance, as for those interested in life.Burton is not a writer for fops and milquetoasts. He was a crusty old devil who used to go down to the river to listen to the bargemen cursing so that he could keep in touch with the true tongue of his race. Sometimes I think he might have been better off as the swashbuckling Captain of a pirate ship. But somehow he ended up as a scholar, and instead of watching the ocean satisfyingly swallowing up his victims, he himself became an ocean of learning swallowing up whole libraries. His book, in consequence, although it may have begun as a mere 'medical treatise,' soon exploded beyond its bounds to become, in the words of one of his editors, &quot;a grand literary entertainment, as well as a rich mine of miscellaneous learning.&quot;Of his own book he has this to say : &quot;... a rhapsody of rags gathered together from several dung-hills, excrements of authors, toys and fopperies confusedly tumbled out, without art, invention, judgement, wit, learning, harsh, raw, rude, phantastical, absurd, insolent, indiscreet, ill-composed, indigested, vain, scurrile, idle, dull, and dry; I confess all...&quot; But don't believe him, he's in one of his irascible moods and exaggerating. In fact it's a marvelous book.Here's a bit more of the crusty Burton I love; it's on his fellow scholars : &quot;Heretofore learning was graced by judicious scholars, but now noble sciences are vilified by base and illiterate scribblers.&quot;And here is Burton warming to the subject of contemporary theologians : &quot;Theologasters, if they can but pay ... proceed to the very highest degrees. Hence it comes that such a pack of vile buffoons, ignoramuses wandering in the twilight of learning, ghosts of clergymen, itinerant quacks, dolts, clods, asses, mere cattle, intrude with unwashed feet upon the sacred precincts of Theology, bringing with them nothing save brazen impudence, and some hackneyed quillets and scholastic trifles not good enough for a crowd at a street corner.&quot;Finally a passage I can't resist quoting which shows something of Burton's prose at its best, though I leave you to guess the subject: &quot;... with this tempest of contention the serenity of charity is overclouded, and there be too many spirits conjured up already in this kind in all sciences, and more than we can tell how to lay, which do so furiously rage, and keep such a racket, that as Fabius said, &quot;It had been much better for some of them to have been born dumb, and altogether illiterate, than so far to dote to their own destruction.&quot;To fully appreciate these quotations you would have to see them in context, and I'm conscious of having touched on only one of his many moods and aspects. But a taste for Burton isn't difficult to acquire. He's a mine of curious learning. When in full stride he can be very funny, and it's easy to share his feelings as he often seems to be describing, not so much his own world as today's.But he does demand stamina. His prose overwhelms and washes over us like a huge tsunami, and for that reason he's probably best taken in small doses. If you are unfamiliar with his work and were to approach him with that in mind, you might find that (as is the case with Montaigne, a very different writer) you had discovered not so much a book as a companion for life."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy: What It Is, With All the Kinds, Causes, Symptoms, Prognostics & Several Cures It; In Three Partitions with Their Several Sections, Members & Subsections Philosophically, Medicinally, HIstorically Opened & Cut Up","review":"I am enjoying this book immensely and don't have much to add to what others are saying, but it should be pointed out for those familiar with the massive length of the original that this is NOT an abridgement -- the Product Details are incorrect.

A plausible translation of the title into modern terms would be &quot;A Study of Abnormal Psychology.&quot; The application of Scholastic methods to this topic --- so similar, and yet so different, from contemporary academic discourse --- creates a curious impression. He invokes astrology and theology in forming his psychology.But in fact, Burton uses this arcane subject to go off on a profound and lengthy meditation on the melancholies and misfortunes of life itself. The author, it seems, was easily distracted, and his distractions are our gain. The passages on the Melancholy of Scholars, and the Melancholy of Lovers, are themselves worthy of the price of admission.His prose is unlike anything before him or since him. It has some kinship to the paradoxical and simile-laden style of the Euphuists, but his individual sentences are often pithy and brief.This seventeenth-century classic ought to be read by anyone interested in the period, in early psychology, or in the history of English prose."},{"Title":"The System: An Insider's Life in Soviet Politics","review":"As the subtitle of Georgi Arbatov's memoir states, he was an insider of the Soviet political system from the Khrushchev through Gorbachev eras. Arbatov believes this is perhaps the most important period in Soviet history and dubs the years following the death of Joseph Stalin through the 1980's as a period leading up to the Second Russian Revolution. Arbatov tells us a gap exists in the present scholarship and that historians need to concentrate on this important chapter in Soviet history. Written with a great deal of hindsight and sprinkled with digressions and personal regrets, this work nonetheless offers the insightful recollections of a top political advisor to the pinnacle of Soviet leadership. Born in 1923, Arbatov's mother came from a peasant background, while his father, a Civil War veteran, worked in a factory in Odessa. During the purges of the 1930's, Arbatov's father was jailed for a period, but later released due to lack of concrete evidence that he was an enemy of the people. This incident began what Arbatov believed was a passive disillusionment with the Stalin regime that his father silently harbored. Arbatov regrets not fully communicating to his father about his disenchantment before he died in 1954. At eighteen years of age, Arbatov enrolled at the First Moscow Artillery College one day before the Nazi invasion of 21 June 1941. As a result, the usual two-year tenure period was reduced to a six-month crash course. As a young captain, Arbatov commanded a Katyusha rocket battery before being invalided out with a severe case of tuberculosis. Both his father and he had participated in the two climatic events in Soviet history (the Bolshevik Revolution and the Great Patriotic War) that would leave an indelible legacy upon the collective memory of Soviet society and, most importantly, according to Arbatov, hinder the willingness for that society to enter into the \\"recovery from Stalinism\\" (p. 4). After the war Arbatov became a student at Moscow University where he specialized in foreign political affairs. Arbatov and his fellow students were required to read \\"selected\\" works of Marx/Engels and Lenin, but academic policy stipulated that Stalin be quoted two-to-three times more than Lenin and five-to-six times more than Marx/Engels. Arbatov's first job upon graduation was translating significant American, British, and German political, economic, and philosophical literature. It was in this capacity that Arbatov became exposed to the more liberal aspects of social democratic ideology. Arbatov admits, however, that he never fell into the category of dissident or western democratic want-to-be. After Stalin's death, Arbatov worked on the staff of the academic journal \\"Problems of philosophy.\\" This was the beginning of what Arbatov calls oasis of open thinking in the desert of totalitarian dogmatism. Arbatov's most influential work came as a result of his founding the Institute for the Study of USA and Canada in 1968. It was within this \\"oasis\\" that Arbatov would \\"Discover America\\" and gain essential influence to expunge jail sentences for dissident intellectuals. Arbatov believes the Stalin years was the darkest chapter in Soviet history. He writes: \\"Stalinism (more precisely, Stalin's cult of personality) had embedded itself in our society over a long period and by the most radical means.\\" . . . \\"[A] great many people in the leadership adhered to the old Stalinist views, and it would have been difficult, if not impossible, for them to find a place in any other social or political structure; they were simply incapable of doing anything other than carrying out the will from above\\" (p. 137). Arbatov reminds his audience that the specter of Stalinism was in power for thirty-five years and it would take that long for the negative influences to wear off. Arbatov believes the seeds of reform were planted well before Khrushchev's secret speech denouncing Stalin, even while the dictator was still alive. Arbatov praises Khrushchev's courage but believes his motive were purely political, not only to denounce Stalin, but also the conservative hard-liners that were attempting to reinstate themselves into the system and oust him. Arbatov advised and had close relations with the succeeding Russian presidents as well. Arbatov admired Brezhnev in the beginning, however, the effects of old age, failing health, and an addiction to sleeping pills, forced him to bow to the hardliners within the party. Arbatov is against all of the Soviet Union's armed interventions in the Eastern bloc countries and especially Angola. Arbatov personally liked Andropov and praises him for raising Gorbachev out of relative obscurity. Arbatov points out that the two men did not always see eye-to-eye, and mentions some character flaws Andropov possessed, such as indecisiveness. Arbatov attributes these faults, not only in Andropov, but also in other key figures to the trauma that had been embedded in them as a result of working under the Stalin regime. Arbatov recalls this sense of foreboding, regarding the possibility of another totalitarian dictator like Stalin coming to power, permeated many of those, including himself that had worked so hard to pave the way for better relations with the west and internal reform. This fear would surface again in 1992-93 with Arbatov's disagreements over policies within the Yeltsin presidency. Arbatov admits that writing his memoirs while so many of the turbulent events were still taking place was difficult. Still, the mixture of hindsight and personal regrets are obvious. His remembrances are not overly self-serving, yet he shifts back and forth from participant to outside observer. The digressions within the chronological framework are a mild distraction, while some of the chapters are completely out of sequential order. The devastating affects of Stalinism and the dread of the Soviet Union returning to just such a totalitarian \\"system\\" are two of the prominent themes throughout the book. I recommend the work, however it should be read with care."},{"Title":"The System: An Insider's Life in Soviet Politics","review":"A peculiar book from one standpont, a serious lack of modesty in the author. There are many photos in the book, and EVERY SINGLE ONE is there to show Arbatov in the company of one or another famous personage. The captions each call attention to Arbatov and only incidentally mention the world leaders who are in some of the photos."},{"Title":"Foxfire 10","review":"The Foxfire books are a wonderful thing and we are so lucky to have them. Many of the ways, crafts, planting lore, animal lore, and as the book says \\"affairs of plain living\\" are preserved here. This particular volume includes oral histories of the Great Depression, CCC Camps and their impact on the local areaa and ecomomy, folk art, chair makeing, and of special interest to me, gourd art. This is a wonderful recording of life the way it was and probably never will be again. The book is quite well written and has faithfully recorded even the dialect of these wonderful people, from which so many of us sprung. That is a big part of the charm of these works. This book includes actual interviews with folks from that region of the country which I am sure are long dead now. Their knowledge would be completely lost without works such as this. Another generation or two and it will all be completely gone. This book will cetainly be of great interest to those, like me, who are interested in the depression era and in the CCC in particular. Thank goodness we have recordings such as this. Recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"Foxfire 10","review":"As most readers already know, the Foxfire book series is a true treasure. Book 10 is no exception but it must be noted that as the series progress from book 1 through 12 the content does move from specific 'hands on how to' toward more of an historical review of the people of the Appalachia. There are some sections in Foxfire 10 that are dedicated to details of craft (most notably that of Chairmaking) but the majority of the content is about individuals and their colorful lives.This does not detract from the importance of the book however. The craft-heavy content of the earlier books in the series are priceless but only because of the people who pass it on through the text. Many of the wise people of the Appalachia are covered in this book and it makes the series more well rounded. Most notable for me was the chapter on \\"Hard Times\\" as told by those Americans who lived through them. It will either make you appreciate what you have or it will urge you to prepare for similar times...perhaps both.If you are considering collecting all of the Foxfire series book 10 will be no disappointment. I only held off on five stars as the first half of the series gets that accolade due to more practical content."},{"Title":"Foxfire 10","review":"It's a great deal of fun to read about the historical needs and solutions of the Appalachian people that applies as well to my own history.

Lee bounced from the present to his past in a single line that sometimes sent me backtracking and rereading to catch the wit of his metaphors, but I found that delightful as the writing was not the &quot;same old thing.&quot; It all seemed pretty horrible and his characters were definitely bigger than life with steroids. Jackson Kan found his buddy and I still had a 100 pages to go as his &quot;mission&quot; kept expanding.

Following Jackson's adventures through the Seoul to Tongduchon corrider was a thrilling experience - also brought back a lot of memories. The chilling filth and terrible conditions in the Korean prison was, no doubt, accurately described.....even nightmarish.

Catherine goes to Balvenie where she married her host John Stewart (see THE DREAMER). Laura travels to St. Duthac where she weds her protector William Ross (see THE ENCHANTRESS). The wildest one Adrianne drives the Abbess of Barra in the Western Isles crazy with her defiance.Eventually, Wyntoun MacLean, master of the Isle, arrives and takes Adrianne away with him when he leaves. His seemingly altruistic motive disguises his effort to obtain the Treasure of Tiberius for the Knights of the Veil. At his father's castle, Adrianne and Wyntoun agree to marry in order to rescue her mother, now held hostage, and to attain the treasure without jeopardizing her now married and pregnant siblings. As they work together, Wyntoun and Adrianne fall in love, but any meaningful relationship remains in jeopardy from a traitor and the individual who abducted her mother.THE FIREBRAND, the conclusion to the Perry siblings Highland trilogy, is an exiting, well-written historical romance filled with suspense and intrigue. The story line is fun as the lead charcaters struggle with an unknown enemy and their growing love for one another.

He's 23 months old and still really enjoys this book."},{"Title":"The Wheels on the Bus (Classic Books With Holes)","review":"at first, i was a little disappointed that the words were different from the song that i know. it goes \\"all day long\\" instead of \\"all around the town.\\" but i am used to it now, and the illustrations are so cute and the author obviously put a lot of thought and effort into making her drawings detailed. i notice something new with each read. my 11 month old daughter gets very excited when we read this book. she sticks her little fingers through the cut outs and points at the pictures. i will probably get this as a gift for another child."},{"Title":"The Wheels on the Bus (Classic Books With Holes)","review":"My daughter abolutely loves this book. She is almost 3 and she still wants to go to sleep with this book. also anytime during the day if she is getting grumpy we just pull out a couple books to read and this one is always first because she can do the motions along with reading.Great book!"},{"Title":"The Wheels on the Bus (Classic Books With Holes)","review":"I bought this for my 18 month old and he LOVES it. He loves the bright colors and characters and they keep him entertained."},{"Title":"The Wheels on the Bus (Classic Books With Holes)","review":"The words in this version of the book are slightly different than what we usually sing but my daughter loves it anyway. For example, we sing \\"all through the town\\" and this book says \\"all day long\\" and our driver says \\"move on back\\" while the book's driver says \\"tickets please\\". Not a problem, it's just different. The pictures are hilarious and the holes are awesome! They integrate into each page so well. Plus my daughter gets a kick out of the last page where everyone on the bus goes to a party. Definitely a great purchase!"},{"Title":"The Wheels on the Bus (Classic Books With Holes)","review":"My 18 month daughter never tires of this one - she'll dig it out from amongst all the others on the shelf. There's a lot going on in each page for her to point out, with the continuity of the bus and the people that gradually fill it. It turns out the bus is going to a birthday party, and in the final page you can look for all the characters at the party, and try and spot the birthday girl. I'm looking for more books from this illustrator, because this one has been such a hit."},{"Title":"The Wheels on the Bus (Classic Books With Holes)","review":"I was first introduced to this book after checking it out from my local library. It immediately became a favorite book for my then 15 month old son, so much so that I reached my renewal limit with it and had to regretfully return it to the library. With Christmas coming up, I knew what would be going under the tree for my son. The look on his face when he unwrapped it was priceless. It was like he was seeing an old friend. We read, well actually sing, this book at least a few times every day. My son loves the singing, and I love that there is so much to be seen and discussed on each page. This book has bright, vibrant colors, is very sturdy (though heavy for a little one), and is endlessly entertaining. I highly recommend this book for anyone with young children, i.e. grandparents, parents, daycare, doctor's offices, etc. It is truly a classic!"},{"Title":"The Wheels on the Bus (Classic Books With Holes)","review":"a toddler favorite. sing/modify the \\"classic\\" song with the words from this book and you have a sure fire hit.

There is a lot for both the parent and the child to look at while singing the song."},{"Title":"Dynamical analogies,","review":"Harry Ferdinand Olson was a famous engineer and made many contributions of great value in his day, and his book on Dynamical Analogies had a high reputation. However, he makes considerable use of the Heaviside Operational Calculus in this book. And I must point out that today, the Heaviside Calculus is no longer used by anybody, because Fourier methods have completely displaced it. For this reason, anyone who received an engineering education after 1950 will find the book, at least in part, very tough going. This is because modern Fourier theory displaced the Heaviside calculus almost overnight in the 1930's, so Heavisides's methods disappeared from all the textbooks after World War II.Please also note that the Heaviside method depends on books of conversions that work like a table of integrals, but they are sufficiently different to confuse almost everyone today. If you want to verify my opinions on this subject, you can look up Olson's book on the Internet and read it for free because the copyright expired in the 1970's. I have infinite respect for anyone who knows how to use the Heaviside Calculus, but for me, life is too short to spend a lot of energy on something like that."},{"Title":"Dynamical analogies,","review":"Dynamical Analogies es un libro espectacular. Muestra las analog&iacute;as din&aacute;micas de una manera did&aacute;ctica y totalmente comprensible, adem&aacute;s contiene algunos ejemplos de aplicaci&oacute;n que ayudan a esclarecer ciertas dudas que se puedan llegar a crear durante la lectura del texto.Simplemente excelente!!!!!"},{"Title":"Dynamical analogies,","review":"This book was presented to me by one of our professors when I was in graduate school. I used it one time when I was in school as a reference for calculating the effects of incorporating quarter wave resonators in duct silencers. Later I never opened it till last month when I was searching for a \\"clean\\" model & solution for a coupled electro vibro-acoustic problem. I feel this book has all the basic building blocks to understand many of the interdisciplinary problems (linear oscillatory/frequency domain/lumped systems) in electrical engineering and Mechanical engineering. I think I am going to come back to this book frequently for general understanding of oscillatory systems from lumped element approach."},{"Title":"The Keeping Days","review":"I read this book when I was in middle school and then gave it (and it's sequel, \\"Glory in the Flower\\") to my own daughter when she turned 12. Now I am ordering it for my niece on the occassion of her 12th birthday.This is the story of a family in Yonkers, New York, at the turn of the last century. Althought circumstances have changed a great deal in the past hundred years, human nature, needs and nuances have not and the author beautifully captures the hopes and fears of young women on the verge of their lives as she describes the daily comings and goings of Tish, her sisters and brothers. I actually named my first child after one of the characters in this story (the other got her name from \\"And Ladies of the Club,\\" but that is the topic for another review!)If you are looking for thoughtful, thought provoking, realistic quality piece of literature, look no further."},{"Title":"The Keeping Days","review":"The Keeping Days series is FANTASTIC!!! I had the entire six book series when I was a teenager in the early eighties. I wish I had never lost them because it has been very difficult re-aquiring them, as the last four are out of print. I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS SO! I wanted my teenaged daughters to read them so I have been slowly hunting them down and buying them. This series takes place in turn of the twentieth century New York City (the Bronx). The themes are relevant for today's youth (adults, as well). I am rereading them along with my daughters, and I have found the books to be as captivating now as they were all those years ago. My daughters ABSOLUTELY LOVE them! They've read all of the books now except for the last one which I am presently tracking down. I look forward to reading these books again and again as the years go by! This series would also make a great television show or movie!!!"},{"Title":"The Keeping Days","review":"Handles coming of age more realistically than Little Women, and much more intelligently than the modern teenage series. I don't know how Johnston remembered what it's like when everyone else forgets, but The Keeping Days, its sequel Glory in the Flower, and also the Johnston's Bridget Vandever books spoke directly to me when I was about 12 or 13. It's comforting when *someone* else in the world goes through the same things, even if she is fictional."},{"Title":"The Keeping Days","review":"The entire series is wonderful, and its a crime that they are out of print. &quot;Keeping Days&quot; and &quot;Flower&quot; are on a lot of school reading lists, and rightfully so. Ranks right up there with the &quot;Little House&quot; series-Tish Sterling is a wonderful heroine!"},{"Title":"The Keeping Days","review":"This is a long series, most of which Amazon doesn't offer, but if you're lucky enough to read it, you will not be the same. No cheesiness, nothing typical, it is the quintissential growing-up story of one amazing woman. The tales she tells of family, love, and writing will stay with you forever. BTW, the second book in the series is &quot;Glory in the Flower.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Keeping Days","review":"Like other reviewers here, I first discovered The Keeping Days (and other Norma Johnston novels) in my mid teens and they helped me make sense of everything that was confusing and scary during this most challenging period of adolescence. I loved Tish, the main character. I was Tish (with some minor and major distinctions) and for any girl who someday wanted to be a writer (or even who already was) she inspired me to embrace being different. When, after college I went to New York to be a writer, Norma Johnston led a workshop on writing teen novels at Rutgers and I attended. On the one hand, it was an unsettling experience, as I didn't really want to know Tish wasn't actually a real person, just the product of a fabulous storytelling imagination. On the other hand, Norma was really inspirational. I've read elsewhere that Anna Quindlen re-reads Maud Hart Lovelaced's Betsy Tacy series every year. I just bet that she has not yet discovered The Keeping Days. For me it is a once a year re-read."},{"Title":"The Keeping Days","review":"I had no idea this book was part of a series until reading these reviews. So thank you to all that mentioned this, since now I will try to track down the rest of them!I was happily surprised that the Sterling family was not your typical-cheesy-everything-is-perfect kind of family. It shows how family dynamics can really be--sometimes yelling, spitefulness, and being unappreciative of one another.This book is one of those books you can enjoy reading and rereading and you will discover something new and thought provoking every time."},{"Title":"The Keeping Days","review":"I enjoyed The Wider Heart by Norma Johnstone so much that I hunted down moire of her books. This is the first one that tells of Tish Sterling of Yonkers, New York, around the turn of the century. I don't know why Johnstone wanted to go back so far in time for part of the reason The Wider Heart is so good is that she engages the reader very much in the present (well, what was then the present for she wrote it in 1962) but perhaps she had some idea that Hello, Dolly (also set in Yonkers in 1900) had been a big hit, why not try her own hand at a romance set in Yonkers, but I will say that this is no Hello, Dolly!It is not for kids at all if you ask me, for it is a grim, depressing family story rather like A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, dominated by an incredibly sour, dour Ma who starts her sentences midway, biting off the subject like a boxer biting off the tip of a cigar. \\"Always were a spoiled little tart, Tish! Can't see the sense is educatin' girls! Shouldn't be surprised if I woke up dead from your antics.\\"She is possibly the ugliest human being in the history of YA lit, and yet Tish still manages to find compassion for her, even if she never grows to love her. And Pa in some ways is even stranger. Professionally, he is a courtroom stenographer, and much of the suspense of The Keeping Days is to find out if Pa is \\"keeping\\" his job or not, due to a new political administration that might toss him out, bring in an inferior man. \\"Told Pa it was all wrong, the political system in the USA!\\"Tish has several brothers and sisters when the book begins, and by the end, well, that would be spoiler territory. Johnstone can create beautiful setpieces--Tish's party, the dance in Gramps' farm town way out in Pennsylvania--and others--but all in all I grew weary of her importation of 1970s realism into the sweet old age of Queen Victoria."},{"Title":"The Keeping Days","review":"I never enjoyed reading as a child, but found this book to be so engaging and heart felt. I couldn't wait for each of the books in the series to come out. If you can get a hold of them I would highly recommend it! I always felt these books would make a wonderful television series (if they kept with the integrity of the books)."},{"Title":"The Keeping Days","review":"This novel, and its sequel, Glory in the Flower, spoke deeply to me when I was 14 (a scant 6 years ago), and are still worth reading. It is compelling without melodrama and familial without schmaltz. Buy this for any bat mitzvah, confirmation, or junior high graduation. Better than Little Women, even."},{"Title":"The War Above the Trees","review":"This is an excellent book about the battle for the Plei Trap Valley in Vietnam (Operation Wayne Grey) in March and April of 1969. I was with the 1st Brigade headquarters for much of March, then took over as commander of Delta Company, 3rd Battalion, 12th Infantry on LZ D-Handle for the last two to three weeks of the operation. Mr. Carey has captured not only the chronology and tactics of the battle, but also the personal side of the fighting in this most inhospitable location. It was a place of thick jungle and steep mountains. The NVA considered the valley their territory, had it well fortified and fought hard to keep it. Mr. Carey and all the other helicopter crewmen were our life line. Without their heroic daily flights the infantry, artillery and engineers fighting in the Plei Trap Valley could not have inflicted heavy casualities on the NVA, thus stopping a serious threat to the Allied control of the Central Highlands. This is a great story of ordinary people doing extraordinary deeds."},{"Title":"The War Above the Trees","review":"I was one of the chapters in this book, I can say without doubt that everything in the book is true.
