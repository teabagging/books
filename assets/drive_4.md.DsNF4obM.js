I prefer Donaldson for two important reasons: the transparency of the translation and the translator's humble willingness to let stand archaic implications that may seem absurb or offensive to most people today.On a technical level, Donaldson--much more consistently than Heaney--reproduces Old English compounded words and phrases with Modern equivalents. He does this with accuracy and freshness--if not with seamless grace as some readers would prefer. The great advantage of Donaldson's approach is that the reader who does not read OE can at least imagine that she can second-guess the translator, and can feel the raw, rugged texture of the original. Even my 12th grade (inner city high school) students who have bought Heaney's version have become irate at a number of crucial points where the complexity preserved by Donaldson has been eliminated by Heaney.A second point--or a second way of looking at the same point--concerns interpretation. With all due respect to Heaney, he has an agenda related to the future of the European Union, and I suspect that this motivated or influenced his approach to the translation of Beowulf. Heaney is presenting, via the seminal text of Beowulf, a vision of the origins of European politcs that he believes will ultimately lay a foundation for its future viability and humanity.Heaney's version is this a much more creative endeavor than was Donaldson's. Where Donaldson allows seeming incoherencies to emerge for the modern reader, Heaney makes things make sense. The main difference here lies in the treatment of the hero. For Heaney, Beowulf is an unambiguous ideal figure. Donaldson, on the other hand, preserves the original ambiguity of a hero who is physically similar to the monsters he fights in his superiority to ordinary men.Yes, Jacques, there's no translation without interpretation, but there's also a question of degree of control to consider. Heaney's translation falls in line with the unfortunate tradition of Raffel, whose Procrustean approach privileged modern sensibility above everything else. Heaney is much better than Raffel, but Donaldson is one of those rare translations that has and will continue to stand the test of time becaus he didn't try too hard to be a person of his time."},{"Title":"Beowulf: A Prose Translation, Second Edition (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"I am one of those people who, out of pride perhaps, force themselves to read classic old stuff even when it gives me headaches. I was braced for such an experience when I began to read Beowulf. I remembered being completely disinterested when I had to read an excerpt of it in high school.But I was pleasantly surprised. In the first place, Beowulf is short; I was able to read it in an afternoon.Secondly, the translation is very readable and entertaining. A few times I had to read a sentence twice to understand it, but that happens. The translator was definitely a craftsman of the English language.Third, the story is entertaining. It's fun to read. This might not be true of all classic literature! It's an adventure story, and a pleasing one. One reason it was fun to read is that you can feel the pleasures of the heroic values that the poet and his audience shared; in this respect it's similar to what you might experience in \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" In fact, the story often reminded me of Tolkien--I confidently guaratee that Tolkien fans will enjoy it. (Tolkien also wrote one of the essays included in this edition.)Fourth, it is interesting to read the oldest \\"English\\" story (of course our language has evolved so much that we now need a translator). The historical interest is much aided by the essays in the Norton Critical edition, including very helpful maps of England and ancient Scandinavia. One interesting aspect of Beowulf is the tension between pre-Christian values and Christian ones within the story as we know it. Again, the essays were interesting and enlightening about this as well.All in all, this is classic literature at its best: readable, highly entertaining, and educational (and short). The essays and maps really were helpful; you won't need to buy the Cliffs Notes to understand or appreciate the text. If you want to read classic literature, I strongly recommend Beowulf; if you want to read Beowulf, I strongly recommend this edition."},{"Title":"Beowulf: A Prose Translation, Second Edition (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"Of the translations that I have read this is the most true to the original words.

I would recommend it if your professor wants you to read Beowulf."},{"Title":"Beowulf: A Prose Translation, Second Edition (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"A very useful book on a cult poem in English literature, maybe the founding poem of English literature. The translation of the Anglosaxon text is altogether good because nearly word for word. Yet it contains some imperfections, or some untranslatable - and improperly rendered - elements. For example the text contains at least thirteen words to speak of the sword, without counting developed metaphors or descriptions. It is of course impossible to translate such lexical richness. But it is a sign of this iron-age civilization bent to fighting with this sword, among other equipment. It shows the great symbolical value of the sword in this culture before the arrival of christianity, and it will survive after the conversion of these peoples to this new religion. This text also represents the christianizing of the old mythology or religion of scandinavion, germanic and probably celtic peoples. Hence the All Father (Odin) of this culture, becomes in the text Father all-ruling (section 4), All-ruler (section 19), Ruler of Men (section 24), Ruler of Glory (section 25), wise Lord (section 26), the Ruler ... everlasting Lord (section 33), and then a standard God several times. This chritianizing of an old religion is an essential aim of this poetry and it is done with great care. For example again, the twelve children that pay homage to Beowulf after his being cremated, are a reference to the twelve apostles, the twelve doors of the messianic Jerusalem, the twelve layers of gems in the wall of the messianic Jerusalem, all references to the Bible. But twelve is also the runic letter Eoh or Eihwaz, representing the yew tree, a symbol of death in many ways, and even of the Ragnarok , the end of the world, the great hunt and war among all living beings, men and gods alike, that will bring the world down, and maybe its regeneration afterwards. Here the christian context moves this regeneration towards that of the soul after death and eventually after the second coming, Doomsday. If we study this poem from this symbolical point of view, with all the cross-references we can imagine and find, we have a masterpiece that spans centuries of old culture and religion and opens up on centuries of a new culture and religion. It is the passageway between two spiritual worlds. It would be very interesting to compare the dragon of the Book of Revelations and the dragon that finally kills Beowulf though he is also killed by Beowulf simultaneously. We have to remember that Shakespeare was extremely learned about these cultural facts and that the three Weird Sisters in Macbeth are his modern version of the three Norns, Urd, Vervandi and Skuld, who govern our lives and our fate. And what's more weird comes from the word wyrd that means fate in Beowulf, that is fate in Odin's mythology, that is the twenty-fifth rune, and the vision of Beowulf's fate in this poem is very scandinavian, germanic : you do not fight against fate, you assume your fate and stand up to it, even if it means your death. A man in this culture is standing up in front of fate not to oppose it but to live or die upright and assuming anything that may come. No submission to death. No submission in life. One must live and die on one's feet, facing the future, one's weapons in one's hands, believing that one will be something beyond any challenge if one can say : I was walking tall in the face of life and death . This poem is a lesson of courage and stamina, as well as of our limits in front of the personal, social, natural, historical or cosmic perspectives we have to face. Some of the collected articles after the text are very enlightening, for example J.R.R.

Some courses specifically for Brazilian or European Portuguese teach you local expressions and colloquialisms that make learning harder for people like me who want to use the language on both sides of the Atlantic. After struggling with a couple of such courses, I was fortunate to find this one. In this course the starting point is the common ground between Brazilian and European Portuguese. The differences are then explained and you can pick what you need depending where you want to use the language.I bought this course last year and have gone through most of it. So far, I have used what I am learning in Brazil, Portugal and Angola. When I spoke Portuguese in these countries, it was a fantastic feeling to see that I was actually understood. The accompanying audio gives you different voices, which also helps with the various accents even within Brazil (they sound quite different in the north and in the south).Another feature I particularly like in this course is that it is very communicative. Everything you learn can be used straight away, in authentic situations: formalities on arrival, finding the way, hiring a car, hotel and other accommodation, food, shopping, health, meeting people socially or for business, and a lot more.

Since neither of us spoke the language we decided to purchase a teach yourself course. Having reviewed all the available material, we found the above book and audio package to be the best value. Best because it also covers Portuguese as spoken in Brazil; our next target.What appealed to us about the book was the modern day approach which the author adopted. Its flexibility by allowing us to go as far into a topic as we wished. That the same book would serve us equally as well when we visited Brazil. Also and the number of different topics covered.Quite naturally, when you are a beginner, grammar can be the biggest obstacle. No problem here. The grammar is presented in small amounts, each piece being targeted to your progress.Dialogues used in the book to demonstrate model sentences use expressions which can be found in everyday situations. In fact, they too have been pitched to cater for your confidence in using the grammar.Equally the vocabulary used is very realistic and typical of everyday use. We particularly liked the vocabulary lists at the back of the book for quick reference of Portuguese to English and vice versa.The range of topics to was invaluable. In the early stages of our visit we pointed to the phrase or sentence in the book to get what we wanted but as we read and immersed ourselves in the environment we spoke more.You would have thought that because of the environment we were in, the audio assistance would not have been used so much. Not true, we found it very useful, particularly when we refer to our next target of Brazil. Having the ability to relate the daily Portuguese we heard to the audio aid and then relating it to Portuguese as spoken in Brazil made us feel comfortable over a next venture.

She explores the way texts were used as memory tools or mnemonic devices by medieval readers. Texts, she argues, were not meant to be simply informational. Instead, readers and listeners used mnemonic skills to store the information gleaned from texts in their minds and use that information as the matter for future composition or meditation. Carruthers's writing is clear and informative. This text is comprehensive, often fascinating, and displays the author's vast knowledge of her subject matter. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in expanding his or her understanding of memory and composition in the Middle Ages. However, this book is not for everyone. It is very dense and goes into great technical detail about its subject matter.

Its themes are also a revelation to anyone interested in medieval art history. For example, after reading this, one realizes that medieval manuscripts were colorfully illuminated for the purposes of recollection, not just to make pretty pictures in the margins. This work expands and corrects some of the conclusions of Frances Yates in her pioneering work, &quot;The Art of Memory.&quot; This is an intellectual thrill ride!"},{"Title":"The Book of Memory: A Study of Memory in Medieval Culture (Cambridge Studies in Medieval Literature)","review":"In this review, I intend to describe what the book is, who it is for, and its pluses and shortcomings. Then, I'd like to recommend a few companion volumes. Finally, I want to answer the complaint of one reviewer who claimed that Frances Yates book \\"On Memory\\" is better.Mary Carruthers did the world a tremendous service by writing the book. What she does is investigate the world of pre-modern memory in 500 pages beginning with the Ancients and then using that background as a base from which to cover medieval mnemonics-which both borrowed from and added to ancient systems of memory. She also discusses the role of memory as an art and a part of virtue, how the medievals perceived it, a brief set of theories on how memory works, memory's effects on composition and books, and the like, mnemonic-architectonics (I'll explain this term in a following section), and, finally, the \\"end\\" of memory as an art. Some of the work is conjecture, but most of it is simply solid historical material, which Mrs. Carruthers carefully documents and references. The work is, for the most part, divided according to subject rather than time period. Three appendices and two indices, one general and one of the manuscripts referenced, are included as well. Several black and white plates are included as well which are generally reproductions historical examples that are examined. As for the work's physical characteristics, I have a paperbound edition, but it is still quite sturdy.This book is useful for a variety of people. Obviously, the student of medieval thought is one target. However, for those wishing to educate themselves about a well-nigh forgotten area of knowledge, which was was considered absolutely vital, this work is a godsend. Additionally, for the person who wants to learn how to memorize things systematically, the book provides descriptions of several methods for doing so and breaks down the various systems into their common components. Of especial interest is the system of mnemonic-architectonics, in which one memorizes a physical place, such as a building (or \\"builds\\" an imaginary one in one's mind [\\"castles in the air\\", anyone?])and uses it as a place to store information in an orderly fashion. The systems described are not simple mnemonic tricks but are extraordinarily useful tools that were vital in an age before the printing press and were (and could still be) invaluable aids in composition. The authoress gives an extended description of how this was done. The copious references also make it possible to go directly to the primary sources, which is a tremendous help.As for the work's shortcomings, there are very few, in my opinion. The biggest problem is that it is rather dry. However, this is to be expected as it is academic. However, it manages to stay on subject well and deliver a great deal of information. A few digressions into literary theory may or may not interest the reader and some of the conclusions she draws using modern literary theory are debatable. The only other difficulty is that some may disagree with a few of the conjectures of the authoress regarding memory and the medieval mind. Nevertheless, the presence of conjecture in a field that is relatively unexplored is inevitable. Other than that, it is a solid, well-documented work.There are several works that may work as valuable accompaniments to this book. A translation of some of the primary sources referenced is available in a companion volumeThe Medieval Craft of Memory: An Anthology of Texts and Pictures (Material Texts)and another volume,The Craft of Thought: Meditation, Rhetoric, and the Making of Images, 400-1200 (Cambridge Studies in Medieval Literature)discusses the role of memory (in detail) in medieval rhetoric, meditation, and other areas of life, particularly in the religious communities. Frances Yates's book on memory is also useful as a sort of broad overview.Finally, I wish to answer an unfair comparison. One previous reviewer claimed that Frances Yates's book, \\"The Art of Memory\\" is superior. It is superior only in the sense that it is more readable, at least for the majority of the work. That book is written with a broader audience in mind and has more of a conversational style for recreational reading. However, Yates's specialty in writing tends to lean towards the history of occult movements and the like, and as such, she focuses on these aspects of the history of memory and the medievals don't get all that much space, and, in the end, memory gets pushed off the the side as well. Instead, the thrust of the work is ultimately towards the history of science with a focus on modern science's gnostic and occult roots (she theorizes about the philosopher's stone being the memory, etc, etc). In the last few chapters, the work becomes nearly wholly absorbed in discussions on the hermetic tradition, occultism, and various proto-modern scientists. Yes, it's readable, but readability is not a criterion for excellence save in thrillers and yellow journalism. I didn't find the information to be nearly as valuable or as useful or even as structured as \\"The Book of Memory\\". It's not a bad book, but it is much inferior to Mary Carruther's seminal work."},{"Title":"The Book of Memory: A Study of Memory in Medieval Culture (Cambridge Studies in Medieval Literature)","review":"I agree with the reader from New York who praises the scholarship on display here from Prof. Carruthers. Memory, so long a darling subject among intellectual elites, has fallen out of favor among modern intellectuals. Carruthers does an admirable job of re-locating it on our cultural maps._The Book of Memory_ suffers, however, in comparison with Frances Yates' classic text, _The Art of Memory_, which manages to be sweepingly ambitious, rigorous, and engaging. Carruthers is more academic. Yates' book is a masterpiece, whereas this one is merely superb."},{"Title":"The Book of Memory: A Study of Memory in Medieval Culture (Cambridge Studies in Medieval Literature)","review":"Mary Carruther's book on memory in the medieval age is one of those rare books where superb scholarship intersects with fascinating content. The book examines the role, nature, and development of memory in medieval times, and compares those to our modern conceptions of memory. As a construct worthy of examination, memory as viewed today is significantly different than its medieval construction, and Carruthers is able to examine these differences while providing a thorough examination of the medieval conception of memory.The scope of the book is impressive. The author begins by discussing the various memory models, a subject which should not only be of interest to medievalists, but those working in educational and cognitive psychology. Building upon this base, she then examines the neuropsychology of memory and elementary memory design, using numerous specific cases from the period as examples and as subjects for examination. Having established this base (and quite frankly, it might take digesting this material first necessary to truly grasp the overall thrust of the book), she then proceeds to discuss the arts and memory, memory and the ethics of reading, memory and authority, and finally, memory and the book. Each section is replete with examples (both individuals and material items, such as manuscripts, teaching lessons, art works, etc.). The book is lavishly supported with extensive post-text notes and a large bibliographic library of references. Illustrations are sparse, but are useful when used. For anyone who has spent any time learning about Hugh of St-Victor, Thomas Aquinas, Abelard, or Boethius (or any of a dozen or more historical personages from the era) the work will illuminate the teachings of these individuals by allowing the examination of their historical artifacts through a completely new lens.This is a complex, scholarly work. Although anyone with an interest in the subjects here--be they medievalists, psychologists, or educators--can benefit from the work, it will take a careful and methodical examination of this relatively dense and richly layered content. But the rewards can be substantial: this is a work that will certainly be considered a text de rigueur for most anyone studying in the field. It brings to light important ideas and concepts about human psychology and memory processes that allow us to increase our knowledge of the middles ages, but also to examine our own concepts of the same.

Imagine the scenario of a group of well trained and organized terrorists taking hostages at one of your local urban malls. That is the basic plot background but there is so much more to the storyline.DeBono uses both plot lines and character development to further the suspense and the action throughout the book. It is one of those stories that will get you hooked from the beginning to the end. As in all great works of fiction there are strong hero types and just as strong and intelligent evil doers. There are no cardboard characterizations - the author draws out the key elements in enough of the leading protagonists to allow you to connect with them on a more emotional level.This group of terrorist have it all figured out and have plans to counter all the potential police moves, however, the problems come when our hero, who is a recovering Iraq veteran and Marine, decides to take matters into his own hands. This unpredictable development takes the plot and storyline beyond just being a well told story into the realm of a classic thriller where suspense adds to the reader's enjoyment.A well told action tale and well worth reading!

Once they know this information and most importantly apply it in thier lives the ones who are sick will know why they got sick in the first place and will know how to get themselves well and those who are not sick will know how to prevent sickness in the first place."},{"Title":"The Hallelujah Diet : Experience the Optimal Health You Were Meant to Have","review":"I read this book in two nights!

An even bigger delight to see all the high praises and encouraging comments from doctors, researchers and medical experts I respect and admire deeply such as: Dr. Neal Barnard, Dr. Joel Fuhrman, Dr. John McDougall and, of course, the very highly esteemed Dr. T. Colin Campbell.It was so much fun to read all of their individual works first, BEFORE finding this book and the Hallelujah Diet. There is (THANKFULLY!) a revolution going on in diet and medicine these days and this author is right on target.Because Rev. Malkmus is not a physician or professionally connected to the world of medicine, he has no need to speak delicately or cautiously, worrying about who he might offend, how it's going to affect his livelihood or what he might be risking.Respectfully, openly and without fear, he pulls no punches but simply tells it like it is, from his own perspective. Enlightened by his own personal experience and that of his flock (now getting to be worldwide!) He is supported by countless experts in the various fields of which he speaks.They may differ a little on the details but that's how revolutions happen.I'm so grateful that these individuals with widely varied education and life experiences are all teaching and learning from one another.They share the same goal: HEALTH and HEALINGDon't miss the wonderful recent contribution, the Forks Over Knives movie, DVD, book and website (dot com).Very hard to imagine this revolution is NOT divinely inspired....!Thank you!(Sure wish Paula Deen would find you!)"},{"Title":"The Hallelujah Diet : Experience the Optimal Health You Were Meant to Have","review":"This book, The Hallelujah Diet, is one of the most thorough treatments of nutrition as it relates to major chronic diseases. Like the book by T. Colin Campbell, The China Study, this is a book covering all the major diseases of America and how simple nutrition steps we take can reverse diseases like heart disease, cancer (all), arthritis, and diabetes. I was diagnosed with diabetes and after trying Dr. Malkmus way of eating according to the Bible my sugar returned to normal in less than three weeks. I lost 23 pounds in the same three weeks and have seen lots of other symptoms of heart disease and neuropathy go away in the last 9 months. His premise of \\"you don't have to be sick\\" permeates every chapter as he deals with all major diseases affecting Americans today. The three writers draw together all available scientific evidence to support this thesis, including charts and a complete meal plan to help every soul interested in attaining optimum health. He clearly shows how the standard food pyramid is upside down with its focus on meats and dairy, both known carcinogens because of all the chemicals, pesticides, and hormones used to grow livestock today.

In my mind, this is a masterful accomplishment, which could only be possib le because of extensive research, work and experience through which God has led Dr. Malkmus. This could not have been his first book, but is the result of many years of practical experience. It contains just ab out everything that is needed to be said concerning The Hallelujah Diet and good health. Real facts and truths, not hearsay, are beautifully presented in a well-planned and organized fashion. Many questions are answered with ample explanation and information. I appreciate the fact that he does not shy away from difficult areas where people differ but endeavors to be open, clear and honest in these crucial areas. Throughout the book, we are shown our own personal responsibility; and rather than presenting man's meager remedies, the author gives God the glory for His miraculous creation and provision. This book properly outlines the options that we all have after knowing the facts; absolutely no one has any excuse or a reason for not understanding The Hallelujah Lifestyle and enjoying good health. My conclusion is that this is a marvelous and clear layout, which makes the whole field of health easy to understand. I could not have imagined that a book could be so well written as to fully cover and explain the need and importance of good nutrition and this healthy lifestyle.

There was some of that, but mostly, it's about an overzealous preacher who repeats himself in about every chapter with a \\"let's review what I said earlier\\" just to repeat himself verbatim as if the reader couldn't retain what he/she had read earlier. The writing style is \\"defensive\\" in that he foresees the reader feeling duped if the author doesn't back up his diet with a case study of sort. And there were too many (insert name)'s stories as if the writer couldn't stand alone on his blueprint for the new diet.He made some good points that most people can swallow, but he's a proponent of vegetarianism stating that's what the Bible says we should do. And I specifically remember reading stories in the Bible about fish and loaves, so I don't put much credence into the promotion of vegetarianism on the pretense of the Bible saying that's the way we should eat. The author states that these Biblical figures lived for centuries and we have short lives because we eat \\"dead food.\\" However, in the Old Testament, there were plenty of stories with lambs and feasts and those folks lived oh, 800 years (on an aside, I don't think I would want to live THAT long in our current social and political environment!).There are some pretty interesting recipes in the back, so I'll try them, but as far as the diet goes - it's not all the jacket pumps it up to be. Organic and vegetables, yes. Do away with red meat, I can see that. But do away with fish that is a staple of the Bible - that's where you lost me.I think the author would do well writing a book for dog owners who advocate the BARF diet (Biologically Appropriate Raw Food) as there are tenfold issues with the pet food industry than the USDA food industry (and I do believe there are severe problems with human food - as witnessed with spinach e-coli outbreaks of late).I give the book a \\"3\\" rather than a \\"2\\" for the recipes in the back and that's all."},{"Title":"The Hallelujah Diet : Experience the Optimal Health You Were Meant to Have","review":"It seems this is more about God than a diet.

I really thought that my life was going to go downhill from that point as I did alot of research on the disease and for everyone it seems to just snowball and get worse and worse until they finally die of some kind of complications. Also, lupus patients are very highly medicated. I decided that instead of going the medical route I would try this diet of juicing carrots and eating an 85% plant based diet. I was only 3 days into the diet and started to gain energy that I hadn't had in years. I continued to get better and better...and really, 3 months into it I was pretty much healed of the disease. I had no idea that a person could feel so good. I felt and still do feel better than I can ever remember feeling. even as a teenager (I am 48). i also lost 25 lbs which was a nice plus. I don't follow the diet 100% right now, but I do try to stick to it as much as possible and I very seldom eat meat. I kind of know my limits now, so cheat alot, but still feel great!

My concerns are with the philosophy and teachings underpinning the book and how it is used to profit the author and the organization of Hallelujah Acres which seeks not just to have you change your diet, but more importantly from their perspective, to buy their products.The entire premise of this book theologically is based upon George Malkmus' interpretation of Gen 1:29, which he takes to mean that God created mankind to eat only fruits and vegetables. Based upon this interpretation, which is not accepted by a majority of Biblical Scholars, Malkmus suggests that meat entered the human diet at the fall of Adam and Eve. While he does not suggest that eating meat itself is necessarily sinful, he does strongly push the idea that this was God's original plan for diet and therefore anyone seeking to eat optimally should consider this as the first choice and reject any meat or animal products in their diet.He goes further to teach that illness is caused and/or escalated by what he deems the Standard American Diet (conveniently acronymed as SAD for emphasis.)Chielf culprits are any and all meat products, dairy products and then sugar, flour, salt.It would be one thing if he left it here and invited you to join him with his diet plan.He doesn't however.Based on this rather shaky premise of questionable theology and some pretty questionable science and nutrition teaching (witness, for example, his discourses on Glucose and Fructose that refers to them as \\"complex\\" carbohydrates) that suggests there is an esoteric life giving quality to eating \\"live\\" food as opposed to \\"dead\\" food, he goes on to teach that there are things he has come up with to go above and beyond eating natural raw food.This is the real point of the book in my opinion.He wants you to buy BarleyMax, a product he sells through his traditional multi-level marketing business for a profit.This is important enough to repeat.Hallelujah Acres is not a ministry in a formal sense at all. They are a business and they sell products. Malkmus, through his weekly newsletter often appeals to what he does as a \\"ministry.\\" He justifies that title and calls \\"ministry\\" such actions as giving free seminars, free electronic newsletters, counselors etc and holds that up as \\"proof\\" of his \\"ministry.\\" Other companies call this \\"marketing.\\"Nutritionally their featured product \\"BarleyMax\\" (before this they used an AMA product named \\"BarleyGreen\\" which received a warning from the FDA for excessive claims beyond what science could substantiate) is sold by them and their \\"Health Ministers\\" often serve as financial marketing partners who in turn profit from their ministry.Recent developments in their teachings include now supplimenting their diet with vitamin B12 which often is a common deficiency in Vegans, the lack of which can lead to irreversible nerve damage. They resisted this recommendation for years despite overwhelming evidence of the need for this suppliment and then conveniently began to offer it for sale themselves; another cash flow.Followers often frame their support of this diet in spiritual terms, implying or outright claiming that this is \\"God's diet plan\\" and any who oppose their teaching or question theirs and Malmus' claims are thereby attacking God.The primary method of support relied upon are an overwhelming number of testimonies regularly put out from people who are on the diet. A consistent theme that even a casual observer can note in these testimonies is that many are on the front end of the diet and very excited about the weight loss and energy they have. Updates on these people is rare. There are always new people coming on who are caught up in the excitement and willing to claim healings and health improvement regardless of the medical substantiation of the claim, which is usually lacking or general in nature.George Malkmus' own personal testimony of healing from cancer is based upon examinations by chiropractors and there is no pathology or medical records to substantiate his claim.Tied into this teaching is a very strong negative assessment of the medical profession and the outright implication that they are profiteers seeking to perpetuate illness for their own gain in many instances. This is unless, of course, a doctor gives a person a frame of time to live due to cancer or some other illness. Then if that time frame is exceeded, the doctor was right and the diet is responsible for a \\"miracle.\\" They will pick and chose what to accept and what to reject from the medical community based upon whatever is needed to promote the diet.Ironically, in recent years, Malkmus has suffered a stroke and had high blood pressure which his diet and herb treatments could not control. He now sees a doctor and is on medications to control this condition. There is some question as to the nature of the stroke itself and whether it might not have been caused or exacerbated by his diet's deficiencies.In closing, this is the how the story of my father ended. He was diagnosed in October of 1999 with kidney cancer in the 4th stage. He went on the Hallelujah Diet when the medical prognosis offered little hope. He did make remarkable progress although it was never medically verified as he refused to see a doctor for almost 5 years after his initial diagnosis.He dropped 70 pounds, exercised and did seem to do very well and went beyond the 2 year outside window he was given as an estimate by the doctors. He was convinced he was healed and gave a great deal of credit to the Hallelujah Diet for his progress.In July of 2004 he travelled to Shelby, North Carolina to become an elite Health Minister to step up his promoting of this diet to the many people that were encouraged by his testimony.He submitted a testimony to Hallelujah Acres and they published it in their Health Tips Newsletter in August of 2004 emphasising his claim of healing and his praise of their diet despite the fact that in the testimony itself he acknowledged it was not verified medically.My dad finally began to go to see 2 doctors when he began to have serious health issues and pain. In October of 2004, just 3 months after his testimony of healing was published, it was confirmed that his cancer had furhter metasticized and spread to 6 other organs.Dad refused further medical treatment refusing to go to the hospital and resiting as strongly as he could anything for pain management. He died on Christmas morning of 2004, 5 months after his testimony was published in Hallelujah Acre's Health Tips proclaiming his healing.In fairness to Hallelujah Acres, I sent them an update of his story recently asking them to publish the update in their newsletter. They did so, but only after considerable pressure on my part to get an answer from them and when they did publish the e-mail they edited out the date of death as well as the extent of the spread of the cancer and allowed people to think by implcation that Dad lived longer than he did. They also stated, without any medical support that Dad was in remission and then inferred that he came out of \\"remission\\" due to some actions of his own, rather than any shortcomings of the diet.I'm grateful they had the integrity to print something. Their manipulation of the material in this manner is indicative of their general mode of operation in masking the whole truth when it does not generate praise for their diet plan and marketing their products.I think there are many good elements to a vegan diet and that managed carefully it leads to weight loss, a correction of some medical conditions and a sense of energy and well-being for many people. There is no question in my mind that short-term, a diet of this nature can accomplish positive things as a change in lifestyle and bring amazing results.Long term, there are serious questions as to the benefits versus the risks and there is a cadre of former adherants to this diet plan who often times are afraid to speak up for fear they will be personally criticized for their lack of will-power to remain upon this rigid diet plan that was equated with their spiritual commitment.I am not against veganism or diet in the pursuit of homeopathic healing.I am skeptical of the Hallelujah Diet's inner teachings, workings and their personal profiting from their diet plan which they entwine with questionable theology, questionable science and less than honest representations of their for-profit status and all the while manapulating their testimonies and claims.Please read this book with this in mind, do some additional research on your own. Don't accept the claims of this organization without checking their teachings and science from other sources as well. You can learn a lot by Googling and reading the material that activity will yield."},{"Title":"The Hallelujah Diet : Experience the Optimal Health You Were Meant to Have","review":"I am an N.D. and have a practice here in Pennsylvania. I have owned this book for many years and for 5 years, I followed this diet \\"religiously\\". One of the reasons this diet is helpful, and to it's credit, is that is makes you aware of processed foods, and by avoiding them, you can improve your health and stabilize your weight. The real benefit comes not from the theology, but rather in making wiser food choices. I agree in avoiding packaged, processed foods, and the return to eating organic whole foods. To the book's credit is the fact that it warns it's readers to avoid chemicals in food, our households, and environment. I believe the healthiest diet in one that is based predominantly on plant foods (fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds, beans, whole-grains, and minimal organic animal products such as eggs, lean meat, raw cultured dairy, etc.) While I do agree with some of the thological points presented, there is one that is truly unbiblical. Rev. Malkmus teaches and believes that God allowed meat into our diets as a means of shortening our lifespan. When Noah exited the ark God repeated the blessing given to Adam in Genesis, of eating plant foods, but now included animal products in that blessing, and instructed Noah to be fruitful and multiply. It would not be the character of God to give man meat in the guise of a blessing, while really intending to offer man someting that would cause an earlier death. God does not offer a curse in disguise as a blessing. This is theologically opposed to the character and nature of God. If you want to purchase a book as a guide to a biblically based diet, one of the best is, \\"What The Bible Says About Healthy Living\\" by Rex Russell. Rex is a Christian M.D. and offers a balanced view. I have read just about every book on this subject, and this is the most balanced and easy to understand presentation I have found.

But my beer, pizza, cinnamon rolls, cookies, & steak were to important to me & I didn't really \\"need\\" to change. Only 2 years later my scare with cancer crossroads met me.

I have spent years wading through the fads and wild assertions of many diets and health crazes, and took what works and kept it, and rejected what doesn't.This book, by Rhonda Malkmus is one of the very few books that has a huge compilation of the valuable information that I have gathered over the years and put it in one very easy to read place.I often recommend this book to many people who do not have the library of resources that I do because they will find the most amount of valuable information in this book than most books that I know of for those who are trying to change their life into a healthier mode of living.The beginning of the book explains what needs to be in your kitchen, and what needs to be out. There are many recipes from 5star raw to 1star cooked so that you can adapt your diet to raw eating and include those in the family who do not want to eat like you.Every recipe I have tried from this book has been excellent with few exceptions. The instructions are clearly laid out, and the ingredients are not outlandish like many raw books.Some of the recipes sound boring, but in most cases, they are delicious. One thing I do not like about it is that some of the recipes for breads and cookies are all dehydrated which I do not have time to plan for in advance most of the time.We especially love the raw soup recipes- asparagus, carrot, avocado, gazpacho, and raw chili.There are even menu suggestions on the back in case you get stuck for what to feed the family.Out of all of the raw food books I have, Recipes for Life is one that I reach for most often- especially when I am in a hurry.Another very good raw recipe book is Sunfood Cuisine. It not only gives great delicious recipes, but it teaches you priciples of how to quickly put together your own recipes from what ingredients you already have."},{"Title":"The Hallelujah Diet : Experience the Optimal Health You Were Meant to Have","review":"This is an EXCELLENT book!

Tired of going to Doctors and paying large sums of money and they are just as sick as you are? Nobody seems to have the answers UNTIL you read this and other informative books from Hallelujah Acres. These people truely care about others and want people who are seeking the TRUTH a place where they can go and find it. Forget the negative reviews or else you will never find out for yourself the truth. It changed my life and my entire city has seen the difference that this diet and lifestyle can do, even my father who found out he had prostate cancer now has a dopted this diet and has some very amazing recovery already in 6 months and has lost a ton of weight. This book helped me to learn about foods! I later learned about the Hallelujah Diet & Lifestyle and changed my diet. I now look and feel 20years younger and my arthritis is gone! I used to weigh 215 lbs and now I weigh 167 lbs. I have been on the Hallelujah Diet for almost 4 yrs now and LOVE it. In fact as of this year (2009) I eat all RAW living foods and I can see even more difference. I highly recommend the HA diet and RE-learning about foods, what you eat may be causing your problems! It is not so important what you eat...AS COMPARED TO...What You DON'T EAT!!! After almost 4 years of changing my diet and lifestyle I have impacted my communtiy and several people now have learned about the HA diet and eating more raw living foods and understanding what food is and what food is NOT. The Standard American Diet (SAD) is killing us slowly in the wonderful country many have helped to build. The Love of money, greed and lack of understanding about what we put into our mouths everyday is the cause of up to 90% of all of phyical problems. I hope you will begin to learn and change, it worked for me and many others. Read as many books as you can and learn for yourself, and again I highly recommend the Hallelujah Diet & Lifestyle.

The diet is not easy, as it recommends heavy on the \\"RAW\\"; and a flat hand to fast food..(just like every health book); but it also delivers HOPE to those who have little hope left. And a dear neighbor (who was not supposed to live past Christmas 05) today is in full remission and swears by this book. (She also looks better at 60 than she has looked in the past 25 years).

Her students at the time snuck some of her hair to a lab that verified the hair was not dyed as the students had not believed her.Victoria Boutenko another 100% raw foodist vegan cured her family of several serious diseases like type one diabetes, etc.Stories like this are all over the internet.Although he does encourage people to buy his products one can still do the diet without buying his products although Dave the trucker did take barley max and called it rocket fuelOne can get a dehydrator with a temperature control and make their own beet and carrot powder or buy wheat or barley grass elsewhere.I like that he lists the foods you can and cannot eat both raw and cooked and does include this at his website as this makes it easy to show people that this does not just mean produce and there is a wide variety of acceptable foods. I like that he speaks also of other things that add to health like exercise, juicing, the sun etcThis is a very good book and mission.For those seriously ill in addition to this or better yet a 100% raw vegan whole food diet, includes lots of juices, green juices, green smoothies, juice fasting and detoxing of elimination organs and try doing Dr Schulze's save your life programTo find the videos and manual search on here for biser save your life.

Raw foods is key..go to Shirley's wellness cafe and type raw foods and at first link go to great rat experiment and read and also see pottenger cat study raw food rawk.Though not yet where I want to be three years ago I changed my diet to a whole foods, vegan, diet and currently eat about 60% raw. I recently learned at a raw group how to make raw vegan cheese and raw crackers and things like these help one eventually go more and more into raw foods with more ease.edit I just found out one can watch the save your life videos free on youtube currently and with a search can find the Biser save your life manualI learned more from these materials than in 15 years of extensive reading on health topics, herbs etc Take advantage of watching this free or downloading it while it is still there...the interviewer keeps getting these things removed from the internet so may not be there long and well worth your time if you or a loved one are sick,incurable or dying.dr Schulze worked with such people in his clinic that doctors had given up on and many many survived and even outlived their doctors..one thing he advocated for incurable disease was a vegan totally raw diet or juice fasting in the worst cases unless one is healthy and then vegan with a lot of raw..raw foods are the great healers especially produce."},{"Title":"The Hallelujah Diet : Experience the Optimal Health You Were Meant to Have","review":"I lost 29 lbs. eating this way in less than 2 months. It was such a healthy diet. My arthritis has clear up and my skin has not looked this good in over 40 years. I will stay with this way of eating, nothing but good has resulted from it."},{"Title":"The Hallelujah Diet : Experience the Optimal Health You Were Meant to Have","review":"I bought this book because someone dear to me said she was on a new diet that cures cancer. She said this diet is based on science and Bible teachings, but then talked about eating almost all raw foods and cutting out all meat and animal products. Having done extensive studies of the Bible, health, and nutrition myself, I immediately wanted to know upon what evidence this diet is based. It is mostly testimonials. I found no peer reviewed journal articles, and little other scientific data listed in the endnotes. Often Reverend Malkus used videos made by his own corporation to back up what he says in the book.One can demonstrate that this diet is neither Biblically sound, nor scientifically backed up.First, it is Biblical? Malkus quotes Genesis 1:29 only. He then restricts people to raw vegetables, fruits, sprouted grains, nuts, products called BarleyMax, CarrotjuiceMax, BeetMax (that the Hallelujah Acres Corporation sells), and once in awhile a few cooked beans or grains (pages 142, 143).Rev. Malkus ignores the many, many other references to food, diet, and healthy living in the Bible. For instance, he ignores Genesis 3:19; \\"by the sweat of your brow shall you eat bread.\\" Bread is mentioned 361 times in the Bible. Jesus himself fed the twelve disciples bread and wine at the last supper. He said, \\"I am the bread of life,\\"( John 6:7), and he taught us to pray, \\"give us this day our daily bread\\" (Matthew 6:11). Bread is a cooked food that has always been the staff of life, but Dr. Malkus wants people to eat mainly uncooked sprouted grains.He also advocates heavy use of vegetable juice made with a juicer or blender. How many people throughout history have had access to electric juice extractors? Yet he says this diet is \\"natural\\" and Biblical.Then he makes the wildly unsubstantiated claim:\\"... almost everyone who adopts it [The Hallelujah Diet] gets well from almost every physical problem they have been experiencing, and then stays well\\" (p. 66).As for cutting out all meat, fish and dairy products-- Rev. Malkus explains away Genesis 9:1-3 where God blesses Noah and gives him the beasts of the air and the fish of the sea to eat. He says nothing about the dietary laws given to the Israelites where God tells them they can eat clean meats, poultry, and fish-- just not the fat on the meat, nor unclean meats (scavenger animals, prone to infectious diseases), Leviticus 11-12.Malkus completely ignores that Jesus himself fed fish and bread to his five thousand followers, in a miraculous act of love. Throughout Jesus' ministry He healed people, which is why he is called the Great Physician. Would the Great Physician feed something harmful to his followers? Jesus also ate fish, bread, and drank wine. Rev. Malkus advocates cutting out all alcohol, all coffee, and all tea, except herb teas. He bases it on his theory of \\"acidity,\\" for which I can find no scientific support.If you want to know more about principles of health from the Bible, a much better book is by Rex Russell, MD.What the Bible Says About Healthy Living. Dr. Russell has done a much more thorough study of the Bible, is a Christian medical doctor who backs up what he says with sound science, and is not trying to sell you products like BarleyMax or CarrotjuiceMax.As far as science is concerned, the unsubstantiated claims that Rev. Malkus makes in the \\"Hallelujah\\" book are nothing short of outrageous, bordering on dangerous. For instance: \\"All drugs are toxic. There isn't a safe drug on the planet earth.\\"(p. 86).It is shocking that any M.D. would endorse his book, as Rev. Malkus would deny people the benefits of antibiotics, pain-killers, anesthesia, thyroid replacement, seizure controlling drugs, and so many other medicines, making it seem immoral to ever go to medical doctors. In his system, the only moral thing to do is go on his extremely restrictive diet. If there are no safe drugs on the planet, you couldn't go to the dentist either, because the dentist might use a local anesthetic when repairing your teeth.Here is another bizarre claim:\\"There is a similarly fine line between life and death regarding the temperature of foods we eat. At 107 degrees F, the enzymes--the life force within the food--start to break down and die. By 122 degrees F, all enzymatic activity is gone--the food is dead...\\" (there are no footnotes that document where he gets this information). How does Malkus know when the \\"life force within\\" the food \\"dies\\"? Enzymes are simply proteins that, in the stomach for instance, help to digest foods. What in the heck is he talking about?Conclusion: Yes, it is good to increase one's intake of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and other whole foods. Yes, Americans eat too much red meat, refined sugars, and saturated fats. But Malkus' Hallelejah diet is an extreme, needless, and potentially harmful gimmick, in opposition to what Jesus taught about foods.Kathleen Melonakos, RN, MA"},{"Title":"The Hallelujah Diet : Experience the Optimal Health You Were Meant to Have","review":"This book has been very interesting reading.

Breen's comment that Hallelujah Acres products are sold via MLM: this is absolutely NOT true. I am a Certified Health Minister myself and we have no such pay structure. We are not pushed to make sales, but rather for ministering to people with needs and questions.This diet and lifestyle has benefited my husband and me immensely, and NOT financially from sales of product, and we know of many others who have been equally benefited LONG TERM, and of no one who has not.I believe the TRUE Maker's Diet would be more correctly described by Genesis 1:29, which Rubin (author of 'The Maker's Diet') does quote, and which describes YHVH's Original Diet in the Garden, as well as the Hallelujah Diet. It just makes logical sense that this would be the ideal as it was given in the ideal state of man, created specifically for his body's needs. Noah appears to have been given permission to eat meat based upon need, as most vegetation had been destroyed in the flood. Just because we have permission does not indicate that it is YHVH's ideal for us. A consequence of adding meat was, indeed, shortened life span, according to Scripture, so that this 'blessing' was, simultaneously, a 'curse'. One may be blessed for choosing Yeshua, and, simultaneously, cursed with the consequences of one's previous actions during this lifetime. This doesn't mean one isn't 'saved', only that certain actions have natural, God given consequences, therefore this is definitely within God's Character.I am a Certified Health Minister with a Bachelors Degree in Chemical Engineering and a work background as a Certified Environmental Trainer specializing in Health & Safety and Hazardous Materials who has studied several of Malkmus' books carefully and find them both effective and practical."},{"Title":"The Hallelujah Diet : Experience the Optimal Health You Were Meant to Have","review":"This is not an easy diet to follow, but the benefits are remarkable.

Be aware though that some who followed this diet strictly for several years have had problems. See Chet Day's site for specific stories or beyondveg for more general problems with vegan, mostly-raw diets.The worst part of this book is the claim that it is based on Christian teaching. No serious Bible scholars that I know of agree with the use of one verse to imply that God intended a vegan diet. Jesus gave fish to the crowds and to his disciples (John 6 and John 21), so it is hard to see how God's ideal diet is vegan."},{"Title":"The Hallelujah Diet : Experience the Optimal Health You Were Meant to Have","review":"This book gives proven sound nutritional advice regardless of your religious views. The top two negative reviews posted focus on the theological aspect and try to discredit the author for selling products. Many alternative health professionals and practices do this in order to supply quality products which promote health and the body healing. The reviewers fail to mention that in their presentations, Hallelujah Acres, will tell their audience of comparable products they can purchase if they choose.From my experience and research in the arena of the diet and lifestyle to promote the body healing, Hallelujah Acres is right on par with many of the cutting edge alternative organizations, secular and religious. Their prices are on the lower end. You may not agree with their religious philosophies but their nutritional advice and results is in agreement with a lot of other natural health professionals, many from medical backgrounds, around the world. And the evidence is growing.If Hallelujah Acres were one of a few organizations making the claims they do without the proof It would be one thing. Their diet and lifestyle and healing testimonies are consistent with the alternative health community.I'm not trying to deny the reviewers feelings but I think their reviews were not just about the book but of the Hallelujah Acres as a whole and it gave an inaccurate picture."},{"Title":"The Hallelujah Diet : Experience the Optimal Health You Were Meant to Have","review":"AMAZING BOOK, FULL OF TRUTHS THAT I HAVE MYSELF PUT INTO PRACTICE WITH GREAT RESULTS.I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND READING THE CHINA STUDY, AND RAW FOOD LIFE TO REALLY DRIVE ALL INFORMATION HOME.TRULY ILLUMINATING!"},{"Title":"The Hallelujah Diet : Experience the Optimal Health You Were Meant to Have","review":"What a breakthrough this marvelous book will be for those who read it, thoroughly digest it's teachings and apply them to their lives!

I myself have been an adherent of the Hallelujah Diet for a little over 6 years. Through the teachings of this book, and Rev.

I have walked this path, as I said, for over 6 years now and have never seen any return of any of my former complaints. All of my results are medically validated and my doctor was truly amazed at my results! I heartily recommend both the book and the lifestyle to you.

Malkmus that was allegedly based on Scripture verses from the Bible called The Hallelujah Diet.My first exposure to this holy diet plan was when the former minister of music at my church lost a significant amount of weight on it several years back. He was already a big man at 6'7\\" tall, but The Hallelujah Diet helped him trim down by an incredible 75 pounds. The results of this way of eating for him were just undeniable and he was one of the strongest proponents for this way of eating you'll ever meet. But there's more to share about what happened next for him in just a moment.Malkmus is well-known within Christian circles for his frequent appearances on radio and television and in publishing a health newsletter that is read by hundreds of thousands of people each month. In addition, he travels all around the country talking about health and nutrition in seminars held mostly in churches and local venues.His message: God ordained the way we should eat and it includes consuming living and organic foods, implementing better lifestyle choices, and getting our lives in accordance with what the Lord wants for us.This all sounds good on the surface and certainly Malkmus is a strong believer in the Lord and in the health principles he is teaching people about their diet. But that \\"optimal health you were meant to have\\" according to Malkmus is predicated on eating lots and lots of living and organic foods which in and of itself is not a bad thing. However, when it is to the exclusion of foods such as meat (described as \\"dead animal products\\" which Malkmus believes \\"is more harmful to our health\\" than any other food) and other \\"deadly\\" foods, Malkmus reveals that his motive is less spiritual than it is in promoting veganism and the vegetarian lifestyle.With that said, though, I give credence to Malkmus for acknowledging the harmful effects of excessive preservatives in foods, white sugar (which he says \\"contributes to an obese society, contributing to epidemic rates of heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and a long list of emotional problems\\"), prescription medications, white flour (which makes \\"the most wonderful paste\\"), and caffeine. That is why Malmus highly recommends people eat more raw foods to have their bodies work the way God intended.Sprinkled throughout the book are various success stories from people who have been on The Hallelujah Diet in an effort to legitimize that it really is working for real people. I'm sure it is, but the jury is out on the so-called 85:15 rule, where 85 percent of food consumed should be raw and a mere 15 percent is cooked foods.Wanna see what you get to eat in a typical day on The Hallelujah Diet? Try this on for size.BREAKFAST: One serving of BarleyMax powder to cleanse the system.MID-MORNING SNACK: 8-oz glass of vegetable juice with flax seed.LUNCH: More BarleyMax with raw veggies and fruit.MID-AFTERNOON SNACK: 8-oz glass of vegetable juice with trail mix.DINNER: Another BarleyMax serving with non-head lettuce and pasta.DESSERT: Juicy fresh fruit or organic apple juice.EVENING SNACK: Homemade organic recipes from the book.Doesn't this just sound so yummy to your tummy? NOT!While I can certainly appreciate a pastor trying to help people eat better than they ever have before to preserve the temple of the Holy Spirit which is our bodies, I cannot for the life of me understand how Malkmus believes his nutritional approach is the one and only way that God would have people to lose weight and get healthy. With all due respect to my fellow brother in Christ, he is just plain wrong in his conclusions about weight loss and diet for ALL people. There is no one God-endorsed diet plan out there and anyone who tells you otherwise is lying.When I weighed 410 pounds just two years ago, there is no way I could have ever been able to do The Hallelujah Diet because it was more of what I had heard my entire life about getting my weight under control -- eat better, stop eating junk food, move your body, YADDA YADDA YADDA! Those statements ring so hollow and I heard them again and again as I read The Hallelujah Diet book.But now that I found a healthy way to eat and control my weight through the incredibly healthy low-carb lifestyle, my life has been radically changed for the better -- over 180 pounds gone forever! Is God mad at me for losing weight and keeping it off this way, Rev. Malkmus? I sure don't think so. He is probably happy to see me finally find a way to control my cravings, enjoy the foods that He created for me to eat, and now serving as someone who can inspire and encourage others who need to lose weight, too.Remember that minister of music I told you about who had lost weight being an enthusiastic follower of The Hallelujah Diet. Well, apparently he got tired of having to avoid social events at church where there was food that was totally off-limits to him for his diet. Not only has he gained back all of that weight he lost, but he now weighs more than he did before he went on the diet. It's sad to see that happen to this great man of God, but unfortunately it was predictable in my opinion.Some people can only keep up that way of eating for a short period of time before they go completely nuts! While Malkmus believes in his diet, I don't think there's anything shameful about a Christian choosing to follow another diet plan instead. Perhaps people who have tried and failed on The Hallelujah Diet should try the low-carb lifestyle instead. I know that will be a hard transition, especially since Malkmus often references such radical vegetarian activists such as Dr. Joel Fuhrman, T. Colin Campbell from The China Study, and other various anti-dairy, anti-meat web sites in the appendix to his book. But you can do it and God will help you just as He helped me.Permanent weight loss is definitely within your grasp and I pray that God will reveal to you what will work best for your body. After you lose the weight for good you can shout HALLELUJAH for the blessings that God has bestowed upon you for lasting weight loss and improved health like you've never seen before. It CAN happen if you believe that God can still perform miracles -- he did it for me thanks to livin' la vida low-carb and I'll never be the same again! And he'll MAKE IT HAPPEN for you as well."},{"Title":"The Hallelujah Diet : Experience the Optimal Health You Were Meant to Have","review":"I truly LOVE this book. Its importance to the health-seeking reader simply cannot be overstated. For those who are familiar with Rev. Malkmus' other books and videos/dvds, \\"The Hallelujah Diet\\" may not pose very much new information about health and nutrition, but certainly it has assumed a greater urgency. Can we, Christian or non-Christian, conscientiously continue in the current day's eating and lifestyle, well knowing it contributes to the disease and premature death of millions worldwide - and maybe to one's own, too?There have been numerous books released on this issue already, most of them sort of idealistic rather than biblical in viewpoint. According to the credo of the authors, research on the subject of health, nutrition and lifestyle should start from the Scripture, not from preconceived ideas. And they adhere firmly to that standpoint throughout this book. The clarity of the authors' exposition, the pertinence of their analysis, the vigour of their convictions and the firmness of the testimonies woven in make \\"The Hallelujah Diet\\" a very important contribution to one of the most urgent questions of our time.According to Hallelujah Acres' weekly newsletter, shortly after George Malkmus' new book, \\"The Hallelujah Diet\\" was released in March 2006, it reached the #1 ranking on amazon.com, a listing that ranks some 500,000 books. That's astounding but not surprising; it's heartening!My sincere recommendation."},{"Title":"The Hallelujah Diet : Experience the Optimal Health You Were Meant to Have","review":"Great information and great tools (journals, etc) to help follow the diet and lifestyle.In response to the review about \\"bad theology\\", Dr. Malkmus doesn't claim that this is the only diet mentioned in the Bible, but rather that is is the ORIGINAL (from Genesis 1:29), and I believe that bears some significance.The fact that God did not give meat to eat in paradise tells me that meat is optional. It's not something we need to be healthy. And scientific research has shown that animal product consumption can be contributing factors to some of our major illnesses today. So why eat it?It's not a sin to eat meat, nor does Dr. Malkmus make this claim.The Hallelujah Diet is based on the original perfect diet given in the paradise of the Garden of Eden. Yes, we now live in a fallen world, and consequently, some changes need to be made from the original, but we can learn a lot from God's original plan. And the diet makes allowances for the fallen world we live in.I highly recommend this book. The Hallelujah Diet changed my life. I wasn't suffering from any major illnesses, but I am much healhier than I was before. I think the testimonies speak for themselves and you can see even more testimonies regarding many serious illnesses (cancer, diabetes, auto-immune, etc.) on the Hallelujah Acres website at www.hacres.com.Buy the book and give it a try for yourself!"},{"Title":"The Hallelujah Diet : Experience the Optimal Health You Were Meant to Have","review":"Excellent, Amazing!!

The author gives a great background on the use of names, and repeatedly shows examples utilizing powerful array formulas. Every chapter presents several interesting concepts. The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is that the author doesn't consistently take the time to explain how some of the functions/formulas work. For example, in the Databases chapter there is a section on Summarizing a List with a Data Table which I think is very poorly explained. I prefer not to simply copy a formula out of a book to use it in a spreadsheet. This is a pattern in all of Walkenbach's books.

The author, John Walkenbach, covers formulas from basic to advanced; this book includes more formulas than any book I've seen! I really liked the two chapters (chapters 12 and 13) on arrays, formulas you can use with arrays, and the alternative formulas you can use in place of the AND and/or OR functions in array formulas if you're summing and conditions must be met (the AND and/or OR functions gives you incorrect results).In addition to formulas, the book also talks about Excel's history, how to perform certain tasks like Data Validation, and other interesting information (e.g. the year 1900 is not a leap year!).The only thing I disliked about the book is that some concepts required more explanation; Mr. Walkenbach didn't really explain why some formulas work. For example, the alternative to the OR function in an array formula (when summing based on conditions) comes to mind; I found it to be confusing! He also never mentions that to get the results, there are other formulas you can use in place of the AND/OR functions when summing based on conditions (I figured this out by trial and error); readers might think that they have to use the formulas he presented to get the results. In addition, it would've been great if the financial calculations (Chapter 10) showed more formulas (ones that you can use if you were to calculate them manually) so that readers know how Excel came up with the result, but since Mr. Walkenbach is not a business graduate, I can cut him some slack.One good thing about this book is that you can follow the book without the aid of the enclosed CD-Rom; I prefer to rely on the book alone, because I find the contents of the CD-Rom to be confusing without referring to the book.The formulas presented in the book are neat, and the author really knows what he's talking about.

Some areas needed expansion but with careful reading of this and the other two Walkenbach texts you really should be able to teach yourself (with the assistance of newsgroups: most of which are listed in the teaxt).After his Bible, and Power Programming what does John do to follow?"},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"The Excel \\"Formulas\\" book is extractions from the same author's\\"Excel Bible\\" book. Although it's easier to find information in this version, that convenience is not worth the extra cost for less information. I made the mistake of buying this version, while also having the \\"Bible\\", so I basically wasted my money."},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"This is definitely one of the most useful books on the market for getting the most out of Excel. I've personally purchased about eight copies for colleagues and employees.What helped me the most after reading this book was that I now approach data and analysis problems much differently. John Walkenbach is great at showing the potential of Excel as a real problem solving tool; by the end of the book, you'll be putting together complex formulas and breezing through the most complicated analysis in ways you never knew were possible.If you only buy one book on Excel, this should be the one!"},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"This booked turned me from a good Excel user into a very strong user.Even better, several colleagues are rapidly moving into being strong users. This is beyond a doubt the best book I have seen for any Microsoft Office application, both as a learning text and as a cookbook for five minute solutions."},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"I can't express just how useful John Walkenbach's books are! I am constantly amazed at the simplicity and &quot;elegance&quot; of his formulas and codes. I am a programmer by trade and have utilized the author's techniques to creat macros and spreadsheets that require minimal user attention and effort. Just yesterday I modified a weekly spreadsheet that originally took the user two hour to complete. The user now only has to spend one minute updating 15 cells and everything else (including charts and reference points) automatically updates! Contrary to one review's remark, the lack of the disc does not render the whole book useless. Most of the book covers one line formulas that requires minimal computer entry. Unless you want to copy some of the more complex macros, you won't need the disc!"},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"As an intermediate Excel user, I was comfortable with writing basic formulas, simple conditional formating, pivot tables, etc. I've been using Excel for ten years, and was very familiar with writing formulas in previous versions, but needed to brush up on 2000 in my new job.I read this book nearly non-stop, from cover to cover, almost as one would read a novel, instead of a text book. Walkenbach writes in a style that is understandable, and presents outstanding examples and tips which will definately take you to the next level. There are so many useful examples that this book is now permanently located within reach on my desk top.The section on using lookups, and the section on array formulas were very useful, as was the section included within working with databases and dealing with advanced filtering - which may give you techniques that are just short of amazing.Drawbacks: If you're a beginner to Excel, this may not be the best choice. Furthermore, the book is not always logically organized; it can be difficult to find that example that you KNOW was given, but don't know exactly where you saw it. Finally, the last three chapters on programming with VBA would have been better left to a whole seperate book, as there was only enough detail to add confusion (in fact, I believe this author has a book devoted to that)."},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"It's better than the usual 'reference bible'. You can tell the author had a real office job before this, as his examples actually made my office work easier, faster, and frankly, more fun. And it's quite readable. I thought I knew a lot of tricks before I bought this, but this book made me leapfrog many skill levels."},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"Assuming that you know the basics of Excel, this book presents methods to expand it to its fullest. With VBA you can just about do anything that a full blown language provides without having to write functions in languages like VB or C++. It provides many examples that will get you up and running fast. This is a great text for Excel developers."},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"As a mid-high experienced Excel user, I found this book to be a useful resource to round out my Excel knowledge with coherent and concise explanations of Excel formulas and useful examples. While I don't think this book is a great resource for the beginner, I think it is useful for anyone who's job requires them to use Excel anyhwere from 10 hours a week or more OR for experienced Excel users who want to round out their overall Excel knowledge.I particularly liked the author's ability to solve commonplace Excel logic problems with formula examples (i.e. finding the the number of unique experiences in a data set with a combination of clever formulas put together). His solutions and examples are clearly written and explained, particularly sections on dates and text manipulatios).Where I think the book has shortcomings is in its struggle to pull these great solutions out from the more basic instructional writings. I have, however, heard many great things about this author and look forward to reading other works by him."},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"I would personally rate this book as 5+ stars. The author gets right to the point in each chapter, the examples are easy and you also get real world applications. I would personally recomend it to anyone who is interested in going beyond the basic and most popular functions that Excel offers. The part that I enjoyed the most, and have gotten more use from, was Part V, dedicated to developing custom worksheet functions. What else can I say? It's a great book, one that will definitely not be lost high in a bookcase or stored away. This is the type of book you will always want to have near your desktop."},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"Walkenbach's book on formulas is terrific for the novice. I've been using it to explain the syntax of formulas that I have been working with over the past several months. His explanation of formulas, and how Excel works, has really enhanced my understanding of Excel and how to use its true power."},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"I do all my serious mathematical work with Mathematica. However most of my collegues use Excel for simple data presentation and analysis, so I've recently started using Excel to be able to converse with them.Since most of the elmentary things that one would do with Excel are fairly simple, Excel's built-in help capability is quite adaquate as a learning resource. However, as with any product, there are various useful tricks that go beyond the scope of vendor supplied documentation. This is where good books come in, as they can guide the user to a higher level of expertise. Because the reviews on Walkenbach's book were so uniformly good, I thought it would be a good place to get some deeper insights into Excel. Unfortunately I was quite disappointed.Indeed the book contains a wealth of useful examples, and for that reason I gave it two stars. The major problem with the book however, is that it does a very poor (and often non-existent) job of explaining why the examples work.A case in point is the example on page 402 which shows how to graph a function without populating values in a worksheet. There is a receipe in the text for accomplishing the task. However the receipe is so sketchy that I don't believe anyone would be able to produce a graph by just reading the text.Fortunately there is a working example on the CD that comes with the book. And more fortunately, the example can be easily modified to produce graphs of other functions. This is all very good! However Walkenbach does not explain why the example works. Moreover, he makes no attempt to explain the obscure functions (OFFSET, SUBSTITUTE, EVALUATE) which the example is based on. Thus all the reader is left with is a template for accomplishing a task. If he keeps the template around, he'll have something useful. But if he's asked to develop the template on his own, from material presented in the book, he will not be able to do so.The graphing example is not an isolated case in the book. Time and time again I found myself frustrated with poor explainations throughout the book -- which do not provide an understanding of why things work.Understanding why things work is extremely important because without such an understanding it is impossible to devise solutions to situations that one has not encountered before. Cookbook recipes are useful for producing tasty meals, but one cannot become a master chef without understanding the principles of cooking. Similarly, this book is at best a reasonable cookbook, but a very poor expository work."},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"If you only buy one book on Excel, this should be the one. If you are a low intermediate user (i.e. not brand new to it, but with a passing familiarity) up through seasoned Excel veteran, this book is a help. There are many hidden secrets in Excel. Do you know how to use Array formulas? Create Custom conditional formatting? Save time with Auto-functions? That Circular References can be a good thing? How to give cells names, then use names instead of cell references in your equations so they are easier to edit / understand (I.E. =(Cost of Goods Sold / Sales) vs. =(A1/C3)? How to use VBA to create the exact function you need? This book has it all, plus all the basics and hidden shortcuts (some not even published) I.E. Using CTRL+Shift+F9 to force recalculation.This book is extremely lucid and easy to understand. Every piece of information is supported by examples. I am a financial analyst and extremely experienced with Excel, yet this book is still helpful. It is almost a one-stop shop, seemingly lacking little. I also have an MBA. MBA's, buy this book BEFORE you by the MBA's Guide to Excel. I did it the other way around, and knowing what I know now, would not have purchased the Guide. In my opinion, anyone considering an Excel guide purchase, should purchase Excel 2000 Formulas first. It is much more than just a list of formulas. It is truly an excellent book, will save you time, effort, and frustration, and is an excellent value even at twice the price."},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"Being new to Excel I was constantly stumped on writing formulas for the various applications I was putting together.

Cover to cover (700+ pages)of well explained examples of every type of formula. Most useful software book I've ever had."},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"I already had a reputation at work as the Excel Wizard, so I was a little cautious about investing in a 'how-to' book on the subject. I have to say though, that Excel 2000 Formulas is worth every last cent and more. Even skimming through the early chapters, where I doubted I would find anything new, I chanced upon several easy tips I'd not known before.Excel 2000 Formulas is arranged in a simple-to-reference way and the page layout is excellent, giving easy-on-the-eye icon notes, references and tips. Even so, I quickly found myself grabbing a colored highlighter to pick out the bits that were important to me. The author also has a flowing style of writing so you don't feel you're working through a manual, It's more like a fun day out, with new discoveries on every page.Particulary interesting and useful was John Walkenbach's section on creating megaformulas. Though I was already familiar with the concept, and have used it to good effect at work, I found Walkenbach's methods even more concise and precise. In no time at all, you're building a relatively simple 229 character formula that does the work of 51 intermediary formulas. Not only is this more efficient and streamlined, it saves space in the workbook, thus making calculation quicker and more effective. Also of great value was the section on debugging formulas.VBA had always remained something of a mystery to me (excluding elementary macros) until I got stuck into 'Excel 2000'. Now (with a bit of prompting from John Walkenbach) I'm really getting the hang of it, and finding, again, that I can streamline my workbooks and impress my colleagues. I've already bought 'Excel 2000 Power Programming with VBA' by the same author, and look forward to improving my skills in this area.If ever there was a technical book that deserves more than five stars, this is it. If you need to improve your Excel skills, there's no other book you should consider - Excel 2000 Formulas has it all."},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"If you don't have this book by Walkenbach you are at a serious disadvantage when building Excel spreadsheets. That's the long and short of it. This book is an invaluable reference in building business models. I've been developing complicated spreadsheets for years and years, but this book shows tips and tricks I never dreamed of before. Well worth the money. From now on, if Walkenbach's name is on the cover, I shell out the money to get it. Absolutely outstanding. Never read anything better"},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"I am usually the guy who amazes his co-workers with Excel capabilities, and have used Excel from it's inception. The formulas books were always a good help... but THIS book simply amazed me! I didn't get past SECTION 1 without learning half a dozen things I could use immediately! I'm already &quot;scaring&quot; my managers with the things I've learned. Talk about impact! Well written, easy to understand examples, and thorough. If you want to stay on a simple level with Excel (or just a general overview) go for a less expensive book. BUT IF YOU WANT DETAIL (plenty of it here!) and &quot;comprehensive comprehension&quot; - this is what you're looking for."},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"I hesitated to buy this book, even though I knew the author to be an expert. (I have his Excel utility program, and I've seen him answer questions in Excel user groups.) Why did I feel uncertain? I had bought several large computer books over the past several years...and I found them difficult to understand and use. As a financial consultant, I had used a lot of financial functions. But I just couldn't see how to use much of the materials in those other books. I couldn't get the feel of them.&quot;Excel 2000 Formulas&quot; is far better than I had even hoped. Now I've find myself naturally using naming techniques, pivot tables (which are amazingly powerful and easy to use), simple and more complex lookups, arrays, and other tools that I'd never even worked with before. The CD-ROM that comes with the book lets me quickly and smoothly play with and understand the Excel tools that I'm learning.Only a few days after buying this book, I've already read, highlighted, and marked up this book. And benefited more than I could have imagined. I'm using Excel far more effectively...and at huge time savings."},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"As with most everyone who is frustrated with the pathetic state of OEM software doumentation, I buy a lot of computer books. Unfortunately, many books on the market may contain only 1 or 2 chapters of useful information; the remaining chapters essetially pap. Not too much different from musical CD's. On rare occasion I come across book that is well-crafted, coherent, and actually contains a lot of useful information. Excel 2000 Formulas is one of those books.I am quite competent in Excel but I still get stumped from time to time. This book has already provided me with new apporaches to old problems. I'll wear the cover off this book. Good job, Mr. Walkenbach!"},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"We use Excel extensively at work, but I always found using formulas in Excel to be much more difficult than, say, Quattro Pro or Lotus 1-2-3. Well, with this book in hand, I got farther in an hour than I have in months of haphazardly using Excel and the (hmm) help files. This book is NOT just about formulae--there is excellent background on Excel and a good introduction to some of the most central features, such as multiple worksheets and data entry tips.Excel is a powerful program and though you can set up a simple spreadsheet with little or no training, using the deeper functions becomes a bit complicated. This book helps you dip into more of the things Excel can do and which frankly are not well explained by the manual or the help files.We do a lot of charts and forecasts. I found the chapter on charting helpful. I also found a bunch of tips and tricks on naming cells that I hadn't used before (for example, I've named cells for charts but never for variables in a formula.)Having examples of formulae also saves a lot of time. Maybe the formula is not exactly one you need, but having one to start from sure helps.This book is a fantastic tutorial and really expanded my knowledge of Excel quickly. What's interesting about this book is that it also includes a history of Excel, starting with VisiCalc. I used VisiCalc when it first came out--and spreadsheets revolutionized what you could do on the earliest of PC's. The history section is wonderful reading --a nice thing to see in what could have been a dry subject. I think this could be classified as \\"the missing manual.\\" A must for anyone doing forecasting, math functions or anything more than basic Excel work."},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"As an intermediate user of Microsoft Excel, and new to the 2000 environment, I was fortunate enough to stumble upon John Walkenbach's Excel 2000 Formulas.

The examples in the book are simple to follow as well as duplicate on your own without having to spend countless hours recreating sample spreadsheets.

His instruction is very cogent; that cogency fosters an environment in which the reader is continually reminded of the concept that faulty assumptions several formulas back will pervert data which rely upon those faulty assumptions. If you can understand that concept intuitively as you design a spreadsheet--basically, if you can audit the logic and math of your spreadsheet--then you will go a long way with Excel (and other such applications of logic--be they programming, writing, etc.) In short, if you can focus on the rigor that Mr. Walkenbach applied to his book, then you can use that rigor in a variety of environments outside of Excel."},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"Although entertaining.. the production of this book was obviously very sloppy...Most of the text refers to an enclosed CD rom .. unfortunately the CD rom attached bears no relationship to the book.. and of course the Web site of the publisher and the author are let us say less than helpful."},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"JW did it again, every single one of his XL books is more than worth the price you pay.

It's not just a rehash of the help files.The book is intermediate level and is meant for study, not reference. If you're patient, and spend time with it, and you're not already an expert (i.e. you don't spend the majority of your day in Excel) then you'll benefit.I do have one small peeve. In both this book and his other VBA book, Walkenbach has actually encouraged people to use complex \\"megaformulas\\" that are in his words \\"impossible to decipher or modify\\" because other people will be impressed with your abilities. This is ridiculous. Experienced programmers whose work affects other people, understand that readability is critical. An intentional megaformula is akin to writing a whole program in one subroutine, and it separates a freshman wannabe from an educated developer. Walkenbach should know better than to encourage this."},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"The book is an excellent tool for expanding your knowledge in Excel. The text is easy follow and provides real world examples of how and when to use which formula.

Ever load a database that imports names in all caps, and you need it in upper/lower case? You could re-enter it manually, or you could use the &quot;PROPER&quot; function as described on p 94. This is not a book for beginners, but an essential resource for intermediate users who want to unlock advanced techniques and hidden features that should be better documented in Excel. Walkenbach has added a number of real-life examples of how to use these techniques (I did a lot of &quot;oh, so THAT'S how to do it,&quot; while reading); as a result, the information is not only thoroughly presented, but a pleasure to read (though I wouldn't wait for the movie)."},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Formulas","review":"Walkenbach did all the hard work to create these formulas.

They combine results of sociological surveys and studies with anecdotal evidence to paint an alarming picture odf societal breakdown directly attributable to the lack of a permanent father authority figure in the home whilst the welfare state treats individuals as more worthy of receiving welfare benefits than a traditional heterosexual married couple.Further the authors go on to link the breakdown of the family with the rising crime numbers and suggest that public policy be geared up to restoring the traditional family to the centre of the public policy agenda. They draw on evidence from other countries to give their case a more general flavour and to provide examples of policy actions.This is certainly an articulate and persuasive work which it is claimed gave new impetus to the UK Blair government to alter it's policies on welfare provision in this area whilst refraining from taking the whole step and reasserting the family as the centrality of their social policy agenda. They are wise in not doing so. To paraphrase Popper, a theory that explains everything explains nothing and in many ways their case seems too good to be true. The finer points of dispute I will leave to others but I wish to focus on one major point which the authors refer to specifically with which i am at odds.Throughout my years as a student of social policy I was always encouraged to be sceptical if not agnostic about cause and correlation in social science. My nose twitched rapidly when the correlation of rising crime and family breakdown from the 1950's was introduced. To me that period represents the implementation of the Keynsian consensus and the development of the age of affluence and the emergence of the consumer age in the aftermath of widespread economic destruction. I would personally place the time of family breakdown in the early 1960's when the introduction of the female contraceptive pill broke the link between sex and reproduction and enabled more married women to have their own careers, determine when they were ready and able to have children and allowed them the capacity to become more financially independent. However, I digress.The authors cite statistics indicating the rise in crime numbers and contrast these with statistics of crime when unemployment was at historic highs. The comparison is certainly a valid one, unemployment is not the main cause of crime but it is and can be a contributory factor. But then so can the government. For instance, if government makes some drugs legal say nicotine, but not others say heroin, it alters the way people behave. Suppliers can maximise profits through trafficking and have an incentive to get more people addicred thus boosting the demand for a drug already in short supply through legislative action. To finance their habit, addicts resort to petty theft, burglary, prostitution, fraud and others thus boosting the crime statistics. They are caught, fned and/or imprisoned and then return to their old ways if not helped. QED. Drug users are not confined to the lower income groups and are often to be found in the professional and managerial higher income groups where fathers are often to be found.So I am afraid that the analysis just will not do. The problem of socital brakdown is a much more complex issue which to me reflects a transition to an age of more family and lifestyle choices than we are used to where individuals, who after all should be the best people to choose their destiny, amke choices which the paternalistic conservatives of right and left may not like.John Lennon did not know his father as he was growing up, his mother was killed in an accident and he was raised by his aunt. His first marriage failed and during his second marriage he stayed at home, giving up a career worth millions to bring up his son with Yoko Ono. He did not turn his back on marriage or fatherhood but despite his lack of a traditional family upbringing he made choices about how to live his life with others. Surely the authors do not have the right to deny others the ability to make those choices?"},{"Title":"The Bible Code: Fact of Fake","review":"I read this book BEFORE 'The Bible Code'and it made me want to read the original.This is the only book I ever threw in the garbage the second I read the last word.

Only pick this one up if you have an open mind and enjoy living vicariously through alternative lifestyles. That being said, if you do enjoy taking a break from mainstream (aboveground) fiction, look no further.The collection provides a who's-who guide to some underground talents in the world of short fiction, online fiction, and novels. Nearly every story has a detailed author bio, providing background, contact information, and further reading. Some of the biographies are as rewarding as the stories themselves! For example, Gregg W. Boita [p. 64]: \\"Intelligent and subdued, he quietly mulls the fate of humanity once control is wrested from the powers that be into his own hands.

Published by noted British aviation publisher Ian Allen Publishing, and carried under the Aerofax imprint, this book is a must for your bookshelf.During the dark days of the cold war, Soviet war planners realized that the skies would be the key battleground for Germany. The MiG 23/27 FLOGGER series of aircraft provided the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies with a family of relatively inexpensive, fast, and capable aircraft that could serve in both the air defense/interceptor and the close air support/ground attack role, providing the iron punch believed necessary to push Soviet ground forces through NATO defenses.Designed in response to a Soviet Air Force requirement for a fighter/interceptor that could operate from a shortened runway, the FLOGGER began life as a FISHBED airframe with modified wings and lift fans behind the cockpit. Though not a STOVL aircraft, the lift fans were intended to shorten take-off and landing distances. Meeting with limited success, MIG redesigned the MiG-23 as a single engine, side air intake, variable geometry wing aircraft, similar to the American F-111 Aardvark design. Achieving first flight in 1967, the FLOGGER underwent several years of testing and development before entering into service in 1973. Though the definitive FLOGGER models were still several years away, its speed and short field capacity made it an important part of the Soviet and Warsaw Pact air forces. Possessing a fairly rudimentary ground attack capability, it was not until the MIG OKB was tasked with the development of a dedicated ground attack aircraft that the MiG-27 FLOGGER that was born. Originally MIG intended to create a new aircraft from scratch, but realized that modifying the existing MiG-23 airframe was a more effective solution than starting with a blank sheet of paper.With its 3-position variable geometry wings and R-35 afterburning engine, the FLOGGER was capable of achieving speeds over Mach 2. An internal twin 23-mm cannon and a weapons load of over 3000kg gave the aircraft a powerful punch, but its 620 nautical mile combat radius limited its employment and deployability. Though not a traditional dogfighter like the F-16, doctrinal use of FLOGGER utilized speed and numbers to strike fast and hard against NATO targets. The FLOGGER's low cost, ease of maintenance, and combat capability helped create considerable foreign interest, with over 18 different nations purchasing the type. The FLOGGER saw limited combat with Russian forces in Afghanistan, in a ground attack role, but never was called upon to fulfill its duties as a fighter, making it difficult to assess its place in aviation history. Though almost completely phased out of Russian and CIS inventories, the FLOGGER still flies today with air forces in Africa, the Middle East, and India.This volume is very similar to other Aerofax releases by Gordon in its structure and length. Delving into intricate detail, Gordon traces the lineage of the MiG-23 from its predecessors through to its successors. Every model of the 23 and 27 are discussed, with their differences highlighted and illustrated efficiently by judicious use of photographs. The 280 color and black and white photographs are drawn from Gordon's personal photography collection as well as the RSK-MIG photo archives. Gordon offers discussions of the FLOGGER in Soviet and Russian/CIS service, as well as detailing its significant export history.In 176 pages, Gordon delivers more detail than one can hope to process in a single sitting. The book reads smoothly and questions raised in the text are quickly answered. The photographs, three view diagrams, and color drawings of various paint schemes in this volume will be a huge benefit to modelers, and the extraordinary attention to detail will benefit both enthusiasts and professionals. When it comes to aviation, you simply can't go wrong with the Aerofax series. Yefim Gordon is considered the best for a reason, and this new volume demonstrates once again that he is the worldwide authority on the topic. This is a welcome addition to the collection and is highly recommended.A.G.

I have closely observed the MiG 27 of the Indian AirForce at Nasik and at an Air show in Mumbai. I wish i had more information on the Mig-23/27 with photographs and 5 view colour drawings / markings.After searching the Net i decided to buy the Book by Yefim Gordon on Mig-23/27.The author has described the aircrafts in detail with rare black and white photos of the MiG-23. The author has also covered the deployment part well. At the end 5 view line drawings ,colour drawings of Mig-23 BN, Mig-23 UM ,Mig-23 ML and Mig-27 M have been included which is useful for an aeromodeller. However 3 views have been restricted to aircraft of Russian Air Force markings. A few more coloured 3 views would have made an aeromodeller happy.Cutaway drawings have not been included. I wish cutaway drawings with details should have been included in the book.Overall the reading is interesting. People crazy about MiGs should buy this book."},{"Title":"MiG-23/27 Flogger: Soviet Swing-Wing Fighter / Strike Aircraft (Aerofax)","review":"An excellent history of this Soviet-era fighter/fighter bomber.

I feel like it was maybe 8 years ago or so... i was 17 (i think, by looking at the publication date). I don't even remember where i got it. Did i buy it? A gift?I just remember loving this book. It's the story of 2 unlikely people to date... by unlikely, i mean people from different \\"sides of the tracks.\\" I remember being enthralled by their romance (and by some sexy scenes in which they do some things in a car).Kevin Canty's new book \\"Honeymoon and Other Stories\\" came out not too long ago. I manage in a book store and didn't even realize that it was the same author, and picked it up when i noticed how many copies i was selling and after selling one to a musician i like.Then when i went to my mother's house for X-mas, i rediscovered \\"Into the Great Wide Open\\" on my childhood bookshelf and remember loving it. So not i'm really excited to read \\"Honeymoon\\" and to re-read \\"Into...\\"This is a book you can read and re-read. I think Kevin Canty definately knows how to tell a story!"},{"Title":"Into the Great Wide Open","review":"I read a review of this book in a magazine and decided to go out and buy it. That was about a year and a half ago, and i've read it at least a dozen times. It is an amazing book, and I would recommend it to everyone between the ages of 14 and 20. Into the Great Wide Open is the tragically sad and moving story of Kenny and Junie, seventeen and in love. Of course, as with all young love, there are obstacles: Junie's &quot;problem&quot;, Kenny's alcoholic father and institutionalized mother, and the world that Kenny knows will take Junie away from him. This book made me cry a lot and laugh a little, but most of all, it made me think about what a fragile gift love is. Kevin Canty made me feel everything Kenny felt as if I was in the story. I have never read a book that lets us into the mind and heart of the character as much as Into the Great Wide Open does. It is a beautifully written tale with the univeral theme: &quot;Why must I be a teenager in love?&quot;"},{"Title":"Into the Great Wide Open","review":"I am in love with Kenny Lolodny. You get inside his head and don't want to leave. He has situations he is forced to deal with which are much more difficult than most teenagers face, but any I think any teen can relate to Kenny in some way or another. I would recommend it to any teenager and to anyone searching for a heart- capturing story."},{"Title":"Into the Great Wide Open","review":"This is the fist book were I was compelled to underline passages and mark pages, to go back and read again and again. Canty has a wonderful rhythem to his writing, and delivers eliquent prose that reads like poetry. An overall literary masterpiece that shows off Canty's intellect and insight. The only caution I have is that the material may be a bit mature for early teenagers."},{"Title":"Into the Great Wide Open","review":"After many friends and I read this book you obtain anunderstanding of growing up in the nineties. You never reallygrasp the hardships young adults must face in order to gainacceptance. This book was truely remarkable and gave a truedefinition of two teenagers in love. I would recommend thisbook to anyone, boy or girl, who is growing up now and hasever had an experience with falling in love."},{"Title":"Into the Great Wide Open","review":"_Into The Great Wide Open_ is the literary equivalent ofthe Big Star song &quot;Thirteen&quot;: a lyrical, heartrending, yetdisturbing tale of one boy's passion. I found myselffalling in love with Kenny Kolodny and I couldn't decidewhich was worse: that I felt drawn to someone so troubled,or that he was a fictitious character. (In fact, Cantydepicts Kenny so richly that the other characters--includingKenny's beloved Junie--cannot help but seem somewhat flat incomparison.) The turns of phrase are immediately striking,yet seem completely unforced. This novel shocks me and tearsat my soul. I find myself unable to escape its clutches."},{"Title":"Into the Great Wide Open","review":"This tedious book is about two touchy, humorless, ultra-delicate teenagers constantly taking offense at each other, then apologizing, and then criticizing themselves for apologizing. In a way, though, this reflects the &quot;samsara,&quot; the Buddhist cycle of endless misery, to which the author makes reference several times. The main character, Kenny, sometimes wants to get off the cycle, but not half as bad as we want to get out of this book. This is a retrospective story, told by the adult Kenny. Unfortunately, the adult Kenny's voice mingles with the teenage Kenny's implausibly. For example, what teenager, however smart, would think, &quot;it's better to regret what you have done than what you haven't?&quot; Kenny does a lot of this kind of cogitating. That's the adult Kenny talking, but we don't have a firm enough grip on the adult Kenny to know who's who. This is a serious structural problem. Sometimes telling undermines the showing: &quot;The lake... dark gray... with dark purple shades... This landscape looks depressed.&quot; We don't need to be told it looks depressed. If this review seems harsh and overly &quot;judgmental,&quot; just try spending some time with Kenny. The only difference between me and him is that I'm not apologizing!"},{"Title":"Into the Great Wide Open","review":"Maybe I'm too old and can't relate to teenagers anymore...but I'm only 31 so I don't think that's it. I do remember what it was like to be a teenager, and even with the many issues I went through, I still can't completely relate to the two main characters (Kenny, Junie) in this book. If anything, it gave me a new perspective.The one thing that I thought was the weirdest was that a man wrote this book. This book reads female all over it. I have a really hard time thinking a 17 or 18-year old male would have the thoughts and feelings that Kenny had. It just doesn't read correctly to me.I did think the book had merit. Not quite sure what merit, but it was well-written, entertaining, funny at times and bittersweet. More bittersweet than anything else. First loves are like that."},{"Title":"Into the Great Wide Open","review":"This book is not hiding anything. Even the sexual content is realistic. It's about strange and confusing world of love with 2 kids that live in different worlds but come together to share there love. I recommend this book to older teens and adults."},{"Title":"Into the Great Wide Open","review":"Holden Caulfield, move over. Kenny is the 90's. Although one teen reader told me he was bothered by how casually Kenny could walk away from his father, the overall report from today's youth is that Canty speaks for them."},{"Title":"Into the Great Wide Open","review":"Kevin Canty's work is a flickering greenish fluorescent bulb over head. I love it."},{"Title":"Into the Great Wide Open","review":"Read this book. It describes everything you couldn't when you first realized that love wouldn't save you from becoming less than you had hoped you'd become - from the monumental boredom of adulthood. The story stays with you long after you've finished it - in the same way Canty's protagonist is haunted by the feeling that the truest part of himself was in someone else, and entirely behind him. If you read books to be changed by them this one won't disappoint you. It's a gift from Kevin Canty."},{"Title":"Into the Great Wide Open","review":"Canty's lyrical style and raw emotional text made me yearn for more of this book. I was completely absorbed and in awe of the authentic characters, Kenny and Junie. This is a must read - anyone who had a first young love will be compelled by the reality of Canty's emotional language. He beautifully puts into words the thoughts and feelings one had at that tender age. I liked the way that the book didn't neatly tie up all the loose ends or answer all the questions about the characters. It leads one to form one's own judgement. I have recommended this book to all my friends."},{"Title":"Into the Great Wide Open","review":"While it took me a little while to get into the characters, I grew to care about Kenny and Junie. Junie was annoying at first, with her insecurites and her &quot;come here, go away&quot; attitude. Actually, she was rather annoying through the whole novel. But the book is a successful first attempt and did bring back many of the emotions and fears that I recall from my own intense high school romance."},{"Title":"Into the Great Wide Open","review":"I read &quot;Into the Great Wide Open&quot; about three months ago. At the time, I wasn't sure if I liked it, and I could tell that Canty was a first-time novelist. Some of the rambling psychoanalyzation of the protagonist, Kenny, is heavy-handed and obvious, and the character of Junie is a little vague. But I have found in recent weeks that this little book sticks oddly in my head. Kenny is one of the most acute, real teenagers since Holden Cauflield. He's a decent kid in a set of bad circumstances, and for me he has turned into one of the more memorable fictional characters I've encountered in some time. One other little note: as an aficionado of &quot;coming-of-age&quot; novels, it was nice to see one set in the present day. I was starting to think that only teenagers in the '50s and '60s had meaningful adolescent experiences."},{"Title":"Into the Great Wide Open","review":"This is a great book for teenagers to relate to the struggles of teen relationships. Although, it seems that Kenny has become hoplessly envovled with someone who doesn't care, your heart will clench to the hope in his voice as he will not let it slip away so easily. This novel portrays a virtue that should be in everyone's hearts...&quot;there are to many mediocure things in life to deal with and love should not be one of them, anything less than extrondinary is a waste of time.&quot;-Dream for an Insomniac"},{"Title":"Into the Great Wide Open","review":"I can't find the words to describe this book. If you're big into the teenage dream of obsessions, manipulations, and inevitable consequences, you'll adore this book. Canty has a knack for holding your attention. Kenny's life is filled with the sorrows of living and he goes in search of happiness. You are drawn into his poetic thoughts, and you will see the beauty in life. If you are looking for a Fairy Tale, this is not your story. There are some graffic moments but what is a good story without them. If the real world begs your attendence, come on in. This one is a keeper. For reference of raw thoughts, reality, and passion."},{"Title":"Into the Great Wide Open","review":"This book is actually based on a character from one of the short stories in Canty's collection. When Kevin first meets Junie, there's so much uncertainty about her, and it's just like the start of a dynamic relationship in real life - it keeps you on the edge of your seat, wondering if he's &quot;in&quot; or not. Laced with the problems of his alcoholic father vs. trying to relate with her Martha Stewart-like mother, it drove the plot and made it impossible to put the book down. Although slightly unbelievable in places, the book continues like this, and I always wondered if she was going to stay or go. The ending is much of the same - it's hard to talk about how excellent it was without giving it away, but reading the book tore the feeling out of me, and reminded me of my own youth. It's hard to put down, and aside from the plot, contains lots of excellent writing. If you like this book, make sure to check out his short stories - also a 10."},{"Title":"Into the Great Wide Open","review":"I read this book when I was twelve. Only because I thought I was the most mature girl in the world. That was a laugh, but this book changed my view of love forever. I learned to appreciate love and to hold on to it more tightly. This book is absolutely amazing. Canty wrote a piece of pure genious. This book is definitely NOT for a twelve year old, but from anyone 14 and older. Its... there are no words to describe it. Its that good."},{"Title":"Into the Great Wide Open","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I got the book from a cousin, and I began to read it to my girlfriend every night over the phone. It was one of the most beautiful works that I've ever read. The funny thing was, the calmness of the book, combined with my voice, plus the time of night I usually read to her, and I ended up with her falling asleep alot.

For me it is like the general public's introduction to memory - but would also be a great read for a keen undergrad entering psychology. It goes over a lot of the key concepts in psychology (memory oriented) and provides and spin that the reader can relate to the concept under discussion.Memory from a broader perspective (see link below) would make a good accompaniment to this book, again for the same audience. For a softer introduction into memory see Seven Sins of Memory (see link below).Memory from a Broader PerspectiveThe Seven Sins of Memory: How the Mind Forgets and Remembers"},{"Title":"The Aristocrats","review":"I bought this book at a library sale. At first (chapter 1 and 2) I thought I would not finish it as it was not grabbing my attention. By the time I did finish it I was sorry it ended.

So it was with enthusiasm that I purchased \\"Reality Is What You Can Get Away With,\\" particularly after seeing the glowing Amazon.com reviews. However, I was disappointed with this book in general. Oh sure, it had humor in a kind of over the top sort of way (although I know that RAW strived for more than humor in the book). But I didn't find that it tremendously \\"expanded my reality.\\" Maybe that's because I've been in the \\"human potential,\\" and \\"freedom\\" movements for decades. So what RAW writes in \\"Reality\\" was not all that shocking, mindblowing or new to me. The book is actually written as a screenplay and perhaps would translate better into the video, rather than the written, medium.One more thing: based on the reviews of RAW's work I had expected him to be as libertarian as you could find. But there is a passage in \\"Reality,\\" where he tosses insults at the U.S. because, among other things, it doesn't have a \\"national health plan.\\" How could anyone who has even the slightest knowledge of economics, society and reality in general really believe that establishing a \\"national health plan\\" would, rather than destroying a large part of any economy (as Medicare & Medicaid have already done), bring a slice of utopia into society?"},{"Title":"Reality is What You Can Get Away with","review":"My friend William Kevin Burke said that after he read the Schrodinger's Cat trilogy, and I would say it of every book Robert Anton Wilson ever wrote. We live in a world where most people can't really call themselves particularly wise (and know it) while a few so-called leaders pretend to be wise; the truly wise number but a handful and often go unrecognized. Even among the wise handful Wilson has few peers. When very young I thought the grownups really understood what was going on: Wilson, that rare bird, actually seems to. I want to see him win a Nobel. RAW's writing often carries so much meaning that one understands only a little at the first reading (I didn't feel I had really mined Schrodinmger's Cat until about the fifth reading. If such depth seems intimidating, would you rather read five shallow, insipid books once? Besides, he runs an easy installment plan: laugh now, understand later.) RAW wrote &quot;Reality Is What You Can Get Away With&quot; as a film script, but it hasn't made it onto a movie screen yet. One may hope, however: modern technology has made it easier to put even the most fantastic visions onscreen quite cheaply, assuming one HAS a vision to communicate. He has."},{"Title":"Reality is What You Can Get Away with","review":"Please note that ratings for the above book lower than five five-pointed stars will not be encouraged.

His introduction is priceless.The remainder of the book, the script itself, is creative but is really just a compendium of things RAW has said before in other books. Because of the conceit of the script he is working within, he usually says it better where it first appeared. Also, it is a product of its time - 1992 - and the timely nature of his political quips (Quayle) seem dated even now.Discordians and Subgenii will definitely want to find this book, as both religions are repeatedly mentioned and illustrated."},{"Title":"Reality is What You Can Get Away with","review":"Hard to find and fun to read, another addicting tale by Anton-Wilson.

Any B.S. artist worth a grain of sand can learn a thing or two about the fine art of deception to convince one that this is art and it really is and it just might actually mean something but Im sure RAW is just yanking our chain here to use a colloquialism. And that equates with pulling the wool over our eyes. Its getting us to buy that myth and bite on the manipulation--a zen masterpiece in the Western sense. So I can not rank it with Dostoevski or Nietzsche but graded on a curve I would give it an A and so what if I lied--the ends sanctify the means in 9 out of every 13 cases and I will not remind one that RAW backwards is WAR and the assault on our senses is well designed and intentionally taken (and delivered) with a smile.

Other more famous titles like Torenbeek(1981) and Roskam(1985,I don't yet have the 2002 version) are mostly outdated.However, by comparison Civil Jet Aircraft Design is trying a bit too hard to simplify the many very sophisticated decision-making activities involved in the design process of a modern jet transport. Oftentimes the examples included are too simple or based on references not clearly cited in the text. The chapter on wing design and aerodynamics are so unreasonably simplified that they are of no use for someone doing even a small-scale course project. Many assumptions are made without any explanation and leave the reader completely to his own devices.After thoroughly studying this book as well as other titles in this field, such as Torenbeek,Roskam,Raymer's aircraft design conceptual approach,Denis Howe's aircraft conceptual design synthesis,etc, during my graduate study I think this book with its minimum mathematical content is suitable for those who seek a casual look into the world of modern jet transport design and those who,like me, are studying aircraft design and in dire need of a comprehensive collection of related titles.By the way, if you plan to actually apply the formulae found in the book, beware that fatal mistakes and typos are not uncommon. The Wing Weight formulae and the Takeoff ground roll formulae are the most noticeable two. If you have a professional interest in aircraft design, be sure to always do the mathematical deductions yourself."},{"Title":"Civil Jet Aircraft Design","review":"The best book of its type I have ever read.

Not only does it have just the right amount of mystery, suspense, and romance, but it also deeply touched my heart and helped me to give more of myself to the Lord. You will be blessed by her writing!"},{"Title":"The Awakening (Seven Sisters, Book 2)","review":"The Awakening is the second in the Seven Sisters series, which tells the stories of seven college friends. However, it can easily be read as a stand-alone novel, as there is a 'Cast of Characters' in the front of the book.Kim Lan Lowery is a half-American, half-Vietnamese supermodel who has risen from a background of poverty to being a rich, independant woman who is engaged to a heart-throb movie star. As a Christian who is seeking to develp her relationship with God, Kim Lan is challenged by a presentation at her parent's church, and feels led to undertake a short-term mission to Vietnam. But sparks quickly fly when Mick O'Donnel, the trip co-ordinator, refuses to consider her because of her fame. While this conflict is quickly resolved, another arises in the form of a 'secret admirer' whose gifts soon turn threatening. Meanwhile, Mick and Kim Lan have to consider where their relationship might be leading - particularly given Kim Lan's fiancee.This, to me, is the best kind of Christian romance fiction. It has two lead characters, each with a strong relationship with God but who still make mistakes but are able to learn from them and develop in their Christian faith as the story progresses. The change in point-of-view from Mick/Kim Lee to the 'secret admirer' was clear-cut, and did not interfere with the story. The Awakening has a solid cast of characters, a bit of suspence and a good dose of romance without being corny or cloying, and, most importantly, it felt real and authentic. No doubt this was because several of the Vietnamese scenes were drawn straight from the author's own experiences in visiting Vietnam to adopt a child.This book will suit those who like Christian romance with a real Christian focus, unlike much of the genre which merely excludes bad language and sensual scenes.

This book is not for CCNA wannabe's, cause it doesn't include Catalyst 1900 Series. Besides, you should know Cisco Switching before attempting to read this book. This book is more help on your day to day Cisco Catalyst administration job.This book beats Cisco LAN Switching (CCIE Professional Development). It covers those topics that Cisco LAN Switching lacks - from Switch Functionality, SE Configuration, creating VLANs & Trunking, STP, Multilayer Switching, to QOS. More examples than LAN Switching.This book, together with the Cisco Routers for IP Routing Little Black Book (by: Innokenty Rudenko) and Remote Access for Cisco Networks (by: William Burton and Bill Burton), your daily administration of Cisco devices will be easy as you have never imagined. Of course you need at least a CCNA Advanced Level or a CCNP level to use these three books.I'm a CCNP/CCDA supporting Internet Data Centre / Internet Service Provider Core Routers/Distribution Switches/Access Switches and I found that this book is valuable to my daily administration tasks. I highly recommend this book for Cisco Catalyst administrators."},{"Title":"Cisco Field Manual: Catalyst Switch Configuration","review":"I am a network engineer and use the Catalyst 2900, 2950, 3500 and the 4000's on a daily basis. We do a lot of VLAN configurations, trunking using 801.q, static port access, along with other various switch configs. This book has been indispensable for my daily routines. There has not once been an instant where I couldn't find the answer to what I was trying to accomplish when configuring a Cisco Catalyst Switch. This also gives you the commands for COS and IOS and also tells you which switch supports what and which switch doesn't (example: the Catalyst 2950 supports 801.q by default, where others support ISL by default). I highly recommend this book for all your switching administrative needs."},{"Title":"Cisco Field Manual: Catalyst Switch Configuration","review":"In becoming a CCNA and CCDA I had to study switches and switching techniques, both of which are covered very well in most study guides. What seems to be missing is coverage, extensive coverage, of switch configuration and management, that's why this book is so important.The authors take a specific subject, the Catalyst Switch, and break it down to the lowest level. They give extremely detailed information about the switches, from the 2950 series to the 600 series, from configuration for both layer 2 and 3, to VLANs, VTP, STP, multicasting and access control.Leaving virtually no stone unturned the authors have taken area of Cisco certification and made it the focus of study. What I found most impressive was the real world examples, coupled with coding screen shots, so you can see what things look like rather than have to guess.Overall this book can work for the CCNA, CCDA and CCNP Switching exams. Cisco Press needs to add this to the Preparation and Certification libraries for the exams as well."},{"Title":"Cisco Field Manual: Catalyst Switch Configuration","review":"This manual has easy to follow steps and explanations for programming of Catalyst switches. It covers commands for both CatOS and IOS."},{"Title":"Cisco Field Manual: Catalyst Switch Configuration","review":"CiscoPress's \\"Cisco Field Manual: Catalyst Switch Configuration\\" by Hucaby and McQuerry is a very strong attempt at documenting the configuration implementations of Cisco switches. Any Cisco Switching book is going to need to make a decision as soon as the first page - and that is how best to document the two separate and totally different versions of Cisco Catalyst operating systems - COS and OS. This book takes a different tact - and one that I think works very well. Instead of splitting up the two OS domains and describing each in their own respective sections - the authors have decided to show how to implement both types of commands at the same time. This little difference is profound in the way it helps demonstrate the use of each command and eliminates redundancy found in other all-in-one switching books.It is important to note that this is not a Switching-101 book. You definitely need a decent understanding of the various subjects - Spanning-Tree Protocol (STP), Virtual-Trunking Protocol (VTP), etc... The book does a good job at discussing the different implementations of Vlans and Trunking (Chapter 6).One reassuring item to note is that I did not find any typos in the book. I have used this book while studying for my CCIE R&S; lab (I think a lot of CCIE candidates forget that the \`S' in R&S; stands for Switching). I have also used this book for real-world implantations. I feel the utilitarian value of this book is much higher than Hucaby and McQuerry's similar book on Router configuration.I give this book 4 pings out of 5:!!!.!"},{"Title":"Cisco Field Manual: Catalyst Switch Configuration","review":"The author has put together a very clear and concise book which is essential for engineers.

But this is a very close second. \\"No Ordinary Time\\" is a brilliantly written, information-packed book that provides great insight into the FDR White House and the minds of both Franklin and Eleanor.\\"No Ordinary Time\\" covers the Roosevelts from 1940-45, focusing primarily on how they handled the home front during America's involvement in World War II. It was interesting to learn about Eleanor's deep commitment to civil rights, how polarizing a figure she was throughout the country, and her influence on the president.I was also very intrigued by the relationships between both Roosevelts and their friends and family. Goodwin occasionally breaks from the time period of the book to cover important moments in their lives pre-1940. FDR's affair with Lucy Rutherfurd, and the rekindling of their relationship in his last years, through the help of his daughter, is fascinating.If I have one criticism -- and it's a stretch -- it would be that Goodwin sometimes gets bogged down in numbers, such as statistics about war production -- the amount of planes, tanks, guns, etc., that were produced and/or shipped to England and Russia. But while those sections may have somewhat slowed the progress of the book, they were important to the story she was telling.So I consider this a 5-star book. I know Goodwin justifiably received criticism a few years ago due to some plagiarism in a previous book, but few, if any, historians combine research and writing as effectively as she does.

Bravo!"},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"My parents and their generation grew up during the Depression and WWII, and said that Franklin Roosevelt was the difference with his upbeat attitude and sound leadership, giving the country the confidence needed to overcome all obstacles. He was not afraid to lead and take chances, they told me, and was for them the most revered patriot in the history of our country.I finally decided to read a book that might give me some perspective on this. Were my parents right in their assessment, or was this mythological thinking, making something better in retrospect than it was in real time?So I turned to this carefully researched and crafted, and Pulitzer Prize winning account of that time, \\"No Ordinary Time\\". The book found FDR to be complex, charming, hard-to-know, optimistic, resilient, crafty, and ruthless when necessary; in other words, FDR was a master politician. His vision and timing were impeccable and he was fearless, as he navigated the stormiest waters of the 20th century. I found him, by this book's account, to justify the admiration of my parents, even with 60 to 70 years perspective.Doris Kearns Goodwin gives us a stroll through his life, stopping here and there to go into the history of an event or the background of a key person. It was a little bit soap opera with the various relationships FDR and Eleanor had, not only with each other, but with others they loved. She and Franklin had parted intimate ways just after WWI because of an extended affair FDR had with a certain Lucy Mercer, and so they both sought intimacy elsewhere. It seems that none of the relationships were sexual, including, of course, the one between FDR and Eleanor; and at least one was a lesbian affair. FDR and Eleanor truly loved each other, but it's a mystery how they kept their marriage going. Their relationship is one of the most important mysteries of American political history, as they both put together patched-up personal lives to compensate for the failed marriage.All of this proves that the President and his First Lady were very human and depended on each other. For the crippled Franklin, Eleanor was his eyes and ears to what was really going on throughout the country; and for Eleanor, it was a way of pressing for her social concerns. In fact, her efforts sowed some of the seeds that fomented the Civil Rights movement in the 60's.Franklin was very good at keeping his own counsel, and hardly ever showed his hand until he announced a decision. Also, he took chances, especially in supplying England early in the war when our resources at home were almost completely decimated by the Depression. He was able to pump up production of war materials in the US to record levels, by navigating the tricky waters between unions and big business. (In fact, the book says that our production, more than our military manpower, was the reason we won the War.) He was able to bring out our best. He was also adept at dealing with our allies, notably the great but high-strung Churchill, and the mysterious and deadly Stalin.Eleanor was also truly remarkable. She was tireless in her liberal causes for the under-classes (women, minorities, the poor) and set a standard for First Ladies that has never been equaled. She was better with crowds, making speeches, than one-on-one, and had a more difficult time with personal relationships. She did not seem to be able to reveal her true self even to those closest to her. That said, you couldn't help but be impressed with her tireless drive and dedication. The Presidency would not have been as successful if not for her.I can't imagine the amount of research that went into this book. Doris Kearns Goodwin deserved the Pulitzer Prize for it. It was a great read about a great subject.FDR and Eleanor were no ordinary couple!"},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin's book &quot;No Ordinary Time&quot; about FDR &amp; Eleanor is a fine piece of writing that certainly belongs in anyone's American History library. Of course it is World History, but it is written from a very American perspective and thereby manages to relegate even Churchill to the wings.There is a degree of nearly strident feminism in the writing, not quite what one would call shrill, but the author's sympathies seem to lean decidedly toward Mrs. Roosevelt, often based on issues of sexual inequality. To be fair, Ms. Kearns Goodwin is about as harsh in her handling of racial prejudiceand anti-semitism, both cases where FDR used Eleanor as a lightening rod.What emerges is nonetheless what most sources reveal: he was the instinctive politician who happened to be in the right place at the right time to make magic happen while she was a tireless social activist more in tune with the masses than with any one person. He could bend his principles when needed (either for the greater good of the whole or on occasion for his own selfish indulgences) whereas she was quite rigid and nearly incapable of intimacy.One can (or should) hardly judge them. It is enough to appreciate their complexity and their contrasts and to see how they played off one another so well. The real beauty of this book is that it allows us to do just that quite completely."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"This book is beautifully written. It is a deeply researched historical work that leaves the reader thirsting to continue reading it until s/he has reached the last page.

I particularly enjoyed Goodwin's portrayal of Eleanor Roosevelt. This book is further strengthened by Goodwin's empathetic treatment of issues related to Jews and the Holocaust, Blacks and integration, and women and the job market.

The book brings the reader through events in the White House during the end of the Great Depression and through WWII. I never knew that Franklin died with his mistress from almost 30 years before at his side or that the US had virtually no army c. 1940, or what exactly \\"lend-lease\\" was. Eleanor comes off as a bit unreadable. She seemed ot delight in asserting her independence from Franklin, yet she taunted him with her distance in a way that it is hard to imagine a woman of her intelligence and courage doing. Franklin's long-time secretary, Missy LeHand, may or may not have had an affair with the president, but that doesn't really matter. After she has a stroke Franklin changes his will to leave 1/2 his estate to her, and cuts his children out (it was worth approximately $3M), but effectively never speaks with her again. Read this book if you love history, or a great story--it's both. The courage of the American and British people comes through in a heartbreaking way. The genesis of the American Civil Rights movement and the feminist movement are intereting to witness and seem to owe a great deal to Eleanor. On the downside the blatant anti-semitism of the US, and, unfortunately, the Roosevelts, is shocking. It's hard to believe that these events happened only 60 years ago. It was truly another world."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin has written a delicious, comprehensive biography of the Roosevelts from a slightly differnt perspective than the other umpteen-hundred Roosevelt biographers. This angle gave her the luxury of devoting a lot of space (and thus, detail) to developing her interpretation of their relationship &quot;on the home front&quot; in World War II. Whether you are liberal, conservative, Republican, or Democrat, you will absolutely devour this book and form a generally favorable (and well deserved) impression of both key players. Eleanor was entirely duty-driven, obsessive in pursuing and championing her interests, thoroughly selfless, and a towering figure of the early 1940's. In Ms. Goodwin's pages you will see how crucial Mrs. Roosevelt was to her husband politically, particularly at the 1940 Democratic Convention. Her relationship with FDR was complicated, to say the least, and Ms. Goodwin does a marvelous job in making the reader understand exactly what that relationship was, and why it not only worked, but (in a way) actually florished.

NO ORDINARY TIME---FRANKLIN AND ELEANOR ROOSEVELT: THE HOME FRONT IN WORLD WAR II really should be called FRANKLIN AND ELEANOR on THE HOME FRONT IN WORLD WAR II or FRANKLIN AND ELEANOR: THE WHITE HOUSE IN WORLD WAR II.Except for a few brief passages, this book doesn't address \\"the home front in World War II\\" unless it is to highlight how Franklin, Eleanor and their White House coterie affected or were affected by domestic political and social concerns. Ordinary people don't appear very often in NO ORDINARY TIME. To get a sense of the home front, the reader needs to go elsewhere, such asThe War: An Intimate History, 1941-1945.Having said that, this is an excellent history of Eleanor, Franklin and their White House both before and during the War Years. Kearns Goodwin does her usual exhaustive job of researching every bit of material she can find from the period, and she does her usual more than excellent job in coalescing it all into a very readable entirety.Some readers might take issue with Kearns Goodwin's pronounced Interventionist/New Deal sympathies (I'm not one of them, but it would be interesting to see what an Isolationist Anti-New Deal historian would make of the same material). As far as this reader is concerned, the outcome of World War II and the prosperity of Postwar America speak clearly as to the positive impact these people had.It is clear that the Roosevelts were in a constant state of evolution during these years. Eleanor, who once described an evening with Bernard Baruch as a \\"Jew party\\" became an indefatigable proponent of allowing Jewish refugees into the country (this was forestalled by the notoriously anti-Semitic Breckinridge Long, who was convinced that all Jews were Communists and managed to convince FDR that German Fifth Columnists would use an Open Door policy to slip into the country en masse). Likewise, Eleanor went from referring to African-Americans as \\"Pickaninnies\\" to inviting them as active participants to White House dinners and conferences; in the 1940s she fought valiantly for them to receive equal pay and equal work in war-related industries and military service.The President's evolution was less pronounced, primarily because of his need to navigate a political tightrope. A consummate politician, he knew how to horsetrade and carefully balance what he wanted with what he could accomplish. This sometimes led him to seemingly cynical stances (as with the Jewish refugee problem and his equivocal stand on allowing Blacks to have an equal status as combat soldiers in the War). It also led him to be coy to the point of enraging (he nearly lost his third term nomination because he intentionally refused to declare his candidacy until the eleventh hour and fifty ninth minute), and devious (his intense desire to help the Allies in 1940 caused him to outmaneuver an often recalcitrant and reactionary Congress with Presidential fiats that often turned his Constitutional powers into Turkish Taffy).Overall, Eleanor and Franklin worked together wonderfully in a political and personal partnership that had both ceased being and transcended a traditional marriage. Having discovered FDR's infidelity in 1918, Eleanor, the niece of President Theodore Roosevelt, built her own public life thereafter. FDR led a largely separate life, particularly after his life-altering battle with Polio (or perhaps Guillain-Barre Syndrome). They most frequently lived separately and traveled in different circles.FDR took a mistress, his \\"personal secretary,\\" Missy LeHand, who lived in the White House with the Roosevelts. Eleanor maintained a pied-a-terre in New York which she shared with several close female friends; her sexual orientation is a matter of debate. But neither abandoned the other. He trusted her judgement implicitly and often followed her advice in national and international matters. Eleanor acted as FDR's eyes and ears as she traveled throughout the nation taking stock of the conditions under which the citizenry lived. She thus often acted as his conscience when he developed New Deal programs and other policies. He often asked her to speak for him in public venues. Though he might be muzzled politically, his wishes and wants and ideas became known to the public through her. By and large, the American people looked upon the Roosevelts as their \\"friends in high places.\\"FDR was able to use this vast political capital to ready the nation for war. Throughout 1940, he chipped away at his own anti-business New Deal stances in order to promote rearmament. He was able to pass a Conscription law with broad public support (imagine Americans in favor of being drafted!) And though he kept insisting, \\"I hate war!,\\" it was clear he was snatching this time to ready the nation for what was becoming an inevitability. Regardless of what his critics might say, FDR saw that the European War was growing, threatening to engulf the United States willy-nilly, and he was frightened (there is no other word) that the U.S. would face the Axis with a miniscule Air Corps, an undermanned Navy, and only five Army Divisions supplied with remnant weapons of World War I vintage. It should be remembered that Germany, forced to disarm in 1918, had rearmed to the teeth on her own volition with the most modern weapons in the world. Indeed, the German Blitzkrieg was so effective in large part because the defending Allies could not match Germany's homegrown armaments industry.America was slow to respond. Isolationists, led by notables such as Charles Lindbergh, fought FDR's initiatives tooth and nail. Less vituperatively but more effectively, American industry chose to continue producing consumer goods, slowing the ramping-up process as limited resources were allocated between toasters and tanks. Management blamed labor for the delays, and labor blamed management, forcing the Federal Government to take a very active stance in resolving production disputes.1941 was a watershed year, not only because of Pearl Harbor but because of Hitler's massive invasion of the U.S.S.R., the expansion of Lend-Lease, and the sudden and total shift of the U.S. from a peace footing to a war footing. After December 7, all consumer auto production stopped cold. The 600,000 1941 models in showrooms and on assembly lines were bought up by the Government to be used for military or crucial service purposes, being given, for example, to police departments, and M.D.s. No consumer vehicles were produced at all for 1942, 1943, 1944, and 1945, though hundreds of thousands of jeeps, tanks, self-propelled guns, landing craft, merchant ships, warships, airplanes, and other weapons rolled off the lines at an amazing rate of speed. If nothing else, as Kearns Goodwin points out, this vast effort illustrates the unstoppable purpose of the American people when unified behind an idea.1941 was also a watershed year for the Roosevelts personally. FDR's mother died. Eleanor's brother died. FDR's paramour Missy LeHand suffered a devastating stroke, after which she faded from the White House. Eleanor's close friend, Lorena Hickock, another White House visitor-cum-permanent-resident, faded out of the picture as the exigencies of the war altered the Roosevelts' personal relationships profoundly. FDR and ER drew closer together. Their personal wartime odyssey was one that was being reflected by Americans throughout the land in myriad different ways. Military manpower demands required that millions of women enter the workforce, most for the very first time. Likewise, the War caused erosion in institutional Jim Crowism as African-Americans were both brought into the industrial workforce and sent overseas to fight. All but the most hardened racists saw the illogic of asking people of color to fight for a democracy that was denied them at home. Racial incidents (and there were many at first) were trumpeted by the Axis as evidence of the decadence of America. Thus, hardcore anti-integrationists began to be perceived as a kind of Fifth Column giving aid and comfort to the enemy. This logic even touched the Japanese-American community which had been indiscriminately interned following Pearl Harbor. By mid-1943, a full one-third of the internees were either in the military or living outside of internment camps. Still, the treatment of the Issei and Nisei remains a blot on the American record.As the War progressed, the Roosevelts were consumed by activity. Eleanor was particularly indefatiguable, showing all the exuberant energy of her Uncle Theodore by often cramming 15 appointments into a 20 hour day, plus writing a daily news column. She took an extended tour of the Pacific Theatre at the same time that the President was conferencing at Casablanca and Teheran and often hosting the Churchills along with European royalty and governments-in-exile.So busy was ER that she failed to notice a decline in the President's health. He never seemed to fully recuperate following a bad attack of flu in early 1944; although his usual White House physician proclaimed him in the best of health, other doctors, called in by his daughter, documented an alarming deterioration in the President, who, it was discovered, was suffering from Congestive Heart Failure. Prescribed Digitalis, he seemed to recover somewhat for a brief while; however, after D-Day his health continued to fail. Kearns Goodwin relies on others' research to posit that the President was dying of cancer, but existing medical records were intentionally fudged by doctors unwilling to alarm either the President or his Administration, Congress, or the public. By the time he was nominated for his fourth term in July of 1944, it was clear to the President that his death was too near, though he seemed indifferent to the implications inherent in his shifting prescribed changes of schedule, medication and diet. He blithely continued to work and travel, despite increasing discomfort. His death, on April 12, 1945, was sudden, shocking, unexpected and predictable.Kearns Goodwin does not end the story with FDR's death but continues it to the close of 1945. FDR's Administration did not die with him. Completely overshadowed by his four-term predecessor, President Harry S Truman initially acted in thorough reliance upon FDR's advisors to win the War and secure the Peace, though many of FDR's people thought him too rustic to be trusted with running the country. It is an open question as to whether FDR would have used the A-Bomb of course, but given the loss of life feared in a land invasion of Japan, it is likely. How FDR might have led the country if the War had stretched on into 1947 or 1948 is sheer speculation, as is how he would have handled the Peace and the nascent Cold War.Eleanor, though no longer the First Lady, remained a powerful presence on the world and domestic stage. Truman eventually named her UN Ambassador. And although she no longer had ready access to the President's ear, she influenced the remaining New Dealers in Truman's Administration and led the Liberal wing of the Democratic Party, invoking the ghost of FDR to do so.The questions of whether FDR actively conspired to bring the U.S. into the War, and whether the Roosevelt White House was a nest of Syndicalists never get addressed directly, though Kearns Goodwin certainly presents enough evidence to answer both questions in the negative. Roosevelt clearly did not \\"want\\" war, and he did not \\"allow\\" the Japanese attack. What he wanted was war preparedness and aid to the Allies; in 1940-41 he was successful in achieving both without forcing the U.S. into conflict. And, as for the question of radical leftists in government, Kearns Goodwin demonstrates that though there were many Social Progressives among the New Dealers there were no agents of the Kremlin in influential positions anywhere in the Roosevelt Administration; indeed, there were a surprising number of reactionaries and Dixiecrats offsetting the New Dealers' social fervor. The New Deal, in fact, never accomplished such stated goals as Universal Health Care and a Guaranteed Minimum Annual Income Plan for all citizens.Sixty years hence, we have collectively forgotten the dehumanizing effects of Depression, Fascism and Stalinism, and have slowly undone the New Deal much to our very great detriment. Greed has replaced enlightened self-interest in American social and political discourse. Still, the Roosevelts' time was \\"no ordinary time\\" that can act as a template for creating a unifying American purpose based upon individual respect and community interest once again. Those were some of our greatest years."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin really took her time and wrote one of the best books I have ever read. She talked about Franklin and Eleanore and their influence on each other, as well as the support for each other they needed to get through WWII. I was born in 1960, and recognized many of the names in politics from my childhood, but the step by step process of the war and the thinking behind each step was just so educational for me. I chose this book for my Literature group last year, and everyone loved it. Most of the women lived through this time, and one was a nurse in the army at that time, and said this was a very accurate account, but also that she learned much more than was ever in the news. Just a great experience and definitely sparked great discussion fo hours!"},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I have been a fan of the Roosevelts since I discovered them as a teenager thirty years ago. I have read many, many books on them, most notably Burns's Roosevelt biography and the excellent set on Eleanor by Blanche Cook. I have also read many books on the various political and social aspects of the Roosevelt years. It was with great interest that I purchased this book when it was released. I knew of Mrs. Goodwin from her work and subsequent book on President Johnson.This book offers a unique perspective on the Roosevelts, namely their lives during the second World War. While not a daily diary of their activities, the book succeeds in illustrating not only significant public appearances, but also routines in their daily lives. Mrs. Goodwin has a particular talent for writing in a style that is extremely readable without being simplistic. The overall writing style is sympathetic toward the Roosevelts without neglect of critism or their individual weaknesses.This book was one of the very few I read that I couldn't put down until finished. I have reread it, and loaned it out, so many times that I was forced to buy a second copy.Mrs. Goodwin has the peculiar talent of making history 'live' through writing, in the same manner that Barbara Tuchman did. This book is great reading for those who don't ordinarily like reading history.I only wish Mrs. Goodwin would spend less time on television and more on writing books!"},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"This was a very enjoyable and well written historical account of America during World War II, through the prism of the relationship between Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. Goodwin's great strength, it seems to me, is to find a really refreshing angle to look at a well documented subject, often by examining the subject's most important personal relationships. She did the same thing in her Lincoln book,Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincolnby examining the way Lincoln put together a strong cabinet, while still remaining a strong executive.In this book she focuses on the Roosevelts during World War II, as FDR rallied a totally unprepared nation to become, first the arsenal of democracy, and then to enter the war against both Germany and Japan.From my point of view I would have preferred more Franklin and less Eleanor. Ms. Goodwin notes several critics dismissing Eleanor as a meddling nag, and at times the criticism has merit. Franklin's demeanor, whether he is holding court at press conferences or White House cocktail hours, is much more enjoyable to be around. And you do, thanks to the lively writing, have a \\"you are there\\" feeling throughout this book."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Like most people educated in the US, history classes generally managed to stay pretty detailed until roughly the civil war, then as the spring arrives, we ended up rushing through the 20th century not getting a whole lot of the details.So it's been with some delight that I've been reading this book, filling in the details. Focusing primarily on the lead-up to Roosevelt's third term through his death, Kearns manages to provide enough detail and background to keep the reader informed and engaged throughout.It is, though somewhat disturbing while reading this to realize how far to the right the US as tacked in the last 60 years."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I found this to be a fascinating book on my political heroes. Once you get half way thru the book you find yourself absorbed in the White House activities during WWII. Doris Kearns Goodwin weaves this story so well, it is downright escapism. Everytime Churchill showed up I nearly giggled with glee. FDR was the greatest President we'll ever have, and Eleanor was part of the reason why. I came away from the book more enthralled with her and her passion than anything. More than deserving of the Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"As a student of history, I found this book to be a classic gem. Doris Kearns Goodwin is a truly gifted author with a keen insight into American political history. This book made me feel like I knew the Roosevelt's well and that I was a part of that time (which I wasn't). Reading like a diary, the pages flowed beautifully back and forth from Franklin's world into Eleanor's life, and vice versa. It made me realize how truly special the Roosevelt's were and that together they devoted their lives to keeping this country alive and the world safe from Nazis. Regardless of what conclusion one would make about the Roosevelt's personal lives, it is clear that they had an understanding of what they both had to do to keep this country working well. What a team effort during the most crucial period of American history during the past century. As soon as I finished this book, I bought Wait Till Next Year, a memoir by Doris Kearns Goodwin. My wife just finished it ( and loved it), and I can't wait to start it."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Being a Baby Boomer, I always wanted to understand the former generation's affinity to FDR and Eleanor. Doris Kearns Goodwin in her Pulitzer Prize winning book, creates a visualization of the people and the times quite well. Never knew FDR was such a ladies man, or that Eleanor overcame such a disfunctional early family life to become a leading example of feminism well ahead of her time."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Are there many Roosevelt lovers out there who are under 70? I'm one of them, but I can't for the life of me understand why. It is perhaps because of the low esteem in which I hold the Presidents of my life time: Kennedy, Johnson and so on. God, how low we have come. It is surely a period of unprecedented mediocrity in national leadership. Can one honestly compare Bush, Clinton, Carter, or Ford to the likes of Franklin Delano Roosevelt? Why is this? That FDR was hated in his time is now more understandable to me, as I hadn't before understood how radical his policies were. Of course, none of his experiments has lasted and this may explain why he is so easily loved. Only Social Security survives. I love the personal anecdotes the author has assembled to tell the story of the President's ordeal. We see again how much he suffered. Those four terms really were too much for him. The author of this work is a \\"petticoat historian,\\" part of the feminist movement in history to tell the grand historical stories from the point of view of the bathroom and bedroom. If it were not deemed too personal and in bad taste, Goodwin would describe the President's bowel movements. One might very well say \\"why not?\\" but the point that bothers me is why such things are of such great interest to the author. Surely, the Battle of Stalingrad is a wee bit more important than Roosevelt's breakfast menu. Nonetheless, Goodwin is discreet and tasteful and, therefore, the anecdotes she shares are personal but never vulgar. She possesses an entrancing style, which makes this a quick and delightful read. That we have had such a sorry group of Presidents since FDR is a sad thing but, who knows?, with new crises approaching, the country may yet produce another great man."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Typically I don't read historical non-fiction but was drawn to this book by the fact that it won the Pulitzer. It is a truly engrossing, wonderful book, and I found myself pressing it on friends as a \\"must read.\\" While I knew the basic \\"facts\\" of WW II, I was astounded to discover just how easily the outcome could have been different had Franklin Roosevelt not stuck to his guns. This book did leave me with less respect for Eleanor Roosevelt--while she accomplished so much in the public arena, she came across in the book as a poor mother. Doris Goodwin writes beautifully. Sometimes you feel like you are in the same room with the people she's describing."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"No Ordinary Time is a wonderful book because it is so accessible. Doris Kearns Goodwin writes about America and the Roosevelts in a very easy-to-read and personal fashion. After reading this book, I find myself able to recall historical facts in conversation quickly, without racking my brain. It's easier to relate to history, when it's written in an engaging narrative like this, instead of a dull recounting of names, dates, and places."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I learned not only about Eleanor and Franklin, but about WWII and other events and issues of the day. This is a compassionate book, one which takes context carefully into account as it details the controversies and issues with which Eleanor and Franklin dealt. I highly recommend it! even if you are not usually a Biography reader."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"This is a fabulous book, but the Kindle edition is marred by many, many typographical errors. This makes me wonder whether I want to buy more books in Kindle form."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin's biography of FDR comes at a perfect time.Our Nation is facing the equivalent of the Great Depression AND a warof jihad that exceeds in its tentacles a greater global threat thanNazism.

She looks at the lives of FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt, both of which have been examined by many writers, and presents their relationship in a new and engaging way. She presents Eleanor not only as wife and First Lady, but also as a significant individual of deep convictions and strength in her own right.In another case of &quot;history repeating itself,&quot; the examination of the Roosevelts public and personal life will give the reader greater insight into the dynamics of personal relationships within the context of the political arena.

ANY HISTORY BUFF SHOULD READ. TO REALIZE HOW UNPREPARED OUR COUNTRY WAS, AND ULTIMATELY VICTORIOUS, WHEN WE WERE COMPELLED TO ENTER THE WAR, SHOULD GIVE US COURAGE IN THESE TRYING TIMES."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Goodwin does an outstanding job showing the Roosevelts as the mortal human beings they were, while adding substantially to the mystique surrounding the administration. FDR's extraordinary ability to build coalitions and make weighty decisions under pressure are nothing short of extraordinary, and Eleanor's dogged adherence to principle stand out against the empty pragmatism we see in the modern world. However, the personalities of less discussed figures, like Harry Hopkins and Sara Roosevelt add flesh to the story, and Goodwin's candid analysis of FDR's relationship with Lucy Rutherford is done as tastefully as possible. As one who read this outstanding book during the impeachment trial, I must admit, I longed for the days Goodwin describes, those in which the President seemed to believe America was really the greatest country in the history of the world."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"This was the first book of Ms. Goodwin's that I have read. I found it entertaining and difficult to put down. As a critique and chronology of how the Roosevelts' dealt with domestic US realities during FDR's tenure, the interspersing of WWII and international affairs gave the treatise proper balance and perspective. Eleanor is treated fairly and with the right amount of criticism, the relationship(s) of Eleanor and FDR are given exposure, and the difficulty of two powerful egos in the White House proved fascinating. Will Hillary and Bill Clinton get a similar treatment in years to come? I found this book of great interest for today's generation in trying to understand how today's domestic policies were birthed in the 30s and 40s."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"This is a well written book that will capture the attention of anyone who reads it. It is not a book solely for history buffs. In addition to giving the reader a view of the Roosevelts, it also gives a perspective of the times, now and then."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Goodwin has written yet another \\"biography\\" of FDR and Eleanor which omits more history than it includes. If you are looking for an objective examination of the New Deal and the events leading up to WW II, or an explanation of why FDR was surrounded by so many communists, this is not the book for you. There are other books suggested as alternatives that would be a much better source of information instead of this propaganda. Goodwin admits to being a liberal, and this book shows that on every page. She cannot even bring herself to discuss Eleanor's lesbian relationships in a candid and honest way. The only new revelation I found in the book was the fact that some newspaper reporters who wrote about the administration actually LIVED in the White House while spewing their propaganda in the name of objective journalism. If you want to read a book that reinforces your belief that FDR was nearly a flawless human, then read this book. If you want to read some actual history, such as FDR's 1940 campaign where he branded anyone who said he was planning on taking the US into the war in Europe as a liar, while planning at the same time to do so, and doing so with his embargo of oil to Japan that guaranteed the attack on the US, there are many better books than this. Goodwin is an admitted plagarist, and she would have been better off stealing some legitimate material for this book than publishing this tripe."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"FDR was the second worst president in U.S. history after Bill Clinton. He bankrupted the U.S. economy, he made us a socialist nation, and brainwashed us with filthy Soviet propaganda during World War II. Doris Kearns Goodwin is a Roosevelt worshipper. Steer clear of works like this and instead read John Flynn's &quot;The Roosevelt Myth&quot;."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"An excellent distillation of what the Roosevelts meant to 20th century history. I enjoyed this book tremendously and recommend it to anyone interested in modern history or the study of leadership."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I found this to be a most refreshing addition to the morass of biographies on FDR. Ms. Goodwin weaves an interesting mosiac of the complicated relationships that existed in the Roosevelt White House. Contrasting these against the players in the current presidental scandal affords the reader with no small degree of credilbe perspective. I would recommend this study to anyone interested in the first modern presidency or to those who might enjoy an intellectual but not academically rigorous look at this truly fascinating couple."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Ms Goodwin's, &quot;No Ordinary Time&quot; is no ordinary effort; she penned a masterful chronicle of the WW II years. I was ten years old in 1940 and her work took me back to relive events that were very much a part of my young life. Only now, through her mastery of narrative and her attention to detail, I was able to revisit that extraordinary time as an adult. As the author points out, the war effort was an all consuming way of life for those of us on the home front. Age precluded my serving in the armed forces, however being named a &quot;messenger&quot; in our local Civil Defense unit sure made me &quot;proud to serve&quot; - running (literally) messages from the command post to the fire station during air raid drills. Goodwin mentioned the change from brass buttons to olive drab ones on army uniforms. My mother worked in a clothing factory that did &quot;government work&quot;, and among the many machines she operated was one that sewed buttons on the fronts and sleeves of army overcoats. I recall sitting by her side - as she worked overtime - the night that change was made to the &quot;plastic&quot; olive drab buttons (still with the embossed eagle). In reading Ms. Goodwin's behind the scenes drama starring Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, many old memories were revived and given new depth and meaning. Most important, however, is that the novelist's canvas of the WW II home front &quot;landscape&quot; is a remarkable - and enjoyable - lesson in history..PS: As an Arizona resident for over 25 years I would be remiss in not pointing out one glaring inaccuracy in the book: When Goodwin writes about the Japanese internment camps, she mentions the &quot;Gila River Camp in Arizona&quot;, and then makes this statement, &quot;Set in the middle of the desert, Gila endured temperatures that ranged between 125 degrees in the summer and thirty degrees below in the winter.&quot; The lowest temperature ever recorded in Phoenix, which is also &quot;in the middle of the desert&quot; was (plus) sixteen degrees on January 7, 1913. The coldest temperature ever in Arizona, minus forty degrees, was recorded on January 7, 1971 at Hawley Lake, which is situated in the mountains at over 7000 feet elevation."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Outstanding, vivid book really brings to life not just the public and momentous events in Franklin &amp; Eleanor Roosevelt's lives but the private and the everyday. Very rich character development and an incredible wealth of detail. If there is one shortcoming it's that Goodwin doesn't examine Eleanor's relationship with her secretary, Malvina Thompson, anywhere near as fully as she examines the Roosevelts' relationships with other important people in their lives. Overall a great read, couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"This is a excellent book for history &amp; non-history buffs. As the author describes the events that occurred in the lives of the Roosevelts, it is told in context of the times and the events surrounding them. I found that this give me a clear understanding of their thinking and actions. I thought the book presented the Roosevelts fairly even handed, though it seemed to me that some of their failings were explained away too easily. Overall a great book that I could not put down."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I often judge books by their ability to transport me to another place and time... and this one scores big. If you ever wished that you could be that proverbial fly on the wall, this book lets you! As Goodwin's title says, it was NO ORDINARY TIME, and her look at the figures that dominated the American political scene for 13 years is simply fascinating. The book especially leaves one with an appreciation for what an amazing woman Eleanor was. A great book!"},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"It has been years since I have attempted to read a book on history. Having been turned off to it during my college years, I felt my interest coming alive when I watched Ken Burns' Baseball on KCET. Goodwin's eloquence and knowledge showed in her interviews on baseball and her book on the Roosevelts has not disappointed me. I have learned volumes about the history of our country during the 40's. I now realize that Mrs. Roosevelt was a woman born 50 years too early and yet, had it not been for her, FDR would not have had the social conscience that he did. Thanks to Goodwin, I have a far greater respect for Mrs. Roosevelt than ever before and will continue to read her books on American History. I feel as though I am sitting and talking with a life long friend; not reading as her style is so very comfortable."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin is a master at mixing endless historical facts with fascinating personal insites into this former president and his wife. It is not a book to be read in a weekend but realished over many weeks. There is so much to absorb and learn about the people and events that shaped that corner of history. I was fascinated to learn about certain pieces of WWII and what this country accomplished during that time. I am not a history buff by any means but find myself enjoying history as Goodwin has a way of making you feel as though you were there. I highly recommend it! I am already knee deep in her book about the Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"This is a book so rich and well-written that you choose to read it slowly, savoring each page. These few years of our history catapulted the US into world leadership and radically changed our culture, our institutions and the social fabric within which we live our lives. Doris Kearns Goodwin artfully draws you through the story weaving together the people, their personalities and the events that were to be the genesis of modern America."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I am admittedly a much bigger fan of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, our brave and humane 32nd president, than of his wife Eleanor, who used a shaky marriage as a launching pad for pushing a deeply-felt yet goopy one-world idealism. So it's no surprise I was much more engaged by some parts than others of Doris Kearns Goodwin's 1994 Pulitzer-winning joint biography.Goodwin's admiring interest in Eleanor dominates this long and episodic book, focused on the couple's days at the White House during the last five years of his administration, when World War II first threatened, then engulfed the United States. However much FDR may direct the events of this book, it is to Eleanor she returns again and again. Goodwin pushes everything from the First Lady's \\"enormously popular syndicated column\\" to her \\"fervent hope\\" for a future without discrimination.Eleanor, writes Goodwin, was a dogged champion of principle and the underprivileged, insisting \\"that the struggle abroad would not be worth winning unless democracy were renewed at home.\\" That meant a nation focused more on the rights of blacks, women, unions, and Jews being persecuted (and by 1942, systematically exterminated) by Hitler than on such things as building up an \\"arsenal of democracy\\" with the help of shameless capitalists or an alliance with a recalcitrant colonialist like Winston Churchill. If she ragged on Franklin a little too much while he wrestled with both a world at war and his legs in metal braces, Goodwin seems to say, who could blame her when she cared so much?Eleanor talked a lot. Franklin did things. Goodwin's desire to focus the narrative equally on both may give her book distinction, but it also hobbles it with a good deal of touchy-feeling psycho-analysis about the First Lady's steps toward self-actualization at the expense of recording the real history made by Franklin. The focus, on life at the White House, is ironic because Eleanor was more often found around this time at her apartment in Greenwich Village or the cottage in Hyde Park built so her lesbian friends didn't have to deal with the heavy vibes of FDR's judgmental mother, Sara.That Eleanor herself was not a lesbian is a point Goodwin makes softly, but firmly. Yes, she had a female suitor she put up at the White House right next to her own bedroom, Lorena Hickok, but despite some passionate letters it appears Eleanor left her dangling, even suggesting Lorena find herself a man. Eleanor may herself have had a man, Joe Lash, but when he married she was four-square behind it. One is left thinking she was probably asexual, more entranced by her proximity to power than her capacity for love, whatever it was.Franklin's day-to-day life was spent largely without his wife. At first his fiercely devoted secretary Missy LeHand, and later his daughter Anna, provided the companionship he needed, along with a Norwegian princess and a former mistress who returned to him after a quarter-century on ice. Goodwin notes what many others have, that Franklin had a tendency to treat those who loved him like Kleenex.\\"The President uses those who suit his purposes,\\" Eleanor is quoted observing. \\"He makes up his own mind and discards people when they no longer fulfill a purpose of his.\\"A subtheme of this book, one Goodwin would no doubt reject vociferously, is that it took one to know one. This, after all, was the woman who allowed her mortally ill husband to run for a fourth term because she didn't want that extremist Thomas Dewey to get a shot in office. At one point in the middle of the war, Franklin asked Eleanor to be a more regular companion, but she declined.\\"No Ordinary Time\\" is indispensible to those who want to follow the story of the Roosevelts in their last years of power. Goodwin writes well, with an obvious and engaged reliance on the record as it exists and an appetite for pulling it from obscure places like White House log books. Alas, unlike her prior book, \\"The Fitzgeralds And The Kennedys,\\" it lacks an inner pull to carry you from chapter to chapter. Instead of experiencing FDR's last years in all their dramatic glory, we get visits to factories and peeks at Eleanor's chatty columns. Too often the book plays up Eleanor's subsidiary importance as if it merits equal weight, regulating Franklin to the role of \\"that man in the White House.\\" This is more her story than his, and is the lesser for it."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I was hooked from the first paragraph.

Despite being a kid during World War II and the preseding years I was very much atuned to what was going on in the USA and the rest of the world. Of course my knowledge was limited to the newspapers and radio news broadcasts. Now many years later this book has filled in between the lines much of the history I was living then. Probably the most significant history that few Americans knew at that time was how ill Roosevelt was during the last eighteen months of his life during such important times. Nontheless his brilliance and that of his staff sustained his office as president and as a world leader. The importance of Eleanor as his wife and a figure of nationwide importance is well treated. If you lived during those times, even though you are not a history buff, I can highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Absolutely riveting!

Both a great & terrible time for people to live through."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"What a riveting read - this is history at its absolute best, seamlessly combining personal, social, political and cultural themes into one beautifully written account. There have been more scholarly accounts of the War years in the United States and the leadership of FDR, but none has been more accessible, informative and all-encompassing than this. The original \\"power couple\\", FDR and Eleanor are revealed as the complex individuals they were - generous, petty, manipulative, driven - whose relationship was unusual to say the least, even for contemporary readers. Doris Kearns Goodwin covers all this with sympathy and honesty while also documenting with the same informed insight the dynamics of a rapidly changing America. Her command of her material is awesome - each page has some carefully selected and telling anecdote or statistic, and whether the topic is labour relations, war production, the changing role of women, the influence of the powerful or the realities of segregation (North and South), the result is a rich, engrossing account of life in America during one of its most critical phases. The stakes could hardly have been higher and the outcome less certain for the US and the world - \\"no ordinary time\\" indeed and no ordinary Presidential couple. Few others would have had the vision, the courage and sheer self-belief to lead a nation safely through such treacherous times. We, all of us, have a great deal to thank the Roosevelts for and a debt of gratitude to Doris Kearns Goodwin too for helping us understand this so beautifully.

The historical facts which I recall having to memorize for high school history class tests became totally captivating and allowed me to understand that period of time much more deeply. Goodwin's attention to minute details and her commitment to research on facts give a solid background to her skillful writing. Honestly, anything she writes is wonderful and this is no exception!"},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I love the books by Doris Kearns Goodwin, and this is no exception. She paints an unforgettable portrait of the horrible time in American history of the Great Depression and World War II. A significant part is the sympathetic portrayal of the unusual marriage and partnership of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"A fine blend of the personal and public lives of two iconic political figures. No Ordinary Time is a fair and balanced account of the Roosevelts during WW II and honors both Franklin and Eleanor for their remarkable contributions to the country during those years."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Great story of the everyday things that happened in the Roosevelt White House and the people who made history. Not a quick read but very enjoyable. It was shocking to look back at what the political and social controversies were."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I would give this book the highest rating because I felt as if I were right there. Doris Kearns Goodwin is quite the gifted writer, what a story! I learned so many things by reading this book. The book was long, but I couldn't wait to start the next chapter, and was sorry when I got to the end.Thanks"},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I really love the author and it's a great book if you've ever questioned how we got into the II War."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Loved the insight I got into FDR and Eleanor. What an unusual relationship but still such admiration for both of them. Having not been alive during WWII, I only had stories or facts from history books. Now, I feel that I have learned the &#34;behind the scenes&#34; of the War and all the people involved in it.If you are a history buff, this is the book for you. If you love history written with a &#34;voice&#34;, you have to read it."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"A fantastic read and so very informative! It gives one such an insight as to Franklin's and Eleanor's Important lives during World II and FDR's last term in office."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I chose this rating as I thought the book was well written and informative. Having lived through the period covered by the book, I thought the description of the period was accurate. I also enjoyed learning little background details about FDR and Eleanor. I have read a number of books about FDR, including Schlessingers' works, Roosevelt and Hopkins, and Freedom Fro Fear, and I would rank this book with those."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"It told about what was going on in the private lives of Franklin adn Eleanor, by taking away the politics and looking at the personalities."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I am a college student. Before reading this book I barely knew who FDR was, let alone why his terms in office were so important. I traveled to Hawaii shortly after reading this book to visit Pearl Harbor because I was so moved by the book. I feel like I understand my grandparents generation a little better now and truly want to thank them for all they have done.Overall, a terrific read. The author did a wonderful job of sharing the unique relationship between FDR and Churhill. I was also impressed with the author's knowledge of the homefront, instead of just all of the famous battles. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Goodwin takes a really interesting approach here to what is essentially the biography of a couple. Doing a biography of a couple is fairly unique as a starting point, but Goodwin gets more creative, using the time period of the Second World War as a magnifying glass to really bring the traits of her subjects into focus. The result is amazingly well done.Goodwin clearly admires her subjects, but does a nice job of keeping a balanced perspective about their character traits and their actions. In the end, she does what any great biographer must - she shows you that even massive historical figures are human beings with failings that go along with their strengths. Goodwin does an admirable job of showing how the character traits of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt translated into changes in America and the world.You don't need to be a fan of Franklin and Eleanor Rooselvelt to enjoy this book - I'm not. But the balance of Goodwin's approach will help any reader come to better understand the time in which the Roosevelts lived and led and the factors that shaped these two enormous personalities.Highly recommended for fans of great biography and/or history."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin is simply at her best in No Ordinary Time. It is a wonderful historical narrative of what went on inside the White House during the Depression, the years leading up to the war and WWII itself. Dr. Goodwin picked a topic and added an immense amount of research and color to it. She manages to astutely put the reader into the Roosevelt White house and the relationship between these two towering figures. Yet she never allows the reader to lose site of the bigger picture, always seemlessly bringing a broader historical framework back into her pages. Her depiction of FDR's true leadership but failure at in-depth human relationships is well done. Her look at the pioneering Elenor Roosevelt and her inability to slow down and deal with a marriage even after a near failure in its very nascent stages, her desire to influence her husband to keep the social progress of the New Deal alive when his hands were beyond full leading an all-encompassing war effort and her jealousies of women with social graces is truly terrific stuff. Literally all the players that set both the world stage are there with much of her attention at the White House where friends, family, advisors, lovers, and world leaders lived and stayed and created a dynamic that literally shaped U.S. policy during this incredible period of world history.One could go on about how well each topic is covered. Suffice it to say this is one well done book. If the reader desires to learn more about another relationship that greatly effected the war effort, I would recommend \\"Franklin and Winston\\" by Jon Meacham or, for a broader and terrific work on the period, \\"Freedom From Fear\\" by David M. Kennedy (part of the Oxford History of the United States). For a great couple of historical fiction pieces I would pick up \\"Winds of War\\" and \\"War and Rememberence\\" by Herman Wouk (don't let a poor televions mini-series poison your view of a couple of terrific novels that give you a feel for a period that even the best writers of narrative history, simply cannot given the purpose of their writings)."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I received this as a gift two years ago, set it aside on my &quot;to be read&quot; pile, and there it sat. Then a trip with the prospect of waiting time in airports brought it to the top of the pile, and I must say I wish I had gotten to it sooner. This is truly engrossing, well-researched, revelatory. One feels at the end a new appreciation for the wartime achievements of Eleanor Roosevelt in particular, as the book seems to take more her point of view than Franklin's. Either way, I found this vastly entertaining and informative, gracefully written, and an important adjunct to the more formal histories of World War II."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Despite its length, I loved this book. But then again I would hope that 13 years in the White House would merit 600+ pages. The author may romanticize the harmony of the White House by not delving too deeply into the private relationships of both ER and FDR, however she pulls no punches in defining their relationship with each other.What a team they were. Eleanor as a tireless worker pushing her husband to make a difference in the lives of women, minorities, the poor and immigrants and FDR, the political realist who maybe knows his wife is correct, but uncertain whether the Republican/Southern Democrat coalition will allow him to enact liberal legislation. ER's almost radical agenda tempered by the realism of FDR's political savvy mixed in with a &quot;vast right wing conspiracy&quot; draws many parallels to the recent Clinton administration and proves again that history is cyclicalThe Roosevelt marriage was not a conventional one, but in the love and admiration were still a central component to their relationship and in the end, their teamwork/partnership defines this unordinary time.I am certainly happy that I read this book and would read Goodwin again."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"After listening to FDR and his wife being demonized on talk radio all these years, it was refreshing to read an objective book about them.The story of FDR is inspirational. He was the greatest president of this century, and he belongs on Mount Rushmore. How exciting to read how he led us through the War to victory, and how he treated his fellow citizens as human beings and not subjects. Just an incredible genious for politics and for having a &quot;big picture&quot; approach to leading the country.Eleanor was the greatest First Lady of this century; she showed that a First Lady is capable of doing more than just picking out china patterns for the White House. Was Eleanor a &quot;busy-body&quot;? She sure was, God bless her. She noodged her husband every time she came across bigotry and unfairness in this country.This book reminded me of how wonderful it is to be a liberal."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I heard Doris Kearns Goodwin speak last year, at which time she read excerpts of No Ordinary Time.

Her attention to detail is exhaustive and yet her delivery keeps you turning the pages. She has a way of going beyond the statistics and giving you a sense of who both Eleanor and Franklin really are. At 633 pages in length, it's not a short read you can take along to the beach. But if you have the time and the interest in the subject matter, it's worth reading."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I have been a fan of Doris Kearns Goodwin after hearing her speak at a leadership conference. All of her descriptions of events were built around the people that made the key decisions or influenced the events to occur.This Pulitzer Prize book is equally well researched on both of the book's characters, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. In reading the book, you feel like you are actually living in the White House during the events leading up to and during the Depression and World War II.The author is so thorough in the details gathered from her research from diaries and letters, that the book is not a fast read. However it is a fascinating portrait of two extraordinary individuals that led our nation through extraordinary events and personally influenced historical change in the way we live as Americans that forever changed our fabric.I highly recommend to any Franklin or Eleanor Roosevelt reader...through this work, you cannot understand one without knowing the other."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin has given us a treasure in &quot;No Ordinary Time,&quot; a vivid, intimate, informative, and readable biography of FDR and Eleanor during the WWII years, as well as a history of the time itself. This book is doubly relevant now, because since 9/11/01, we too are living in anything but an &quot;ordinary time.&quot; We don't know what is going to happen next, and neither does anyone else...including the White House. In their time, neither Franklin nor Eleanor knew what was coming next. The anxiety and weight of responsibility certainly took a toll on both of them. Kearns is unabashedly a fan of both FDR and Eleanor, but this does not prevent her from revealing their weaknesses as well as their strengths. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"The private life of one of the most famous couples in American history is shown with all it's faults.

They shipped early and the book was in wonderful condition.The book itself was very enjoyable reading. It is different than other WWII histories in that it did not catalog battles but events in the White House. It was like having the inside story, the story behind the story.It gave a a much broader perspective of what was happening on the home from while the GI's fought for their lives and the life of Europe.

Scores of memoirs, records and personal interviews bring this striking pair into focus both privately as well as before the public eye.This is an engaging, entertaining and insightful read. As a word of note, military buffs seeking WWII battle detail will find themselves sorely disappointed. On the other hand, fans of Winston Churchill will discover sufficient personal anecdotes about this headlining Prime Minister during his most stellar moments in British and world history.If your interest is in US government, public policy or social change and development, No Ordinary Time is an epic tale you won't want to miss. \\" (Updated 1 second ago)"},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"It puts you in the White House with the first family and key players during the most dangerous time in 20th century for the USA."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Really enjoyed this book, it's a great look at the \\"backstory\\" behind WWII. I learned a lot that I didn't know and found much of it fascinating. Would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Goodwin tells the inside story of the FDR's White House during World War II. To her credit, Goodwin delivers a solid, scholarly review exploring the personal motivations and complex interaction between Franklyn, Eleanor and their colorful inner circle. Goodwin could have easily cooked this book into a scandal rag. For example, both Franklyn and Eleanor carried on hushed (but by no means secret) love affairs within the White House walls. However, because of Goodwin's reserve, her book should become essential reading if you wish to fully understand FDR's White House. At the book's core is a unique couple who both first rise above their family pedigree and then overcome their personal fears and handicaps to achieve something extraordinary (i.e. the title, \\"No Ordinary Time\\"). Eleanor conquers her social shyness to champion the poor, instigating a number of new domestic programs and policies. Franklyn's personal stamina negates his hidden paralysis. His iron will is even more impressive as he defies his own party and strategically delays America's troop deployment into the battlefields of WWII. I recently tried reading (but failed to finish) Gore Vidal's \\"The Golden Age.\\" It is historical fcition covering the exact same subject matter. Strangely, I found the fictional account to be stiff and the historical account to be heartfelt. Why settle for fiction when the facts are so fascinating?"},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"A fine work within its boundries, but the author's laudible concentration on primary sources has kept her from getting a consensus of other writers about the period. The worst gaffe is that she perpetuates the view that only Jews were sent to Hitler's extermination camps, when actually Gypsies, homosexuals, communists and others were also exterminated like termites.She knows little about war, and sometimes that is a problem, as when she seems to think the advantage of the German tanks was that they were more comfortable, or when she perpetuates the myth of Germany beating Poland by having tanks gun down cavalry.No author knows everything, so with those reservations, I recommend it strongly to anyone who wants to know how the US became what it is today."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"WELL READ AND BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN. AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF OUR HISTORY."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Even today we voters primarily vote for the candidate instead of his or her spouse. Thus, my preference would have been for a book that tilted more heavily with FDR's vantage point.Having said that I can also certainly stress that I understand precisely why so much is dedicated to the First Lady. She certainly was a great American and was heavily involved and did a terrific job in getting a first-hand look at the country for FDR. I doff my hat and bow to the one individual who did so much to bring my country into a new age.As I listened to the audio version I thought much of my mother. She had worked at McDonnell-Douglas and then became an Army WAC. Near the end of the war Mom wrote a poem that appeared in Stars 7 Stripes, \\"You Whispered I Love You.\\"At the time she was hospitalized and later received a number of marriage offers but the one she'd most wanted to hear did write to ask me hand. Thus, some seven years later, thankfully, I appeared on the scene and would later become a writer. I am grateful but, perhaps, readers of my reviews have opposite emotions!Again, get a copy of this book and read or listen to it to get a terrific insight into the America born from the Roosevelts.

It's very interesting to listen to. I was a little surprised how much time the author spent speculating about FDR's and Elanor's sexual relations (with each other and with others), but there's a lot of good anecdotes. It bounces back and forth in time a bit, but it's not hard to follow what period they are talking about."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Another great one here, fills in a lot of blanks with some good new stuff."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"First off, let me say that this book was required reading for my AP US History class. I didn't expect much out of it, but it was really good. The story was told unlike any other history book that I have ever read. I shy away from giving it 5 stars because it is a history book and it is not critical enough. Goodwin presented the story without enough criticisms. She should realize that FDR wasn't perfect. But otherwise, a great book!"},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I really wanted to like this book and had looked forward to reading it for a long time. However, the writing style compared to other historical novels that I do like was very dry. I didn't get any sense of empathy for either FDR or Eleanor. On the other hand, characters such as Churchill came across much more vividly and likeable. I don't know if this is a reflection of the differences in the peoples' personalities or simply the fact that the author chooses to include every single detail of the daily lives of the couple without ever really let the reader get to know them. For me it has been a book that I'm only able to get through about 10 pages at a time before I get bored. For reference, the last three books I've read, all of which I thoroughly enjoyed were, the Nine by Toobin, The River of Doubt by Millard and Peter the Great by Massie."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I found this book to be historically satisfactory, but I thought it lingered excessively on FDR and ER's respective extramarital relatioships.

It shows us that FDR probably saved the world with his remoteness and self-discipline, and his not caring for others. Eleanor was equally as great in her own right, but certainly should never have been a mother as she seemed to have disassociated herself from this responsibility. Reading this book certainly brings today's happenings into perspecteve. Thank God there was no T.V. in those days, the Roosevelt's would have made the Clinton Administration look like a bunch of amateurs."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I have met Doris Goodwin Kearns.

As a history buff, I am enjoying this more personal look at FDR, Eleanor and their friends and family. The inside story of how FDR manuevered to assist England, such as the lend-lease program in the face of Isolationists, the description of his reinstatement of the draft, the frantic efforts to build forts to house the new inductees may sound boring. Far from it. It was as fascinating to read as a novel. The description of how Eleanor grew from a scared, insecure woman into a power in her own right and what she accomplished in her lifetime, long before the Women's Movement, was wonderful. I don't think the book needs a broader scope regarding WW II as that can be found in other FDR books. This is the first Doris Kearns Goodwin biography I have read. She is a splendid writer and I now plan to read all of her biographies."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Another spell binding book by Doris...great story teller, who has peaked my interest of how the past is influencing the here and now."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I WOULD RECCOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO AS AN INTEREST IN THE TIME OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR OR FDR AND ELANOR ROOSEVELT.

Liked the inside view of the White House. Gave me details of the war I never knew. Doris Kearns Goodwin is a excellent writer."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I normally am not tremendously interested in history, though I am slowly trying to change my ways. What better way than reading \\"No Ordinary Time\\". Doris Kearns Goodwin is an incredible historian and I marveled throughout at her ability to bring in primary materials and anecdotes to give context and depth to the historical period. This book tells us about Eleanor and Franklin at their peak in the public eye, including the challenges they faced and the factors that played into all of the decisions they made. I think it is particularly important when learning about critical leaders to understand that they were not perfect, but usually made the best out of what they were given. This is particularly true of the Roosevelts, and I considered this a very valuable lesson.I will continue to read works by Doris Kearns Goodwin in order to continue to build my interest in historical works. I wish that she also created a work that tells about WWII in a broader context but alas, this is as close as I can get. Goodwin has incredible talent, as I am sure is echoed in thousands of other reviews."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"My wife and I are reading this at the same time. We have read some of the same books, but never at the same time. Our Kindles allow us to have this pleasure. This flows very easily and the development keeps you wanting to read more. The content contains so many insights that other Rosevelt books have not."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Having read many of the reviews written here, I think that it is important to first state that I am very conservative both economically and politically. Having said that, I want to make sure that it is understood that I am not judging the FDR Presidency, just this book.This is my first real historical look at this time frame in American history and I felt that this book was a very good start from which to look into other avenues of interest during the war years. It is important to keep in mind that the earlier FDR years do not come into the focus of this work. This would not be a good book to judge FDR and the New Deal. It sticks with the years 1940 until FDR's death in 1945.The book is well written and easy to read. It definitely lacks an in depth look at the \\"whys\\" of the FDR decision process. I would have liked to have learned more about the actual war decisions, but in reading the subthe title of the book, it is clear that the focus is about the homefront, not necessarily the war efforts abroad. The internal fighting and family relationships are discussed at length. Eleanor is given a front and center position in this work. I really would have liked to see more of FDR and how the decisions for various strategies were found.There is a liberal bias to the book, but maybe that's my conservative stance showing. Nothing is mentioned in the book other than two sentences about Vice President Wallace. FDR is made to be a Superman, when it could have been read as FDR was merely a dictator that was elected. Without the effect of the decision process, the impression is that all decisions were FDR's alone. And while that may have been the case, the book never clearly states the way many of these ideas came to pass. This book leaves me the impression that much of FDR's time was spent polling the public and then fitting that knowledge into a decision.So yes the book does have weaknesses in my opinion. But the strength of the book is the look at FDR the person. He was a solitary figure that needed a strong group of friends to humor him and help him through a truly horrific time in American history. His family life was a mess - he and Eleanor going in different directions with the purpose of staying apart. But the main thing I took from this work was that FDR gave the country hope. He never said quit, no matter the odds or obstacles. Was he a great President? This book is a very small piece of that puzzle."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I loved this book. In it, Kearns-Goodwin recreates the time frame 1939-1945 like no other book I have read. The Roosevelts, long in power and struggling to overcome personal/physical difficulties, rise to the occasion like few leaders before them. Both children of privilege, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt took on their personal demons (his polio and her, at first, paralyzing shyness) to save the nation. Already dealing with the Great Depression, they were the public face of the war effort. How easy it would have been for FDR to overreach his power (in both the Depression and WWII). Although he was restricted by an isolationist Congress before the attack on Pearl Harbor,he persuaded Congress to ok Lend-Lease, and developed a plan with Churchill (and later Stalin) that eventually led to total victory. While he made some mistakes (internment of Japanese Americans, for example), his optimistic and winning public style balanced nicely with a keen understanding of the power he wielded. Eleanor, for her part, became the paralyzed president's spokesman around the world and at home. She also pushed domestic policy in a way that kept things like civil rights, help for the poor and needy, and better working conditions for labor on the front burner despite the efforts to win the war. Kearns-Goodwin covers it all, including the personal struggles of the First Couple. After it all, they emerge as extraordinary leaders for \\"no ordinary time\\". Few have equaled them before or since."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I usually read mostly fiction, and I bought this book after reading about it in Oprah magazine (it's one of Judy Mueller's favorites). I agree with a lot of what other reviewers have said about this book, and especially of Doris Kearns Goodwin's considerable talent for telling history in the most fascinating and unsentimental way. What I'd like to add for those who may be considering the book is this: if you usually read fiction and you are looking for something new and utterly interesting, get this book. It's well written, researched and just a great read. I was sad when I finished it, like you sometimes feel after you finish a great book of fiction, when you feel like you miss the characters. (Has this happened to you?) Also, the topic of the book - fighting a war against a fascist aggressor - from the POV of the homefront is very timely when you consider the &quot;war&quot; we're fighting now, and how Americans are again being asked to set aside our isolationist tendencies and work to make the world safer. Having read this book, I feel I've got a lot more perspective about the situation."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin writes with a relaxed yet authoritative style. The reader truly feels a connection with the characters. Ms. Goodwin reveals frailties, strengths, rationale, and frames all within various anecdotes that elicits laughter and at times, tears.She is not judgemental, but does interpret events in an acceptably objective framework. FDR may rise above his peers, and Ms. Goodwin does not change that perspective, but the gap between FDR and his peers existed largely due to his strength of belief and a wife whose infidelity by her husband, launched contributions by a First Lady that have not been paralleled since.Truly a fine work."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"No Ordinary Time certainly deserved the Pulitzer it received. Goodwin has fashioned a story that both portrays the epic nature of FDR and Eleanor as well as depict them as human beings, capable of the same kinds of personal idiosyncracies as anyone else.Of all of the many virtues of this book, perhaps its greatest achievement is that it provides such a rich understanding of the pressures of the Office of the President and of the White House. It shows how FDR's and Eleanor's relationship changed and evolved, based both on their feelings for one another but also on the tremendous pressue they were under.Eleanor is depicted as being a farsighted, visionary thinker (and doer), and probably she was the one of this couple who was really interested in creating a new and fairer society. FDR was not an activist by nature, but proved his greatness by responding to two of the greatest threats this country has ever seen -- the Depression and WWII. His whole goal in the late 1930s and early 1940s was to get the USA ready (despite fierce opposition) for the war he knew would come. While Eleanor lobbied him for human rights, worker rights, etc., he had a different set of concerns on his mind, and Goodwin brilliantly recounts this.Goodwin also is masterful in examining their own complex, symbiotic, ever-shifting relationship. She convincingly describes why both Eleanor and FDR felt the need to go outside his marriage for companionship and love, while never apologizing for it or excusing it.As you read this book, you will inevitably gain insight into Bill and Hillary Clinton and their relationship and their public policy efforts. Those who routinely criticize Bill Clinton for his vague and seemingly shifting stances on public issues will see the antecedents in FDR's stance on involvement in WWII.To sum up, this is about as perfect as a biography can get. It is informative, entertaining, dispassionate, and discriminating. It is history that will change how you think about current events. It is an absolute masterpiece."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"This book is quite a feat. It is about the War Years and the Presidency of FDR. It shows how from a underdeveloped nation concerning a war machinery it started to produce more airplanes, weapons, ships and tanks etc. than any nation in the world and which helped the West to win the war.The accounts of the bug summits in Casablanca, Teheran and Yalta are fascinating. Especially concerning Yalta, where the faith of the world and the faith of the president were both decided. The world would have peace soon, FDR would die days after the summit.But besides this big international political themes, politics inside the US is also addressed, especially the war industry and the role of black Americans and women in the war effort. This is done without it being something a historian should answer becase he has too, here it is really well done. In this all the role of Eleanor Roosevelt is highlighted.Another theme through the book is FDR's affair and Eleanor's reaction to it. I won't say too much, but this is also worth reading about. This is the best book about the Roosevelts in the white house during the war I have ever read. It deservidly got the Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Terrific book--but the Kindle version is full on typographical errors-including misspelled names, letters for dates, symbols in place of letters, and spaces placed in the middle of words. A few errors could be tolerated, but an average of one mistake per page distracts the reader signicantly."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Is there anything worse than an intellectual snob? Yes, a psuedo-intellectual snob like brothersjudd with a political agenda. Goodwin's straightforward, rather old-fashioned, biography/history is ctiticized as being for those of &quot;limited intellectual curiosity&quot; because she does not challenge the Roosevelt's living arrangements, or point out some other shortcomings on FDR's part. brothersjudd, coming from a conservative point of view, refuses to acknowledge the exceptional nature of FDR and his achievments (can't give those liberals credit for anything), and therefors finds fault in Goodwin's book because she is not harsh enough on the Roosevelts. But the proof of FDR's greatness is not so much in the affection he engendered in the liberal community, but the respect he earned from conservatives like Churchill and American military leaders. Is there room for criticism, of course, but it should be honest, and not transperantly political."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Kearns-Goodwin brings to life the interesting characters that dominated the political landscape in America's most defining years of the 20th Century. Both FDR and Eleanor are fascinating people and she makes these larger than life characters almost ordinary people. Great insights into the inner workings of the White House and the turbulent but often over looked home front during the Second World War. She is not judgmental and tempers her opinions to remain true to historical content. If you love history with a real human touch, this is a great read."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"For those who say a man must be a good father and husband in order to be a good leader, I recommend this book to you. Authored by one of America's most famous female historians, this book follows the lives of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt thru their 2nd, 3rd and 4th terms in the White House. The book looks at their personal and public lives, and how they influenced each other, and the history of the world. Written in chronological order, the book covers war planning, domestic politics, the race issue, labor relations, the public growth of Eleanor Roosevelt, along with the lives of numerous residents and visitors to the White House such as Winston Churchill, the Roosevelt children and friends, and the many attractive women who intrigued FDR, some of whom were possible mistresses. What comes across is their respective abilities with people. There is Franklin's ability to communicate with people in person or en masse, and to steer them towards a common goal, which is the essence of leadership. Then there is Eleanor's ability to empathize with people, to understand their wants and needs and to work to help them. What also comes across is the story of Washington's first true power couple, both of whom are so occupied with longer horizons that neither can make the concessions needed to create a happy family. It is clear that FDR cheated on his wife, with multiple women most likely. And the book suggests that Eleanor in turn cheated on FDR, though of a less sexual nature. This failure in marital relations was passed onto their children. The 4 sons went thru 18 marriages between them, and their one daughter also went thru a divorce. The book clearly illustrates how sacrifices for public service often include a ruined family life. So overall, a very insightful and important book about American history, and how history is made by people making decisions on a daily basis often under less than perfect circumstances."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"If you enjoy history, this book is a must read.

I knew if I sat down to read it, I'd gain a good 10 pounds by sitting on my rear end for that long. Just by a coincidence, I happened to see these audiotapes being sold here on Amazon for a hefty price. It was the only set of audiotapes I could find. I splurged and listened to the tapes every day for an hour while I walked at my park. I was getting exercise and listening to the book at the same time. I really enjoyed the book and even more so because I was outside getting exercise! These tapes were actually my incentive to go walking every day because I had to finish the book by a certain time to produce a book report. I've held onto these tapes for 2 years now, knowing they were gold to me. I'm finally ready to sell them, so I hope someone else realizes their worth, too.

Afastastic book."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Many say Lincoln was our greatest president because he saved the Union. I say our greatest president was FDR, he saved THE WORLD. Goodwin's examination is scholarly and readable. Its weaknesses are understandable -- she is a social historian, not a military one. Do not look to this book for thrilling descriptions of late night war strategy sessions between the old man and Churchill. Goodwin tries hard to show what the man was truly like to those who knew him. After reading the book I felt as though I knew him too. The book inspired me to visit Hyde Park and I must confess I was a bit choked up when I saw Franklin's humble wheelchair in person.Equally impressive is the author's treatment of Eleanor's personality. She was truly a great figure in Amer"},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"An entire industry has been built out of books documenting the military aspects of the Second World War- the battles, the personalities, the men who fought, etc. The role of the homefront, the efforts of the civilians who made the weapons and supplies used in the battles across the fields of Western Europe and through the seas of the South Pacific, has only now been addressed by historians. At the front of this effort is Doris Kearns Goodwin's &quot;No Ordinary Time&quot;, a wonderful study of the partnership between Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor during World War II, and the role the two played in preparing America to fight WWII and to prosper in the peace that would follow.That FDR was a brilliant President, there is no doubt. He survived reverses which would have crushed a lesser man and displayed a stunning grasp of knowledge as to what people were capable of. His creation of the Lend-Lease program, by which America loaned weapons and supplies to the beleaguered Allies in exchange for repayment in kind, was example of his genius. A wonderfully creative plan to immediately supply England and Russia with desperately needed help by creating a plan that junked the unfeasible loans discussed by American policymakers.That Eleanor Roosevelt was an extraordinary First Lady, a woman who had survived heartbreaking tragedies to carve out a new and extraordinary role for herself, there is no doubt. Goodwin does an outstanding job looking at FDR and ER's roles in one another's lives and uncovering interesting portraits of the two which give the reader a revealing glimpse into what these two were really like.Outstanding book."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"No Ordinary Time is a wonderfully well written biography which tells the story of &quot;Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt -- The Home Front in World War II.&quot; Doris Kearns Goodwin has made a number of choices to tell her biographical story with deceptive simplicity. I personally don't think the book quite manages to completely encompass &quot;The Home Front in World War II&quot; along the way, and I probably didn't want it to; instead it tells the story of the war through the Roosevelts' fascinating circle of White House &quot;family&quot; members, with broader historical themes touching on that story.The personal story works. I've never read quite this sort of parallel biography before. In a lot of ways the relationship between FDR and his astonishingly complex, compassionate wife makes a perfect lens through which to view the times. Goodwin has plenty of chances to let Eleanor's various interests touch on different aspects of American life; hardly anything escapes the first lady's list of interests and causes, so there's no strain to include anything, that's for sure.I sometimes found myself, though, wishing the emphasis was more squarely on biography proper. Four or five times in reading the book, I became momentarily bogged down in passages involving, say, big picture statistics, and wanted to concentrate on the motives and feelings of Eleanor and Franklin again. In particular, Eleanor's various interests often serve to introduce some new social issue, and I wanted to really understand *her* appreciation of things rather than reading a set of statistics she wouldn't have had access to anyway.Honestly, though, No Ordinary Time breathes life into these people. You come away from the book understanding that they could be huge, monumental figures and yet be complex and flawed and very human at the same time. There's no taking away from the heart of the book. It's told well, and it makes a wonderful, rich, rewarding read."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"This is one of the finest books I have ever read about America's involvement in World War II. Not only has Goodwin thoroughly researched her subject, but she knows how to tell it in an easily readable, \\"can't put it down\\" manner. Writing an informative, wonderfully illustrative book about the home front during mankind's biggest, deadliest war is a feat, but making readers feel as if they are actually living and experiencing that time is another accomplishment altogether. Goodwin does this in a book that will be read hundreds of years from now.Anyone who wishes to get the feel for what it was like during this tumultuous time should buy this book, read it, and then read it again.Many people of FDR's inner circle are profiled and narrated, including Lucy Mercer, the woman FDR fell in love with and nearly divorced Eleanor over; Missy LeHand, FDR's personal assistant whom many referred to as his \\"real\\" wife; as well as Ikes, Morgenthau, Stimson and most importantly, Harry Hopkins.Goodwin also debunks some myths about the FDR presidency, both good and bad. Some World War II \\"Did You Know\\" tidbits covered:1. Nearly 105,000 refugees from Nazism reached the U.S., more than any other country. Palestine was second with 55,000. No one disputes that the number should have been much, much higher, but today's attitudes would lead people to believe that we turned everyone away. Footnote - during FDR's presidency, only 3 percent of the population was Jewish - but 15 percent of his appointments were Jewish. Our greatest wartime president was no Anti-Semite.2. The journey of the St. Louis. The author gives adequate attention to one of the great tragedies of the war, and an enormous stain on FDR's legacy.3. Goodwin thoroughly covers the internment of Japanese-Americans - another enormous stain on FDR's presidency. But what is often ignored is the overwhelming pressure on FDR from a tremendous number of people to confine anyone even remotely related to the Japanese. This should not have mattered to FDR, and tragically, it did. One can only wonder if this was part of FDR's dealmaking mentality to accomplish many of his goals to prepare for and wage war. Quite possibly, if he didn't go along with this tragic idea, he many not have received cooperation on many of his other initiatives. People also tend to forget that this was all out war following a tragic, unprovoked attack. Many of the same things are happening to people of Arab decent following the 9/11 attacks, and the Bush administration doesn't hesitate to throw the rule book or Constitution out the window with people of Arab decent, all in the name of fighting terrorism. Rooting out sympathizers and spies was a principle reason in confining the Japanese. This is not a justification for internment, merely part of the reason.4. Eleanor played a big role in trying to convince Congress to pass legislation that allowed British children to come to the U.S. so they could be out of harm's way during the bombing of Britian. William Schulte of Indiana tried to get the provision expanded to include all European children under 16 - including German Jewish children. The provision never made it to the Senate floor for a vote.Goodwin also covers FDR's reasoning and motives behind lend-lease, the brilliant idea to provide war mat&eacute;riel to the Allies when they couldn't afford it. Even Stalin said that lend-lease was one of the biggest factors in winning the war.In short, this is one of the most informative and educational books written yet about what the home front was like, and the thinking and wisdom that went into many of the decisions about the war. It also offers many wonderful insights into FDR and Eleanor, and their complex relationship that was really more of a partnership.This brilliant tome belongs on any World War II bookshelf. I'd give it six stars if I could."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Of the making of books on Franklin Delano and Eleanor Roosevelt there is not end. By any standard they remain two of the most remarkable people to have inhabited the White House, he as one of greatest presidents ever and she as without any serious competition the greatest first lady. Together, they forged a partnership without parallel in the nation's history.In a sense, the book is deceptively delimited. Goodwin ostensibly deals with the Roosevelts and the Home Front during WW II, but in fact this is more like a joint biography of the two. She freely shifts the narrative from the years of 1939-45 to any point in the lives of the two, whether to dwell on their first meeting, to the time in which Franklin was afflicted with polio and his attempted recovery, to Eleanor's upbringing and the sufferings she experienced with alcoholics, to Franklin's adulterous affair that effectively ended his and Eleanor's marriage if not their partnership. So the book ends up as a wide-ranging exploration of the lives of the two main characters, as well the major figures in their lives, whether in the war years or not.Franklin emerges in the book as what he certainly was: one of the truly great presidents in American history (even his detractors need recall that Ronald Reagan called him the greatest president). Virtually every poll of scholars since his lifetime has placed him among our three greatest presidents, but even that can overlook the fact that no president in our history faced more challenges than did Roosevelt, and few dealt with them so successfully. Goodwin is brilliant at showing both Franklin's great strengths as both president and a human being, as well as his weaknesses. As she demonstrates, perhaps no president had a greater sense of what could actually be achieved politically at any moment, as opposed to what ought to be achieved. He was the great master of compromise, at crafting seemingly impossible solutions to intractable problems. Could any other president have conceived the land-lease program that may have been as essential in determining the outcome of WW II? As she quotes Churchill as saying, no other individual of his age thought so globally and comprehensibly as he. And has there ever been a president who generated such confidence in the people as a whole. Whatever his moral shortcomings, his leadership qualities were beyond parallel, and surely no president spoke so brilliantly and directly to the hearts of Americans. Sometimes we don't get the leaders we deserve, but the ones we need.But despite Roosevelt's brilliance as a political leader, Goodwin does not spare in presenting him warts and all. She shows him as someone seemingly incapable of intimacy, despite the hordes of people he needed to surround him at all times. He possessed a host of admirable qualities, but he could also be disappointing, such as his behavior towards Missy Lehand after her debilitating stroke. He is also presented as someone who detested the dirty business of firing someone, someone who would go to the greatest lengths to avoid anything unpleasant, someone who, in fact, comes across as the pampered child he had been. He emerges both as someone worthy of the greatest admiration despite some very real emotional shortcomings.Much the same is true of Eleanor, who while coming across as the nearest thing to a saint as we are ever likely to see in our country, was deeply lacking in a host of human qualities. Goodwin shows her as alternatingly scolding, insensitive of Franklin's momentary needs, as unaffectionate and fearful of sex, as unspontaneous and lacking in humor, as lacking in confidence, and unforgiving of Franklin's unfaithfulness with Lucy Mercer. At the same time, did any American ever have a better heart where the downtrodden and needy were concerned, or any American have some unselfish concern with social and political justice? Throughout the book, Franklin and Eleanor emerge as so admirable in part because they are also so human. These are not marble statues, but they are nonetheless all the more remarkable for all that.Any presidency contains a host of supporting characters, but this was especially so in the Roosevelt administration, largely because of Franklin's need to be surrounded by others. Probably no presidency saw so many people living in the White House as the Roosevelt years. Consequently, the book provides mini-biographies of a score of characters, whether the uber-secretary Missy Lehand, the remarkably gifted though gravely ill Harry Hopkins, the Roosevelt children, Eleanor's friend (and perhaps lover) Hick, or Eleanor's friend Joe Lash. There are also wonderful portraits of such important individuals as Winston Churchill, whose friendship with Roosevelt was one of the reasons for the close cooperation between the U.S. and Britain during the war.Because the basic subject matter is one of our greatest presidents during a period of great crisis, there is an inescapable political element to the book, but the actual tone of the book focuses more on the personalities rather than the issues. I do not find the book the least less successful for that. In fact, I think this book is a wonderful corrective for other biographies that focus more on the New Deal and WW II years as a succession of debates on issues or military crises. I would place this fine book on any short list of books to read about Roosevelt and presidential leadership during the war years."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"This book at 626 pages is so rich in detail that readers may think they are reading \\"War And Peace.\\" This is half history, and half biography of the Roosevelts. Wartime conversations, weapons production, historic meetings, the leaders, their families, and personal anecdotes are all here. You learn that Stalin was an enigma to FDR. That Churchill and FDR were truly kindred spirits. On the homefront numerous changes happened that transformed the USA permanently. Ex: The large scale moving from rural communities to urban manufacturing areas. Women {Rosy the riveter} moved in huge numbers into the work force. The service sector of the economy grew to help them. As in day care, take out food, and laundries. The reader may truly be stunned at just how unprepared the USA was beforethe start of the war. When the readers are done, they will realize that very title is a huge \\"understatement.\\""},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Once again Doris Kearns Goodwin pulls the elusive hare from the historical hat! I have been a fan of hers since reading \\"Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream\\" well over twenty years ago, and after all this time and reading a number of her books, I never cease to wonder at her incredible creative abilities, at her sheer profundity with language, nuance, and always choosing the right word to cast her narrative into exactly the right mode and string the reader along the trail of her entertaining and informative story line. This time out she tackles the single most fascinating period of modern American history, those critical years between the onset of the Depression and the end of World War Two.Here she has chosen to thread her way through both the public and private lives and times of the Roosevelts in the throes of their four successive administrations between 1932 and 1945, in the throes of what was undoubtedly the most momentous and critical period in modern American history. Her powerful prose style lends itself magnificently to the task at hand in terms of describing the principals and the social surround masterfully, and the reader is swept into the waves and eddies of the period, sitting in the catbird's seat as Goodwin describes both the intricacies of FDR's administration and their uneasy, unconventional, and unusual marriage. This is an extremely well researched, insightful and thoughtful study of two enormously complex people at the peaks of the intellectual, social, and political powers, in the midst of a socio-political maelstrom of historical proportions.As described by Goodwin, both Eleanor and FDR become figures of almost Biblical proportions; modern titans committed both to the nation as well as to each other. Yet these two were in many ways living separate lies, and one marvels and the degree of maturity, selflessness, and composure each had to face the issues of both their public and private obligations in the manner they apparently did. Her emerging portrait of FDR is that of a brilliant, charismatic, endlessly witty and wise patrician who steeled himself to the notion of \\"noblesse oblige\\", while Eleanor is painted in what is in many ways a much more sympathetic light, as a long-suffering, patient, loving and ultimately independent woman no longer content to stand quietly in the shadows.This is a very comprehensive, compassionate, and compelling historical biography of the Roosevelts in the context of their times, and is an admirable addition to the growing body of scholarly yet popular works so many recently active American historians like Goodwin, Ambrose, David Kennedy, James Patterson, and Taylor Branch have contributed to our understanding of the United States in the 20th century. I really enjoyed reading this magnificent book by Ms. Goodwin, and recommend it for your history bookshelf. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Although I am an avid history reader, I'd recommend Goodwin's \\"No Ordinary Time,\\" to most readers. Goodwin does not write in the typical non-fiction writing-style by not continually delivering fact after fact. She will dig into the story, isn't afraid to offer opinions from other historians, will often share a first-person quote from letters, interviews, etc.; and will not shy from surmising her own hypotheses on the subject matter.Although the book solely focuses on the Roosevelts during World War II with only passing mention to the New Deal and the Depression, the main body of the text is on the relationship between FDR and Eleanor and their concerted effort to win the war while bettering the American way of life at the same time. With Franklin, Goodwin examines his determination to beat fascism, both before the United States' involvement and after Germany declared war on the US. Key players such as Harry Hopkins, Henry Stimson, George Marshall, Winston Churchill and others make continual appearances in the book.Looking at Eleanor, Goodwin concentrates on her work with the OCD and her persistence at improving civil rights and women's issues. Goodwin does not shy from entering family business, and writes at length about FDR and Eleanor's unconventional relationship, their troubles with their parents, children and in-laws and FDR's early-marriage affair. Goodwin even tackles the controversial topic of Eleanor's alleged alternative lifestyle in very good taste by not gossiping but delivering factual information without jumping to conclusions.Missing from the book is any military view of the war so it helps to know some of the background of the WWII military theaters but is not necessary to still enjoy \\"No Ordinary Time.\\" (I'd recommend Robert Leckie's \\"Delivered From Evil\\" for that aspect). The diplomacy view is also lacking as, for example, Goodwin spends more time on the controversy of Eleanor not going to the Tehran Conference, than the actual issues at the conference itself.That said, I still enjoyed this Pulitzer Prize-winning book and was quite impressed with the amount of information I learned on one of America's greatest president's and the effort this nation put forth on the home front to win the war.- In case any readers of \\"No Ordinary Time,\\" become interested in the colorful Winston Churchill, I highly recommend William Raymond Manchester's \\"The Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill, Alone 1932-1940.\\" Although it covers Churchill before the war, it is written in much the same fashion of Goodwin's book in that it covers both the daily life as well as the international issues. Sadly, Manchester passed on before finishing his third installment in this incredible series."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Goodwin manages to pull off a delicate balancing act in No Ordinary Time. She spends a great portion of the book discussing the consequences of the large issues (race relations, labor/production struggles, military preparedness) facing the country during this period. Yet, she also spends as much time noting the personal issues, like Franklin and Eleanor's struggles with their marriage and the tragic travails of Missy LeHand. The result of this balancing act is a wonderfully complete depiction that gives one an appreciation of not only the complexities of the time, but also of the incredible intelligence and character of the Roosevelts. The comprehensive nature of the book makes it difficult to imagine that a better book on the Roosevelt presidency during World War II can be written.A reader may get a little lost trying to keep track of all the names, especially when they appear only once every fifty or one hundred pages. Fortunately, the index in the back is very useful for finding the first appearance and description of these characters. Still, this minor drawback does not offset the powerful lessons that the book teaches. For those who equate government with partisan bickering and gridlock, it is heartening to know that such conditions existed during World War II, yet were overcome with persistence and ingenuity. For those who did not live thorough those times, it gives a vivid portrayal of the sacrifices and challenges that all Americans endured. Finally, it shows that Roosevelt's belief that people will respond successfully when given a challenge and the freedom to rise to that challenge is true. These are all powerful lessons that not only illuminate our past, but give us a guideline for our future. Ultimately, that is the mark of a successful historical book. Goodwin should be (and has rightfully been) commended for making such a book."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"No Ordinary Time presents a compelling social history of both Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and the development of American society during the war years. Both are exposed for their flaws and both are extolled for their virtues. Doris Kearns Goodwin interweaves an impressive array of primary resource material in chronicalling international and domestic developments. For example, the emotional ups and downs of the Allied war effort are counterposed with excerpts from the diary of Nazi propaganda leader Joseph Goebbels. The progressive views and policies of the Roosevelt administration are aptly pitted with letters to the White House demonstrating the stubborn racism and apathy of many in WWII American society. In the end, Goodwin paints an illustrative picture of both the Roosevelts and their time -- with wonderful accounts of events and attitudes that will surprise a number of readers.Because of Goodwin's approach, the book is equally valuable for what is says about the Roosevelts as what it says about American society during WWII. The Roosevelt marraige is displayed in all its beauty and ugliness. Goodwin aptly demonstrates the irony of the live of the Roosevelts: while they strove ceaselessly to improve the lives of every Amercian, they often manipulated and harmed the very people closest to them, especially each other.At the same time, through splendid research and organization, Goodwin follows America's attitudes on such varied subjects as race, gender equality, labor relations, politics, and the war production effort. No item of domestic concern seems overlooked. In her portrayal of domestic developments, Goodwin chronicles the true beginning of modern American society. And once again, as with her descriptions of the Roosevelts, Goodwin does not hesitate to present American society in all its glory and shame. The wonders of American ingenuity and dedication are countered with the ugliness of the Japanese-American internments and racial biases.Goodwin's account is simply a unique piece of history. While most authors would be unable to portray either the Roosevelts or American society in such brilliant detail, Goodwin pulls both off together in a seemless and impressive account. It is no wonder that this book won the Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"This period of history has always held a special interest for me as I grew up listening to my parents' stories about World War II on the warfront and the homefront. They spoke of FDR and ER but not until I read Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, did these two people cease to become an abstraction. I could not put this book down wanting to know &quot;what happens next...&quot; even though historically you do. It was as though I was sitting and listening to stories about my own parents - that's how intimate the details are that Doris shares with her readers. While it has a novel like quality, the sourcing and accuracy make the book a must for &quot;nightstand historians&quot;. It frames for the reader the context of other books one might have read on Churchill and the other extraordinary people who flowed in and out of the White House during those years. I thought her recounting of the day that FDR died, and the days that followed, was so poignant that I actually cried for the America of 1945 and for those who were closest to him. A visit to Hyde Park is my first stop this summer. Thank you Doris for this wonderful book. You are the best at what you do."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin has written a very enjoyable book. It takes a different view of presidential history by focusing on the family life of Franklin and Elanor Roosevelt and the life enjoyed by their official family during their White House years.By focusing on the perosnal side, this book provides glimpses at facets of the Roosevelt story that are either ignored by standard histories or covered in passing. That is not to say this book is not serious history -- it is -- just from a different vantage point. One is much more likely to learn about FDR the man (and Eleanor the woman) than thay would in say James McGreggor Burn's excellent FDR biography. There are also excellent passages on their relationships with the luminaries who made the time...Churchill, Hopkins, Ikes and the New Deal crew. Since so much related to getting things done revolves around relationships, this focus helps in the understanding of how the great events of the 1930's came to be.The gossipy stuff is in here too -- affairs, the questions surrounding Eleanor's &quot;friends&quot; and FDR's personal foibles and habits. Goodwin to her credit does not treat these issues salaciously, but as part of the story to understanding the Roosevelts.She is an excellent author and has produced a very enjoyable history of her subjects. Can't wait for her upcoming book on the day to day activities of President Lincoln. It she meets this standard, that will be a fascinating book."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Best book I've read in a couple of years, and I read alot. I was hesitant to purchase this book as I know absolutely nothing about politics. Do not let that daunt you. Not only did I learn alot but it has sparked quite an interest for me in a subject I always felt was out of my grasp. I do like autobiographies which is why I bought the book. That and thousands of 4-5 star reviews had to mean something,plus a Pulitzer prize. World war 2 from U.S perspective is also something not written about often, usually staying within European side of things. This book is a perfect blend of the personal and political lives of the Roosevelts. Utterly fascinating, never boring, highly readable. I did not want it to end. Normally know what I'm reading next before I finish a book(I can't be without a book!) I was lost for a week after this. Couldn't get it out of my mind and anything I looked at paled in comparision, nothing interested me, thats how good it is."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"No Ordinary Time is thrilling history as well as deeply personal biography. Kearns Goodwin begins the book on the eve of World War II, and goes on to highlight the distant crises in Europe and the South Pacific while detailing the additional myriad of issues that the home front was dealing with at the same time, in all their nuances and complexity. The book is beautifully, regally written, always accessible no matter what it addressed (yet thankfully a bit more arms-length when detailing FDR's different economic policies and New Deal departments). Where it really shines is in its portraits of FDR and Eleanor, the latter emerging as a fascinating woman, an endlessly interesting mix of strength and insecurity. The book also found the right balance between the fighting abroad juxtaposed with the fighting at home, and gave both their equal time with a great deal of dignity. Kearns Goodwin did a great service with this book, because the years 1940-1945 are understandably focused on the war, at the expense of acknowledging a great deal of positive change that too place in America at warp speed during the same period. Also, it details the many interesting men and women FDR had in his life that made his administration work, including the robust Churchill, whose eccentricities are scattered throughout the book. Most importantly, the book is warm and humane throughout, always entertaining, and very easy to like and enjoy. Necessary reading for any WWII nut, regardless of what you've read before."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I have to admit - Doris Kearns Goodwin is quickly climbing up \\"My Favorite Authors\\" list. She's definitely at the top of \\"My Favorite History Authors\\" list. She is great at making her biographies read like narratives. Just like with Team of Rivals, when I put this book down, I felt like I really understood Franklin and Eleanor as people and not just as historical figures. I connected with them, just like you would connect with characters in a novel. It's funny, because this is exactly what I want in any book, let alone a biography, but it's very difficult to find history books that can accomplish it.No Ordinary Time looks at Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt's relationship during World War II (1939 and 1945). If you're looking for a deep dive into the New Deal or a lot of information about Franklin's early political life, this book won't give it to you. Kearns Goodwin does provide relevant and well-timed flash backs throughout the book to put Franklin and Eleanor's actions in to the larger context of their life together. She provides some background on Eleanor's early life, including her father's death and it's impact on her upbringing, Franklin's relationship with his mother and it's impact on his marriage, and his affair with Lucy Mercer and its continuing reverberations throughout their lives. She spends some time discussing Franklin's battle with polio, but not much, except in the context of Eleanor's care for him and how it enabled her to build an identity of her own. Eleanor and Franklin pretty much get equal treatment and their relationship and life together is almost a third character in the story.As a secondary theme of this book, Kearns Goodwin uses their life together and Eleanor's personal missions to illustrate the key domestic issues in the U.S. during World War II. While this book would be half-complete if it didn't include information about the battles and military decisions of the war, it does not re-hash or be-labor them. It focuses much more on what was going on within the U.S. As an example, I felt like I got a really good look at race relations in the U.S. during WWII through this book. I hadn't realized so many small steps towards equality had been taken during the war, especially in the armed forces.Overall, this was a great book. I learned a ton and enjoyed reading it. I have no doubt I'll go back and read it again in a few years."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin hit it out of the park with this one. (Please excuse the obvious baseball metaphor.) The book is a biographical study of Franklin & Eleanor during the FDR years in the White House. The subject itself has all the potential of being a very factual yet boring Sleeper. However, with the author's skill, it turns out to be a biographical Page-Turner. So often books about the FDR administration tend to be either printed tributes to the Roosevelts OR simply a negative display of the author's political differences with the FDR legacy. The book \\"No Ordinary Time\\" shows a more humanistic view of two people that left very large foot prints as they went through life. Coincidently, they happened to be in the center of the world's stage at the time. The reader is left to interpret the consequences of those foot prints."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"The author took a big risk in focusing on the personal side of these two biography titans within the context of their experience during WWII. She succeeds in using the familiar story of WWII and the depression era to set the context for the development of FDR and Eleanor's character and achievements. These are two larger than life individuals, driven by their experiences to face great trials and shape the modern American future. As in reading a Lincoln biography, I marvel at the depth and breadth of issues faced in their public lives. Politics and content. Strategy and tactics. Vision and leadership. The personal side is less heroic and more tragic. Both Eleanor and FDR were mere humans, driven by experience, pursuing mixed ends, winning and losing, embracing temptation and acting selfishly. This is excellent biography, providing true insight into character. The book is a bit long and sometimes the stories are longwinded. The CD is a good drive-time companion."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I am 2/3 through this fabulous book and, although I am reserving my final opinion until the last page, I truly feel this will be my favorite book of my nearly 70 years on this planet. WWII is my reader hot button. I am a great Stephen Ambrose fan and enjoy most authors writing about WWII. However, No Ordinary Time is the missing link that neatly ties it all together. Doris Kearns Goodwin is a genius! Meanwhile, I am savoring the remaining pages. I don't want this book to ever end."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"After listening to an abridged audio of this book, I bought the paperback as Kearns-Goodwin is a master at getting to the heart of individuals she chronicles. I was not disappointed - the book richly fills in the details which the abridged audio simply must omit. I became a fan of Kearns-Goodwin after reading \\"Team of Rivals\\" about Abraham Lincoln's decision to include in his cabinet those who rivaled his nomination for the presidency. Both Roosevelt and Lincoln led our nation through some of its most troubling history. Eleanor's influence on FDR, and her subsequent personal journey after his infidelity, are touchingly described through interviews and comments from those closest to her. The mutual influence each had on the other's ability to understand the times and lead the nation through the depression and world war - he in the political and economic sphere, and she through her insights into the social impact of governmental policy - are interwoven with accounts of the personal tradegies which fractured their marital relationship yet strengthened their love and respect for the other. Throughout the narrative it seems Goodwin keeps in mind the sentiment that gave great comfort to Eleanor after FDR's death: \\"They are not dead who live in lives they leave behind. In those whom they have blessed they live a life again.\\""},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Growing up in the 1930s, my father knew of only one US President and First Lady until he was 16-years-old--Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt. With remarkable skill and feeling, noted historian Goodwin in \\"No Ordinary Time\\" tells the story of likely the most remarkable couple of the 20th century. She focuses on the American home front and Roosevelt home front during the period surrounding and including World War II, when FDR prepared the country for war and served as a visionary world leader in the battle to defeat Germany, Japan, Italy and other Axis powers. Eleanor Roosevelt, the most politically active First Lady in US history, spearheaded and pressed her husband on various issues on the home front - segregation, housing, child care, among many others - while she was held at arms length or further away from conduct of the war. Somewhat estranged emotionally since Franklin's affair with Lucy Mercer years earlier, the couple still worked together brilliantly in what Goodwin aptly refers to as \\"No Ordinary Time.\\"She also paints a superb picture of life in the White House, where friends of both Franklin and Eleanor lived for extended periods as if in a small hotel, and provides detailed portraits of the various characters there - FDR confidant Harry Hooper, his secretary Missy LeHand, Princess Martha of Norway, Eleanor's great friend Lorene \\"Hick\\" Hickok, young soldier Joe Lash, and daughter Anna Roosevelt, who served as FDR's personal secretary during the last year of his life. Using White House ushers' diaries as a primary source, she meticulously recounts daily lives - bad food from a White House chef that FDR was too tenderhearted to hire, guests and drinks at cocktail hour, and motoring junkets (one of FDR's passions) into the countryside.The Roosevelts' several second homes are featured as well - the family estate at Hyde Park with Eleanor's separate cottage; Shangri-La (now Camp David) in Maryland, Eleanor's apartment in New York City, and the Little White House in Warm Springs, GA, where FDR battled polio in his 30s and eventually died at age 63.In a bittersweet denouement, now widowed Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd returns to FDR's life to provide emotional support as his body fails. Five stars to all readers, and especially to older Baby Boomers like me who can learn what FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt meant to their country and to each other during the lives of our parents."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Seemingly hundreds of books have been written about Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. Books about Franklin, written from his point of view, can be critical of Eleanor - her tendency to nag, her seriousness, her lack of personality. Similarly, books about Eleanor, written from her point of view, can be critical of Franklin - his deceptions, arrogance, and self-centeredness. \\"No Ordinary Time, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II,\\" written by historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, provides a unique perspective in telling the stories of both Franklin and Eleanor, incorporating each point of view into the story, describing them both as individual people and as part of a troubled yet fascinating partnership. Written in narrative form, Goodwin chronicles the war years on the home front, beginning in May of 1940 and ending in December of 1945, combining the story of the Roosevelts with that of regular Americans to demonstrate the unique relationship that was created between government and the people, making this truly \\"no ordinary time\\" in American history.In \\"No Ordinary Time,\\" Franklin Roosevelt is fleshed out as a charming and charismatic figure who comes to inspire the nation through his \\"ebullient energy\\" and unlimited confidence, not only in himself, but in the country. Although he came from a wealthy, aristocratic family, Roosevelt was able to empathize with the poor and underprivileged after a bout with polio left him crippled. Although he never allowed himself to be seen in his wheelchair, and most Americans did not realize the extent of his disability, Goodwin describes one poignant scene when the president went to visit troops in Oahu and specifically asked to be wheeled around the hospital ward slowly - to, in effect, put himself, his disability, and his vulnerability on full display, so that troops who had lost arms or legs could see \\"living proof of what the human spirit could do.\\"His unique ability to transmit his own perpetual cheerfulness and optimism to others was what defined his leadership. According to Goodwin, more than any previous president, Roosevelt studied public opinion (reading newspapers, analyzing polls, securing different points of view), allowing him to understand the national temperament. Even more than that, he wanted to connect to the American people. Prior to one of his fireside (radio) chats, he asked Americans to buy a map to have before them as they listened to his speech. Americans rushed to buy maps, and eighty percent of the audience was listening to the radio as Roosevelt explained to them the situation in each part of the world, bringing the war to life, so Americans could better understand the challenges they were facing and be more prepared for a new kind of war being fought on every continent. Not only did these fireside chats allow Americans to connect with their president, they allowed Americans to connect them with each other. Describing the scene on the Chicago Midway during a fireside chat, novelist Saul Bellow explained how all the taxi drivers were pulled over by the side of the road with their radios on, so that he didn't miss a word of the speech as he walked by their cars: \\"You felt joined to these unknown drivers, [. . . .] not so much considering the President's words as affirming the rightness of his tone and finding assurance from it.\\" Through his leadership, Roosevelt inspired a country that had just been through an economic depression and that was woefully underprepared for a global war to come together and re-establish itself as the world's preeminent superpower.Like her husband, Eleanor Roosevelt also forged a unique relationship with the American people. Although she too had grown up in a wealthy, aristocratic family, unlike her husband she suffered through an unhappy childhood, leading to a lack of confidence and various bouts with depression. She lived a conventional subservient life as Franklin's wife up until she discovered his affair with Lucy Mercer. At that point, she decided she would no longer depend on another person for fulfillment and happiness and embarked on her own independent life devoted to her own interests, including teaching, writing, and participating in various political causes. She was not a conventional first lady but rather \\"challenged the traditional sense of what was possible\\": she was the first wife of a president to hold a government job, testify before a congressional committee, hold press conferences, write a syndicated column, and earn money as a lecturer. She didn't limit her role to staying at the White House and hosting social events, believing, if she did, she \\"would lose touch with the rest of the world.\\" Instead, she traveled the country, observing poverty in Appalachia and sweatshops in Puerto Rico firsthand, reporting back to her husband when she found workers making less than minimum wage in one town. She witnessed the devastation of the war herself, also, as she traveled to Britain and to the Pacific. After seeing \\"the mangled bodies, the stomachs ripped by shells, the amputated limbs, the crushed spirits,\\" she fell into a depression, trying to come to terms with her \\"emotionally disturbing\\" trip. Like her husband, she empathized with the American people and, even more than him, was determined to raise the consciousness of our country, fighting against Japanese internment and for women's rights in the workplace, an increased role for African Americans in the workplace, and less restrictive rules to allow refugees into the United States.Characterizing Eleanor as the agitator and Franklin as the politician, Eleanor as the one who thought about what should be done while Franklin thought only of what could be done, and contrasting Eleanor's shyness and insecurity with Franklin's confidence and sociability, Goodwin makes it clear just how different Eleanor and Franklin were. Realizing their inability to fulfill each other's needs, they established largely independent lives where they turned to others for comfort - Franklin to his \\"real wife\\" Missy LeHand, his gossipy cousins, and his aide Harry Hopkins, and Eleanor to her young political activist friend Joseph Lash and a circle of feminist friends, including newspaper reporter Lorena Hickok. Even after Franklin grew lonely as Missy and Hopkins drifted away and turned to Eleanor in the hopes they could re-establish a more traditional marriage, she refused, later writing to Lash that she felt there was \\"no fundamental love to draw on, just respect and affection.\\" Yet, Goodwin makes it clear that there was a bond between them that could not be broken. In one particularly affecting passage, Goodwin quotes from Eleanor's son, who describes the aftermath of his uncle Hall's death: \\"'Hall has died,' Eleanor told Franklin simply. Father struggled to her side and put his arms around her. 'Sit down,' he said, so tenderly I can still hear it. And he sank down beside her and hugged her and kissed her and held her head on his chest. . . . . For all they were apart both physically and spiritually much of their married life, there remained between them a bond that others could not break.\\" This bond was not just from nearly forty years of marriage, but from the common cause they were joined in - to better the lives of Americans. In order to advance this cause, they drew strength from each other, together creating a far different America than the one that existed when Franklin Roosevelt first took office.While it is clear that Goodwin has deep admiration for Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, she also establishes them as fully-fleshed characters - visionary, courageous, and brave, but also deeply flawed. In fleshing out their characters, she also succeeds in creating a third character, that of the American people. When Franklin Roosevelt began his second term, one-third of Americans had no running water or indoor plumbing, more than half had no central heating, and only one-fourth had even graduated from high school. America was a \\"pyramidal society,\\" with a few fortunate on the top and a great mass of people at the bottom. During the war, though, Americans moved from the farm to the factory, from the south to the north, from the east to the west, as war production led to the emergence of the middle class and created the \\"most profound transition in American history.\\" Most importantly, through innovations like the minimum wage, labor protection, social security, and market regulation, a new relationship between the American people and their government was formed. Franklin Roosevelt's importance is felt most at the end of the book, as Goodwin poignantly describes the public's reaction to his death - \\"everybody is crying\\" - and the long railroad trip as his body is carried from Georgia to Washington, with Eleanor looking out the window of the train and seeing hundreds of thousands of people whose lives he had touched gathered along the way to pay their tribute. In recounting the lives of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, and their impact on America, Goodwin shows readers why this was \\"no ordinary time,\\" creating a vivid portrait of what American life on the home front was like during the second world war and bringing this incredible time in American history alive."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin won the Pulitzer Prize for this book and it is an award she richly deserves. This book is basically a study of Franklin Roosevelt's role as the Commander-in-Chief on the home front. \\"His leadership of the home front was the essential condition of military victory.\\" Kearns Goodwin adds, \\"To understand Roosevelt and his leadership is to understand the nation whose strengths and weaknesses he mirrored and magnified.\\" At the same time, she also studies the relationship between the President and his wife. Eleanor Roosevelt was no ordinary First Lady and made a real effort to shape policy. \\"At a time when her husband was preoccupied with winning the war, Eleanor Roosevelt insisted that the struggle would not be worth winning if the old order of things prevailed\\" (p. 10 for all quotes).As a book designed for the general public, \\"No Ordinary Time\\" is exceptionally well-written. There is a general belief, though, that popular historians often sacrifice substances for form and high sales. While there is something to that that view, it is totally off the mark in this case. In writing this book, Kearns Goodwin challenges an old idea that FDR subscribed to: that wars kill domestic reforms. Many political historians of the Progressive Era, the Jazz Age, the New Deal, and the Fair Deal have argued various points associated with viewpoint: did the First and Second World Wars kill off the prewar reform movements, or just put them on hold; was the movement for change that followed each conflict a continuation of the prewar cause or were they something different. Kearns Goodwin argues instead that Eleanor Roosevelt was largely successful; that reform and social change continued during the war. The conflict had a transforming effect on American society and did not kill the New Deal, despite what FDR said. She supports this point with a number of good examples, arguing there is a direct link between the New Deal and the Fair Deal.Kearns Goodwin got into trouble a few years back with charges of plagiarism on another book. Putting the merit of those accusations aside--it was after all a different project--one need not worry about this book. Kearns Goodwin offers her readers a wonderful read and some thought provoking views of the past. It is a book that will appeal to generalists and specialists alike. It is well worth both your time and money."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"We may think we know all there is to know about Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, but Doris Kearns Goodwin shows in this well-written and fascinating book that we only *thought* we knew the whole story.This book is full of intimate moments, as told by those who were present to see them. Beautiful detailed, interesting and colorful, this is a layered and nuanced description of life in the Roosevelt White House during those turbulent years between 1940 and 1945.What I wasn't expecting, and what turned out to be a delightful surprise, was the discussion of what life was like on the Homefront for average Americans during this time. This made extraordinary reading.For those who are interested in history, this must be added to your list of titles. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I know another five star rating. But She deserves it. Doris Kearns Goodwin's best book. I felt as if I was living their lives through the words of Mrs. Goodwin.The very essence of this marriage made a story which is better than any fiction novel. The formative years of both Franklin and Eleanor's lives tells us of the impending marriage of convenience. The starting of a family, along with the tragedy of the death of one of their offspring, tells us of their early life together. The later relationship with Lucy Mercer exposes us to an altered marriage in which Eleanor becomes a truly effective politician in her own right who in turn effected national policy.Mrs. Goodwin should be commmended for this truly human account of the Franklin Roosevelt period. Her writing was accurate yet highly entertaining. I learned a lot of this Brahman Family. Winston Churchill understood this family as no one else did. It wasn't until Mrs. Goodwin explained this period of extraordinary American History that I really understood the effect of their lives on the American public.

Goodwin uses her amazing skills to weave the story of two remarkable and very human people into and through a momentous time in the world's history. While she sometimes gets slowed down by statistics of limited value (for example how many rubber bands were collected in rubber drive) overall the writer has found a brilliant balance between facts, feelings and remembrances. The book's main revelations center mainly on the enormous contribution ER made to race relations and labor relations during that desperate time. One comes to feel that if not for FDR's hyperactive, agitating wife little or no social progress would have been made during the war years. I have read several biographies of FDR and Churchill and was still enriched by the layers of detail Goodwin has brought to her work, highly recommended."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Another tour de force by Goodwin. Like her \\"Team of Rivals\\", this book is a fascinating, compelling account of a fascinating, compelling period in our history. Kearns relates in great detail the many forces and waves that buffeted the American people as they geared up to face the immense challenge facing them and the Allies. I was a child then and remember a few things, especially the tension showed by the adults -- tensions I didn't understand. This book bears testament to the greatness -- the flawed greatness -- of FDR. His pragmatism and his ability to inspire his countrymen were invaluable tools as he strove to marshal a nation that was totally unprepared for war. What was surprising to me was Eleanor Roosevelt. Kearns paints her, warts and all, and the warts were plentiful. The impression I get of Eleanor was that she was a fierce liberal who saw the war not as an existential challenge to her country, but as an rare opportunity to get in place her extreme liberal agenda. I really don't think she saw the war as her husband did. She did a lot of good, particularly in helping eliminate racial barriers. But she hated corporations -- the very companies that made it possible for our nation to go to war with the resources they needed, especially petroleum. She tended to be blinded by her leftwing ideology and simply didn't understand or care about whether or not the private sector had the incentives to make the massive changes that turned us into the Arsenal of Democracy. FDR got it; Eleanor didn't. Also, this book reveals the very human side of its protagonists, especially the very strange relationship between the president and the first lady. Well, I could go on, but suffice it to say that this is a very profound book which reveals the tenor of one of the most challenging times in our history. If you're a Baby Boomer, especially if you have never studied much about the WWII homefront, you absolutely have to read this book. The times it chronicles are the foundation upon which the modern America is built. Kudos to Kearns Goodman for an outstanding piece of work."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin did a remarkable job of not only recounting the hietorical events which took place from 1940 to 1945 but especially of giving us - the readers - an insight into the feelings and behavior of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanot Roosevelt and all the people surrounding them during this particularly trying period of time in our history. I was really impressed by the way she gained the insignts she did and by her skill as a writer in presnting them to us. All too often we learn about history as if it is merely a series of events which can be presented to us in a chronological chart denoting what happened and the date that it took place. Here, in this book, Goodwin filled in the \\"spaces\\" among the events by revealing to us how people felt not only about the events but also about one another as they tried to use their roles in life to move what was taking place in a direction which they felt was desireable.Franklin Roosevelt is portrayed as the consummate politician - practicing politics as \\"the art of the possible\\" ususually with a sense of what it was desireable to do, but always attending to the matter of how far he could go in the pursuit of what he felt should be done without loswing the powere which his position enabled him to exercise. Eleanor Roosevelt is portrayed both as a heroine - if you agree with her ideals and admire her peristent desire to bring about the changes she thinks should occur in our society - and as a very insensitive person blinded to her own egotism bu what she thought were her ideals. A complicated person, she seems ofte toplace her own needs ahead of every thing else because she is utterly convinced of the worthiness of the causes she espouses and the impotance of the role she must play in bringing them about. The relationship between Frnklin and Eleanor forms a great part of this story and leaves the reader with many questions to ponder, particularly with the effect that they both had on their children as they, themselves, played the role of mother and father.As the story is unfolded about this \\"no ordinary time\\" Goodwin does not spare us the painful exposure to the shortocomings of our society, particularly with reference to the treatment of Blacks and Jews which was so evident during this time. Over and over again we are reminded of the all too prevalent himan disosition to place nationality and culture and race ahead of humanity in defining our relationships with one another.She is an excellent historian and writer and I reccomend this book enthusiastically to any one."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"This book is a triumph!

Doris Goodwin has a unique ability to transport the reader to the very time and place of her subjects."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"As a student of history, I found this book to be a classic gem. Doris Kearns Goodwin is a truly gifted author with a keen insight into American political history. This book made me feel like I knew the Roosevelt's well and that I was a part of that time (which I wasn't). Reading like a diary, the pages flowed beautifully back and forth from Franklin's world into Eleanor's life, and vice versa. It made me realize how truly special the Roosevelt's were and that together they devoted their lives to keeping this country alive and the world safe from Nazis. Regardless of what conclusion one would make about the Roosevelt's personal lives, it is clear that they had an understanding of what kind of working business relationship they both needed to keep this country working well. What a team effort during the most crucial period of American history during the past century. As soon as I finished this book, I bought Wait Till Next Year, a memoir by Doris Kearns Goodwin.

Doris Kearns Goodwin takes a personal approach to history by presenting the ideas and emotions that shaped history. She peers into FDR's private life, showing the dynamic relationships he had with his wife, daughter, consultants, and mistress. She paints a picture of a strong willed man who expects what he demands, crafting international treaties and agreements as he desires; yet she also explains the losses that tug at his heart and make him human."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Throughout the book, No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The American Home front during World War II, the Pulitzer prize winning author Doris Kearns Goodwin strives to depict Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt not just as political powerhouses of the mid twentieth century, but as actual human beings with genuine emotions. Goodwin attempts to bridge the gap between the personal happenings of the Roosevelt family and the historical events of the Second World War.Through working for Lyndon B Johnson and teaching a course at Harvard University titled, \\"The American Presidency,\\" Goodwin has acquired a vast experience with understanding and interpreting the actions of Presidents. While working under Lyndon B Johnson as a White House Fellow and an assistant, Goodwin acquired a new found interest in the diverse personalities surrounding the president; this experience played a huge part in her interpretation of FDR's personal assistant Missy Lehand. Although many biographers overlook the influence of personal assistants, Goodwin consistently emphasizes the importance of Missy on the daily life of President Roosevelt.As the book opens at the beginning of FDR's third term, the reader is presented with a truly bizarre menagerie that is known as the Roosevelt White House. Franklin and Eleanor have separate bedrooms, Lorena Hickcock, Eleanor's \\"special friend\\" lives in the bedroom across the hall from the first lady. Sara Roosevelt, Franklin's mother, is frequently on hand, as are Harry Hopkins, Franklin's advisor, Princess Martha of Norway, whom FDR shares a very intimate relationship with, and the list of colorful characters goes on. Yet, Goodwin assures us that all of these relationships are perfectly straightforward and innocent. The book is essentially told through the perspective of those surrounding Franklin and Eleanor; thus giving the reader the feeling that they are also a part of the hustle and bustle of the White house. Due to the large amount of secondary characters, Goodwin fails to give certain personalities justice in their descriptions; therefore it is often difficult to keep each person straight. Lucky for Goodwin, the diaries and letters of the hundreds of Roosevelt's companions provide a strong basis for writing a book about the president. The book is made up of personal accounts of what living in the White House was like. Goodwin does a beautiful job tying these accounts together and her use of primary sources really enhances the book. Although Goodwin does not recreate hypothetical discussions; the usage of diary entries really makes the stories come to life. Through reading, it becomes obvious that Roosevelt needed to have people surrounding him at all times. Without the assurance and advice of his closest companions Roosevelt could not have functioned, never mind governed the largest political power of the time. Goodwin attributes Roosevelt's need to be in the company of a variety of people with his overbearing mother and her influence on his childhood.The Narrative switches off between the comings and goings in the Roosevelt White house and the major events shaping World War Two. Goodwin eloquently synthesizes the two making it easy to see a direct correlation between FDR's decisions and the many outcomes of the war. Due to the fact that Goodwin only briefly describes Franklin and Eleanor's childhood, there are many dots left unconnected. It would be easier to understand Franklin's many idiosyncrasies if the reader had a background on his early life. Instead Goodwin decides to start the book at the pinnacle of FDR's political career, consequently robbing the reader of an in depth understanding of how Franklin Roosevelt became the President. Goodwin shies away from the controversies surrounding Eleanor's sexual preferences, and the names Lillian Faderman and Blanche Wieson Cook are never brought up (CANON). It seems that the author takes great pride in exposing Franklin Roosevelt for the ladies man that he truly was but only addresses certain aspects of Eleanor's life.Furthermore, Goodwin chooses to place emphasis on the luxurious lives of the Roosevelt's, rather than the disenfranchised American common man. It becomes easy to forget the unstable state that the American people were faced with at the time; one has to remember while reading that not every family has an estate in Hyde Park or copious amounts of virtually everything. One needs to keep in mind that, eight years of the New Deal has still left the country with a seventeen percent unemployment rate. However, Goodwin assures the reader that the New Deal has been a resounding victory. Now, a second crisis approaches, World War Two, which is even more fearful than the Depression. Yet, Goodwin describes the situation as if there was no chance of the Nazis winning and holding power over the World. Little is said about the personal sacrifices individual American's were making every day on the home front. Instead Goodwin focuses on the battles happening overseas and the president's reactions to pivotal events. The average American people of the time are viewed merely as helpless beings in need of rescuing by Franklin's policies and Eleanor's social endeavors.When FDR faced a decision that fairly few Presidents' have ever contemplated, the question, \\"Should I run for a third term?\\" George Washington was one of the few, who could have actually won a third term, but he considered it more important that the Nation be governed by laws and not men, therefore he stepped down from the presidency. Following his example, no other President, with the exception for Theodore Roosevelt, had made the decision to run for a third term. Nevertheless Goodwin barely acknowledges the fact that FDR's decision to run was a significant step on the way to the Imperial Presidency. Later, when FDR actually runs and wins a fourth term in office, Goodwin, not only ignores this subject but she continues to overlook the fact that Roosevelt was a dying man, with a very slight chance of finishing his term. In Roosevelt's eyes it was an, \\"act of extraordinary irresponsibility to put the country in a position where it would be governed by a virtual unknown in time of war.\\" But by this time, as one observer remarked \\"[...] he had ceased to be a person; he was simply the president. If something was good for him, it was good; if it had no function for him as president, it didn't exist.\\" This mindset was exactly what George Washington did not want in the President of the United States to have. Yet, Goodwin neglects this \\"minor\\" indiscretion and plays off FDR's power hungry need to be in control as merely a trait that made him a great leader.Personally I enjoyed reading, No Ordinary Time; I now have a newfound fascination with the relationships between first ladies and the presidents. I think that Goodwin did a wonderful job in depicting the Presidents personality and his unique way of going about things. The author's use of primary sources, especially the letters between Eleanor and her daughter Anna really helped me look at the Roosevelt family in a new light. Although at some points Goodwin left me wanting to know more about certain topics like internment camps, I got the feeling that Goodwin purposely omitted certain facts because of her own personal adoration for FDR. In addition I wish that the author would have discussed Franklin's childhood and early political career, more in depth. I really liked how Goodwin described what was going on in the White house and then immediately jumped to the daunting situation overseas. The organization style is what makes this book so profound; it is obvious that Doris Kearns Goodwin put a lot of thought into the order of each paragraph. Furthermore, through reading this book it becomes obvious that the modern day presidency would not exist without the influence of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. FDR essentially revolutionized the office of the presidency and provided a transition between the early twentieth century presidents and what we see the executive office as today. I would recommend this book to anyone who claims that FDR is the worst president of all time, because this book really shines a positive light on FDR's third and fourth term on president and it provides a deep look into the emotions of the thirty second president of the United States.All in all the Book, No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War Two, provides the reader with deep insight into the inner workings of the White house at one of the most pivotal times in History. Goodwin really serves her purpose of both bridging the gap between the White house and World War Two, and providing insight into the human inside one of the most influential leaders of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"this is one of the finest books I've read on World War II. I read it several years ago &amp; was going to read it again but instead opted for the audio version. To me, Edward Hermann is the next best thing to FDR. This is Doris Kearns Goodwin's finest work. This a social history. It is about life in the White House during World War II. FDR surrounded himself with people whom he loved &amp; who loved him. But it is also about what the president needed. What he needed was a support system as he dealt with the war. He had a grand plan. It was like a blueprint. But the only copy was in his mind &amp; only he knew how all the parts fit. Eleanor shows up from time to time to generally bum him out. Where her council was valuable on domestic issues during peace time she became a depressed head case when FDR didn't need her as much, the war becoming his top priority. The war was all a healthy man could handle &amp; FDR was not well. She did not see his declining health &amp; pushed him. Her hectoring drove him back to the old love of his youth, Lucy Rutherford. She gave him what he needed in his last days without asking for anything in return. This book is not an easy read necessarily but it is easy to stay with &amp; is throughly enjoyable. America has been lucky to have great leaders in her times of greatest crises, (Washington, Lincoln &amp; FDR ), who were equal to the task."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"An incredibly thorough historical account of a remarkable couple that reads like a novel. The research was exhaustive--right down to the first couple's appointment books. You will walk away from this book confirmed of FDR's greatness (as a President, not as a husband) and thoroughly impressed at the too often unheralded accomplishments of Eleanor. Her civil right's record is greater than almost any other resident of the White House. Goodwin tells the story through the voices of those who lived it (with quotes from presidential advisers, internment camp residents, soldiers, factory working wives and mothers, etc...). This style proves very effective."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I read this book about four years ago and, to this day, it is still one of the three best works of non-fiction I've ever read in my 34 years. Ms. Goodwin has become one of favorite historians and I'm always interested in her perspective of current events. Her book made the Roosevelts more human and their story even more poignant and sometimes absolutely exasperating. Sometime in the future, I plan to read this one again. I have recommended this book to many people who agree with me that this is an exceptional work."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Doris Goodwin, althouth not a historian by trade, is an excellent storytelleer. In this volume, she attempts to understand WWII and the ensuing Cold War as product of two personalities -- Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. What makes this book compelling, and perhaps better than most of the other Roosevelt biographies, is Goodwin's ability to place together the varied pieces of FDR's private life, and then use it as a map to understand the public man. She spends much time on the unusual -- if not bizarre -- living arraingments in the White House during WWII. Harry Hopkins living in one room; Churchill in another; secretary Missy LeHand in another. And Eleanor had here own set of overnight guests and companions as well. But she doesn't make note of this for salacious reasons; rather, she points to it as evidence of Franklins unusual needs and quirks that were essential to his fullfilling his presidential duties. One could only wonder, she posits at one point, what the modern media would make of the Roosevelt White House. All in all, the book is an accurate, and sometimes spectacular, portrayal of the Roosevelt White during that most turbulent time. Goodwin does, on occassion, get a bit preachy and even philosophical about FDR's impact on the country and the world. It is, nonetheless, a fine effort."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"This book may well be the best history ever written about FDR and ER. It is definitely the best work written about them in the last ten years.It is, of course, a very scholorly book, but it is also, surprisingly, a very readable book. It covers major aspects of their lives, and minor aspects of their lives. I wish all history books were like this one.This book goes very far in showing why FDR was the best President of the United States to ever hold the office. Lincoln was present durning the civil war. Washington was the first President. Wilson held office durning the First World War. But FDR held office and guided the country through two of its great crisis's - the great depression and world war two. That is what makes FDR the best President to ever live in the White House."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"My dad was a young man when FDR was President.

This is no exception. Her research is exhaustive. She let's you in to the principle player's lives with perspectives offered by people around them. It is fascinating how she can approach a character and make you understand how they think an operate under the most unusual set of circumstances. FDR and his wife certainly had an unuasual relationship and it is quite difficult to understand. Yet, Goodwin's style is engrossing in that she let's you \\"peek under the hood\\" so the aspects of their relationship is so easily understood and felt by the reader.This is a fascinating study of FDR and those around him in the WWII years of his life.

The documented details deal with such interesting facts as the three mistresses of Franklin who often lived in the White House at the same time as well as Eleanor's lover who also moved in there and stayed for years. Without today's instant access to news, traveling with adoring and well cared for print reporters, FDR was protected by the media, ruled by Executive Order and wanted to be President for life which indeed he was. This is a cautionary tale of how the sometime political abuse and executive policies of a man who loved being President but got tired of governing and wrestling with complicated problems, worked against African Americans, Japanese Americans and the Jews in Europe."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"This book is fascinating.

The weight reduction using the Kindle outweighed the issue with the OCR, leading to a 4 stars review."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Whatever the academic infractions allegedly committed by Ms. Goodwin in writing this book were, she has produced an excellent work that lays bare in detail the workings of FDR's White House during the Second World War from May 1940 onward when Nazi Germany ended the phony war and stampeded over France and Europe to the doorstep of Britain before turning on Soviet Russia. This is a story that in general terms most literate persons know or should know and it is precisely this legacy, not Ms. Goodwin's academic credentials, that sardonic critics of this work and its author seek to disparage. When read in conjunction with Steve Neal's excellent monograph on Wendell Willkie or similar works, a vivid picture of this historical period and its life and death issues for the future of humanity emerge in the context of a distinct theme: that the prospect of an imminent victory of Nazi Germany and fascism in the late 30s and early 40s was viewed with complacency, not by the epochal FDR and \\"liberals\\", but by a wide section of conservatives and the \\"America First\\" leaning right wing, including all the principal Republican Presidential candidates in 1940 (except for maverick Willkie), whose conciliation of fascism, as in the post-war era in Latin America, was consistent with their deep hostility to FDR and the \\"socialism\\" of the New Deal from which they sought to return to the good old days of the laissez-faire capitalism of the Gilded Age in which obstacles to their unrestrained profits like the graduated income tax, social security and labor unions were eliminated."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"There are only a couple of prominent historical authors that I would put in the same class as our native Pittsburgh author, David McCullough. Goodwin is most definitely in this class as an author. Not only is the research of her topic concerning FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt during 1939 to the death of FDR in 1944 impecable, her writing is so riveting, that I found it near impossible to put the book down. I certainly didn't read anything else until I finished this book.I never could understand why my parents who grew up during this time period kind of bad mouthed FDR. I suspect it was from hearing their own parents, who were conservative. AFter reading this book, I understand their attitude even less...I'd ask them, but try hard to avoid things that may bring on a fight at their age. Anyway, even though it's obvious that both these people had their very large problems (especially in dealing with each other and personal relationships), given the type of presidents I've experienced during my lifetime...I sincerely doubt two other people could have handled so many issues correctly during this time of war. I am beginning to understand why this was called the Greatest Generation by Tom Brokaw, in fact, reading this book makes me want to read that one. I am awed by the overwhelming personal sacrifice that so many young men (and their parents and their spouses) made to serve in the military when the chance of coming home at all was slim. I am also awed by the effort of the entire U.S. workforce to enable Roosevelt to create and supply the Lend-Lease program that allowed our Allies to fight until the U.S. became involved in the war against the Nazis. If they hadn't been able to carry on, the chances of crushing Hitler and cronies with their armed might was slim.Roosevelt was an enigma. I don't understand his apparent need to be surrounded by pretty women who listened to him talk, while at the same time admiring his wife and wanting her by his side. However, his oversight of all the parts of the U.S. during the war seems to be exactly what was needed. Whatever else he did wrong, no one can possibly state that he did not enable us to win the war. If they do say that, they are wrong. The weak presidents we have now would never have been able to accomplish what he did back then. His political ability and personal charm allowed him to hold all the reins of the economy, military, deal with Congress, continue to promote social change and programs is beyond the powers of modern men. Not since Lincoln had a strong president been able to control so much during a time of war, and succeed so spectacularly. Add to this the fact that he was disabled by polio and the effort of all this was taking a toll on his body, that in this day and age would have been controlled by diet and medicine. However, the medical care as demonstrated by the author was so bad that it led to his early demise at age 63. If he had lived now, so much more could have been done to save him...but at that time, so little was known about the heart and its care that even his personal physician was incapable of reading the signs Roosevelt showed of decline due to stress among other things.Goodwin wrote so lovingly of Eleanor, that I want to read more. A woman who cared so strongly about other people, and who was such a strong advocate for social equity and change...I would have loved to met her as I am an advocate for disabled rights. We could not possibly have made the changes in society towards the disabled without the changes made in civil rights for African-Americans. This is another reason to respect that generation, both those who needed to learn to put aside their prejudice and many did, and those who advocated for that social change...and many did, including an elderly white woman who could have sat back in wealth and totally ignore the needs of others. She couldn't do that. Wow...she was impressive.I loved this book. I was sorry it ended, and I am probably going to read her other stuff as soon as possible.Karen L.

What are vivid are the feelings of love and adoration for FDR by my mother and her family. One of my fondest experiences was taking my Mom to Warm Springs GA to visit his home--and place of his death.I have learned through the years that the mere mention of Franklin Roosevelt evokes extreme emotions--he was either loved and admired or hated and condemned. There seemed to be no middle ground.I learned so much about this man, his politics, our country, the Great Depression and WWII in this remarkable Doris Kearns Goodwin biography. She has the ability to \\"put you there\\" as an observer during so many pivotal times in American history. Her seamless segues from past to present allow the reader to understand this man's past as it is woven into his life's story.

Brands) and this book is a great adjunct to those books. I read No Ordinary Time after just having completed FDR by Jean Smith. Both cover much the same ground (at least in so far as the events of 1940-1945 are concerned) but Goodwin's book is much more emotionally powerful. For instance, both cover the events concerning FDR's death but the way Goodwin tells the story so emotionally involved me that it brought tears to my eyes.This book is essentially the story of the separate lives led by Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt and their interactions. It is about infidelity, emotional estrangement and unrequited love, with WWII as background material rather than as the focus of the book. The struggle that FDR waged to support Great Britain before December 7, 1941, the way in which the war effort was waged on the home front and the interactions with Churchill and Stalin are all discussed in some detail, but the focus is on Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt. As such, this book is a valuable adjunct to biographies of FDR and books about WWII.As I said, I read Smith's FDR just before I read this book and I feel that knowing what went on before 1940 helped me understand this book, but while such knowledge was very helpful I do not believe that it is absolutely required. Goodwin weaves in background material about the New Deal, the elections of 1932 and 1936 and about Franklin and Eleanor's lives before 1940 in an effortless manner, so the reader is brought up to date but perhaps not quite to the extent that they would be if they had read a book concerning events that occurred prior to 1940.I recommend this book to those interested in FDR or ER and to anyone who likes a very powerful, interesting, and emotional biography. Those who are interested in just the history of the 1930's and 1940's may find the focus on the personal lives of FDR and ER a bit too emotionally involving, but it is certainly not dry history."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Excellent book... just like \\"Team of Rivals.\\" She takes history and makes it into \\"can't wait to turn the page story.\\""},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Doris Kearn is very thorough and uses many quotations from other sources. She has organized the information in an easy to read format and I trust she has gleaned the TRUTH and not her own interpretation of the facts."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"This is the first book by Doris Kearns Goodwin that I've read. I've often seen her on tv and enjoyed listening to what she's had to say on presidential history. This book is a sympathetic portrait of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt during the years of World War II. Few figures stand as tall in the world of twentieth century politics, partly due to circumstances ( the Great Depression and World War II), but also due to their personalities. This book is good at examining the central characters, but Goodwin is also successful in looking at the transformations going on the home front during the war years, even if not as strongly told as the characters' stories.No doubt about it, Franklin Roosevelt was a complex individual. Part of this had to do with the fact the he was a politician and hence had to assume a certain pose, if not completely insincere, he had to at least meet certain expectations. Eleanor was clearly the more passionate and outspoken on causes of social justice. As the author ably concludes, they complimented each other as each one needed the other.We also get so learn about those in Franklin and Eleanor's inner circles, for example, Missy LeHand, Harry Hopkins, Lorena Hickok, Anna Roosevelt, Sara Delano Roosevelt and others. The role of Lucy Mercer Rutherford also comes into play later in the book. I found myself understanding both Anna's and Eleanor's point of view on Lucy's role, though Eleanor was his wife. The nature of the relationship between Franklin and Eleanor was indeed complex and gets a lot of attention in this book, but it is a topic that I found of great interest.Obviously world events are the context in which Franklin and Eleanor are seen. Franklin was playing a delicate dance in trying not to move too far ahead of public opinion, while at the same time trying to help the American public see the importance of what was going on in the world and what was at stake. The nation was woefully unprepared for war in the early 1940s and much work needed to be done to get the nation on a war footing. This would become America's stamp on the Second World War: it's capacity (through government and business partnership) to produce war materials in such breathtaking and stupendous quantities and using that industrial might to overwhelm the enemy.We also get to learn of Roosevelt's third and fourth presidential campaigns, the lighter moments at Hyde Park and other places, the relationship forged with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the Big Three meetings, the strategies for both theaters of the war, plans for the future and the failing health of America's Commander-In-Chief. Controversies such as the failure to prevent the European Holocaust from its further implementation, the Japanese internment camps formed in the United States, and the ongoing struggles for equality between blacks and whites are discussed, including Franklin Roosevelt's role in these issues, as well as Eleanor's.Reading of the president's declining health was quite sad. His last days in Warm Springs, Georgia, the reactions by Eleanor and others on his death, and the legacies he left are all told with feeling. As mentioned earlier, this is a sympathetic account of the Roosevelts, but one I think most would agree with. This was truly no ordinary time."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin has always been a favorite of mine. Her love of history is infectious, and she is an engaging storyteller both in print and in the numerous appearances she makes on television. Ms. Goodwin has the ability to bring her subject matter to life and find lovely little anecdotes that make them memorable. Although she touches on several dark moments in the Roosevelt presidency (Japanese internment and the like), overall the work sings FDR's praises, but it is important that we celebrate great lives. To get a full picture of Roosevelt and \\"the home front in World War II\\", it is necessary to read further, but Goodwin is unrivaled in showing the many connections between the personalities and histories of both Franklin and Eleanor and how they changed the twentieth-century.On a side note, I recently realized that the photograph in the book of the '44 Quebec Conference incorrectly identifies Clementine Churchill. She was there but was seated further down. The woman seated between Churchill and Roosevelt is not Clemmie. Just thought I'd throw that out there..."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"This superb narrative gives us a very personal look at President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882-1945), first lady Eleanor Roosevelt (1884-1962), and the U.S. home front just before and then during World War II. Author Doris Kearns Goodwin captures the tenor of the times as she takes us inside the Roosevelt White House. We see the charismatic President and his inner circle (which included Eleanor) skillfully leading the nation against Fascism. Goodwin focuses heavily on Eleanor, who was the President's advisor, gadfly, his \\"eyes and ears,\\" and a magnetic force in her own right. Readers also see the couple's very human flaws, and their strained relationship based on devotion rather than romance. The President kept a mistress (Missy LeHand, then Lucy Mercer) while Eleanor had passionate friendships with a woman and with student leader Joseph Lash - future Pulitzer-winning author of \\"Eleanor and Franklin.\\" Goodwin clearly admires the Roosevelt's as people and as leaders, but refuses to gloss over their flaws, nor some of the President's errors - interning Japanese Americans, not saving enough Jews from Hitler, and marginally combating racism.Ms. Goodwin captured the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for this superbly moving and readable narrative. The book is more dual biography than work of history, but should be of great interest to fans of either genre."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"The sheer volume of work generated by Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt during World War II was (and is) staggering. Not only did America fight overseas, but it mobilized at home on a scale that seems fantastical to us today. What we do with modems, email and computers, they did with telegrams, letters, phones, and typewriters. Forget about cable TV and network news. The media machine ran on newspapers, radio waves, and newsreels at the movies. And yet with these relatively low-tech mediums, the Roosevelts mobilized the nation out of the Great Depression and into the mass production of enough munitions and surplus to win the war.Goodwin is a stirring historian, and the book is truly an achievement. Though Goodwin's words are effusive, it's not motivated by flag-waving. Instead, her subjects have a poignant humanity with all its heroic and fallible qualities. The book is a long one, but if you're investing any time finding out more about the Roosevelts and the American homefront, there's no one better than Doris Kearns Goodwin to hear it from."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"I was sitting on an airplane reading TEAM OF RIVALS. The man next to me said, \\"If you enjoy that one, you need to read NO ORDINARY TIME. He was correct. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Goodwin did a fantastic job on both of these books. It even made me go back to FRANKLIN AND WINSTON, the book about that relationship during WWII, to compare notes."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"A fascinating and very informative look behind the scenes of the White House during WWII. To someone who tried to learn about WWII from relatives who were involuntarily fighting on the German side (they refused to speak about it) and from going to school at a German-government funded high school in the 70ies (our history teachers covered the Romans and Greeks over and over but stopped our history classes at WWI, possibly because the German goverment and German universities were not sure how to present WWII to their future history school teachers) Goodwin's books filled many knowledge gaps in this reader. The story was made more endearing as the main characters were portrayed as human beings, with their emotions, hopes, strong points and weaknesses. E. Roosevelt in 'This I Remember' utterly forgets to mention Lucy Mercer (what an inappropriately chosen book title) while Goodwin's anaylsis makes it abundantly clear what an effect Lucy's affair with Frankin and Lucy's subsequent presence at his death had on Eleanor (wouldn't anyone in Eleanor's shoes be incredibly hurt? On the other hand, the reader can also symphathize with Franklin. He had, on numerous occasions, ask for his wife's companionship).Would I have voluntarily swapped places with Eleanor or Franklin? No, but I am sure glad they existed. Especially Eleanor kept the human conscience focused on the important issues. And Goodwin's book clearly delineates both Eleanor's and Franklin Roosevelt's effect or lack thereof on human rights of the Japanese-Americans, Jews and black Americans.Well written, gripping and the best part about this book was that it is a huge tome and thus will provide days and days and days of reading pleasure."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"This book was so good, I could not stop reading it!! It's so well-written that it is like reading a story by a friend. Besides the history lesson, I gained so much admiration for Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. It was such a trying time in our history and I felt like I was there by reading this book. It is also scary how similar the events in this book are to the current events in the world. This is a great book!"},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"This scholarly and superbly intimate look at FDR and Eleanor from the last days of the Depression through the Second World War makes for excellent reading. The author examines the couple's strained relationship and flaws, along with their sterling achievements. Many books by stuffy historians are highly boring. Goodwin's Pulitzer Prize winning effort is an immensely readable narrative of the 20th Century's greatest President and First Lady."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin is masterful in her book on the dynamic relationship between FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt. A complete history of FDR's presidency it is not, but this book gives you insight into one of our country's most fascinating public relationships. I was completely engrossed in this beautifully written story. It gave me a better understanding for how Eleanor Roosevelt and FDR negotiated with and influenced each other, and how she impacted his presidency. FDR used her to extend an olive branch to feminists and minorities; she used her influence to lobby him on behalf of the poor and other groups needing help. An enthralling read!"},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"What a wealth of information and it is provided in an easily read manner that I have greatly enjoyed. Franklin and Eleanor are tremendously diverse and greatly respected American hero's.Thank goodness that our great country had their combination of efforts to guide us through the Great Depression and World War Two. Doris Kearns Goodwin deserves and achieves great reconition for this wonderful book.I hope you enjoy it as much as I have."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Packed with information on every aspect of Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt during the WWII timeframe, this book is a history lovers dream. Unfortunately, I am no history lover. I became glossy-eyed when fine details were being mentioned about everyday activities. I felt that the book strayed from the main story and gave too much supporting detail. Yet, as is with all of the history books that I marginally enjoy, I learned quite a bit of information that I would never have gained otherwise. I was amazed to learn about how separate the Roosevelt's actually were as a couple and FDR's continued relationship with Lucy Rutherford. I also gained insight into how much Eleanor helped to spur the rights for blacks and women with her forward thinking. Eleanor and Franklin's separation as a couple was shadowed by their strength in bringing a nation out of depression and forming our current business environment. I was also surprised to see the extent in which Franklin relaxed. There wasn't a chapter where Franklin didn't either drive around Hyde Park, cruise on the Potomac, or spend time in his \\"Little White House\\" in Warm Springs. This was a man who knew what taking it easy was all about."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"If you read the outside cover of the CD Audiobook, you get the impression that the volume strongly will deal with the manner in which FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt led the country during World War II. However, what you get is more often innuendo about FDR's fascination with women other than his wife, whether his prviate secretaries, a visiting princess, or his mistress of many years. Eleanor is covered in more detail than was expected, but she comes off pretty well, her husband's wandering eye notwithstanding.Goodwin does provide some insight into the challenges of running the United States during the critical war years, but the amount of time devoted to private pursuits was not what was expected. I had hoped for a lot more detail on the warimte effects of the economy, and the challenges it served the president. I had hopes of more on FDR's handling of race and labor issues, but did not get it. I had hopes of learning more about FDR's partnership with the Congress to achieve the nation's goals, but was disappointed there as well.This was the first Goodwin book I picked up, and it didn't put me off enough to avoid her amazingly good Team of Rivals, about Lincoln and his cabinet. Still, I remain disappointed that the book's cover and inside clearly focused on other issues than what was projected."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"When she discusses the Japanese losses at the battle of Midway she states the Japanese lost 4 aircraft carriers (true), 1 heavy cruiser (true), 3 battleships (completely, totally false). Who's supposed to edit this stuff? For a supposedly top notch historical book that's an absurd error to get through."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin is the kind of earnest Liberal who it is hard to dislike. But this book joins David McCullough's Truman, Arthur Schlesinger's A Thousand Days and Robert Dallek's LBJ biography to complete the set of hagiographies of the pre-Carter Democrat Presidents. It is an extremely lightweight, but very readable account of the Roosevelts during the War years. It is ideal for anyone who wants a glossy portrait of the topic and does not want to have any of their preconceptions called into question.As the book opens, in May 1940, we are presented with the truly bizarre menagerie that was the Roosevelt White House. Franklin and Eleanor have separate bedrooms--and have been estranged since Eleanor found out about his affair with Lucy Mercer in 1918. Missy LeHand, FDR's &quot;secretary &amp; hostess&quot;,lives on the third floor. Lorena Hickcock, Eleanor's &quot;special friend&quot; lives in the bedroom across the hall from the first lady. Sara Roosevelt, FDR's mother, is frequently on hand, as are Harry Hopkins (FDR's friend &amp; Eleanor's ally), Joe Lash (the young left-winger &amp; future biographer who Eleanor loves), Princess Martha of Norway (who FDR shares intimate moments with), and on and on... But Goodwin assures us that all of these relationships are perfectly straightforward and innocent.Goodwin briefly describes FDR's childhood. She trots out the well worn story of his domineering mother, his blackballing by the Porcellian Club at Harvard, etc. All of which leave him with an &quot;anxiety to please&quot;. However, she never really connects the dots &amp; explores how this trait (a weakness/strength that he shares with Reagan and Clinton), and it's resulting tendency to dither over decisions, lead him to needlessly hurt &amp; confuse people. Instead the chaos that attended his governing style and his personal relationships is presented as a kind of intentional creative force.Of course, FDR's paralysis from polio is presented as the formative experience in his life. It is hard to imagine that it would not shape his character somehow, but did it have a beneficial effect? She accepts Eleanors statement that, &quot;Anyone who has gone through great suffering is bound to have a greater sympathy and understanding of the problems of mankind.&quot; This is balderdash. They're likely to understand the suffering of others who are crippled. But the great mass of mankind is not handicapped and if his polio led FDR to govern as if all men are dependents, this is something that needs to be examined and dealt with. Instead we are assured that FDR had a special understanding, that you and I don't have, because of his disease.In the nation meanwhile, eight years of the New Deal has still left the country with a 17% unemployment rate. But Goodwin assures us that the New Deal has been a resounding success. And now a second crisis (the War) approaches which is even more fearful than the first (the Depression). What can she possibly mean by this? In what sense was World War II, especially in it's early stages, a dire crisis for America? We were never seriously threatened. There was never a chance of the Nazis winning &amp; holding power in Europe. What crisis?Suppose it was a crisis, why did it take FDR two years to get us into the War? (Even then, only the bombing of Pearl Harbor made it possible.) If FDR was a great leader, why were these leadership skills not evident prior to December 7, 1941.At any rate, War in Europe rages. FDR faces a decision that fairly few President's ever faced. Should he run for a third term. Now George Washington was one of the few who could actually have won a third term, but he considered it more important that the Nation be governed by laws and not men, so he stepped down. Following his example, no other President had stood for a third election. But Goodwin barely acknowledges the fact that FDR's decision to run was a significant step on the way to the Imperial Presidency which finally came a cropper under JFK, LBJ &amp; Nixon.Later, when FDR actually runs &amp; wins a fourth term, she not only ignores this issue, she ignores the fact that he was a dying man, with little chance of finishing his term. It was an act of extraordinary irresponsibility to put the country in a position where it would be governed by a virtual unknown in time of war. But by this time, as one observer remarked &quot;...he had ceased to be a person; he was simply the president. If something was good for him, it was good; if it had no function for him as president, it didn't exist.&quot;Here are a few other issues that warrant fuller treatment:1) Did the internment of the Japanese flow from something within FDR? He often used hateful language in describing those, like the America Firsters, who disagreed with him. Was he prone to seeing the Japanese as enemies, because it was easy for him to imagine enemies?2) What was the point of taking Europe away from the Nazis and giving it to the Soviets? Was that his intent?3) When the war ended US debt was 127% of GNP. If our current debt of maybe 60% is so awful, as I'm sure she argued during the Reagan years, then how could he have saddled us with twice that amount?4) FDR used the Greer incident to justify convoying British ships. He claimed that a U-boat fired on the US ship Greer without provocation. This was a lie and as Goodwin points out, it bore bitter fruit in the Tonkin Gulf. But isn't such deceitfulness an integral part of FDR's career? He cheated on Eleanor (understandably perhaps, since she once told a daughter that sex was &quot;an ordeal to be borne&quot;), lied about his marriage, lied about his physical condition, etc. Wasn't lying his modus operandi?Goodwin answers none of these questions, &amp; for the most part doesn't raise them, because it's probably never occurred to her to ask them. She began work on this book believing the Roosevelts were demi-gods, but found she'd underestimated them.As a general proposition, I'd recommend the book for those of limited intellectual curiosity.GRADE: C+"},{"Title":"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II","review":"A little more used then expected with a lot of high lite.

This book is a talented interpretation of a beautiful tragedy composed by Giuseppe Verdi in the late 1800s. Children of all ages can now delight in the story of the Ethiopian Princess and the noble Egyptian warrior brought to life by the stunning illustrations of Leo and Diane Dillon, who were awarded the Caldecott medal for previous work in children's literature. This book captivated my imagination and heart because of its unique narrative perspective and intense passion with which the tale is told. Leontyne Price is the gifted performer who played the character of Aida for many years with much success. In the afterward of the book, Price describes the passion she had for her character. \\"In many ways,\\" she says, \\"I believe Aida is a portrait of my inner self.\\" That relationship with her character manifests itself in her telling of the story for children. Each scene is filled with the emotions and struggles of the young princess, with supporting dialogue and illustrations to enchant children and adults of all ages. The story introduces children to the two ancient cultures of Ethiopia and Egypt, while the illustrations help them to envision a time long, long ago. The relationships between a young girl, her father, her true love, and her country are depicted with emotion, struggle, and beauty by both the author and the illustrators. However, the most appealing aspect of this story is Aida herself. She is a strong woman of royal blood that holds her head high in the face of adversity and yet struggles to do right by all those she loves. She is a true heroine and children's literature must continue to produce such women for generations to come."},{"Title":"AIDA","review":"I was only about 10 or 11 when my PATS class was studying the arts.

Aida is an Ethiopian princess whose father, the king, is at war with the Egyptians. When Aida was on her first trip over the kingdom wall some Egyptian soldiers kidnapped her without knowing that she was the princess. She was taken to the king of Egypt and made a slave to the princess of Egypt, Amneris. One day while Aida was doing her duties she saw the Captain of the Egyptian army, Radames, and for them both it was love at first sight. They secretly spent time with each other and spoke of running away to Ethiopia and getting married so that their lands can forever live in harmony, only to find out that after a great victory of Radames's that he was to marry princess Amneris. Aida, feeling betrayed tells Radames, that if he loves her, then he will run away with her tonight. That was a very hard decision for him to make because he couldn't bare the thought of never seeing Aida again but he also didn't want to leave his home land. But in the end he chose to leave. So when they started to run, someone caught them and Radames gave himself up but Aida managed to escape. Will Radames and Aida ever see each other again? Or will Radames die a horrible death?

They didn't understand everything, but they sure did appreciate the artwork and story line. I'm buying it again as a gift for my niece's 12th birthday. She is obsessed with Egypt and Egyptian subjects. The Aida Broadway production recently came through Austin at the Bass Concert Hall, but we were unable to attend. This truly is the next best thing.

The book is simple and romantic but the most important part that many of the book's fans don't mention (or notice) is the realistic illustrations by the Dillons. The Ethiopians and the Egyptians are depicted exactly as they should be: African. And the fact that the pictures are drawn with vivid colors and patterns with a great legendary storyline proves the fact that a book about two black lovers can be just as passionate and captivating as white European love stories."},{"Title":"AIDA","review":"I was not able to get this book in hardcover.

The late Harvard professor Haskins was a master at presenting detailed, insightful research in an easy, accessible manner. Everyone, from the average reader to the advanced researcher will be greatly satisfied with this erudite work.In this book, which he did throughout all of his career, he presents history in the broader sense: history that is flowing and morphic, not static and pigeonholed. He believed that breaking history up into little arbitrary units of measure, like the century or a decade, while convenient, led to unrealistic expectations of periods or breaks between events, eras, and cultures. History for Professor haskins was very much alive and could not be contained for our convenience, hence it overflowed our self-imposed boundaires, and events which occurred in one era, had their origins far back in time and their ramifications felt far forward in time. Nothing is encapsulated and cut off from the rest of time.The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century is a very important book, because it recaptures the early Middle Ages from the dustbin of Dark Ages ignorance where all the centuries after the Fall of Rome and the better known Italian Renaissance of the 15th Century are thrown. It proves that scholarship and learning were vigorous, that the liberal arts flourished in towns, cathedrals, monasteries, and the newly founded universities (which is covered much more fully in his book The Rise of the Universities), and therein lay the expansion of the earlier Carolingian scholarship, the salvation of the Latin classics and laws, and rediscovery of Greek philosophy, literature, and sciences, and the influx of Arabic learning that was so influential in the later eruption of learning that led to the greater Renaissances and modern times. He proves however, that there were local origins of learning and that the arts grew very much out of their own cultural bedrocks. These were not ignorant scribes only copying work from far away and a millennia before, but intelligent and resourceful scholars who bettered themselves and their times.Haskins is a master historian and this book remains a classic of the genre."},{"Title":"The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century","review":"Charles Homer Haskins' book titled THE RENIASSANCE OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY is a well written, well researched book that refutes the notion that somehow the years between c. 500-1500 AD were \\"the Dark Ages.\\" Haskins book is \\"a must read\\" for those who have an interest in Medieval History.Haskins presented an interesting thesis about cultuural/intellectual exchanges prior to the 12th.century(1100s). The book challenged the notion that Medieval Europeans were ignorant and unlearned prior to the Crusades (1096-1291). Haskins argued that there were cultural/intellectual exchanges prior to the Crusades espeacially in Southern Italy. The Byzantines Greeks and Arabic Moslems had trade in this area even after the disintegration of Roman Empire. Haskins suggested that the market place of goods was also a \\"market place of ideas.\\" Gradually such exchanges and ideas penetrated Northern Europe.Haskins dicussed early Medieval intellectual centers which were concentrated in the monestaries and cathederal schools. The monestaries were in effect beacons of light and learning. A point that other Haskins and other Medieval historians have made is the intellectual debt that Western Civilization owes to the nameless heroic monks and nuns.The chaper on the production and publication of books is simply an important part of this book. Haskins gave precise details of how the monks hand copied books including the Ancient Clasics and the Bible. He commented that writing/hand copying books was \\"a labor of love.\\" The monks believed that every word, sentence, and page meant the forgiveness of sins. There is an anecdote whereby one monk wrote one more word than he committed his sins which led to his salvation. The work of book production was so important that those monks who did such work were relieved of physical labor. Often groups of scribes would collaborate to get a book finished, and when the book was finished, there was celebration and a feast. The value of books was very dear. Haskins provided and example whereby in 1043, the Bishop of Barcelona gave a house and land for two books. Books were indeed valuable. The notion that anti-Catholics use that the Catholic authorities did not want people to read the Bible is ludicrous. Haskins stated that Bibles were chained in the cathederals and monestaries to prevent theft. These Bibles were chained to insure their continued use rather than any attempt to restrict their use. Readers must know that just how hard book production was and the arduous efforts involved in such publication efforts.The teachers and students were also involved in reviving and enhancing the Latin Classics and the Latin language. One must know that the Latin language was the universal language of all teaching, learning, and the Catholic Church. The Latin classics and translations of Greek literature was at first read and learned for moral instuction. Gradually such learning was done for the joy of great literature. While some Catholic authorities were cautious of such learning from pagans, the decision was made to encourage such learning because Catholic authorities did not want ignorant priests and monks.The introduction of Aristotle's philosophy was an interesting part of this book. Church authorities were concerned of Aristotle's influence corrupting the Catholic Faith. While there were offical restrictions on teaching and learning of Aristotle in the Medieval schools, these were never rigidly enforced. By 1255, such restructions were abondoned. While the Latin Classics were never abandoned, they were reduced in importance by the introduction of Aristotle's logic and dialectic. Haskins cited a Medieval work about the War Between the Liberal Arts and Logic in which Logic won.The section of the revival of the study of law was also informative. The Medieval Canon Law jurists not only revived Roman Law and developed Canon Law, the Catholic Canon Law jurists developed a \\"scientific legal system.\\" Roman Law was viewed with suspicion in Medieval England, and Henry II (1154-1189)tried to eliminate such studies. Haskins was very specific to explain that improved studies in Law began in Italy and preceeded Gratian's exhaustive work which was produced c. 1140.One must ask how so much learning that was written in Greek and Arabic became available in the Latin West. Haskins gave a detailed explanation of the translators who did the translations to make Greek and Arabic knowledge available in the Latin West. Such work must have been taken seriously. Historians have combed a monastary that existed c 1140. Historians discovered texts written in Arabic, Greek,and Hebrew. This undermines the notion that somehow the monks were ignorant and unlearned men.The chapter on translators was logically followed by the revival of studies of philosophy which became \\"the handmaid of theology.\\" As one might expect that while there serious studies of Plato's DIALOGUES, Aristotle's philosophy dominated philosophical studies. Yet Haskins made clear, Aristotle could be just as mystical as Plato.The chapter on universities is thorough. One can glean this topic by reading Haskins book THE RISE OF THE UNIVERSITIES which this reviwer has previously reviewed. Haskins undermined the notion that everyone was forced to think the same which is simply not true. Rarely did the Catholic authorities interfere, and Medieval teachers and students thought of themselve intellectually free. An important part of Medieval teaching and learning was the debates which, according to sources, were lively and spirited. For example, Peter Abelard (1079-1142)wrote a university text titled SIC ET NON (YES AND NO)in which he showed students the apparent contradictions of the Bible, Church Fathers, Catholic Church councils, etc. Abelard did not resolve these apparent contractions, and he used this text to have his students logically resolve these problems. Abelard was never admonished for this book. Further examination of Medieval universities can be learned from the above mentioned book.Haskins book is a good comparison and contrast of contemporary learning and teaching. Compared to totalitarian regimes and their control over education, this book is refreshing antidote. One must also consider the childish and nonsensical political correct atmosphere of most U.S. unversities which discourages intelligent debate and exchange. Medieval universities encouraged intense learning and debate which was \\"uninhibited, robust, and wide open.\\" One wonders which age was the \\"Dark Ages\\" when comparing the two concepts of teaching and learning. Contemporaries can read and enjoy this book if only as an escape from what many try to pass off as education."},{"Title":"Cavaliers and pioneers: Abstracts of Virginia land patents and grants","review":"This book is intrumental in researching early land patents in Virginia.

I really, really tried, but I simply could NOT get into this book.I usually give a novel one chapter to draw me in, but because of all the good reviews this book received, I read five. It was no good. I was bored. I just didn't care about the characters or the plot.I love thrillers, but this one left me cold. It's not that Seymour is a bad writer, he just isn't a very good one. There was nothing wrong with his writing, aside from leaving the reader bored and wondering when the action would start.There are too many good books out there to waste your time on a boring one. This is strictly my opinion. Several other reviewers loved this book, so to each his own.This was my first Gerald Seymour book and will probably be my last."},{"Title":"A Line In The Sand","review":"I first came upon Gerald Seymour more than 20 years ago. I really liked his writing then. It is nice to see that he just keeps getting better."},{"Title":"A Line In The Sand","review":"A decade ago, under a different name, Frank Perry spied for his government against his customer, Iran when he fingered the locations of several of the country,s biochemical warfare plants. Frank was feeling safe in England for himself and his family until M15 informs him that Iran has fingered him for assassination. To the shock of the espionage community, Frank refuses to run.The Anvil is coming to destroy the enemy to his state. The English counterintelligence crowd feel obligated to protect Frank. This turns his peaceful village into a mini army post that divides Frank's neighbors. Most of them want their neighbor gone before the Anvil arrives. High Noon is coming to Suffolk.A LINE IN THE SAND is an exciting espionage tale because the prime players seem genuine in their multidimensional behavior. Frank is a bit crooked, making him a not so perfect hero. The Anvil has many redeeming qualities and is not just a religious killing machine. Even the M15 crowd seems less like super 007s and more like real people as they wonder if they should be proud of Franks' heroism or loathe him for placing them in danger. Even the townsfolk mob mentality of abject fear feels real. The charcaters destroy stereotypes that normally exist in this genre, which turns Gerald Seymour's novel into a triumph of the spirit.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Line In The Sand","review":"I didn't expect to like this book. I had read and tremendously enjoyed what some call Seymour's Northern Ireland trilogy (Harry's Game, Field of Blood, and the Journeyman Tailor), but I hadn't liked another effort, Kingfisher.But while I eagerly continue to wait for another Seymour thriller centered in Northern Ireland, I decided to read his book Untouchable, which while not perfect, had me in its grip from the first to last page.So I decided to give Seymour another whirl, and I picked out A Line in the Sand. After reading it in about two days, I have to say the analogy one reviewer made of Seymour's plots coiling around a reader like a boa constrictor as the tension builds to an unbearable level is well put. The book is very hard to put down, and really doesn't have any flaws (apart from a couple of minor facts not worth mentioning here).Furthermore, like in his other books Seymour doesn't just write a thriller, he presents the reader with an ethical question. \\"What would you do if you found out your neighbor was marked for death by a state sponsor of terror like Iran? Would you rally to his side, stand aloof, or try to drive him out of your pretty little village?\\"As for myself, I'd like to think that I'd continue to be a friend and neighbor, but suggest that my good friend the terrorist target take a long vacation until the threat subsided.Bottom Line: A superb read, it is reportedly being made into a movie even as I write this. I look forward to seeing that . . .. . . But I hope with all my heart that with his next book (titled Meaning No Evil) Seymour returns to his familiar stomping grounds of Northern Ireland and with all the wonderful characters that he created there: Inspector Rennie, Cathy Parker, Gary Brennard, and of course, Frankie, the IRA man."},{"Title":"A Line In The Sand","review":"This is another tightly plotted thriller from Gerald Seymour that is awfully hard to put down once you start reading. The author often places relatively ordinary people into extraordinary situations - and he does so in this book. Seymour doesn't write about superheroes - I can't imagine Harrison Ford playing any role in any film of a Seymour book. Instead Seymour creates highly believable characters, complete with foibles, weaknesses, irrational impulses and some strengths. The main characters in \\"A Line in the Sand\\" all have their own weaknesses, strengths and motivations. Seymour weaves these together with great skill to create a taut, tense thriller.Seymour books often differ from the Clancys and Ludlums of the world in another respect - don't expect too many happy endings. Seymour writes about worlds where there's a certain inevitability of disaster - and he often lets disasters happen. That makes his stories much more credible, and much more frightening than most.Seymour also poses moral dilemmas for his characters. He's not an author who thinks one side is completely right and the other completely wrong. For Seymour, all combatants are flawed in some respects. In \\"A Line in the Sand\\", Seymour creates a moral dilemma for the inhabitants of a small English village - do they support one of their own or deflect a threat to their village by casting that person out ?I enjoyed \\"A Line in the Sand\\". In fact, it's one of Seymour's best novels so far."},{"Title":"A Line In The Sand","review":"Good plot, technically correct, well developed complex characters, plenty of suspense, a skillfully done sense of the outcome, multiple messages about life - what more does one want in a thriller? The England portrayed smacks of reality and deep understanding. It was difficult to put down."},{"Title":"A Line In The Sand","review":"I think it is unfair to expect this book to grab you in the first few chapters; that is not Gerald Seymour's style. His style is that of a boa constrictor's, where the pressure builds slowly until you realize you are grasping for breath. It is like comparing John LeCarre to Tom Clancy. There is a world of difference, Clancy writes for the masses, and LeCarre is an author. Gerald Seymour is an author, and while this is not his best book ( Holding the Zero has that distinction ) it lives up to his fans' expectations. Frank Perry was an informant for MI6, the British Secret Service, but his use to them is over and they have let him go, with a new identity. However, the new identity has been breached, and now the Iranian secret service has sent their best man, the &quot; Anvil &quot;, to repay Perry for his treachery. The British try to move Perry out with yet another new identity, but Perry is not running anymore. He has a wife and son now, and lives in a small town where he has friends who will rally to him. Or so he thinks anyway. The tension builds as the Anvil makes his way to the small town where Perry resides, and the townspeople rebel at the presence of British security turning Perry's home into a small fort. Plot turns are sudden, with moments of unbearable sadness. What most impacts are the thoughts of Perry, as he reflects on his life and his decision to stay rather than run, with the implications of that decision. Seymour provides us with real people dealing in genuine ways with rather difficult situations. This separates him from the spoonfed drivel of Clancy, where the heroes are infallible and their motives are clear and good. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Line In The Sand","review":"I'm not much for reading thrillers, but my husband loves them, and he kept nagging me to read this one. He's just discovered Seymour, and said that A Line in the Sand is the best of the lot, especially for someone who doesn't normally read suspense novels.He's right, it's a good story. Seymour starts off with a number of separate threads which come together with terrifying effect towards the end. The further I read the more reluctant I was to put it down.There are a number of heroes in this book. The main protagonist is Frank Perry, formerly Gavin Hughes, who was instrumental in slowing down Iran's WMD programme. The Iranians have finally tracked him down, and have sent their best assassin to Suffolk to kill him. The Secret Service asks Perry to move, but he won't leave his family and friends again, in effect drawing \\"a line in the sand\\" that he defies the authorities, and later the assassin, to cross.What follows is an escalating protection programme for Perry, his wife and stepson, and things get ugly when the villagers find out about it - the Perry family is rejected out of hand because everyone needs to be accepted by everyone else for some reason or other. One villager is gay, for example; others have carved a place in village society that they don't want to lose. I found this the most powerful part of this book, not just because it was so natural and believable, but because it could happen to anyone albeit not on such a scale.Interwoven with Perry's tale are parallel stories of the hunt for the assassin, right down to the personal lives of the people involved, and his easy evasion of his pursuers. Things begin a little slowly, but the suspense builds as there are several false starts and stops on both sides.The story begins with a bird, and ends with the same bird. It's probably crazy that a wild bird is instrumental to the plot, but it is, and readers should look out for mentions of it.Seymour writes well, though it was heavy going for me in places where history, politics and religion were discussed in great detail. Overall though it is a book I'd recommend even to those who aren't interested in politics, the secret service, and terrorism. My edition was published in 1999, pre-September 11 and before the Iraq war, but in this day and age, most readers would be able to recognise terms like terrorism and WMD when they come up in the text."},{"Title":"A Line In The Sand","review":"The West's current struggle with fundamentalist Islamic terrorists makes A LINE IN THE SAND all the more topical even though it's fiction. As such, it's an engrossing novel by plot-meister Gerald Seymour.Brit Gavin Hughes was once a salesman selling illicit industrial mixing equipment to the Iranians for the latter's use in making weapons of mass destruction at a top-secret base. Then MI6 caught on, and put the squeeze on Hughes to become an informant. Gavin's information eventually allowed the Mossad to deal a crippling blow to Iran's WMD program. For his own protection, MI6 gives Gavin a new identity and life. He's now Frank Perry living with his wife Meryl and foster son Stephen in an isolated village on the Suffolk coast. The thing is, you see, a Saudi raid on an isolated terrorist camp yields evidence that the Iranians have discovered Gavin's identity and are sending in their master assassin, the Anvil, to make the hit. The British Security Service (MI5) now has jurisdiction, and pleads with Frank to run once more, but he adamantly refuses. Thus, an odd lot of players are converging on the village, its inhabitants, and the Perrys: the Anvil, the assassin's local accomplice previously converted to Islam, MI5, Scotland Yard, the SAS, an FBI anti-terrorist specialist, a sullen Scottish tracker and his dogs, a former British diplomat and his scarred foreign-born wife (the latter a survivor of Chile's torture chambers), and an injured marsh harrier - a migratory bird of prey.One of my pet peeves with some &quot;highly acclaimed&quot; writers is that they impart no individuality to the principal characters of their books. The British government minister, the Yank CIA officer, the South American drug king, and the Tokyo police detective all talk and act as if they're cut from the same cloth, which might as well be that of an insurance broker in Des Moines. Seymour, on the other hand, makes each individual unique and real. This talent can make up for other faults. However, A LINE IN THE SAND is not deficient by any standard to which I hold. It's a taut, smart, finely crafted thriller that should encourage the reader to investigate Seymour's other works. More than that, it's a contemporary parable on the consequences of one's actions."},{"Title":"A Line In The Sand","review":"The basic plot here is quite straight forward. Frank Perry was engaged in espionage in Iran and as a result of his activities the Iranians want him dead. Having already had one new identity, when they discover his new identity he refuses to move to a new life again. Hence the intelligence services are obliged to protect him at his rural location deep in Suffolk in the UK against a highly efficient killer, code name Anvil, who has been sent from Iran.There is an initial credibility gap here, as the reader seeks to relate to a deadly Iranian assassin wandering around Suffolk which is quite a genteel area of Southern England - it all seems a bit incongruous really. However, the book is tightly plotted, and whilst the basic story is fairly straight forward, there is, at times, plenty of action and it all becomes very tense. There is quite a lot of exploration of the effect of this situation on Perry and his family, as well as the protection officers with him and this makes for an interesting aspect of the story. The reaction of the local populace and, in particular, the close friends of the family, is especially revealing.So an interesting tale, at times a page turner, with enough to satisfy lovers of adrenalin fuelled adventures, whilst with exploration of the characters and relationships involved which fleshes it all out and make for a really absorbing book."},{"Title":"A Line In The Sand","review":"Gerald Seymour is a suspense novelist of the highest order, and what's more a truly unusual writer. The only other suspense/espionage writer I know who's killed off protagonists or had them fail anywhere near as much is John LeCarre, and even he doesn't do it anywhere near as often. Seymour writes in a flat, gray voice that conveys little emotion at first, and it takes some getting used to, but his plots are fascinating, and the characters are very very interesting.In this entry, Seymour has built the book around Frank Perry. Frank's a nice guy; he sells chemical engineering equipment internationally. At one point he played fast and loose with the law, export permits and so forth, and when he was caught, he spied on Iran for the British government. His spying mission ended four years ago, why he doesn't know. Now he lives in a village on the south coast of England with a new wife and stepson, and visitors have arrived on his doorstep to tell him that he's been identified by the Iranian intelligence service, and that they are apparently sending someone to kill him.This is a very very good novel. For one thing, the characters are as well-drawn as any Seymour has ever populated a novel with. For another, their reactions to the events of the plot are fascinating. One whole dimension of the book is that the local villagers pretty much completely turn on Frank and his family when they figure out that someone's trying to come and kill him. Their group opinion is that if someone's trying to kill Frank, they'd like for Frank to be very far away from them. Would he please leave?That adds a dimension to the book which makes it that much more interesting. I really enjoyed this book: it's one of Seymour's best, right up there with Harry's Game."},{"Title":"A Line In The Sand","review":"Mr. Seymour has a superb ability to build up tension, and he used it to great effect in this book. Before the end of the first chapter I was hooked. However, even while reading it, deeply engaged, there were some situations that didn't ring true. I mean, one of the baddest dudes on the planet is zeroing in on a small English village to take out his \\"target\\", Frank Perry, a man responsible for a seriously damaging blow to the Iranian weapons program. The British counter-intelligence and Special Branch folks know that \\"the Anvil\\" is on his way and who he's after, so they protect Frank while hoping to capture or kill the Anvil. So far, so good; however, it's hard to believe the killer could even get close to Frank if they were taking protection seriously. After one dramatic--and unsuccessful--attempt, it's like the Anvil retires to his refuge in the marsh and the protection detail just hunkers down to wait for the next try. How about some guard dogs patrolling the area? How about a few hidden security men in the perimeter to watch for the Anvil? The protection detail, though highly capable, consists of just a few heavily armed men. That's why I gave it four stars. I must say also that the descriptions of the bureaucratic in-fighting seemed very realistic, as were the analyses of the politics of intelligence sharing, intelligence rivalries, and counter-intelligence difficulties. Mr. Seymour brings in fully fleshed-out characters; complicated, imperfect, and memorable characters. Finally, I did very much enjoy his making the migration and struggles of one marsh hawk a central thread of the book. I borrowed this book from my library, after reading The Collaborator, another Seymour thriller that I gave five stars to."},{"Title":"The Life of Monsieur De Moliere","review":"Mikhail Bulgakov's book The Life of Monsieur de Moliere is a very biased book that is uncritical of the great French writer Moliere. Despite the author's unabashed love of Moliere, the book is a treat from beginning to end. Bulgakov feels an affinity with Moliere because he wrote under a totalitarian regime headed by Stalin in Russia and Moliere wrote during the reign of Louis XIV. Although Moliere certainly had much more freedom than Bulgakov did, he still felt the sting of censorship from religious zealots and was often persecuted by those whom he made fun of in his plays, ( nobles, doctors, the affected ladies of French society). Bulgakov praises Moliere as the greatest French writer and as one of the greatest comediens ever. Indeed history has proven him correct. Three centuries later Moliere's works are performed in almost every nation in the world. The great joy that Bulgakov feels towards Moliere infuses the entire book (sometimes to the point of unintentional farce.) But he paints a vivid and energenic portrait of the playwright, actor and director that captures the essence of his work. Many of the details of Moliere's life are unknown and Bulgakov does take Moliere's side wherever there is ambiguity. ( For example, many of his enemies have said that Moliere married his own daughter and knew that in fact she was his daughter.) Bulgakov refutes this charge as ridiculous and indeed, without proof, it should be discounted. Bulgakov takes us from Moliere's birth (a very funny telling of how the midwife who delivered him couldn't realize he was more important to history than any royal baby she may have delivered) to his tragically ironic death right after a performance of his play The Imaginary Invalid. Bulgakov wheres his love of Moliere on his sleeve and it works to perfection in this book. Moliere's plays have an energy that imbues every verse. This book is the same way. Most other biographies are staid in comparison. They rarely capture the true genius of the great writer and almost never convey the great fun embodied in his works. Mikhail Bulgakov's biography is the best book, even though it is biased, ever written about the great French playwright."},{"Title":"The Life of Monsieur De Moliere","review":"I read this in the Russian so can't guarantee anything about this translation.This is a biography, a novel and an experimental work all rolled into one. Bulgakov describes the life of one of the most famous and beloved French playwrights and indeed authors. He goes into the intrigue between him and his enemies, the controversies surrounding his satires, his times and personality. The end result is a magical picture of Moliere's France with the splendour and opulence of the period (the reign of Louis XIV). All this is done in a way that reminds me that common ideas about writing (eg. show don't tell) are just that: ideas. Bulgakov definitely tells more than he shows and the work ends up being a crossover genre piece rather than a straight novel. But this does not detract, in fact his intrusions into the text with respect to the evidence for certain periods in Moliere's life work well.This may not be a masterpiece of world literature but it depicts Moliere in a very interesting way and it's from a writer who felt a special connection with him because of Bulgakov's own troubles with censorship and being ahead of his time. In fact, he refers to Moliere as a wolf of his time in the book, the same image he speaks of himself in one of his poems about how he was hounded; which makes this a splendid exposition of one literary wolf by another..."},{"Title":"Celtic Christianity (The \\"Elements of...\\" Series)","review":"Duncan's presentation is fast paced and to the point. It mixes academic research with some clearly identified personal opinions. The main thrust of the book is that St. Augustine is responsible for forcing the Romanization of the Church in Celtic lands. His influence carried over into the reformation -- Luther was an Augustinian monk. Duncan claims that Augustine's renounciation of human sexuality was the result of his attempts to deal with his personal demons, including the putting away of his concubine. Duncan, an Anglican priest, is understanding of Augustine and tries not to portray the 'Doctor of the Church' as a villian, but as a human.Personally, I found this book answered many of my questions about the Celtic Church.

It approaches everything in personal terms, again unconsciously. It was never necessary to articulate the proposition that a personal Creator would be unlikely to create anything that was not -- in some sense -- a person.

On a whim, I decided to check out this book, and I was pleasantly surprised.I hadn't realized that Celtic Christianity is basically a spirituality of Love, and seeing God in all things. The Earth is precious simply because God made it, and the ancient Celtic Christian peoples practiced devotion rather than religion.In reading this book, I got a much clearer view on how Christianity morphed and changed over the last 1500 years, and in ways that weren't always for the best.The book also contains bits and pieces of the most beautiful Celtic poetry, including some from the Carmina Gadelica.I got quite a bit out of this book, and just to let you know, it is a bit academic. Of course, I enjoyed it anyway :) This book is a great starting point for anyone interested in history of Christianity and the Celtic peoples. Though at a mere 112 pages, it is just that... a starting point."},{"Title":"Celtic Christianity (The \\"Elements of...\\" Series)","review":"So many web definitions and recent books on celtic spirituality and christianity have so much fluff and confusion.This book is well written, let's you know what the author thinks and who disagrees with him.great for anyone interested in celtic spirituality"},{"Title":"La Gloire de Mon Pere (French Edition)","review":"This french story is elequontly told.

Various police officers have submitted humorous stories of dealings with the public, pranks between officers gone wrong, mistakes made by themselves, mistakes made by criminals and other funny stuff. The book is divided into chapters.1 Coppers and Villains2 Traffic3 New Recruits4 The Public5 Interviews6 Court7 Death8 A-Z of Police JargonThe first chapter is probably the weakest with some of the tales being urban legends you've no doubt heard before. The authenticity seems to come on in force with Traffic and the subsequent chapters. Plus they are a lot funnier. This book also gives a percentage of its profits to the Victims of Crime Trust which may sway your decision to buy it if you balancing yes or no.There is some average stuff in here and some really hilarious stuff too. What happened to one police officer's shirts as he slept as a result of his colleagues who had to get up early for the morning shift's unexpected follow through while passing wind after a big night celebrating a result, well you've just go to read it. The backfiring of a prankster trying to scare a newbie officer in the morgue is also classic stuff.If you want more the editors say on the last pages they are putting together a sequel. Meanwhile you could also check outWasting Police Time: The Crazy World of the War on Crimeby David Copperfield, it's not quite as good but still a worthwhile read on the same subject.For a really great inside and hilarious look at the lives of front line emergency service workers you've got to check outBlood, Sweat & Tea: Real-Life Adventures in an Inner-City Ambulance. One of the best books I've read in a while."},{"Title":"Cops 'n' Robbers: Hilarious True Stories of Bungling Burglars and Crafty Coppers","review":"I am not a great reader of books, in fact the last one i was supposed to read was called PACE !!! (for those of you who have an interest in this book) but knowing one of the authors I thought i had better support a mate and buy it and see what he made of his project. Well i was astounded that i got the book the next morning in the post and i opened it and read a couple of extracts then a couple more and then i couldnt put it down and finished it the same day without any problems at all (until the wife came back and wondered why i hadnt done anything around the house) so i told her to read it and she is worst than me on books and from a non police background and she couldnt put it down either. some of the old war stories literally make you laugh so much the tears run down your legs. I know I am bias but if you want a bloody good laugh then i doubt there is much better and I cannot wait for a second instalment. Thoroughly reccommended. Whats more I know a couple of the stories are factual !!!!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Trail","review":"I wouldn't have liked this book as much if I didn't live in Kayenta. It is the author's description of Red Lake, Kayenta, and Tsegi among others that makes this book so interesting. My Doctor told me about it, I bought it and have been passing it around to other people in town. Sorry Amazon. Sometimes the story drags a bit but that is Zane Grey. Sometimes his treatement of the Navajo is a bit stereotyped. Come to the four corners, stay awhile. Hike among the canyons and mesas. Get to know the people. Than read the book. You'll get much more out of it. There's an isolated cliff dwelling out here (somewhere near Tsegi Canyon, no more hints) where Zane Grey carved his name into the sandstone. He writes a pretty good description of the area and its people."},{"Title":"Rainbow Trail","review":"This review refers to the Kindle edition of \\"The Rainbow Trail\\" by Zane Grey.One of my very favorite characters of western literature is Zane Grey's tough and cool gunman, Lassiter(Riders of the Purple Sage). I am even always on the look-out for and reading Zane Loren Grey's(Grey's son) continuing series of Lassiter.Although I knew going into this story that Lassiter was not the main focus - Grey in a foreword, says that although this is an independent story(and it was)it may answer some questions of ROTPS fans - I was a bit disappointed in the role Lassiter played in the story.***If you haven't read Riders Of The Purple Sage, this next paragraph may contain a spoiler of that one***Now in The Rainbow Trail, we meet the next generation. Shefford, the main character, is an ex-preacher who has lost his faith and his way in the world. After hearing the story of what happened in Riders, from a mutual friend of his and Lassiter's, and how Lassiter, Jane and little Fay were trapped in Surprise Valley, he makes it his mission to head out West and save the family, and has especially tender thoughts of Fay who must be a beautiful young woman by now.He meets with many obstacles in his journey to find this hidden Canyon as well as redemption, and must learn the life styles, the ways and codes of the West. Bad guys, the perils of being in the desert(including some very mean fire ants),and a group of very religious old style Mormons(that we met in Riders) are causing delays in his quest.If you didn't know this was a Zane Grey novel when you picked up this book and you have read any of his other works, you will recognize immediately his very descriptive style and characterizations. The story as always was very enjoyable and there are new heroes to root for, villains to despise and loveable new horses too! Shefford aligns with some very likeable friends he meets. A trader, some of the younger generations of Mormons, and he especially becomes close with Nas Ta Bega, a Navajo that becomes a true brother to him. We also get to spend some time with Nas Ta Bega's family and like Shefford get a good look at their life in those times.So it really pains me in a way to give only 3 stars to a Zane Grey novel - especially one that involves Lassiter - but without giving too much away, as I said above I was disappointed with the revival of the once great and much feared gunman I came to love. If you haven't read Riders of the Purple Sage, and love westerns, you should do yourself a good deed and read it! This saga does stand on it's own, especially for readers who may be unfamiliar with the Lassiter character. Even though I give only three stars - and Amazon categorizes that as a \\"critical\\" review, I am still recommending it. You can just get lost in Grey's descriptions of the desert, the old west, and his stories.The Kindle edition: Locations - 3629. You can't go wrong - it's free! There were a few typo errors, mostly in the last 25% of the book, but nothing that will take away from from Grey's words. No table of contents, but there are Chapter titles and as mentioned there is a foreword by Grey and in the first sentence of that he has you hooked:\\"The spell of the desert comes back to me, as it always will come.\\" - I feel the same way! Saddle up for another Zane Gray adventure........Laurie"},{"Title":"Rainbow Trail","review":"I first read and reread The Rainbow Trail MANY years ago. Loved it then and still do. I lived in northern Arizona for a few years and since I don't travel much anymore this is a great way to revisit the red rocks and roaring rivers of northern Arizona and southern Utah. Zane Grey is a wonderful descriptive writer who makes you feel as if you are traveling along with the characters in the book. I plan to download more Zane Grey books for my Kindle."},{"Title":"Rainbow Trail","review":"The Rainbow Trail brings closure to the novel Riders of the Purple Sage. It answers the question, What happened to Jane and Lassiter? But more importantly, it opens up a new series of events and characters that a reader can identify with and become emotionally involved with. Zane Grey knew how to get the reader hooked and then keep him on the line to the finish, just like he knew how to fish for world record sharks in the ocean. With the back drop being the desert and plateau and canyon country of Utah and Arizona which Zane Grey could so vividly and memorable describe in words no other author has managed to emulate, he tells a story so unique and compelling that I am sure when it was published no one could resist to read it, especially since it brought Riders to a conclusion. Standing alone, it holds up just as well today. A defrocked minister comes west after hearing the story of Fay Larkin, and Jane and Lassiter, from two of his parishioners and decides to hunt for them, and in so doing find himself and his God. The twists and turns he faces in his search make for good mystery and good romance. I proudly recommend it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Trail","review":"I do not read Zane Grey very often.

Though he overdoes the scenery descriptions by today's standards, I found both books entertaining and a reminder of the cowboy and Indian movies I watched as a kid.

Unlike most preschool counting books, this one goes up to 20.2. By employing amusing situations as monsters misbehave, the book is a lot more interesting than any other counting book I remember reading.3. If a youngster is fascinated by monsters (and not afraid of them), this book will be a long-time favorite.The book's main drawback is pretty obvious. If your child is timid about monsters (especially thinking that some monster might take a bite out of them), this book could be unsettling. You'll have to decide if your child will be amused or not. If your child isn't sure, you can use the book to encourage feeling unafraid around these goofy monsters that eat the inedible and undesirable.Here's an example of what I mean about evaluating your child:\\"Twenty hungry monsters with nothing left to chew. Better close this book up tight . . . Before they chew on you!\\"I loved the illustrations! The drawings are imaginative, colorful, and downright goofy.

First, the release date for this volume was pushed back, which is not typically a very good sign. And second, this volume was being drafted by Marc Shapiro and not Andy Meisler (who did such a wonderful job with the previous two volumes). But after having read through it, I can happily allay any apprehensions about this book not living up to its predecessors. Volume 6 in this series is just as good, if not better, than those volumes that came out before it.Marc Shapiro does a great job in delivering the goods behind every episode. I was very impressed with this from Andy Meisler, and Marc Shapiro doesn't disappoint. There is interesting background information on all the episodes - things like the time-crunch in making &quot;Requiem&quot; and the fact that Gillian Anderson had to wear a wig in a car scene in &quot;The Goldberg Variation&quot; because it was shot after her hair stylist had sheared off her lovely locks.Included in this book are eight full-color pages of images from the seventh season. Those images selected are fine enough, but they only focus on about four or five episodes, which doesn't do such a great season justice. It would have been nice to see more of a mix - some mythology episodes (&quot;The Sixth Extinction&quot; and &quot;Sein Und Zeit&quot;) and stand-alone episodes (&quot;En Ami&quot; and &quot;All Things&quot;). But this is a minor detraction from an overall sharp-looking book.Any fans of the series should have this volume sitting on their bookshelves. This is a must-have, and it is an enjoyable read. Well worth the wait in the time it took to get it published."},{"Title":"All Things (The Official Guide to the X-Files, Vol. 6)","review":"This Book would have to be my all time favorite that only adds to my collection of vol.3-6 now. If you want more x-files, and want to learn more about Season 7, I suggest buying this book. Of course, like the other volumes it has in-depth details of each episode as well as black &amp; white pictures to accommodate them. There are eight pages of color pictures: X-Cops, Je Souhaite, Fight Club, FPS, and, Hollywood A.D.. Very Cool! I enjoy this book very much, despite the delay in publishing, but beleive me, it was worth the wait. There's also the back story of why the ending of Requiem was kept a secret, why Chris waited until the last day of shooting Requiem to write the finale, and why only 2 people knew of it's true ending. . . .

It is a solid (in comparison to other reference books that I have used) reference guide to ORACLE's implementation of the SQL language.If you are looking for a tutorial on SQL, then this is probably not the book that you want to buy. This is a good book if you are a developer whom needs a quick reference guide.The beginning section of the reference chapter is, in my opinion, a little bit of a kluge. The authors attempt to list everything that a DBA/developer might need to do. This LONG list simply states the command needed. You then need to look up the syntax in the index (why not just put the page number right there?) The list covers multiple pages, so it can be troublesome to read (if you don't know the exact terminology).I must admit that I am a beginner SQL developer, so I have only used a limited amount of the commands, but it has been very useful for the commands that I have used, and in helping me expand what I am using SQL for. I must stress that it is NOT a tutorial."},{"Title":"Oracle SQL: the Essential Reference","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer that this book is not a tutorial. But it is an outstanding reference that will save you many long, frustrating and tedious hours of pouring through the Oracle documentation looking for the syntax of various Oracle commands. I've been spending the last few months developing a JDBC based application and this is the only book that I carry with me between work and home.If you've ever been kept up late trying to get the syntax right on some complex SELECT or CREATE TABLE command, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Oracle SQL: the Essential Reference","review":"Well maybe you could live without this book if you had food and water, but you wouldn't be happy about it. SQL isn't especially difficult, but it's hard to remember all of the syntax. Then couple this with the differences between Oracle's SQL and other database's versions and you have a serious headache that will not go away.As in almost all O'Reilly books, this one is very well-organized and easy to follow. There are just enough examples to get you by, though if you are coupling Oracle, SQL and a scripting language like ColdFusion you might get confused with the &quot;command line only&quot; examples.Oracle's Technet reference online is also good for this information, but they have a tendency to move URLs when you least expect it. This book is relatively inexpensive, and when kept within arm's reach you can whip out SQL queries in nothing flat. Earmark the reserved words section and remember where the Aggregate Functions section starts and you should be good.The first half of the text is really enough to recommend the purchase, but this book also goes over SQL*Plus and PL/SQL, as well as some brief tips on SQL statement tuning. It isn't enough to be complete, but it's more than enough to get you started.This is an indispensible book!"},{"Title":"Oracle SQL: the Essential Reference","review":"I have found this book to be an invaluable reference to SQL, PL/SQL, and SQL*Plus syntax and usage. The previous review by Kevin McCormick seems to entirely miss the point of an Essential Reference - it is not intended to teach SQL concepts, and the introduction clearly states this. The book is well organized with exactly the information needed to write a particular statement. The examples are simple and to the point - I don't need a complex example; just something to show me what the statement should look like (for example, to show me that an argument should be a string and not a number). I bought two copies: one for the office and one for home. The book is as close to indispensible as you can get. I only hope the author is planning an update to Oracle 9!"},{"Title":"Oracle SQL: the Essential Reference","review":"This book gives a great overview of Oracle's flavor of SQL, and if you already know some other brand's SQL, you'll breeze right through, and have a very good idea of what's new and different in Oracle. You'll be able to sit right down and get to work.(If, on the other hand, you're a SQL beginner, stop right here. This is not a book for SQL newbies. There is not a chapter with 100 examples of different types of SELECT statements, for example. It is not a tutorial!)Each chapter covers a different area. For example, chapter 5 is about &quot;SQL Functions&quot;. It goes through all the functions, giving you the syntax, a paragraph saying what it does, and then an actual example. Many of the examples are pretty trivial, just a couple of lines, but the ones in the PL/SQL chapter have some meaningful code to illustrate things like the LOOP statement, which is nice.But. When you come back after the weekend and want to look something up, you'll be banging your head against the wall, because the index on this thing is sorely lacking. Just now I spent ten minutes trying to look up %TYPE, and had to leaf through the book before finding it on page 266. Very annoying. O'Reilly should know better: an &quot;essential&quot; part of any &quot;reference&quot; book is a kick-ass index.I give it five stars for content and one star for lack of meaningful index, for an overall rating of three stars. Maybe in the next release they'll get it right.

It's one of those books where it's often hard to find the information and you end up looking elsewhere.To start off with, the index is not the greatest. Try looking up &quot;ORDER BY&quot;. It's only mentioned in the index as one item in an EXPLAIN PLAN command. In general, I found the examples they use to be only bare bones examples. It would be nice to see some more complex SQL.On the plus side, the book seems fairly free of errors and a lot of information is packed into the pages. There's not a whole lot of writing but you shouldn't be expecting that given that it's an &quot;essential reference&quot;.This isn't a bad book per se.

The joke asks what is the average size of a Native Family? The answer is five, a father, a mother, a son and daughter and one anthropologist. It has been written that Native Americans are the most studied but least understood people on the Earth. Native author Michael Dorris states this thought in a more direct way. He writes that Native Americans are the most lied about people on the face of the planet. Much of this discontent with the written record about Native Peoples is due to the fact that much of this record has been recorded by Non-Native people and thus passed through a cultural filter that distorts the reality of Native experience and tradition. \\"Standing in the Light, a Lakota Way of Seeing,\\" is a collaborative effort by the authors Severt Young Bear Sr. and Dr. Ronnie Theisz to record an account of the world view of the Lakota people that was written from the viewpoint and understanding of a person that has lived his life within the traditional culture of the Lakota People. Severt Young Bear Sr. was born on the Pine Ridge Reservation in 1934 and lived his life in the traditional community of Porcupine, SD. In his life he was a rancher, a ranger, a tribal councilman, a singer with and drum keeper of the acclaimed Porcupine Singers that appeared in the movies \\"Dances With Wolves, \\" and \\"Thunderheart,\\" an instructor at Oglala Lakota College, and founder of International Brotherhood Days, a cross cultural forum that is held the second week of July each year at the Young Bear dance grounds just outside Porcupine, SD.. This book is a rare look from the inside of Lakota culture from one that lived within that context. The work touches on the past of the Lakota People, and focusses on the importance of traditions of the culture to the survival and identity of the Lakota Nation. As a self-styled student of Lakota culture I value this book as one of the most relavant books in my collection. Highly recommended. --This text refers to the Paperback edition."},{"Title":"Standing in the Light: A Lakota Way of Seeing (American Indian Lives)","review":"\\"Standing in the Light: A Lakota Way of Seeing\\" is a print version of conversations between R.D. Theisz, a college professor, and Severt Young Bear, a Lakota singer, historian, and cultural traditionalist. \\"Standing in the Light\\" is a cornucopia of cultural information about the Lakota people. The book begins with a discussion about Severt Young Bear's relatives and ancestors, followed by a very brief history of the Sioux people. Unfortunately, the book went to press about the time Severt Young Bear died, in 1993.\\"Standing in the Light\\" has four parts. The first section deals with names in Indian culture. According to Severt, names are of central importance in Lakota culture. Young Bear explains how the people received their names and what names mean in Lakota (his own Lakota name is Hehaka Luzahan, or Swift Elk). Agency officials anglicized Lakota names in the 1880's for a census on the reservation and then applied these names to descendents in perpetuity. This bothers Severt because it means descendents in his family do not earn their name, an important part of the Lakota life process. \\"Young Bear\\" comes from Severt's grandfather, who received the name to reflect his accomplishments in battle; he was a fearless warrior who fought like a bear when cornered. The name \\"Severt\\" comes from his father's war experience, when Severt's father befriended a Swede and promised the man to name his son after him.The second part of the book discusses oral traditions in Lakota culture. There are some great stories in this section, like the story about Sio Paha (translated as the Medicine Hill). This place received the name Medicine Hill because in prereservation days it was the site of a test between powerful medicine men. The medicine men would practice their magic on each other in order to discover who had the most powerful medicine. Whenever a man was felled by magic, he was out of the contest. Severt discusses one contest where a heyoka (a sacred clown, or someone whose role in the tribe was to make fun of everyone else) won by practicing medicine he learned from the bumblebee. There are more stories in this section, all of which are fascinating and informative.The third section covers Severt's career as a musician and his days as a member of the Porcupine Singers, a Lakota drum group who toured powwows and other important Indian gatherings. There are all types of songs in the Lakota world, from honoring songs to dancing and social songs. Many of the social songs helped Indians get together back in the days when the government frowned on Indian gatherings. The Rabbit dance is a good example of a social song. Rabbit songs are quite simple lyrically, but young people used to gather in someone's house to dance to these songs. Of course, all these musical gatherings required musicians, and this is where Severt brings in the importance of the drum and its role in creating and expressing the music. He also discusses how life on the road for the successful Indian musician is just as stressful as it is for any type of musician: egos get large, cars break down, and arguments over money usually ensue.The final section of the book is Severt's examination of what is wrong with Lakota society. Young Bear turns out to be quite conservative as he discusses the problems of the reservation world. His arguments for a return to personal responsibility, a healthy diet, respect for the elders, and responsible childrearing not only have lessons for Lakotas, but also are important for all cultures. Severt's involvement in the American Indian Movement (AIM) and its stand at Wounded Knee in the 1970's, covered in some depth in the book, further highlights his concern for cultural issues.At the end of the book, Severt sums up his reasons for agreeing to create this book. Severt believes every powwow or gathering of Indians has four circles. The first circle is the one in which Indians are dancing and taking part in their culture. As the circles move outwards, one finds Indians who are not as aware of the cultural activities going on in the first circle. The last circle, the circle on the farthest reaches of the gathering, holds the lost Indians, those who are afraid of learning about their culture and so lose themselves in drugs, loose sex, or alcohol. Severt wants to bring all of the other circles into the first circle, into the \\"light,\\" so all the Lakotas may partake in their culture.\\"Standing in the Light\\" is a powerful statement. For those who wish to learn about Indian culture, look no further than this book. I am surprised there are not more reviews of this amazing survey of Lakota cultural ideas."},{"Title":"Standing in the Light: A Lakota Way of Seeing (American Indian Lives)","review":"I am enchanted with this book, one of the most exquisite books I have seen in a long time.

It's about the history of ideas, a basic map of a vast sweep of thought, giving you a way to anchor each of the thinkers and their concepts.I've never found the interconnections among philosophers' thoughts so well explained as here. You get the sense that this is a long, intricate conversation about ultimate things.Robinson is a truly fine explainer. He speaks like a man who had to figure out a lot, and he explains it clearly, vividly, and at times quite personally -- letting his bias show. As a speaker, he is outstanding. There were moments that brought a smile of admiration at how well he expressed something. And that's saying a lot.On anything with so broad a sweep, Robinson is better at some topics than others, but no lecture was a disappointment to me.I've read and listened to a number of more specialized, better trained authors, and, to my mind, Robinson is better. He is not speaking as an expert to other experts, but as a broadly educated thinker to others with real curiosity about the topic. I consider it the best introduction to philosophy I've seen yet -- though, for creative delight, I'd also recommend \\"Sophie's World: A Novel About the History of Philosophy.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Ideas of Philosophy (The Great Courses on Tape, Volumes 1-5, a total of 25 audiotapes)","review":"Professor Robinson has here the best Philosophy Class that I cam imagine.Complete, well, well researched and as simple as possible.I strongly recommend this material.CGB"},{"Title":"The Great Ideas of Philosophy (The Great Courses on Tape, Volumes 1-5, a total of 25 audiotapes)","review":"This course provided a great overview and was easy to follow.

Good purchase."},{"Title":"Standard Handbook for Telescope Making","review":"When I got into making my 16\\" mirror in the 80's, though I had the book by Allyn J. Thompson, I wanted something more up to date. I'd thought of the Jean Texereau book but was scared away by the math (I've since learned it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be). So, I saw this book in Willmann Bell and ordered it. It was a real treat to get it as I was living in Spain at the time and books like this were not available in the base bookstore.The book is very well laid out and informative. The instructions are simple and not overly technical. It was a real pleasure to have this book as a guide because it covered larger mirrors that the Thompson book didn't. It worked great until I got to the mirror testing part, and had trouble with the Focault testing because I was having problems with astigmatism. My mirror was quite thin, and I wasn't used to the extreme shadows I was seeing. A friend in Minneapolis St. Paul came to the rescue and sent me a Ronchi grating of the proper spacing. The lines on my mirror looked like a butterfly! No wonder the Focault shadows didn't look right! In that respect, the book didn't help, but once I got the lines straighter, the Focault method Howard outlines works just fine.This book also has a lot of extra stuff that really came in handy when it came to making the scope after the mirror was done. Howard did a great job and this is another book to add to your library if you are at all interested in mirror making. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A handy book of commonly-used American idioms","review":"Since I was a teenager, I received this master gift from my unforgettable first girlfriend who studied English in Canada during a year (she passed away) and the gratitude has not yet ended.The emblematic and smart linguistic devices reported here were very useful through my years as student whether in the High School as well as at the University.Don't hesitate to acquire it.

Louis Kent, son of Amanda Kent, has taken control of the family business and fortunes, but, despite being his mothers son, is turning out to be a heartless, profiteering opportunist.Jephta Kent is working on the familys newspaper when, through dramatic circumstances, he meets his son Gideon from whom he has been separated for many years. His former wife has remarried to an actor named Lamont, who is a fanatical supporter of Southern rights and who is secretly plotting to seize the fortune left to Jephtas sons, to further the Southern cause. As America is drawn into a war between the North and South, Gideon becomes a cavalry officer and takes part in many terrible battles. The book ends with the news that Gideon is missing in action--can't wait to start Book 6-The Warriors."},{"Title":"The Titans","review":"John Jakes charges onward in his chronicles of Kent family, jumping ahead a few years for the fifth book (Amanda's son Louis is now a grown, married man) but slowing the pace down and really digging in. It's no wonder -- the setting for this one is the Civil War, and Jakes keeps it mainly at the beginning of the war, 1861.Whereas the fourth book was fully Amanda Kent's story, \\"The Titans\\" trades off with her cousin Jephtha -- seen only in letters and brief encounters until now -- and his ex-wife Fan, her new husband Edward, and Jephtha's oldest son Gideon Kent, now a soldier following, certainly, the family legacy. On the ugly battlefield, Gideon comes of age and learns his true merit in much the same way Philip Kent did a hundred years earlier. Woven through the story of Gideon and the young lady he loves, Margaret Marble, is an argument on the brutality, honor, but seeming futility of war. Unlike Anne Ware, who had only admired Philip after he uniformed up, Margaret can't stand the thought of Gideon taking to the battlefield, seeing it as the most foolish form of self-destruction.Even more important than this issue of war, though, is the idea of truth being revealed, of deceptions being uncovered, as Jephtha struggles to reconnect with the sons he's been separated from. The redemption of this \\"fallen\\" clergyman (now serving as a journalist, of all things) is cathartic for several people.I'm loving this series, and I'm charging onward, myself, to the sixth book ..."},{"Title":"The Titans","review":"I have read and own all 8 books of the Kent Family Chronicles - I have them both in original paperback and on my kindle - I have read the series several times and having it in my kindle is much easier than carrying around my dog-eared, much warn copies."},{"Title":"The Titans","review":"I have to review &#34;The Titians&#34; along with all the other &#34;Kent Chronicles&#34; series of books.

Of course for those who enjoy the military I think you'd give this a 4-5 star rating.

In this work, the life and times of Brigham Young, is no different. It is though a thoughtful, well researched work. To study the life of any given individual or time, more than one work need be read. This is no exception. I do feel though, that this particular work is important as it does indeed add to our knowledge of a fascinating individual. The author has done what any good biographer does, given reasons for the cause and effect of an individual life and an individual action. This is a \\"shoot from the hip\\" work and more or less tells it the way the author sees it. The question of polygamy is examined in a rather practical way which I found refreshing. The material in this book is well organized and easy to understand. There is logic behind the author's statements when it comes to necessary speculation, something all biographers must do. This work, combined with many others, gives us a good view of a man and his time and more understanding of both. Isn't that what it is all about? Highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"The lion of the Lord: A biography of Brigham Young","review":"An excellent critical biography that pulls no punches but focuses on Young's positive accomplishments as well.What is Brigham Young's contributtion to the Momons? According to Hirshson,Young reintroduced Calvinism int the religion,that is material wealth as a sign of God's favor.Hirshson states that Joseph Smith was more a spiritualist and formulated doctrine,while Young was the \\"nuts and bolts\\"man that put Mormonism into practice and made it grow.Young could use unlawful methods when necessary to his purpose but could weigh accurately when the situation required obeyance of the law.For example when the U.S. government sent troops against the Mormons in 1857,Young dispersed his militia and laid down his arms in subjection,a smart move,not like a suicide cult would do.The Lion could become the lamb without changing clothes.On the Question of the illegal activities of the \\"Danites\\" sort of a paramilitary extralegal force,after reading this book i would say that Young overlooked their\\"activities\\" and also made suggestions for future,\\"projects\\".Young was careful though to keep a few layers of deniability cover between the Danites and himself.The Lion is also a fox. Hirshson also offers insight into the Mormon's \\"peculuiar institution\\" that is polygamy.Young at times even tried to deny this but there were just too many leaks on this one.Hirshson offers an economic reason for polygamy,that is in a farming,manufacturing culture as was the Mormons initially,more wives meant more children and free workers.So polygamy could be a form of slavery? Hirshson states that Mormons sometimes used beatings to keep their families in line.It could have been as well pride like a person having more cattle,or a guard against loneliness? Hirshson states that undoubtedly some Mormon men were ruled by lusty passions in their accumulations but alot were trying to use large families because they believed a large family would assure safety and survival of their religion.The Lion of the Lord no matter what he was ,was never a goat.P.T. Barnum asked Young to go on tour with him in the 1870's and believed that Young would bring in more money than \\"Tom Thumb\\". He told young,\\"I consider you the best show in America\\"! Hirshson's book will explain why."},{"Title":"The lion of the Lord: A biography of Brigham Young","review":"I started reading this work hoping for an objective and fair description of the life of Brigham Young. I grew concerned when reading the intro, the author states that he pulled much of his information from sources such as Eastern Newspapers and columns that were written during the Mormon Prophet's life. At first glance these seem like legitimate sources, unless you have done research, as I have, and are familiar with the time period. Brigham Young was seen by most people of the day as a notorious villain, not too far off from Frankenstein's monster. The Mormons were also seen as a spectacle. Wild rumors and crazy gossip of the Mormons and Utah circulated the country. I continued to grow concerned when I kept reading, and found statements where the author clearly didn't do his research. At one point he states the purpose and content of the Book of Mormon but gets it so completely, and obviously wrong that it is ridiculous. Very basic research was neglected, or overlooked in favor of juicy gossip and anti-mormon sentiment. This Biography was very disappointing, and I felt it painted a very inaccurate portrait of Brigham Young. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Masterpieces of Chinese Export Porcelain from the Mottahedeh Collection in the Virginia Museum","review":"Another Wonderful book about the amazing Mottahedeh collection.

The practice of magic aims at control of the emotions; its goal is to arrive at a place where one is perfectly content and at ease in the now moment....\\" ~ Bob MakranskyI love this little book! It is what I refer to as a \\"carry\\" book - a book you keep in your car, your purse, your brief case to pick up and read when you have a few minutes. Many years ago I received some sage advice to always have something to read with me so that I could focus on something positive while on line or in traffic. Bob Makransky's 123 page Magical Living fits the bill perfectly! Makransky's collection of essays on how to return to our innate ability to live magically in this wonderful world and how to rid ourselves of the sub-conscious agendas developed in response to our society's paradigms is written with a beautiful, straight forward simplicity.\\"The point is that what we are attempting to do with magic is to pick that one of the infinite probable realities which branch off from the present moment which will lead to a future in which we realize our desires.\\" Makransky talks to us about connecting with the Spirit, connecting with the spirits of the earth and the water, and action with the Spirit. However, he also teaches us how to take this connection and understand on the most fundamental level that we are the authors of our own lives. He teaches us how to go beyond our thought forms, how to dig deep to reach our true emotions. Magical Living is written so well that you feel as though Bob Makransky is sitting in your livingroom passionately wanting you to understand how to live in the moment with your true ability to create your own destiny, how to create love in your life, and how to prepare for the effective prayers that will ensure your abundant living.My favorite essay title is On Not Letting the S.O.B.'s Get You Down. At first glance, you may think that this is simply an essay on how to ruthlessly turn the other cheek. However, Makransky tells us that \\"We can't get the guy in front of us to get off our foot until we get off the foot of the guy in back of us.\\" Without getting sappy or cosmic, Makransky reminds us that we must be extremely aware of our negative feelings about the S.O.B.'s because those feelings cannot arise unless we are invading another's space just as ours is being invaded. According to Makransky, the only way to beat the S.O.B.'s is to continue to present them with a reflection of joy rather than validate their own self-hatred!From photograph gazing to gardening to the preparation for effective prayer, Makransky positively, passionately, and pointedly shows us how to connect with our emotions and live from that place rather than from our random thought forms. Each essay offers us a fresh perspective and ends with the joyful possibilities of our future probable realities. The appendices of the book include the Hour Rulers By Day of the Week and the Tables of Planetary Hours. Makransky does not just tell us how to achieve joyful, abundant living, he also offers us the tools to maximize these potentials. Carry this book with you, read and reread the essays, and connect with joy and gratitude!*****************************************************************Kathryn Lanier lives in Colorado with her nine year old twins.

I completely enjoyed this story and was mesmerized by the innocent coming-of-age story by the narrator, Abraham. This novel is a quick read, chock-full of meaning and sweetness, and invokes a peaceful feeling of nostalgia for the bygone days when there was nothing more magical than a drive-in theatre.Flamingo Rising tells the story of the feuding Lee and West families in the 1960s. Turner West has built his funeral home overlooking the Atlantic ocean. Not long after, Hubert Lee builds his lifelong dream -- the world's largest drive-in theatre, an icon of life, happiness and merriment -- right next door to the funeral home. Their sparring is nothing short of funny and immature. But what happens later, the involvement of Turner's daughter, Grace, and Hubert's son, Abraham, is what really spark the flames. It's Romeo and Juliet with a twist!I urge everyone to read Flamingo Rising. The story is told through the eyes of the almost-50 Abraham as he reflects on his childhood and his coming-of-age. However, it is so much more than a love story between the children -- the drive-in employees are so much like a family, the relationship of the Lees and Wests are at times riotous, bittersweet and poignant. And the ending was totally unexpected and very moving. Larry Baker has created a sweetly atmospheric story and one that will stay with me forever. A feel-good, warm-in-the-belly kind of book. If you see a copy, grab it!"},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"Rita Mae Brown with a little more scope, Tom Robbins stopping before the exaggeration is bigger than life, John Irving's thoughtfulness--with a touch of early, fresh, lean John Updike. The prose on page 1 of The Flamingo Rising is strikingly good, and the story that starts there is unfailingly fascinating: funny, simple, metaphorical, true.These crazy Southern parents are much loved, fully human, and never mere caricature (I have crazy Southern parents: I know). The young man coming of age is also a Korean-adoptee narrator whose sense of himself and life is reflected both in the story's larger metaphors (e.g., Frank the dog, the giant image-tower, a graveyard by the sea, a house of images) and in a thoughtful narrative voice old enough to give one a sense of life and life's passing but true to its youth--also offering a cool but undistanced contrast between its simplicity and life's glorious exaggerations.I recommend this book for anyone interested in: a contemporary boy's coming of age; the problem of being one's parents' child; humor and profundity where unusual life shows you life at its heart; a very moving, very funny story; how to run a drive-in. And not least for the voice of the narrator. There are a couple of sermons underlying the thoughtfulness, but it's good to have folks like this in the pulpit. (The prose continues to be good) Thanks to Mr. Baker for a deeply moving and delightful work of art."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"Larry Baker's &quot;The Flamingo Rising&quot; provides a remarkably insightful look into a time period often characterized as &quot;dull.&quot; His characters resonate with deft depictions of memorable individuals. You will identify with the eccentrics who populate this entertaining novel, and you will eagerly anticipate the publication of his second novel. If no other follows, it would still stand on its own much as &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; would have guaranteed Salinger his permanent place in American literature."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"This is a delightful book with vivid characters that you want to meet! In fact, this book is so original and fun to read, I had to keep looking at the picture of Larry Baker and wonder -- how does he come up with these people and situations? It's easy to try and compare Baker with John Irving...since both have Iowa City roots...but I'd compare this book more to &quot;The Shipping News&quot; -- you actually LIKE the characters and care about what happens to them. Yes, yes, yes -- give it a try! Let's encourage MORE first time authors like Larry Baker."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"I was recommended this book by a good friend.I will say this first. I have never read a book like The Flaming Rising by Larry Baker and I've read a lot. This book is hard to describe. The best I can do is that the protagonist and narrator is Abraham, the adopted Korean son, of a drive-in theater Florida native. We find that later in life, Abraham is a lover a photography. To me, the book is written in a series of photographs-- snap shots in time that are focused around his early teen years, his relationship with his family (mostly focusing on his crazy father). We are introduced also to Turner West, who owns the funeral home down the road and the feud between Abraham's father and Turner. Of course to make things more difficult, Abraham falls in love with West's daughter, Grace.This book is well written. Some of the decisions as to how it was written are not as clear until the end. I will be upfront about how this is not my type of book. The characters are both fascinating and horrifying at the same time. Alice and Polly are two additions halfway in the book. Baker takes a great risk in writing this book the way he has. In many ways, it pays off. His descriptions are lush and many times poignant. Writers are often taught, write what you know. Many times, I would think that this was a true autobiography because that is the way it felt to me and usually can be quite difficult for writers to accomplish.That said, I wonder why it wasn't an autobiography. I believe that Baker's own life experiences as a drive-in owner, would have fascinated me. I kept wanting the story to be real, because that's what it felt like. Personally, I felt that it lost something when I realized it was fiction. I know that's a personal opinion, rather than a fault of the writing. I also had a hard time staying interested in the novel because at the end of each chapter, we get a secret revealed but then the actual story of that secret is not told until several chapters later. For me, this didn't work.That said, this is a tremendously creative and many times beautifully written novel, and the praise it has gotten is well deserved. I think in the end, this just was not my kind of novel, but that's okay. It was worth reading."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"All I can say is: read this book. If you're an adult who was lucky enough to have a drive in to go to, you'll love it. If you have never been to one, you'll still love it. The descriptions about the running of such a place is worth the price alone. You'll meet a family who's father decides to make his neighbor's life a living hell--all using the giant screen and fireworks. The fact that the neighbor runs a funeral home is even more delicious. There are great characters all along the way in this tale including a dog that lives in the attic, a tic-ridden airplane pilot, a nympomaniac and a lady that dies on the toilet. A great coming of age story set in the '60's that you'll think about long after you're finished. The ending is both poignant and heartfelt. Like I said, A Keeper!"},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"i grew up w/ a drive theatre in my town-one of only three in the state. it closed three years ago-just after i finished high school. it was a tremendous loss. for anyone who ever felt the magic of the drive-in, a big outdoor party and a night at the movies all in one- this book will be a nostalgic look back. for anyone who loves reading books w/ characters make you laugh out loud and whose grief can make you cry- you will love this book. also-as someone who often judges books by their covers- i bought the hardcover edition-which had a very '50ish art deco look. do not judge by this cover. you will miss a wonderful chance to meet characters who will crawl into your heart and stay there."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"Though compelling, The Flamingo Rising ultimately disappoints. The characters are mostly wonderful (read full of wonder, wondrous traits) and the story is interesting enough to keep the reader turning pages, but the author is too present, the omissions are disappointing, and the overall spirit of the work too preachy. Why does Abraham keep a house only for photographs? Because this is a novel, that's why. Why is a vicious dog allowed to live on a floor all by himself? Because this is a novel, that's why. Why is the use of bad language written ABOUT and AT rather than included in dialogue? Because this is a novel, that's why. Because we are allowed to know ABOUT the characters, but the author's own prudishness dictates that we not hear the characters.I picked up this book because of the promising quote from a critic comparing Baker to John Irving and Pat Conroy. Baker does not have the skill of either of these great writers. The only trait he shares, and it's a good one, is the ability to let the reader know exactly what is going to take place and still make him/her want to keep turning pages.I liked this book, but it left me somewhere between amused and perturbed. &quot;Show, don't tell&quot; is a lesson writers hear over and over again. Baker insists on telling us about anything he deems unessential or off-color. Show, don't tell, Mr. Baker. Or leave it out completely. And mostly, leave yourself out."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"This book was a good read but not quite in the can't-put-it-down category. It's about a 1960's nuclear family who operate a massive drive-in theater along Florida's Atlantic coast south of Jacksonville. The cast of characters grows to include a Scatman Crothers-type black handyman (only he's very short) and a part terrier/part wiener dog (who becomes unforgiveably vicious). Most of the doings concern the interplay between the lurid but fun cinema and the staid but necessary funeral chapel next door, especially the Romeo-and-Juliet substory of the narrator and his girl. The prose style hit the right buttons: it was neither too colloquial nor too U-of-Iowa-Workshop, if you know what I mean. Unfortunately, though, there was often some heavy-handed foreshadowing of events to come. Anticipating one tragic scene, we witness it through the eyes of a 16-year-old boy, the adult he has become, with symbolism, and with ironic detachment. In this sense the novel is over-engineered. Baker is too good at his craft; he's already experienced enough to go for an effect once and get it right. I look forward to his next book."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"The Flamingo Rising appeared under the Christmas tree with my name on it, and when I picked it up to while away some dreary post-holiday afternoons I was most pleasantly surprised. The story is immediately engaging; as for its cast, I found myself imagining the later lives of a number of the characters, a full day after I had finished the book. (I always take this to be a good sign.) Every once in a while the very oddities of the book weighed it down, and my suspension of disbelief faltered; but these very oddities make the book charming, and provide very good entertainment indeed. A great gift, and many thanks to the giver!"},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"I absolutely adored this book. I took my time reading it because I felt like I was a part of it. It has characters in it that anyone can relate to. You must know from the beginning that a tragedy does occur but it is not what the book is all about. Don't look for this to happen. Just enjoy the book as it unfolds and the tragedy will not ruin it for you. It's just wonderful. It all works. It is America with all it's cliques, colorfulness and newness."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"Vivid and amazing tale, though the abridgement (as always) is a bit lacking. The Korean born &quot;twins&quot;, the biggest drive-in on the earth, a feud, a midget with a huge heart, a consummate screw-up, and a couple hot babes, together with coming of age, young love, the assassinations, and a Grand Finale you won't forget. As usual the reader took some getting used to - does an excellent job on voice changes, but just a bit mincing in some of the delivery - and ah am used to men with southern accents. Nevertheless, I fell into the story, noticed a few abridgement gaps, and even more when I read other readers' reviews of the story. Wished it had ended with the Handel fireworks music!"},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"Although I enjoyed the various characters and plot lines in this book, I found this story lacking in depth and emotional drive. With too many issues and none of them fully explored, the author seemed to forget his basic focus: the link his mother provided between the narrator's father and his future father-in-law. The Romeo/Juliet comparison some reviewers have made fall flat for me simply because I never believed in the supposed love between the two teens; the pairing struck me as more of a convenience than undying passion. Despite these flaws, the ending--both of a family and an era--moved me to tears."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"You're better off reading just about anything by John Irving, with nods to Heller. The best that can be said is that it's mildly entertaining, with the potential to make Izzy actually interesting emerging and submerging along the way. Imitation may be the highest form of flattery, but in this case it results in a marginal reading experience at best."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"..by how much I enjoyed reading this book. I finished it within two days & felt peaceful about the ending. Every once in awhile I like reading a book that helps me leave the real world behind."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"I liked this book and its characters, though I had a hard time keeping up with their names. Usually when this happens to me, I blame it on the author not protraying them in such a way that they are memorable in my mind. I loved the premise of them living in the giant screen and the juxtaposition of classical music and a library beneath a raging dog kennal. It was a priceless visual! I just never got emotionally involved in the story to the point that I hated to put the book down. Bottom line.......it was an okay read on the airplane (I travel 200 days a year and read about five books a week!) Each time I found a gem of a chapter, it was followed by some disjointed and disappointing one...like a roller coaster."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"Larry Baker has shown what a thrill books can still delivery. The characters are still in my mind six months after I put the work down."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"This is one of those books, where the people are so incredibly real -- real feelings, real situations, real dialogue -- that you can read for hours without realizing the time has gone by. It's like peering into someone else's life. You spend the entire story feeling sorry for Abe, then, at the end there is the realisation that he is as crazy as the rest of them. It is a great &quot;story&quot;. It's not a &quot;Horror&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;, &quot;Mystery&quot; or &quot;Romance&quot;. It is simply a story that is told with ease.

Hats off to you, Mr. Baker."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"For lovers of John Irving, The Flamingo Rising will delight. Larry Baker's first novel is wonderful in its characters, its writing, and its irony."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"Charmingly well written with all audiences in mind. Larry Baker is a wonderful story teller who makes fiction seem like fact. I felt this family was very much alive in the world. They were wonderful characters who grew in my heart. Abe Issac Lee was the perfect character to illustrate these wonderful memories of his life."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"I thought this book was a wonderful look into past and what things were like four or five decades ago. There was such a diverse cast of characters and the author made them all beliveable. He made the characters seem realistic without being overly done and we followed Abe from boyhood into manhood, his loves and his losses, and the guilt he must live with over mistakes he made. I thought this was a totally endearing book, and it held my attention until the end."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"When I was told to write an critique on the lastest book that I read, I was worried because I found that I couldn't really choose whether or not I liked the book. It has its good parts, like the way Baker gives you real insight into the minds of his characters, and its bad, the way he tends to dictate events. I enjoyed reading the book although it had its dull points there was always something in the next chapter to keep me turning pages."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"While the nostalgic setting and tone and colorful characters should easily have drawn me in - on the surface it's my kind of book - I found the text somewhat forced and insincere. A constant complaint was that the writer would underline and telegraph the outcome of the chapter I was just beginning. And the conversation the narrator was having with the reader wore thin after awhile. Still the ending did surprise, shock even, and all of the characters were quirky enough to hold my interest."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"This novel is so delightful, I treasure every minute I read it. I don't want it to finish..."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"Upon release, Iowa writer Larry Baker's debut novel garnered an unusual amount of attention. Deservingly? Not really. It's a fun read that carries you along, but it's not all that good a novel. For every promising passage, a clunker brings you back to earth. The story's setting does lift \\"The Flamingo Rising\\" out of the ordinary. Baker introduces us to a man who, in the early 1950s, builds the drive-in to end all drive-ins on a square mile of Florida beachfront....Baker's plot will remind some readers of Paul Theroux's great 1982 novel \\"The Mosquito Coast,\\" another teenage boy's story of an eccentric visionary father who moves his wife and children to a remote location to build a landscape-dominating tower. But, though \\"The Flamingo Rising\\" has many charms, and a good deal of drama and pathos, it has little of the earlier book's sweep and impact. The key to \\"The Mosquito Coast\\"'s success is the mind-set that drives the narrator's father to extreme creations that only he understands. Here, we never get to know Abraham's father, and that's a shame. The smaller, internal stories sometimes carry more weight than the grand ones."},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","review":"&quot;Flamingo Rising&quot; had the makings of a wonderful novel. However, it was anything but. The main character, and narrator, Abraham Lee, spends too much time reflecting on things, and trying to make the reader understand where he's coming from. I found all this to be unnecessary. The author paints a clear picture of the Flamingo Drive In, owned by Abe's parents, and the funeral home next door which is owned by his father's nemesis, Turner West. He gives great descriptions of Abe, his sister Louise, their parents, and the other people in their lives without the voice of the narrator who's constantly speaking to the reader with phrases like &quot;you must understand&quot; or &quot;try to picture.&quot; After a while, Abe comes across sounding preachy, and I felt as if I was reading a term paper rather than a novel.The only characters with any real substance to them are Polly and Alice, two young women who enter Abe's life after taking on jobs at the Flamingo. Sadly, even their presence wasn't enough to salvage this novel for me. &quot;The Starlite Drive-In&quot; by Marjorie Reynolds is a much better story centered around a similar time and place. Read that instead."},{"Title":"Taken on trust","review":"I picked this up at the library because i remember very clearly when Waite was captured and held hostage. What a story. I found myself moved almost to tears by the end, as i thought of Waite and the three other hostages he ended up with, not to mention the many others who were held in Lebanon during the same time. Parenthetically, i do not know what it is that causes me to cry nowadays; is it a function of age? of some increased sensibilities? of a new maturity? Whatever the cause, i now find tears coming to me more and more frequently as i read or see a movie or, even, just think. End diversion. As i read i did wish that the tale was a little less disjointed. I know why it is, and i accept the reasoning behind it; i simply feel that the story was more confusing than it need be. Perhaps if the present (being held in Beirut) had been in a different type-face...? I don't know. Nevertheless, the literary merit of the book is hardly the purpose for reading it. As the story of a man held for almost five years, four of them, i think, alone, this is remarkable. Not once do you get the feeling that Waite is whining (and why shouldn't he? When he first saw his son again after the captivity he saw &quot;a young man I assumed was Mark&quot;), as was the case of the other book i read from the same experience (was it Terry Anderson? i don't remember). One is filled with respect for Waite and the forbearance he shows his captors; i want to reach out and slap them silly, ask them how they could treat a human being in such a way. But he forgives them. How many men could do that? Apparently this servant of God and the Church is one."},{"Title":"Taken on trust","review":"I have recently finished listening to Terry Waite's story on audio tape. Waite himself read his story. His story is one of those that I will never forget hearing. The absolute deprivation that he and the other hostages faced during those years is impossible to comprehend. I realize now that so many of us take our lives and our faith for granted. His faith was put completely to the test over those five years. It struck me how he repeatedly stated that his sufferings were nothing compared to the suffering that Jesus endured. Although most of us will never be called to suffer in chains as he and so many others have, it is painfully clear that we must always pray for those that do. I think that all people who claim Jesus as their Lord and Savior should read &quot;Taken on Trust.&quot;"},{"Title":"Taken on trust","review":"Waite has been much maligned for his motives in trying to help free the Beirut hostages, indeed he has even been accused of being fully aware, possibly complicit, in the arms-to-Iran scandal. That is debateable and I doubt that he was aware. However no one can doubt his courage and compassion when he risked his life in trying to free the hostages. At the personal cost in the end of being a hostage himself."},{"Title":"Taken on trust","review":"I read this book straight after reading Nelson Mandela's 'Long Walk To Freedom'.

These are thoroughly covered in 186 entries which include holiday symbols, legends, and mythical spirits that bring gifts. A number of entries focus on archaic customs and superstitions no longer in practice. These played roles in shaping the modern Christmas, however, and therefore are of historical interest. Also discussed are the customs and cuisine of selected, individual countries around the world. An extensive index and bibliography are helpful, and several appendices list Christmas web sites and \\"Christmas Associations\\" (organizations). Illustrations consist primarily of 50 full-page black-and-white line drawings of contemporary style.Despite being named an Outstanding Reference Source, the book suffers from several deficiencies, one of which is the inconsistent format used to describe foreign traditions. Whereas some entries provide comprehensive coverage of national traditions, others present only a few isolated customs. For example, the entry about Germany is quite comprehensive, yet for a country like Sweden, no similar comprehensive entry exists. Instead, readers must look up three different entries titled \\"St. Lucia Day,\\" \\"Julklapp,\\" or \\"Jultomten\\" to find anything about Sweden. Also lacking are foreign phrases for \\"Merry Christmas.\\"Furthermore, a number of related entries creates needless repetition. For example, virtually the same basic information about the Nativity is spread out over six entries: \\"Gospel Accounts of Christmas,\\" \\"Gospel Account of Matthew,\\" \\"Gospel Account of Luke,\\" \\"Jesus, Birth of,\\" \\"Magi,\\" and \\"Star of Bethlehem.\\" Similarly, note \\"Advent,\\" \\"Advent Calendar, \\"Advent Candle,\\" \\"Advent Wreath,\\" etc. References and web sites not only terminate each entry but are also duplicated in the bibliography and appendices at the back of the book. These repetitions and duplications, at least in part, must account for the book's 729 pages.Entries regarding literature, music, or other aspects of popular culture are limited to Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" Handel's \\"Messiah,\\" and Tchaikovsky's \\"The Nutcracker\\" ballet. It would be difficult to imagine Christmas today without the beloved carols of past centuries or the classic movies, animated cartoons, and television specials of the twentieth century. Where are \\"Silent Night,\\" \\"White Christmas,\\" \\"Miracle on 34th Street,\\" \\"Jingle Bells,\\" \\"It's a Wonderful Life,\\" \\"Rudolph,\\" and many others? Yet this encyclopedia omits these immortal holiday favorites and their like.In summary, this encyclopedia would interest those seeking only the foundations and principal historical events of Christmas but not the Christmas as found in the popular media."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Christmas","review":"Author Tanya Gulevich wrote in the Introduction to this 2000 book, \\"The Encyclopedia of Christmas contains 186 entries on all facets of Christmas arranged in alphabetical order. Topics covered include folk customs and beliefs, religious practices, symbols, legends, mythological and historical figures, foods, beverages, and major artistic works associated with the celebration of Christmas... The book is international in scope, offering 21 entries dealing wholly or mostly with the celebration of Christmas in other countries.\\" (Pg. xiii-xiv)She states, \\"early Christian leaders... denounced Mithraic ceremonies as misleading parodies of Christian rituals. In spite of their opposition to the cult, in the middle of the fourth century Christian authorities selected December 25 as the day on which to celebrate the Nativity of Jesus Christ. Scholars believe that they did so largely in order to divert people away from competing pagan celebrations held on or around that date, such as the Birth of the Invincible Sun.\\" (Pg. 52)She wrote, \\"According to one scholar, Church leaders tried to figure out the date of Jesus' birth from the date traditionally given for his death, March 25. Since they wanted to come up with a round number for Jesus' age at death, they assumed he was also conceived on March 25. Therefore, he must have been born nine months later on December 25.\\" (Pg. 156)She says, \\"Luke's account would seem to suggest that Jesus was born sometime in the spring. Nevertheless, the first celebrations of the Nativity took place in January. During the second and third centuries, a number of Christian communities began to commemorate Jesus' birth on January 6 as part of their Epiphany celebrations.\\" (Pg. 299)She documents, \\"When Pope Gregory XIII established the Gregorian calendar in 1582, he ushered in an era in which the people of Europe disagreed on what day it was. As a result they celebrated Christmas on different days... Some nations and churches refused to adopt the Gregorian reforms. In these lands people continued to celebrate Christmas on December 25, but did so according to the Julian calendar. Their celebrations fell on January 5 according to the new Gregorian calendar.\\" (Pg. 435)This is an excellent reference work, which will answer a host of questions about many different subjects related to the holiday."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Christmas","review":"There's an old saying that you can't judge a book by it's cover. I don't do that. On the other hand, I judge Christmas books of this type by the accuracy of two things -- the story of \\"Silent Night\\" and the information about St. Francis of Assisi and Nativity scenes.Unfortunately this book fails the test on both counts.Regarding the popular carol \\"Silent Night,\\" the book states: \\"Finding himself without a functioning organ for the Christmas Eve service, Father Josef Mohr scribbled down some verse and asked his organist Franz Gruber to quickly score it for voices so that the choir could sing it for that evening's Midnight Mass.\\" The book's author calls it a \\"slap-dash creation.\\"It's very easy to check the real history of this carol through the website of Austria's Silent Night Society. They can be regarded as the keepers of the history of \\"Stille Nacht.\\"Joseph Mohr wrote his six-stanza poem in 1816. There's no way anyone can say for certain that it was slap-dash and there is no way to know how much time he spent on his poem. What we do know is that he didn't give it to Franz Gruber until 1818. Two years later. Hardly slap-dash.Mohr asked Gruber to write a melody with guitar accompaniment but there are no records to indicate that the organ was not functioning. Mohr and Gruber sang the six verses of the carol with the choir repeating the last two lines of each verse. Thus, it's not exactly correct to say it was scored for the choir. They were merely used as background echo for the voices of the two men with Joseph Mohr playing his guitar. I've been to Austria and held Gruber's \\"Stille Nacht\\" manuscript in my hand and pay close attention to everything written about the world's best-loved carol.Pages 290, 405, and 408 of this book, have sections that deal with St. Francis of Assisi. The book's author tells that he created a manger scene \\"using real people and animals.\\" It gives the impression that there was an elaborate scene with people representing Joseph, Mary, shepherds, etc.The biographers of St. Francis were Thomas of Celano and St. Bonaventure. Both men wrote about that incident at Greccio and the English translations of their writings are readily available.St. Francis had a real ox, a real donkey, and a feeding trough (manger) at Greccio. That's all. He celebrated Christmas Mass using the manger as the altar. There were no people to represent Joseph and Mary. There were no people representing shepherds. There were no people to portray Magi.Since I have no way to check everything in the book, the misinformation regarding \\"Silent Night\\" and St. Francis at Greccio leads me to distrust other information in the book. I'm very disappointed and had hoped to share this book with friends.

Spielberg is interviewed by Siskel; Lucas by Ebert.)Much of the focus of this little book is directed toward film preservation, although the title of the book also refers to trends in filmmaking.

The book starts off with basic concepts of time, space, matter, and energy and then develops a timeline of the universe from the big bang onward to the present that incorporates these concepts and speculates on the ultimate fate of the universe using the ideas of dark matter and dark energy. In addition, Mr. Lewis goes into the fundamental incompatibility between quantum mechanics and general relativity at the atomic scale and how string theory might resolve this. He also puts forth a unique and (as far as I know) original idea on a possible afterlife and how string theory could be used to preserve essential information about a person's life (which the author calls humanessence) through the holographic principle. Mr. Lewis develops his ideas very logically and concisely and provides plenty of illustrations which clarify his explanations. As a bonus, he even provides a glossary at the end of the book for the beginner. I would strongly recommend this book to anybody who has an interest in science and ideas and who wants to be introduced to what may be the ultimate theory of our universe."},{"Title":"Our Superstring Universe: Strings, Branes, Extra Dimensions and Superstring-M Theory","review":"The pictures and tables are so poor in quality and printing that would have been wiser not to include them.To make matters worst, the author attempts but completely fails to explain anything in this booklet.There are websites built and maintained by amateurs and enthusiasts that are far better sources.If you're looking for good books on M-Theory and related subjects, buy \\"The Elegant Universe\\" and \\"The Fabric of the Cosmos\\"."},{"Title":"Our Superstring Universe: Strings, Branes, Extra Dimensions and Superstring-M Theory","review":"This little book has 128 pages of text.

Subtract maybe another 25% for amateurish diagrams that do nothing but repeat the text, massive white space, and constant repetition, and you end up with about 36 pages of content on the subject of the title of this book.I'm not sure who the target audience is for this work. It contains no mathematics beyond addition. It contains sentences such as this: \\"The nine planets of our solar system, in order of distance from the sun are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.\\" Or: \\"Dividing by a number greater than one yields a smaller number.\\" What do you think, maybe 5th graders?The content is necessarily shallow, tossing out buzzwords, with no continuity, no real explanations.

Fascinated by the implications of string theory, I wanted more info, and when \\"Our Superstring Universe\\" crept out of the shadows, it actually seemed like a decent choice: a concise, understandable summary of string theory that was up-to-date and professionally done. I emphasize: this is what it SEEMED to be. So I took a chance and ordered it, and when it arrived, the only lesson I got was in how appearances can be deceiving.First off, I don't know if the author even truly understands the concepts he's writing about. Inventing his own (highly suspect) terminology and glossing over several things he should be explaining in detail (as other reviews have noted), I immediately got the sense that this was not a trustworthy source for information on string theory. Instead, I got the sense that this author realized that string theory is a \\"hot\\" field, and he wanted to get in on the action... a lot of science writers have made names for themselves (not to mention getting their books on bestseller lists) in this area.But wait! As if that isn't bad enough, it gets even worse. The diagrams and illustrations are not only pointless filler material, they look like something a 4th-grader might have printed out from a mid-1980's home computer for a school paper. I am 100% serious. It would be hilarious if not for the fact that I paid good money for what was billed as a cutting-edge book.The bottom line is this: there are so many excellent books on this subject, as well as webpages devoted to it, that spending good money on \\"Our Superstring Universe\\" would be a very foolish move. Buyer Beware!"},{"Title":"Becoming a Blessed Church: Forming a Church of Spiritual Purpose, Presence, and Power","review":"Pastor Standish shares an approach to building up a church, no matter how long it has been in existence and no matter what size it is, into a vibrant, blessed body of Christ. One of the criteria our church used for evaluating the myriad of books and recommended approaches available for study was - how is it working for the author? Well, Pastor Standish's denominational suburban church continues to grow and to thrive.The approach is pretty simple. Invite God to all of your church meetings, not just your worship services. Start your business meetings with devotions, and dedicate significant time and energy to the Lord. Pray fervently about your church's decisions and needs, and trust that God answers prayers. Let this approach become the way things are always done at every gathering no matter how large or small. Call on the Holy Spirit to take part in the decision-making process.Being an accountant, I can reconcile accounts and plan budgets with the best of them. However, after reading this book, I now realize that it's okay if my church's forecasted giving doesn't quite measure up to the planned expenses. It's okay if those expenses are a result of what the Spirit is calling our church to do. Pastor Standish includes many accounts, personal and anecdotal, of funding arriving on time from unplanned sources to allow a church organization to fulfill its mission.The book is filled with so much more. And the appendixes are loaded with great practical guides to applying the book's principles, for example:- A Guide to Holding Spiritually Grounded Meetings- Nominating Committee Members- Discerning Direction for a Particular Issue- A Guide to Creating a Prayer GroupAll of our church leadership team has a copy of Becoming a Blessed Church. And the book has been introduced to all members at a congregational meeting. The change in our approach to decision-making and issue resolution has been dramatic. Comments such as, \\"We found that the problem wasn't really a problem after all\\" and \\"Let's pray about that\\" are heard more and more frequently.I heartily recommend Becoming a Blessed Church to all Pastors, church leaders, and committee members. Let the Spirit be the driving force in everything you do and say, and in what you become - blessed."},{"Title":"Becoming a Blessed Church: Forming a Church of Spiritual Purpose, Presence, and Power","review":"Drawing on his experience as a pastor and counselor, Standish describes a blessed church as one that is \\"alive because God is alive.\\" As the pastor of Calvin Presbyterian Church in Zelienople, Pennsylvania he has encouraged an experience with God rather than activity-based church experiences about God. Beginning with prayer to discern God's purpose and vision for the church, the author provides an appendix filled with suggested processes for becoming a blessed church. This refreshing book is not about church membership growth. Rather, it leads the church to become a deeper, broader, spirit-filled community of Christ. The thoughtful reflection questions at the end of each chapter make this an excellent book for study groups and church leaders who are seeking God's transformation in their own lives and the life of the church."},{"Title":"Becoming a Blessed Church: Forming a Church of Spiritual Purpose, Presence, and Power","review":"Excellent book!

We are using it at the church I attend in a Bible study group."},{"Title":"Reference Guide for Essential Oils","review":"If you are looking for a guide to essential oils that also includes information on over 600 health related topics, this is an excellent choice. If you can find a copy of this book you can look up an essential oil and find: the botanical family, chemical constituents, properties, folklore, historical uses, medicinal uses, other possible uses, aromatic influence, application, blend classification, blends with various oils listed and frequency.Sandalwood has frequency of 96 MHz, while Rose oil has a frequency of approximately 320 MHz. It was interesting to read about fresh herbs having a higher frequency than dry herbs and that there is a relationship between frequency and disease. Cancer has a frequency of 42 MHz, while death begins at 25 MHz. Essential oils help the body to regain a healthy frequency. Connie and Alan Higley also discuss the effects of positive and negative thoughts and show how various essential oils affect our moods.Science and Application - How to use oils in baths, compresses and diffusers. You can even add essential oils to paint or use essential oils when cleaning your house for their disinfecting qualities. Vita Flex Therapy and Raindrop Therapy are also discussed.Single Oils - Concise information on pure essential oils. Safety Data is also included. The Historical uses and Folklore make this book quite a fun read. Special Note give detailed information, like in the section about Jasmine the authors explain how the blossoms are collected.Oil Blends - Each blend lists the single oils contained in the blend and gives the reason for including the oils. To find the blends online, just add the name of the oil after \\"Young Living Essential Oils.\\" So to find the Hope blend, you would put in Young Living Essential Oils Hope and it will magically appear. The \\"RC\\" blend was especially helpful when my husband had something very close to pneumonia one year. I think this blend saved his life. I mixed it with Vicks and rubbed it on his chest. You can use this in combination with RAVEN, also for pneumonia. I also found that recovery time was significantly reduced with these two oils. After using these oils, I realized the life-saving power of essential oils.Personal Care Products - You could use this section to make your own body lotions, shampoos and conditioners or it gives you ideas for what you might want to order. The Massage Oil section is very helpful if you are trying to mix your own oils.Supplements and Vitamins - Insight into which essential oils can be used internally. Not all can be, so before ingesting anything, read up on the oils. This book also talks about Stevia and other products to look into for health. If you are interested in antiaging supplements, there are notes about various supplements that could give you excellent results.Personal Guide - This A-Z guide gives you instant access to information on everything from Asthma to Vertigo.I've purchased oils from the Abundant Health Company and their oils are of superior quality. abundant-health4u.com is the site where I first found the book and products. They have new copies of this book. You can find the oils listed here at Amazon underthe name Young Living Essential Oils.I bought this book years and years ago and I still look up information on a weekly basis. I'd consider this to be one of the best books on essential oils I've ever purchased.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Reference Guide for Essential Oils","review":"I just received this book and it appears to be quite thorough. There are primary sections of:1) Application2) Single Oils (BEST PART OF BOOK)3) Oil Blends (These are all Young Living Oil Blends)4) Personal Care Products (Face Cream & Such)5) Bath & Shower Gels6) Tinctures7) Massage Oils8) Supplements (BEST PART OF BOOK)9) Personal Guide (Think Personal Health Care Management - BEST PART OF BOOK)The Personal Guide takes up the entire last half of the book. It tells you what to use for this and for that. Over all it is an in depth book, but important information is lacking (Concerning Formulations) and the book seems to be geared towards Young Living Essential Oils. I have no problem with Young Living, they do have a great product. But THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY COMPANY to offer high quality Theraputic Grade Essential Oils as one would tend to believe after reading some of the things published by their followers. Not to mention that Young Living charges 10x what a product of theraputic grade quality should cost due to their pyramid payment plan for distributors. It is not very Holy to deprive persons who are sick of God's medicine and that is what essential oils are. Everyone cant afford almost $100 for one small bottle of Frankincense - especially when it should not cost that, but maybe $15.00 for the same amount. They also speak of using a Nebulizer which distributes the oils in the air without heating them, to treat illness. The YL nebulizer is once again $100, I know where to get the same one without their logo on it for $39.00. Soooooo, that is one reason why I'm not 100% happy with this book. It is a Young Living sales tool. The section on Personal Care products tells you to use this oil for creams and this and that to create a cream, but gives you no ratio of ingedients. I can mix all those things they mention in the book and not get cream (aka cre'me) because you do have to have the proper ratios. Also MANY of the personal care recipes are full of additives which are not natural and are chemicals. Some are preservatives, and you do need those, but there are natural substances which exist and can be used for preservatives in skin care products. I know cause I make some of them already. You can use Rosemary Oleoresin, Black Willow Bark, Vitamin E (aka topherols) Vitamin E is the has the least amount of long acting effectiveness of those in preserving however (FYI). But there are also many other natural items that preserve, act as thickeners, binders, emulsifyers (keeps the oil from seperating). And none of those are in here. If your going to put it in a book that is about keeping medicine natural basically, don't work chemicals into it. I thought it strange. The section on single oils and their uses is awesome. I really like that section and was my primary reason for wanting this book. The section on the blends is good also, however they are all Youngliving Blends. Which is fine, it does tell you the ingredients for each one, but there are no ratio's so you have no idea of how much to use for each. There are a few pages also which go over Raindrop Technique with no pictures. It is very informative and I was also appreciative of this information as I am intersted in pursuing this field. Once I do go down that path though, and since I'm a beliver in God's medicine being available to all who need it. My oils WILL NOT be Young Living Oils for the simple fact that their prices are ridiculous and prevent those who are in need from receiving what God intended. God wants us all to profit, but I do not see how they sleep at night. Probably on BIG FAT pillows! I only bring God into this because it is a position Youngliving holds. That Essential Oils that are theraputic grade are God's medicine. I belive that too. But you didnt see Jesus putting his hand out for a payment before healing the blind, now did you? And this book strongly pushing Youngliving...... Maybe they received payments we don't know about for that?The sections called Supplements & Personal Guide are VERY extensive and tell you how to make decoctions (sort of - again no ratios - easily found directions on the web or in books by James Green) and what herbs to use in capsules, addresses teas I believe and is very in depth. I am glad I have the book, don't get me wrong. Lots of good info, but be ready for a Young Living Pitch :) Enjoy! I will eventually purchase the new edition also. So I do like the book in spite of it's short falls."},{"Title":"Reference Guide for Essential Oils","review":"Wouldn't want to be without it and it offers many formulas that are expensive to buy in bottle form.

The designs come from malacates which were small spindles made of clay by the pre-columbiam cultures. There are approximately 2-4 designs per page which allows for clarity for the artists use for reproduction. With the use of computers many of these images may be reproduced for use in any type of creative endeavor where a Mexican motiff is desired. An artist may find the designs inspirational for a new creation or use the existing image as is. Simple geometric designs, including images of humans, animals, flowers both real and imagined give a concise and visual glimpse at the ancient cultures imagery . This is an excellent source book that is useful for a variety of projects and applications for all interested in pre-columbian motiffs. Recommended for teachers, students and artists of all ages. Guaranteed to amaze all with the simplicity of the motiffs yet astound with the imaginative results. This is a worthwhile addition to ones personal libray to be filed under Art or Mexico. School librarians would be helping their students by adding this to their collection of books."},{"Title":"Designs from Pre-Columbian Mexico (Dover Pictorial Archive)","review":"I hate to confess this, but this is a book that I have used for a number of years but am too cheap to buy. Therefore, when I need it, I check it out from the local library. I do this often and the librarian has gotten to the point where she sort of raises her eyebrows at me each time I drag it up to the desk.As a winter, and sometimes summer, hobby I work with gourds. I carve, paint, burn, etch, draw on, and shape different hard shell gourds and have for years. I raise my own; several verities and sizes. The reason I use this particular book, along with quite a number of others, is for inspiration, and to be quite frank, to borrow the designs which I then transfer to my gourd art. My special interest is in designs of \\"lost civilizations\\" and cultures. When I am in need of a pre-columbian or a Mexican motif, I turn to this small volume. It is accurate and due to the computer enhancements, very easy to follow. With a bit of practice on paper, I am able to pretty well copy the pattern to any surface I happen to be working on. I do, on many of the designs, modify them to fit my particular need or mood.In addition, I also make custom canes for people, using hickory for the most part. The designs I find in this book are easily transferred and then carved into the piece I am working on. This spring I plan to start working on primitive clay tiles and plan to use some of the designs found in this volume. We shall see how that works out.All in all, this is an excellent book and I suppose I should eventually breakdown and buy it. If you are interested in such things, this is a work you cannot go wrong with.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Designs from Pre-Columbian Mexico (Dover Pictorial Archive)","review":"To be blunt- this book is way too basic. It is simply black and white images with no descriptive elements (besides the most obvious) or educational components. If a person is looking for designs and designs only--because there is nothing else--then it can work. However, if you are looking for history, color, change in designs, interpretations of the symbolism, or anything about the culture what so ever then you should select a different book."},{"Title":"The Mystic Rose (The Celtic Crusades #3) (Bk. 3)","review":"I feel like I am commiting a sacriligeous act by writing a bad review of a Stephen Lawhead novel.I loved the Pendragon Cycle. read the series twiceI wept in the Song of Albion read the series 4 timesI was enheartened by Byzantium. third time readingAnd I reminisced in Avalon. read twiceBut I was disappointed in the Celtic Crusades. Its not that they were bad. They weren't at all. But they weren't good either. They were just &quot;there&quot;. Kinda like your belly button. It doesn't look bad, it doesn't look good. It just &quot;exists&quot;.I was dissapointed in the character developement. I never cared much for any of the characters in this series, least of all Cait in the &quot;Mystic Rose&quot;. There is not much motivation to continue reading a series when all the characters bore you. I did like Rognivald (sp?).I never cared much about the plot either. Searching and recovering holy artifacts is just plain boring and not to mention its already been done. Stick with the stories about men and the love they have for their people and their country (Albion and Pendragon) and stick with stories of men on historic and spiritual journies (Byzantium).Did anyone else get the feeling that the rest of the series was written because he just &quot;had to finish the series&quot;?Very dissapointed but not so dissapointed that I am not eagerly awaiting his next novel or series."},{"Title":"The Mystic Rose (The Celtic Crusades #3) (Bk. 3)","review":"After a wonderful start in The Iron Lance, and a story that finally picked up and became interesting (more than halfway through) in The Black Rood, The Mystic Rose was a very disappointing read.I am a huge fan of Stephen Lawhead, who is without a doubt one of the most gifted writers still living in the world. If anyone else had written this book, I would have given it 3 stars, but I have come to expect much better than this from Mr. Lawhead.Cait is not a likeable nor a believable character, although she is slightly more interesting than Duncan. Not to say too much, the entire episode with the prince completely undermined her integrity and she lost all credibility as a character. I kept thinking (being a woman myself) that woman would NOT act that way. (By the way, Lawhead has written another novel largely from a woman's perspective - Taliesin, in which Charis is the main character, and in which Lawhead did a fine job characterizing her and making her real and believable.)The story was slow, but Lawhead frequently begins stories slow. Thus, throughout the book I expected it to pick up ... something interesting is bound to happen soon ... I confess I skimmed the last eighty pages or so just to say I'd finished it.Please don't get me wrong - Lawhead is a gifted writer, and at least the first volume of this series is very, very much worth the reading, but I'm afraid The Mystic Rose missed the mark."},{"Title":"The Mystic Rose (The Celtic Crusades #3) (Bk. 3)","review":"The Mystic Rose continues the downward trend in the quality of stories in &quot;The Celtic Crusades&quot; series. While I found The Iron Lance enjoyable, and Black Rood decent, I just could not find as many positive aspects in Mystic Rose.The main character, Cait, is not likeable, nor do you empathize with her in most situations. The reader isn't able to fully connect with her emotions and thoughts. I've never read a Lawhead book in which the main character was a female, but I'm wondering if he struggled with the process of trying to write a story from a woman's perspective. The first half of this story is, quite simply, boring. The remainder does have some redeeming qualities, including vivid battle scenes (a staple of Lawhead's), more interesting characters, and an overall higher level of action.Lawhead is capable of doing so much better than Mystic Rose, and I'm looking forward to a rebound in his next book."},{"Title":"The Mystic Rose (The Celtic Crusades #3) (Bk. 3)","review":"I found this book to be an incredible bore. After the first two books in the series, the first one quite entertaining and the second one less so, I was shocked at the incredible number of yawns I counted while reading this. The characters, especially Cait, were so thoroughly unlikeable and I could not relate to them hard as I tried. If it was any other author, I would give this a two, but as I generally like Lawhead books, I hope that this will encourage him to SPEED UP THE PLOT and BETTER CHARACTERIZE!"},{"Title":"The Mystic Rose (The Celtic Crusades #3) (Bk. 3)","review":"Lawhead is a master at building a landscape, as he so wonderfully illustrated in The Song of Albion series. With attention to detail (sometimes to the extreme), Lawhead makes us smell and taste and hear the tangibles of worlds far removed from us. And, usually, he makes us aware of the intangibles. Though his characters can seem stiff at times, they reflect eras gone by, and sometimes suprise us with their poignant insights and honor.I am a huge fan of &quot;The Iron Lance.&quot; In the first book of this series, Lawhead gave us a character in Murdo that we could relate to--he struggled with his faith, with his quest, and with his own weaknesses. In &quot;The Black Rood&quot; and &quot;The Mystic Rose,&quot; we find characters who never struggle in the way Murdo did. For this reason, they never drew me into the story the same way.Don't get me wrong, Cait's character in &quot;The Mystic Rose&quot; is worthy of her forbears. She is strong and ready for the task ahead. After witnessing her father's murder, she decides to seek revenge against the Templar commander responsible. Inadvertently, she ends up with a letter that is key to the location of the Holy Grail, the Mystic Rose. As she sets out to find this treasure, in hopes of luring her father's killer, we are exposed to places rich in color and scenery. Unfortunately, some of this seems staged. Lawhead leads us to believe that a certain Arab prince is up to no good, but later we find ourselves slightly deceived by this. We also see the Templar commander begin to track Cait, but this subplot tapers off until his sudden appearance at the end. We suspect that this will happen, so it's no big surprise; the only surprise is that we're given no explanation of how he found the Mystic Rose's location.One subplot that other reviewers have been quick to rail against, the early 1900's connection, I personally enjoyed throughout the series. It brought the historic existence of these holy relics into this century, whetting my appetite for the real treasure of the Swift Sure Hand that Lawhead writes of. In &quot;The Mystic Rose,&quot; more than the first two books of The Celtic Crusades, Lawhead points us in a spiritual direction full of hope and grace. In so doing, he adds value for those who believe--and possibly undermines the effort for those who do not.I believe. I enjoyed the series. After following three generations of Scottish folk through thousand year old adventures, I am thankful for the experience."},{"Title":"The Mystic Rose (The Celtic Crusades #3) (Bk. 3)","review":"I have to say that, after reading some other reviews on here, that I almost didn't buy this book. Thankfully, my desire to finish this trilogy overcame any trepidation caused by poor reviews, so I purchased the book and brought it to the beach.The book is not up to Lawhead's usual fare. The plot tends to drag in places, and some of the description becomes tediously overdone. I did enjoy the story, and found myself reading more than I had planned at each sitting(thank God for sunscreen, or I'd have been a lobster!). Cait's quest for the Grail, her desperate search for her sister -- these parts of the book drew me further. Her encounter with both the subjects of her search in the same place and her ... but I will say no more, so as to not give away precious plot points. Suffice to say that the book is well worth the time and effort in reading it. For those who have followed Murdo and Duncan, this book contributes to the BOTH stories that we have been following -- the story of the returning Crusader, and the story of the modern-day Cele De."},{"Title":"The Mystic Rose (The Celtic Crusades #3) (Bk. 3)","review":"Concluding the \\"Celtic Crusades\\" trilogy - this book kind of had to be a grail quest really! Better than the second book, Lawhead recovers his sense of storytelling, but still I think the first of the series was the best. Lawhead writes action sequences very well, but the journeying I found a little too long winded.In this story Cait, daughter of Duncan, son of Murdo Ranulfson, witnesses the murder of her father at the hands of a Knight Templer. She promises not to avenge him, but does not keep her vow - but before she can kill her father's murderer, she discovers an important document and steals it. This then sets in train a grail quest across medieval Europe."},{"Title":"The Mystic Rose (The Celtic Crusades #3) (Bk. 3)","review":"I liked this series so much, I have tried to get my hands on every book Stephen Lawhead has written."},{"Title":"The Mystic Rose (The Celtic Crusades #3) (Bk. 3)","review":"Usually when reading a trilogy, the first book is the best, and the series begins to lose steam as one goes on. Not in this case. This is by far the best book of this trilogy.Caitriona, daughter of Lord Duncan of Caithness, visits Byzantium with her father and sister, on her way to trace her father's footsteps during his sojourn (if you can call it that) in the Holy Land of many years ago. Here their trip goes awry, and chaos begins. Duncan is assassinated inside Agha Sophia, in the heart of Byzantium, by the evil Grand Master of the Knight Templars.What follows is a witty and entertaining tale of adventure in exotic places, lead by a woman both vulnerable and strong, whose destiny has been traced long before her journey has begun.I recommend this book to anyone who loves historical fiction. I fully enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Mystic Rose (The Celtic Crusades #3) (Bk. 3)","review":"Given the normal high quality of Lawhead's work, the final part of the Celtic Crusades trilogy has ended somewhat disappointingly. Lawhead's prose style, as evidenced in the Arthur sextet or the Song of Albion trilogy, is usually precise, sweeping in its sense of the epic, and a delight to read. The Mystic Rose proves extremely weak from an author who normally provides wonderful stories. Inevitably, you cannot help comparing it to the Sarentium Mosaic dulogy and the gulf between the two is vast.The Mystic Rose is the story of the vengeful Caitriona and her somewhat awkward half-sister Alethea who seek to avenge Duncan's murder at the hands of the Templar Commander de Bracineaux. After buying a Norse bodyguard from the Byzantine jails she steals a letter purporting to reveal the location of the Mystic Rose (unfortunately, guessable as to what it really is fairly quickly) and disappears off after seeing Brother Andrew (as did Murdo and Duncan before her) to steal it. Alethea's abduction leads ultimately to the prize and gives a conclusion to the \`modern-day' plot that runs alongside.Taking the trilogy as a whole, it is fairly simple to understand how the intended cryptic early nineteenth century side story is going to conclude so it becomes more a case of seeing how the story will unfold. Unfortunately, this is where The Mystic Rose falls down, unlike the Black Rood or the Iron Lance.Caitriona's voyage (after Duncan's somewhat hasty dispatch) comes across as a series of fundamentally unbelievable sketches. Peaking with Prince Hasan's fantastical palace in mid-Spain and barely saved with the eventual conclusion on a thinly-veiled Avalon-esque community, the novel provides minimal excitement. The problem is further enhanced by all of the major characters either being two-dimensional or subject to so many quick personality changes as to be implausible. Alethea's transformation from irritating sister to pious nun is untenable; Cait's constant stubbornness and Rognvald's stoical protector mentality together with the overly brutish de Bracineaux provide a bewildering mix of characters who do not respond from situation to situation with any kind of uniformity.Stephen Lawhead is one of the finest fantasy authors writing today and his name usually guarantees a purchase. As a result, expectations of his work are higher than normal. However, whilst the Iron Lance commenced the trilogy so well, the Mystic Rose has ended it disappointingly."},{"Title":"The Mystic Rose (The Celtic Crusades #3) (Bk. 3)","review":"When her father is murdered in the Basilica Santa Sophia, Caitriona vows revenge against the master of the Knights Templar who performed the cold-blooded assasination. When she sneaks into the Templar's castle, her first attempt at revenge is foiled partly by a white-robed monk (or the spirit of such a monk) who invites her to renew her family's longstanding bond with the Celtic Church. Cait, agrees, but vows to continue her search for revenge--a search that seems closer than ever to fruition when the monk points out a letter describing the location of the 'mystic rose,' or the Holy Grail.Cait sets off with her sister and a small group of knights to locate the Grail, now believed to be located in Spain. Behind her, the Templars follow, searching both for the Grail and for the woman who stole the letter. Conflict is inevitable--should Cait live long enough in the face of Moorish bandits, love-lorn Arab noblemen, and her ongoing conflict with her sister.THE MYSTIC ROSE is the third and final volume in author Stephen R. Lawhead's CELTIC CRUSADE series. The crusades represent a critical period in western history--a time when the leadership of Europe was wrested from the faltering hands of Byzantium by the combined attacks of the Turks on the east and the kingdoms of the west (France, Norman Sicily, the Italian states, especially Venice, and Germany). Religious artifacts of any kind were key elements of both commerce and power. The three artifacts that this series concerns itself with--the Lance that killed Christ, the Cross that bore him, and the Cup of the last supper) are perhaps the most holy in the Christian world (perhaps joined by the Ark of the Covenant).Unfortunately, Lawhead's characters are not up to the history that surrounds them, nor to the artifacts they search for. Cait is continually angry, ignoring her promise to her father to forswear revenge and the clear warnings given by holy visions as well as common sense. She treats her sister like the poor woman is beneath contempt. Worse, she behaves irrationally and impulsively. Although this provides the basis for character growth, by the time Cait is ready to grow, I wasn't much interested in seeing it."},{"Title":"The Mystic Rose (The Celtic Crusades #3) (Bk. 3)","review":"The Mystic Rose concludes Lawhead's Celtic Crusade trilogy. It's a fine ending to the great story. I was afraid the book would fare poorly after the exciting start in The Iron Lance, and a bit slower The Black Rood. But the Mystic Rose brought the dramatic continuation to the Celtic saga started by Murdo, his son Duncan, and finished by Duncan's loved daughter Caitriona. Caitriona witnesses the tragic death of his father during the trip to the fable Byzantium, and swears the vengeance. Her travels and adventures are worth the movie. The plot is quite interesting and it is taking us to the Moorish Spain on the track to find mystic chalice. Caitriona and her sister Alathea undergo spiritual and physical change, and end up at achieving what their father ever dreamed. Book is a great read."},{"Title":"The Mystic Rose (The Celtic Crusades #3) (Bk. 3)","review":"Hilarious! I think its hilarious! After reading my fellow reviewers, I find it amusing that they were all disappointed and that I LIKED it. Apparently, they were familiar with the authors writings and were disappointed compared to his other works----I say to that----I've got to read his others! If this was good, can you imagine how well the others are written?I enjoyed this adventure. I FELT that it was an awesome adventure, with lots of twists and turns. I mean, yeah, there were a lot of loose ends and/or what the heck? but on the most part---its good.Cait goes on a quest for vengeance and plans to use the Holy Cup for her purposes. Its a long road til the last showdown.I enjoyed the descriptions of the Holy Lands and the Crusaders in the dungeon. Stuff you don't think about and then appreciate what you hear.Hey, why'd that guy favor his side? We never found out. I thoroughly enjoyed the vision Cait had when encountering the Mystic Rose at last. Also, I missed something. Who the heck was the white priest or soldier or whatever who spoke to Cait? Its never said but it didn't make the book difficult or hard to get into. There were parts in the 20th century, but considering this was the last of a trilogy that I didn't read the first two of, I skipped that stuff. It has little relevance to ignoramuses.It seemed the story was a little sped up at the end. We don't seem to dwell on Caits stigmata much, before its battletime and off to Caithness. I would have preferred more interpretation as the Grail Protector, etc.But I liked it! So if you're looking for a good Grail Quest to read, like to read it from a refreshing womans perspective, want to throw in a couple Vikings or something, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"The Mystic Rose (The Celtic Crusades #3) (Bk. 3)","review":"Knights Templar Commander Renaud de Bracineaux kills his enemy without a second thought of remorse. The daughter of his latest victim, Caitriona is heartbroken that the merciless Renaud killed her father, a Celtic Crusader. Seeking vengeance for this unnecessary murder, Caitriona purloins a letter from Renaud that claims to name the location of THE MYSTIC ROSE, known in many circles as the Holy Grail.Caitriona decides to find THE MYSTIC ROSE in Spain, but Renaud gives chase. War between the Infidel Moors and the Pope's Army of God occurs on the Iberian Peninsular adding danger to Caitriona's quest. However, ultimately the real peril is when Renaud and the Templars catch up to battle with Caitriona and her Celtic soldiers even as she drinks from the Holy Grail.The deep descriptions of this novel are a two edged sword. They give readers a wonderful look at the past in fascinating yet extrinsic locales rarely used in literature, but also slows down the action. The story line is deep and for the most part moves forward rapidly though a modern day subplot seems bizarrely out of context. Still Caitriona is an intrepid soul whose actions make the plot succeed for those readers who relish a rich historical novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Pickle & Penguin","review":"'Pickle & Penguin' is a wonderful new children's picture book, written by Lawrence David and illustrated by Scott Nash. Its story is as old as literature itself-two lonely but kindred souls meet, bond, are separated by cruel fate, search high and low for one another, and ultimately reunite. That one of the souls is embodied here by an indigent penguin, and the other by a fabulously well-to-do, gap-toothed, late night talk show host dill pickle, does not detract from the timelessness of this spectacular tale.Pickle, host of The Pickle Show, sits alone, depressed, in his lavishly-appointed penthouse apartment. He may be the Toast of the Town, the town in question being New York City, but this toast is both stale and burnt out. He's going through a sour patch. Truth is, he's been hitting the pickle juice a trifle heavy of late. (I could say he has a Brine Jones, but I won't.) Not even global fame and the riches of Rupert Murdoch dissipate his funk.One day, Pickle zips up his furry-hood parka and takes his show to an ice floe on Antarctica for a remote. A mob of penguins surround him and his crew. Pickle spies a maverick on the fringes, keeping his own counsel. Mike in mitten, he homes in for an interview. Penguin, it transpires, has had a beakful of tundra and pines for a change. \\"Why not go somewhere else?\\" asks Pickle. \\"Somewhere else! I've never been somewhere else before!\\" cries Penguin. And before you can say \\"dirty weekend,\\" this odd couple is cruising up the coast of South America, USA bound.Back on home turf, Pickle takes his new pal on a whirlwind tour of Manhattan, but Penguin, dazzled by the \\"giant sparkly icicles rising out of the ground\\"-he's never before seen skyscrapers-waddles off. The two get separated in the crowd.The bulk of the book consists of the adventures P & P go through in their attempts to find each other. I don't want to spoil it for you, but I will reveal that the Statue of Liberty, a pickle dirigible, and a partially-consumed street-cart pretzel all play key roles in the ensuing action-packed, um, action.'Pickle & Penguin' is funny, unique, and touching. Mr. David's no-nonsense, effervescently-colorful illustrations could wipe the frown off the face of the grimmest tot. There are an abundance of hilarious details, too abundant to list here, except for Pickle's astonishing resemblance to a certain ex-Hoosier television personality. (Assuming David Letterman is unlikely to read his infant son to sleep with Jay Leno's children's book, 'Pickle & Penguin' would be a dandy substitute.)The book could have been a little longer. For better or worse, kids' picture books tend to hew to a standard length. The getting-to-know-you scenes are a wee bit telescoped. Consequently, Pickle and Penguin's dogged determination to return to the warm bosom of each other is perhaps not as solidly motivated as it might be. (A similar flaw bedeviled the film version of 'Cold Mountain.' Like you care.) But this is a minor, almost petty cavil. Forget I mentioned it.Will Pickle attain enduring happiness with Penguin? The reader can only speculate, but if there is any city in the world in which a flightless waterfowl can harmoniously cohabit with a myopic cucumber, New York is it. (Okay, okay, San Francisco, too.)'Pickle & Penguin' is a roll-out-the-barrel hoot."},{"Title":"Pickle & Penguin","review":"what a great book! my little pickle is 2 years old and absolutely adores this story. we've taken it out of the library at least three times & finally had to find our own copy so that other kids & parents also had the opportunity to take it home too. the characters are enchanting & the backdrop is at once magical & realistic. my daughter loves that pickle & penguin live in \\"new yowk citee\\" like her auntie & grandmother & i love that there is a book that i enjoy reading as much as she enjoys listening to every evening."},{"Title":"Pickle & Penguin","review":"I took this book out from the library, thinking (as many, I'm sure, do) that a book featuring a PENGUIN and a PICKLE as main characters just HAD to be good.Well... it seems a lot like it's surviving on charm rather than on merit.

Odd thing about this tale is that it is a dill pickle and an Antarctic penguin who forge the friendship. If this wasn't enough of a lesson in tolerating diversity, the Pickle is a wealthy talk-show host on TV and the Penguin is just some bored bird who wants a change from all his 'fish and ice'. Making more than a cameo appearance is the Statue of Liberty, who, Pickle says \\"shines her torch for those lost from all over the world.\\" Through the predictable plot (Penguin gets lost and ends up again at the Statue of Liberty where Pickle finds him, after broadcasting his Missing Penguin on the air) we see that friendship prevails. It's a sweet story with a happy and quirky ending that would be a great read-aloud to grades PK-1 or an engaging read-alone to emerging readers."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene Book One","review":"What is it with Kindle books?

It's quite good, with extensive marginal notes interspersed with the poem. One drawback is the small font size used--the notes and text of the poem are the same size. The text is actually a facsimile reproduction of the Smith 1909 Oxford edition, so it is not particularly sharp or clean. Some sections are a bit faint, and others are too dark. However, the only other affordable, paperback, and readily available edition of the complete Faerie Queene is the Penguin edition, which is a fine reading text."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene Book One","review":"While the publisher claims this is the first modernized text of Spenser's poem, Robert Kellogg and Oliver Steele's 1965 edition of Books I and II, along with the Mutabilitie Cantos, is in modern spelling; has a much longer and (for its time) well-balanced introduction; has explanatory notes (just the right amount for the beginner) at the foot of the page rather than the end of the book; and provides easier-to-use marginal explanations of difficult words. (For that matter, the entire poem was issued in modern, that is, Victorian, spelling over a century ago by the Chandos Classics; the difference between Victorian and present-day British spelling is close to insignificant.) Still, Brooks-Davies and Everyman did a great service for beginning students by putting this more varied and up-to-date selection into print, and hopefully a complete modern-spelling edition will eventually follow. The one real and curious defect of this volume is that, while the purpose of a modern-spelling text is to help the beginner, Brooks-Davies' marginal glosses actually present an impediment to the beginner by giving TOO MUCH information, slowing his or her understanding of the text rather than speeding it up.This the official title of the Chandos Classics edition: \\"The Faery Queen.

The poem was written as an allegory intended to teach Christian morality. On the surface, it can be difficult to read due to the large number of archaic words and spellings used, although there are helpful notes in the back of the book. But the poem does reward those who stick with it, in the way of many beautifully described scenes, fantastic landscapes and characters, and a sharp sense of purpose in its moral themes. Twelve books were planned for the poem, each focusing on a different virtue, but only six (and a fragment of a seventh) were written. I've only read a little more than three of them so far, but I look forward to reading the rest."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene Book One","review":"&quot;For the method of a poet historical is not such as of an historiographer; for an historiographer discourseth of affairs orderly as they were done, accounting as well the times as the actions; but a poet thrusteth into the midst even where it most concerneth him, and there recoursing to the things forepast, and divining of things to come, makes a pleasing analysis of it all&quot;Spenser wrote a letter to Walter Raleigh (above excerpted) to explain this strange cacophony of FQ, a mixture of ancient mythology, Renaissance Christian morality and enough obscure symbolism for an academic brigade; a tribute to country and queen. Knights from the court of the Faerie Queen conduct a search and destroy mission against evil in the form of a pack of minor villains pecking away at the heroes of the poem, but each one perpetually foiled. Such as Archimago, the witch Hectate, the philanderer Malbecco receive comeuppances in jousts, internecine squabbles or palace tours, with this type of constant action occupying canto after canto that at some point the content aspect becomes a bit wearisome. Amid this &quot;action&quot; are endless lists of virtues allegorized in each book, the reader being skewered to a Platonic ideal especially evident in females with such as the knight Britomart representing strenght and accomplishment in women, Una, the ultimate fantasy chick, and several others with such heights of description one does expect something mind blowing ahead, perhaps at last the perfect woman, to which in FQ Spenser comes close without cigar. The joust with the evil forces of nature seems unique to Spenser, who seizes the reader by the lapels with an in one's face style of optimism such that worst elements suffer defeat by contrast with more worthy opponents. There is little in FQ of the the weird, off the wall bastardizations of human nature being written almost at the same time by the playwright down the road. This world of Spenser's appears mostly black and white, and totally devoid of the perceptual uncertainty or moral relativity of a Lear or Hamlet, though one senses toward the end with introduction of &quot;mutability&quot; a weakening in the poet: &quot;Then since within this wide, great universe nothing does firm and permanent appear.&quot; It is faint criticism of genius to call FQ a shade below the top with its questionable, archaic content simply outweighed subsequently, but for the glaring and obvious truth that this is some of the greatest poetry that has been written by one of the best poets. FQ is saved by its lyrical verse, by the brilliance of its expression; by the talent of this tremendous intellect to place into rhyme over hundreds of pages such enormous complexity of expression. To call this accomplishment &quot;a pleasing analysis&quot; though as well said as the rest of this poem, is understatement. Shakespeare tends to stir with eerie omniscient intellect, and Spenser does the same, but in a tone and manner so sharply in contrast. FQ contains cleverness, insight, a piercing intelligence, but all rendered with such brushstrokes of eloquence as is simply unequaled. As happens too often, Spenser died before he finished, and one speculates had he lived what else might have been &quot;thrustest into the midst&quot;."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene Book One","review":"I will be the first to admit that this is not a book for those that give up easily. At over a thousand pages of Elizabethan poetry, it took me almost two years to get through, and I am not a particularly slow reader. However, I don't want to completely scare away potential readers because it has also been one of the most rewarding books I have ever read. The story is always interesting and imaginative (and in such a long work that's saying something), most of the heroes and heroines are very sympathetic, and the imagery of poetry itself is breathtakingly beautiful. Though it was definitely a commitment to read, I have no regrets in taking the time to do so, and only hope that others will give it a try. Bravo, Edmund Spenser!"},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene Book One","review":"The Faerie Queene, I suggest, is the pinnacle of literature in the English language before Shakespeare. Originally envisioned as a twelve book epic, written in language that was deliberately antiquated even for the period, I find it surprisingly modern in several ways. First, the characters are abstract exercises, deliberate embodiments of ideals and concepts. The term 'allegory' is now almost uniquely used to describe this Spenserian technique, and its adoption by later authors. Allegory is metaphor to the Nth degree. Spenser also invented his own, idiosyncratic stanza form and rhyme scheme, a nine line block which he uses throughout (and which is likewise known as the Spenserian stanza). Given these characteristics, The Faerie Queene may be most enjoyed by those who can appreciate its abstract craftsmanship. Nonetheless, there is something in it for every serious reader, as the subjects and plots are deeply archetypal--the saga of Book I's Redcrosse Knight is practically a case-study for one of the thousand faces of Joseph Campbell's hero. The language is rich, and its implications complex--for instance it is unclear what we are to conclude when Guyon, the supposed knight of temperance and moderation razes the Bowre of Blis after nearly succumbing to its charms. Above all, it can be deeply entertaining, moreso I feel than most of Shakespeare's histories, Falkner's Sound and the Fury, or just about anything written in the 18th century."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene Book One","review":"The Faerie Queene is a classic of the English language and amust read for anyone who has ever felt a touch of solitude.Lurking beneath a seemingly Manichean story of knights,maidens and monsters is a narrative of immense sensitivity.Spenser was a brooding, fragile poet full of pain and sorrowbefore it became a cliche. The Middle English verse is a kickto read."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene Book One","review":"The Faerie Queene of Spencer is perhaps the best known piece of English poetry before Shakespeare or Milton. Written in a language old even for its own time, Spencer had composed a national epic. The Faerie Queene was later eclipsed by 'Hamlet' and 'Paradise Lost' but is still an epic that has a lot to offer readers who are willing to come on its own terms.Spenser incorporated allegory into his poem, and understanding this is vital to reading the work. There are two kinds of allegory here: Political allegory, which I found easier to disregard; and Moral allegory, which appears to be the main focus of all the Faerie Queene. One of the nice things about allegory is that one can pierce various aspects of the narrartive for insight and illumination. Even the smallest detail can help the reader derive meaning. But there is a danger, of course, the reader can find a meaning where none was intended; or worse, interpret the passage exactly opposite of the writer's wishes. One should know the Christian and Puritan mindsets to understand this book, it will be very difficult to make heads or tales of Faerie Queene without it; Book III in particular.There also the story itself, which incorporates two classic English plot devices: the Arthurian tales, and the Fairy Land setting. Both mesh together extremely well, I think one could read this exclusivly to partake in the childhood dreams of dragon slaying and damzel rescuing.'The Faerie Queene' is the most difficult book I have ever read, due to the language. If one presses on with reading it, though, I think they will find that the Spencerian prose becomes almost like a second language to them; the Penguin edition includes a very helpful glossary in the back. I recomend this work to those who like medieval classics, though if you do you've probably already heard of it. If you haven't read anything from the period and would like to tackle this, I recomend reading 'The Canterbury Tales' first to familiarize yourself with the period and thought processes."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene Book One","review":"This poem, based on ideas from Vergil's Aeneid and Italian poetical romances, was intended to be England's national epic. It has since, in the estimation of some, probably mainly that of scholars or other enthusiasts of English, become the pan-national epic of the entire English speaking world. In actual fact however, we can probably say that it has not garnered enough support for this aim, but it is a noble attempt and a great work of literature nonetheless, I think among the very best in the world, and I have read more than a few books!A few notes now on what it is about to give you an idea of what is inside: It weaves together the medieval Germanic dragon and monster fighting motifs, which are really elaborations of the old Sigurd the dragon slayer from Anglo-Saxon and Norse lays, also seen in the Old English poem Beowulf (which the Faerie Queene resembles in many ways, but surpasses it in length,) with Graeco-Roman mythology, British legend, and Neoplatonic-Christian mysticism. The poem is shockingly similar to (although of course much more elaborate and huger than) Beowulf, which Spencer had no way of knowing even existed. It is as fitting an epic for English speaking civilization as one could perhaps be devised, if not as has ever yet been written, as it marries the old Germanic Anglo-Saxon values of loyalty, courage and fighting prowess, and the old Germanic and British settings of great halls, dragons, giants, kings and heroes, with the Continental civilizing influences of Classical culture and scholarship, and with Christian ideals, references and morality. I don't understand why so many people who like myself love the grand old Norse, Greek, Latin, British, Irish, and Old English lays, looking for an imaginative and rich old heroic past, but miss this poem, which is written in modern English and therefore directly accessible to the modern reader without having to work through the medium of an interpreter translator. I think The Faerie Queene's enchanted adventures quite fit into the heroical fantasy mould, but I think we have to admit that Spencer's work is far greater, more elaborate and artistic than almost anything else out there. He was really going the \\"full nine yards\\" with this thing. There are multitudes of Grendel-like ogres and she-monsters and dragons and other unbefore-imagined beasts that are defeated, magical spells and weapons, fantasy lands, gold, holy men and women of vast spiritual power, long treks and quests, even cannon fire(!), basically all the stuff you see in the wildly popular role playing game story lines and the sword and sorcery genre of modern pulp fiction. If you have any kind of medievalist side to you, this book is a must read. (The Society for Creative Anachronisms crowd should read it and reread it! I'm surprised they don't have a guild of bards who memorize and perform Spencer's work.) The same if you're interested in the English speaking world's traditional culture and mindset on the eve of its spreading around the world. The same if you are looking for something to model your character on, since this was what Spencer wanted us to read his poem for - to form our characters - the values he promotes are still valued today. Of course, this medieval-renaissance culture is a bit set back in time for us today, but the lessons and the values are just as relevant now as ever. Can we ever stop fighting evil? Can we ever forget about loyalty? In addition to forming character, the book teaches plenty of vocabulary, grammar, alludes to history and expounds on philosophy. The book can become a very meaningful personal \\"self-help\\" or \\"guide to success in life\\" book, in this eminently popular genre, if you want it to be, as all great literature can be if read with this goal in mind. Spencer intended it to be so read in one letter he wrote about it, while in another letter he felt the reader should read it for pure enjoyment. However, the didactic nature of the work is clear in its intention even if this epic's pleasures overshadow any didactic qualities it may have while you read it. One caution though is the antiquated spelling. If someone were to come along and modernize all the spelling, s/he could make a lot of money. The old spelling isn't a big problem, since you learn very quickly to make sense of it, but it wouldn't be a hard labour for someone to redact the thing. I think the old spelling has been left because it shows Spencer's poetic brilliance better, as you can see the relations between rhymes, alliterations and rhythms better. But, I think the poem would garner a whole other group of readers if the spelling were modernized for them.Regarding the poetry, I have a few points to make also. The poem is most definitely intended to be read aloud. This does not mean that you must do so, but it is intended to be read as such. When you read it out loud you come to enjoy quite quickly the powerful pulsation of the iambs, topped often with alliteration in the Olde English mode that add punch to their impact and power to their passage. I have the temptation to label this feature \\"Teutonic\\" as it sounds very aggressive and masculine. The last words in each line rhyme with other lines in the stanza in a set way you can read about in the introduction or figure out from your reading. The first eight lines are in iambic pentameter, which is what about 75 percent of English poetry is in. The last line is in iambic hexameter, called \\"Alexandrine\\" which means one more iamb added onto it, making it a very distinctive cadence for the entire nine line stanza. The stanzas are also arranged on the page in a way pleasing to the eye that you will appreciate. Rhythm and Rhyme make this work a poem, and its regular organization adds a magic to it that I don't think the trendy modern free or blank verse can ever match. I am not criticizing these other forms, as they are great in their own ways, but clearly such an elaborate yet regular form as the Spencerian stanza will intrigue you and captivate you at once. The music of the verse gives me at least a feeling of some kind of aggressive pride which pulls you musically into this enchanted land which becomes all-engrossing and quite vividly real when you visit it through your reading.Regarding his influences: I have not read much of the Italian epics Orlando Furiosos and Jerusalem Libertata that he was trying to rival. I have read some of them, and the effect on him is clear. However, being a big fan and avid re-reader of Vergil and Chaucer, I see the hands of these two guiding Spencer at every step, yet \\"standing on their heads he sees farther\\" and his poem is both longer and more artistic, I think, than any single work of either of his two great predecessors. Having read Spencer for the first time before reading Chaucer, and then having read him again after Chaucer, the experience (of reading Spencer) is quite different. The allusions to Chaucer, like to Vergil, are both conscious and subconscious in Spencer, and I was quite shocked at how huge his debt to Chaucer actually is. Chaucer never wrote a huge epic like Spencer did, and as such Spencer was intentionally ploughing new ground in English. No one has really done anything like he did again in the English language. The fact that he was being almost entirely creative in his plots sets him out from many other long poem writers in English. To each his own of course. I have to add too that Spencer's age was one of the last when the English speaking world was truly one unified entity, albeit still quite small of course, yet with the seeds of greatness already starting to grow. With the establishment of the Empire it started being harder to write something definitive for the entire Anglosphere. This likely is a main reason why Spencer, Shakespeare, Chapman, Chaucer, Beowulf and the rest have retained their popularity so strongly into modern times all around the world. They sing of our common heritage. You can meet their characters around you no matter where you live. Speaking as a North American, all us English speakers are tied together in the Spencerian age; after that our peoples evolved in their different directions. The dedication at the start of this poem to Queene Elizabeth, Queene of Virginia (among other places) points this out quite strongly. I think this poem makes you proud to be an English speaker, and proud to be part of this great world civilization; it makes me feel this way at least! Feel the pride, buy it, read it!"},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene Book One","review":"Spenser's the Faerie Queene is one of the first epics to be written in English, and probably the first to draw on such masters as Virgil and Homer. He purposely wrote in archaic English, so it is a bit difficult to understand (just imagine language that was old 400 years ago!), but taking the time to read it provides a very meaningful experience.The Faerie Queene was supposed to include 12 books, some of which were never completed. Each book was to star a Knight, who would embody some Christian virtue (for example, the Red-Crosse Knight is the hero of book 1--he represents holiness). Additionally, all the books were to feature King Arthur as a hero who was the epitome of a good Christian. The books are very allegorical, and most of the enemies and beasts the knights meet embody some vice or sin (such as the giant who represents Pride in book 1).The Faerie Queene is a classic medieval text, and is also a great epic poem. As many have commented, it does take a lot of work, but the reward is also very immense. For any fan of the epic format or student of classic English literature, the Faerie Queene is essential."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene Book One","review":"This is a review of the Kindle edition, viewed on a PC.I believe that for a less than $3 book, the other two reviews were being unfair.

There is not much by the editor to be read before we come face to face with Spenser himself, but the material that would normally go into an editorial introduction is there after all, only it's at the back instead. If we are daunted by the thought of an enormously long poem there is a temptation to procrastinate by plodding slowly through some scholarly introduction, only to find ourselves wearied by the introduction and hardly able to face the poem. Meaning no disrespect to the eminent writers of introductions, I have experienced nightmares at the thought of some Penguin/Oxford/Faber Book of Introductions, edited (with Introduction) by John Carey.We are not plunged totally unprepared into The Faerie Queene. There is a \`manifesto' by Spenser expounding his aims in writing the work (or what he claims those to be): there are various commendatory sonnets and other miscellaneous stanzas by various other parties; and there are a whole string of dedicatory sonnets addressed to an assortment of bigwigs by Spenser himself. It is easy to skip most of these, and then if we are lucky we may find ourselves engrossed in one of the most readable and entertaining poems in the English language. It is written in a slightly bogus antique idiom, a little like The Ancient Mariner two centuries later. The idea is to create an atmosphere, and the style is nowhere near as difficult to grasp as in Paradise Lost let alone genuine mediaeval English as in Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde. Indeed, try opening the book at random and you may find the kind of magic working on you that Tolkien can work, except that great verse casts a spell of its own that not even my favourite prose can hope to equal. It purports to be a moral allegory, but moral allegories are boring and this is enthralling. Spenser knows how to spin a fairytale thriller, and you can't tell me that that was not what he really enjoyed doing.The editor inserts for reference a table of dates and some suggestions for further reading before we have read anything, but I found the very brief \`Note on the Text' to be rather interesting. It seems that there are three early editions, from 1590, 1596 and 1609, and that this edition is based on the 1596 text, with additional material taken from the other two sources where it is absent from that text. I certainly support the decision to include all the material that belongs in a purportedly complete version of The Faerie Queene, and the editor's apology for his \`composite' text is courteous but quite unnecessary. However what I would have liked explained is why it has been decided to base our text here on the second of three early editions. Spenser died in 1599, so perhaps the 1596 text has been selected as incorporating his last thoughts and revisions. However this is no more than a guess on my own part.Spelling and orthography are not commonly considered exciting topics, but if you agree with me (and with the editor if I have understood him) that Spenser is concerned to create an atmosphere with his pseudo-antique diction, then the spelling is all part and parcel. The way it has been done seems to me just about right. Plain annoyances to a modern reader such as tildes representing the nasals m or n are banished, but u v and i are retained where modern standards require v u and j. I cannot possibly regret that s is printed in the modern manner and not as f, as the latter could lead to quaint orthography in such cases as \`Where the bee sucks there suck I'.At the end there is an appendix detailing textual corrections, and another providing a handy list of common olde wordes. There are also \`notes' on the verses explaining unfamiliar dictions and usages, but the most interesting items here are the longer \`notes', which in effect provide much of what one would normally find in an introduction. I said already that I was relieved not to find this kind of material at the beginning of the book, so let me add now that I am thoroughly pleased to find it located where I do find it. After all, we have bought this edition in part (I suppose) because the editor is the Professor of English at Princeton. Spenser has provided the enjoyment, now it's time for the lessons."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene Book One","review":"This version of The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser contains copious explanatory endnotes, which are very useful in making sense of this vast epic poem.

He needed such an English because he was creating a whole new dimension of enchantment, a magical world, a land of mystery and adventure teeming with ogres and giants and witches, hardy knights both brave and villainous, dwarfs, magicians, dragons, and maidens in distress, wicked enchanters, gods, demons, forests, caves, and castles, amorous encounters, fierce battles, etc., etc.To evoke an atmosphere appropriate to such a magical world, a world seemingly distant in both time and place from ours, Spenser created his own special brand of English. Basically his language is standard Sixteenth Century English, but with antique spellings and a few medievalisms thrown in, along with a number of new words that Spenser coined himself. The opening lines of the poem are typical :&quot;A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plain, / Y cladd in mightie armes and siluer shielde, / Wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remain, / The cruell markes of many a bloudy fielde....&quot; (page 41).If, instead of reading with the eye, we read with the ear or aloud, the strange spellings resolve themselves into perfectly familiar words such as clad (clothed), mighty, arms, silver, shield, deep, cruel, marks, bloody, field. And &quot;Y cladd&quot; is just one of those Spenserian medievalisms that simply means &quot;clad&quot; or clothed (i.e., wearing).The only two words in this passage that might cause problems for the beginner are &quot;pricking&quot; and &quot;dints,&quot; and it doesn't take much imagination to realize that these must refer, respectively, to 'riding' (i.e., his horse) and 'dents.' But if you can't guess them, an explanation is provided in the useful list of Common Words at the back of the book.Once you've used that 2-page list for a little while, progress through Spenser's text becomes a snap. And learning a few hundred words is a small price to pay for entrance into one of the most luxuriant works ever produced by the Western imagination, and one that once entered you will often want to return to.The Penguin edition, although it contains the complete text of 'The Faerie Queene,' is significantly without an Introduction, presumably because the editors felt that we don't really need one. The book does, however, contain stanza-by-stanza Notes. These have been placed at the end where they can be referred to at need, and where they don't interfere with the flow of the story as we experience it.There have been many editions of 'The Faerie Queene.' Students who are studying the poem formally will want to have the fully annotated edition by A. C. Hamilton, a bulky edition with extensive and detailed notes, but in which the actual text of the poem is not so easy to read, being a rather poor and considerably reduced copy of the 3-volume Clarendon Press edition.The Penguin has always seemed to me to be the best available edition for the general reader. As is usual with Penguins, it has a clear and well-printed text, and the Notes are just about right, being neither skimpy nor excessive. Though fat, it's not too big to carry around, and you may just find yourself taking it along with you on your next trip.Spenser is one of England's very greatest writers. And he was writing, not for critics, but for you and me. Admittedly his language can be a bit tricky at first, and he certainly isn't to be rushed through like a modern novel. His is rather the sort of book that we wish would never end.His pace is leisurely and relaxed, a gentle flowing rhythmic motion, and that's how he wants us to read him. To get the hang of things, try listening to one of the many available recordings. And if you hit a strange-looking word, don't fret or panic. Try to hear the word in your mind, and guess at its meaning. That will often help, but if it doesn't, Roche's list or his brief and excellent notes should.So take Spenser slowly, and give his words a chance to work their magic. Let him gently conduct you through his enthralling universe, one that you will find both wholly strange and perfectly familar, since human beings and their multifarious doings are Spenser's real subject, and somewhere in one of his enchanted forests you may one day find yourself."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene Book One","review":"This is a review of The Faerie Queene, Penguin Classics edition, edited by Thomas Roche (ISBN 0140422072).The Faerie Queene itself will not be to everyone's taste. It is probably easier than Milton, definitely harder than Malory, and parts of it are very accessible and parts of it are not very accessible at all. However, the language, which most will perceive as the primary barrier to Spenser's work, is not that difficult to get used to. Take Book I, Canto V, stanza 5, for example:At last forth comes that far renowmed Queene,With royall pomp and Princely maiestie;She is ybrought vnto a paled greene,And placed vnder stately canapee,The warlike feates of both those knights to see.On th'other side in all mens open vewDuessa placed is, and on a treeSans-foy his shield is hangd with bloudy hew:Both those the lawrell girlonds to the victor dew.In line one, \\"renowmed\\" just means \\"renowned,\\" and should be pronounced with three syllables: \\"re-nowm-ed,\\" not \\"renowm'd.\\" There is a difference.In line two, the knowledge that Spenser typically uses \\"i\\" for \\"j\\" and \\"u\\" for v\\" is all readers need to read \\"majesty\\" for \\"maiestie.\\" A passing acquaintance with Chaucer would help with line three, which features the Middle English prefix \\"y-\\" on \\"ybrought.\\"Line four: pronounce \\"placed\\" \\"plas-ed,\\" not \\"plazd\\"; and just remember \\"v\\" means \\"u\\" for \\"vnder.\\"Line five presents no problems.In line six, some readers might wonder why \\"the other\\" is contracted to \\"th'other.\\" Here, a basic knowledge of English prosody is necessary. If Spenser had said \\"On the other side in all men's open view,\\" he would have used eleven syllables, when his meter of choice, iambic pentameter, demands ten syllables. So he makes a contraction to stay within those ten syllables.In line eight, Spenser writes \\"hangd\\" for the same reason: to stay within the ten syllables of iambic pentameter. If he had said \\"hanged,\\" the sixteenth-century reader would have counted the syllables thus: \\"Sans-foy-his-shield-is-hang-ed-with-bloody-hue,\\" which is eleven. Bear in mind that words such as \\"shield\\" are one syllable (sheeld), words such as \\"beauteous\\" are two syllables (beautyus), and words such as \\"disobedience\\" are three syllables (dis-o-bed-yence) for the purposes of scanning verse.So much for Spenser's language. The content of the Faerie Queene might prove the greater barrier to the twenty-first century reader. If you don't like chivalry, knights, damsels in distress, hermits, and magicians, then you probably won't like the FQ. But if you are indeed blessed with a taste for \\"romance\\" in the old sense, then you should like Spenser. You might surprise yourself; a friend who doesn't read much old literature, and almost no poetry, read a few stanzas of the Faerie Queene and said she liked it. Granted, I don't know if she would have liked every bit of the entire thing. But in such a long poem, some parts will get boring. I loved Books I and II, didn't enjoy Book III as much, and then loved Books IV, V, and VI. Book V, with Artegall and his \\"Iron Man\\" who represents Justice, is quite good. And the Mutabilitie Cantos at the very end, as C.S. Lewis said, just might be \\"the finest thing in the whole work.\\" But beware: the storyline is very, very complex. I found myself scanning previous cantos to recapture the plot line, which I'd lost track of. Be prepared to lose track of what's going on, unless you have an excellent memory or are used to old literature and complex plots.Now for this particular edition. It's a very fat book (over 1,000 pages), and I wish it had been in two volumes (Penguin adopted that expedient in the Penguin Classics edition of Malory's Le Morte Darthur). Roche's text differs somewhat from A.C. Hamilton's standard edition of the Faerie Queene, but it's more than adequate for the non-scholarly reader. I found his notes extensive and very helpful. Spelling is barely modernized; Roche just changes the archaic long \\"s\\" to the modern one, leaving \\"v\\" for \\"u\\" (vnder) and \\"i\\" for \\"j\\" (maiestie) intact. Roche seems to be the best edition out there short of Hamilton, which costs about $55, and definitely the best for a first-timer. One recommendation: read Malory's Le Morte Darthur before the Faerie Queene. For one thing, if you don't like Malory, you probably won't like Spenser; and so reading Malory first could save you some time reading the FQ. If you do like Malory, then you probably will like Spenser; and reading Malory first accustoms you to knights and jousts and wizards and the typical machinery of Spenser. Also, knowing some Malory helps you catch some of Spenser's allusions to the Arthurian legend.I give five stars to the Faerie Queene itself because I happen to love it; not everyone will share my opinion. I give five stars to Roche's edition because it's the best out there short of Hamilton, which not everybody needs."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene Book One","review":"EDMUND SPENSER : THE FAERIE QUEENE. Edited by A. C. Hamilton. 753 pp. Longman Annotated English Poets. London and New York : Longman, 1977 and Reissued.The Longman Annotated English Poets edition of 'The Faerie Queene' has been designed primarily for students and academics, but will appeal to anyone who is looking for an extensively annotated Spenser which gives maximum help with the language, historical allusions, symbolism, allegory, and much else besides. In other words, this is not so much a reader's edition of 'The Faerie Queene' as one for those engaged in an intensive and in-depth study.The pages are quarto sized (10 by 7.5 inches) and printed in double columns, with Spenser's text being given mainly in the left column, and the accompanying explanatory glosses and extensive and detailed notes given to the right. Hamilton's notes are, in every way, superb, and considerably enrich one's understanding of Spenser's subtle and highly allusive poem. The notes, however, are so extensive, that they can tend to interfere with one's enjoyment of the poem, as there is the constant temptation to glance to the right to read Hamilton's invariably interesting remarks.Unfortunately, presumably to reduce costs, Spenser's text was not reset, and what we have been given is a much-reduced and rather poor copy of the Oxford University Press edition of 'The Faerie Queene.' The result is a poorly printed text of the poem in a font as miniscule as that used for the sidenotes, and hence one that can be tiring to read. The text of the poem is preceded by Hamilton's informative General Introduction, and the book is rounded out with an extensive Selected Bibliography.Although less than desirable in visual terms, Hamilton's edition is superb in every other way, and definitely belongs on the bookshelves of all advanced students and Spenser enthusiasts. The general reader, however, would probably be far better off, certainly if new to Spenser, to start with the excellent Penguin English Poets edition, or even with the Norton Critical Edition of selections, details of which follow:THE FAERIE QUEENE.

The Renaissance Version of the Faerie Queene is quite hard to read, and must be read over and over again before you can comprehend all the underlying themes and symbols. This edition, stated in modern English, makes the work so much more enjoyable and easy to understand. Not much is lost through this translation, and it has helped me greatly----especially for exams!"},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene Book One","review":"The Faerie Queene is one of the great classics of Renaissance literature, and for very good reasons. Although it is difficult reading (and NO, contrary to another review here, it is NOT in OLD English! Look at the original version of Beowulf and you will see the difference), many of the tensions of the Renaissance, spiritually and philosophically, are masterfully renedered in these brilliant tales. Because its allegory is so rich, this book becomes even more enjoyable to reread, as connections between historical figures and literary history appear repeatedly. (I find something &quot;new&quot; each time I read it, it seems!) It is also a book about the role of the poet in society, and the manner in which Spenser uses allegory illustrates the complex relationship between the poet and his patron. In sum, while, as readers, we are always limited by our modern perspectives, I do think that reading Spenser is perhaps the best way to experience what it must have been like to be a Renaissance reader. Perhaps this is due to the didactic nature of Spenser's epic. In any event, it has forced me to explore more thoroughly the books and concepts to which Spenser refers repeatedly in The Faerie Queene. Furthermore, it has made my study of Shakespeare, Ariosto, Sidney, and other prominent Renaissance writers much more fruitful.But don't buy the trade paperback edition if you are serious about reading Spenser--buy the edition of The Faerie Queene that is edited by A.C. Hamilton. While it is more expensive, it is by far the best text available of Spenser's epic, and contains useful notes and introductions that will guide all students of Spenser to a greater understanding of the greatest epic poem of the Elizabethan Age."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene Book One","review":"When the first line of Canto 1 reads \\"Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine\\", missing off the initial \\"A\\", I know something has gone wrong. So don't waste your money; the one good thing to say is that it's not the worst Faerie Queene out there."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene Book One","review":"For those who are looking for an older take on series fantasy, look no further. The Faerie Queene is often praised for its beautiful use of language and for the fact that it was the first great epic written in the English language, but don't let that high and lofty praise scare you away! Someone who goes into it looking to be entertained won't be dissapointed, provided they're willing to work for it a little bit.At first, the archaic language can be a little difficult to understand, but I found that I very quickly adapted to it so that I was reading it nearly as quickly as I'd read a novel, and I wasn't having to look in the margins for the definitions of strange words. And then the story started to come alive! The Faerie Queene has it all -- knights, maidens in distress, maidens who kick butt (one of the hero knights, Britomart, is a woman and also a very capable warrior) evil wizards, dark temptresses, and monsters galore. Many villains recurr throughout the books, tormenting one knight and then another, so that when Duessa shows up for the upteenth time, you already know enough about her to be emotionally invested in seeing her defeated ;)I was surprised by how much character development the various characters showed, from Redcrosse's slow journey into spirituality to Artegall's gradual temperance of cold justice with mercy. Britomart's unrequited love for Artegall was genuinely moving.But what Spenser does best is description. He very quickly establishes scenes that are so clear and vivid that you'll be able to smell the air and see even the quality of the sunlight.All in all, I highly recommend this book. I was pretty sad when I got to the end, because I'm going to miss my nightly forays into Spenser's arcadian world. This is an extremely good book."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene Book One","review":"I bought this book as a study guide to a course in Renaissance literature, and Spenser in particular. I have now found that it is incomplete! Canto II of Book II only has 11 verses out of 46! Moreover, Cantos 4, 5 and 6 of Book II are completely missing! It does say 'Selection' in the subtitle, I now realize, although it was not made clear in the original description. The volume is doing me little to no good for its intended purpose. I consider it a waste of time and a deception to leave out huge parts of a work you are purporting to present under its original title. I feel cheated. Why wasn't the title &quot;Bits and Pieces of The Faerie Queen&quot;??"},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene Book One","review":"If you ignore the symbolism and focus on the surface elements, \\"The Faerie Queene,\\" a bulky mythological epic rendered in ornate baroque verse, almost seems like a sixteenth-century prototype of the campy swords-and-sorcery pulp of the past century. Thumbing through the pages invokes that particular aura of an ancient struggle against evil in a world of horrible monsters, brave warriors, clashing swords and spraying gore, shape-shifting wizards, fair ladies, and towering castles overlooking dreary fantasy landscapes. However, there must be more to it than just eye candy for Edmund Spenser to have been worthy of burial in Westminster Abbey; \\"The Faerie Queene,\\" like Virgil's Aeneid before it or Wagner's Ring cycle after, is a nationalistic and moralistic doctrine layered with religious and historical allusions that transcend its veneer of fabulous imagery.As explained in a letter to his peer Sir Walter Raleigh, Spenser's plan was to write twelve \\"books,\\" each containing twelve cantos and portraying a virtue from Aristotle's Ethics in the guise of a knight on a quest, the totality intended as a tribute to Queen Elizabeth, who in the epic is implied to be the Faerie Queene. Only six of the twelve books were completed: holiness, temperance, chastity, friendship, justice, and courtesy. The actions of the knights in their respective books are supposed to exemplify the specified virtues as proper behavior in the service of the Queene; conversely, vices such as envy, lust, and furor are represented as obstructors or monsters to be defeated by the knights. Stripped of its considerably gaudy window dressing, \\"The Faerie Queene\\" is a simple series of object lessons.The content is a strange, but not totally incongruous, amalgamation of legends from Greek and Egyptian mythology, the Crusades, Arthurian lore, Italian Renaissance poetry, and Spenser's own invention. As though they had emerged from a set of medieval \\"narrative\\" tapestries, the stories are dazzlingly intricate in plot and detail: The hero of the first book, the \\"Redcrosse Knight,\\" must rescue the parents of the princess Una (the Protestant Church) from a dragon (the Roman Catholic Church), aided by Arthur, here but a prince. The third book begins the story of Britomart, a lady who disguises herself as a knight in order to find Artegall, the knight of Justice in the fifth book, with whom she is enamored when she sees his image in a magic mirror. There are some interesting cross-references, such as the tale of King Lear and his three daughters mentioned in a history of England in the second book.Although English spelling was not conventionalized until dictionaries began to be compiled two centuries later, the poem's peculiar appearance is not representative of the typical writing of the late sixteenth century. The language, archaic even for Spenser's time, is designed to emulate Chaucer, then the standard English poet, in an attempt to conjure a medieval mood, a romanticized past. The misspellings are even intentionally inconsistent; for instance, \\"giant\\" is variably spelled Gyant or Geant or Gyaunt but never Giant. The idea, I think, is to signal to the reader that the poem should evoke the days when poems were more often spoken aloud than read, so what the words sound like is more important than what they look like; another clue to this is that Spenser is actually quite meticulous about the words he chooses to misspell.Glorification of a national heritage is a tall order, so who can blame the poet for his excesses? \\"The Faerie Queene,\\" a project distinguished by its sheer ambitiousness, is an intense reading experience that overwhelms its own flaws and difficulties."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene Book One","review":"This three CD set (ISBN: 962634377X, Naxos 2006) is not unabridged.

All 'modernized spelling' versions available are essentially prose retellings, abridgements or summaries, and not worth the paper they are printed on.Moffat's reading is excellent.

In the Romantic age, Spenser was placed besides these two other authors by the foremost English poets. But, authoritative critics like Mario Praz have had a rather dismissive attitude towards it, and you can feel that someone like Frank Kermode speaks of Spenser's greatness as if having to prove something.Now, I believe this book fails insomuch as it tries to be a great modern chivalresque epic like Tasso's or Ariosto's (from whose works a lot of the characters' names come). Probably, he didn't even understand the full magnitude of those works. In this, he is hampered by his medieval mind. Action, intended as a way of developing character and portraying embattled and sovereign human individualities who continuously create a world of their own making, is shallow.Success is in the static aspect, in the way Spenser manages to imbue &quot;tableaux&quot; referring to some eternal configuration of the existing with a strong power over the unconscious. It is a work which shines either by particular descriptions (their technique influenced Milton), or by the overall pattern that the adventures of the characters create. This pattern can be viewed as a gigantic description of a gigantic thing, as the descriptions in the more proper sense which are contained in it are of smaller things."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene Book One","review":"I'm of two minds here: on the one hand, you've got to admire Spenser's skillz--after all, we're talkin' thousands of nine-line cantos, eight lines in iambic pentameter and one in iambic hexameter, with a strict AC BD rhyme scheme. That must've taken some doing.On the other hand...I can't say I've really enjoyed reading it particularly. Spenser himself admits that the only reason he even wrote the thing in story form was to appeal to a wider audience; I think he might've done better to stick to straight moral philosophy. The allegory really gets in the way of telling a good story, in my opinion. Plus, and I know I sound like a complete cultural philistine when I say this, the archaic language just annoys the hell out of me.Some people love this poem to death, I know.

The story was delightful and encouraged the imagination with just enough description to outline the picture, while leaving plenty of room for the audience to fill in the colors. Look for the vast amounts of symbolism throughout the poem. My favorite character of the play was Una. The princess who travels with the destined Saint George and remains faithful to both God and her love despite what harsh elements might come in her way. She was human in the sense that she was frightened, she cried, and she got herself in trouble, but she was an admirable character in her strengths, endurance and patience. Within her character, she encouraged a strong female role in a time when the potential of women had yet to be recognized. With Elizabeth as queen, the patriarchal dominance that was known through most of the world was startled. Edmund Spenser, however, knew the strength in his queen and admired it. Perhaps it his respect for Elizabeth that is carried through in his development of Una. As a whole, the &quot;Faerie Queen&quot; was simple enough for those who are not absorbed in classical literature. It had gory battles, risky sexual encounters, and a tender message of love and forgiveness. Most of all, it emphasized the mercy and grace that is found through the love of our God and the sacrafice of his son Jesus Christ. Another strong message that was conveyed through &quot;Faerie Queene&quot; was that of personal growth and taking the chance to discover what you have inside, not what you have always been. Red Cross has a destiny to fullfill before becoming Saint George, but until he realized that he could overcome temptations and evil and seize the elements of truth than his destiny would be kept further and further away from him. How many times in our own lives have we decided not to try for something that we know we wanted only because we were afraid to the take the chance? How many times have we kept ourselves further away from our own futures?

For all non-philologists, it is written is Shakesperean English, and is indeed old. It has funny spellings, and even uses letters different than we do. However, Old English, has a specific linguistic meaning, and was the language that King Alfred the Great in the 900's AD spoke.

In 1946 and 1947, Harden hosted a radio show called Tales of Tarheelia, in which he recounted many of the state's legendary stories and mysteries. Interest in that radio series and Harden's commitment to preserving these stories that could be lost forever if not put down in writing led to the publication of this book, The Devil's Tramping Ground and Other North Carolina Mystery Stories, in 1949. One should note the fact that the stories collected here are indeed mysteries as opposed to, say, ghost stories (of which North Carolina can boast of her fair share); these stories won't give you the creeps, but they will fascinate you and sharpen whatever interest you have in the history of the state of North Carolina.When you talk about North Carolina mysteries, you must of course start at the very beginning - the Lost Colony. The first English settlement in the New World was made in the late 16th century at Roanoke, and it was here that the first non-native American child was born (Virginia Dare); when the long-delayed supply ship returned to these shores, the entire colony had disappeared completely, leaving behind a single clue as to the colonists' fate: the carving of the word Croatoan on a tree. This, North America's first mystery, remains as compelling and unsolved today as it was over four hundred years ago. The famous Brown Mountain Lights of western North Carolina, of which many may have heard, necessarily earn a chapter. The Devil's Tramping Ground to which the title refers is a circular spot of land in Chatham County in which the devil is said to pace each night as he thinks up his evil plans. The circle has a diameter of forty feet, and nothing will grow inside it; also, any material placed inside the circle will disappear overnight. A similar story involves the Magic Horse Tracks in the town of Bath; this series of holes remain fresh and unobscured after some two hundred years, and legend says they were made by the hoof prints of a horse whose owner asked him to either win the horse race he was engaging in (on the Sabbath, no less) or take him straight to hell - the horse obviously chose the latter by immediately barreling into a tree, killing his sacrilegious rider. You will read of deserted ships that mysteriously came to shore through the treacherous waters of the North Carolina Outer Banks, strange and unexplained disappearances of several individuals, the legend I must assume all new students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill continue to be told about (I was, but that was back in 1988) related to the present site of Gimghoul Castle, a couple of botanical mysteries, several stories related to animals, and a number of others miscellaneous tales.I must admit that I was unfamiliar with several of these stories, although many were well known to me. One of the most interesting tales involves the identity of a schoolmaster of Rowan County; there is plenty of evidence that this man, Peter Stuart Ney, was in fact Marshal Ney of France, one of Napoleon's most trusted military strategists. Marshal Ney was, history tells us, executed by a firing squad after Napoleon's downfall, but rumors abound that his execution was in fact a hoax.While the caliber of the twenty mysteries chronicled here varies somewhat, only a couple of them failed to fascinate me. Naturally, those with no association with North Carolina won't feel the connection I feel to the material, but anyone interested in the legends and mysteries of former times should find much to interest them in this engaging collection of Tarheel mysteries."},{"Title":"The Devil's tramping ground, and other North Carolina mystery stories","review":"I recently just finished reading this collection of stories about North Carolina. This book is filled with intriguing mysteries and legends about the Tar Heel state. The more famous story of Roanoke Island is covered here, as well as many others most from outside the region have probably never heard about.

I found particularly interesting the story entitled 'The Devil's Tramping Ground' itself, as well as 'The Strange Hoof-Marks at Bath' and the mystery of 'The Brown Mountain Lights'. These alone will capture anyone's imagination and spark a desire to explore the hills of North Carolina. All in all a very enjoyable book, and if you like a good collection of short stories this is a good one for you. The fact that they all come from a particular region and are researched North Carolina mystery stories makes it even more facinating and entertaining."},{"Title":"Strategic Sport Marketing","review":"Designed to be a textbook, in general, this book gives a comprehensive overview of the problems associated with sports marketing, with particular focus on the Australian market.It discusses the natural life cycle of sports and how it is not realistic for administrators to expect continuing expansion all the time."},{"Title":"Strategic Sport Marketing","review":"IT DISCUSSES THE STRATEGIC SPORT MARKETING IN A VERY GOOD WAY"},{"Title":"Collision Course: America and East Asia in the Past and the Future","review":"'Collision Course' is a mix of reportage, history, and economic and political speculation. One of Bryce Harland's themes is the feeling of common cause by East Asian countries as they face a United States fresh from winning the Cold War and imbued with a renewed sense of manifest destiny. Yet, the book makes clear that common cause is increasingly unable to keep the region from fractionating as their parallel economies struggle for prominence in Western markets, and as America, with the backdrop of a declining Japan, continues to leverage her political and economic dominance to assert her social and political agendas. Harland's central thesis is simple, and to my mind, convincing. The domestic politics of the U.S. are as much a factor as the regional diaspora of the South Chinese in guiding the evolution of East Asian economic and political development. It has historically been the domestic attitudes of the Americans towards the migrant Chinese and Japanese in the U.S. that account for the alternating cycles of discriminatory and liberal trade policies on the region. He cites the yearly torment over Most Favored Nation (MFN) status renewal for China as an example of the schizophrenia that grips the American polity struggling with liberal attitudes towards human rights and conservative views on trade; laced with pressures to scapegoat during times of economic want.'Collision Course' is an attempt to explicate the oft confusing and tumultuous relationship between the U.S. and East Asia through a historical lens, and to explore the future of that relationship as the forces of history subside with the end of the Communism. As with most world history, the region and its relationship with America has been shaped by two world wars, a number of regional conflicts, internal revolutions, and healthy dose of xenophobic nationalism. Indeed, the involvement of America in East Asia can be traced back to four significant events -- the gunboat diplomacy of Commodore Perry, the American occupation of Japan, the Korean Conflict, and the Vietnam War. In all these cases, American materiel and capital have been instrumental in propelling the economies of the region toward modernization and urbanization. In the end, my sense is that the next collision contemplated by the author will be less of a clash between East and West as it will be between the nations of the region as they jostle for the political and economic access to the U.S.The author goes to great lengths to show that East Asia is not a homogenous hegemony, but a collection of conflicting interests, cultures, rivalries and nationalistic tendencies that are historically at the razor's edge away from disintegrating into fractional fighting. This complex web of conflicts is largely bilateral, between Japan and China, China and the Europeans, Japan and the U.S., Japan and Southeast Asia, and America and China. Only recently, with the advent of Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) has East-West interactions been multilateral. Harland also makes the point that until the 1980s, the region has been held together by a shared sense of historical colonial victimization. However, as these countries matured, this is being overshadowed by more recent memories of Japan's expansion into Asia, and China's moves into Tibet, Mongolia, Burma, and Vietnam. To a lesser extent, recent memories of the Vietnam war, and role that the U.S. played to stop the spread of Communism in the region seems to carry more saliency with the current generation than the legacy of colonial expansionism a century ago. Today, even as the threat of Communism has diminished, an increase in intra-regional tensions has resulted. Keeping these tensions in check has been a period of double-digit economic growth, fuelled by American money to prop up local governments against the tied of Communism in the 1960s.Mr. Harland manages to keep his promise to remain detached in his analysis, using a reporting style that is at the same time engaging and neutral in tone. The book does not pretend to explain the psychology behind the 'Collision', although it takes time to explore its socio-economic causes. For students of regional politics in East Asia and the U.S. there is nothing surprising in the book. Yet, it is the author's systematic treatment of the region's history, and his focus on economic and trade-related issues, that brings into relief the underlying reasons for today's headlines; usually obscured by 30-second sound bites on broadcast television.'Collision Course' provides a clear road map for anyone to see why the Asian Currency Crisis of July 1997 was inevitable. Tight, opaque industrial networks, nationalistic mercantilism, and a suspicion of outsiders fuelled the lack of accountability and made possible the advent of money politics. The book hints of a warning for the future because unless East Asia breaks loose from its obsession with ridding itself of its colonial past, it cannot freely engage the U.S. without the latter resorting to the kind of forced diplomacy that characterized her first contact with the region...."},{"Title":"Postgraduate Surgery, 2Ed: The Candidate's Guide","review":"Postgraduate Surgery: The Candidate's Guide serves as a companion for those preparing for the Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons Examinations (FRCS) in the United Kingdom. The goal of this book is to prepare candidates for the theoretical, clinical, pathological, principles, and operative aspects of surgery required to pass the FRCS.The first edition was well received in Europe and underwent six printings. The second edition has been revised to reflect changes in the conduct and regulations of the postgraduate examinations in surgery. It contains new information about minimal access surgical techniques and updated United Kingdom requirements.Part I describes the surgical training program requirements. A syllabus and curriculum of the training is provided. Part II contains an introduction to the written examinations.

This book tells the story of his legendary life. His life is colorful, so many countries traveld and so much paper that he did. He put all his attention on math, and gave up all his things but math. Erdos was talent in studying math, but the genius is not innate. He used to study math 19 hours a day. This is why he got success. This book is also funny, there are a lots of interesting stories happened on Erdos, like he does not like woman because he does not want woman to bother his math project.

It is a crowded field. I'm not complaining, because they are all good in different ways, but this is my current favorite. I have been listening to these two short CDs for weeks at 5-10 minute intervals driving my car. The 700 phrases are spoken in English and then repeated in French. The voices (male and female) that repeat the English phrases in French are very clear. The simplicity of the presentation will likely catch you off guard if you are used to listening to cutesy music or sound effect gimmicks in other language packages. This straightforward presentation is precisely why the material is easy to listen to again and again. It is what it is: Useful English phrases and their French equivalency. There is the obligatory booklet, but it repeats all the words and phrases exactly as they are heard on the two discs. So it is very easy to check what you have heard later on (as I need to). The packaging is slim and easy to slip into my jacket side pocket. When I have mastered these phrases I won't be reading Camus or Proust, but I will be appreciative. Maybe the producers should consider a sequel."},{"Title":"Listen & Learn French (Dover's Listen and Learn Series)","review":"This tape of &quot;Listen and Learn French&quot; was the ideal way to learn French while driving to and from work each day.

I rate all these tapes a 5 Star A++++."},{"Title":"Listen & Learn French (Dover's Listen and Learn Series)","review":"Was just what we needed for a fast lesson of the things you would commonly use on a trip.Thanks,"},{"Title":"Listen & Learn French (Dover's Listen and Learn Series)","review":"I used this in conjunction with the Berlitz Essential French book to learn pronunciation/phrases and written French, respectively, in preparation for a 3-month organic-farm work-abroad stay in France. This combination turned out to be perfect. I had no background and couldn't conjugate or put sentences together, but Listen & Learn's rote memorization of standard phrases got me pronouncing and small-talking quickly. After 3 months in France, I could shoot the breeze with the barber.PROs: Once you know that this is just a list of phrases, spoken once in English and once in (rather dramatic) French, you will probably agree that within this simple category it is mega hella awesome, and hella cheap. The overdramatic Francophone is difficult to imitate at first, but once you can mock him well, you'll be able to convey _real_feeling_ when you speak, bashful though you may be. It's rare to see personality and humor like this in the rush-hour-2-minute-learn-now-textbook-cramathon culture of other audio programs.CONs: The French is native-speed and only uttered once (with space afterwards for your attempt). Two repetitions would have drilled it better and made this a five-star product. Also, upon closer examination, you will notice that 1. the booklet looks suspiciously like a xerox, and 2. the recordings come from analog tape (audiophiles will note the giveaway hiss and print-thru echo), dating it back to the 70s/80s. Actually, the inner cover reveals the source phrases to be from 1956. This just means that the phrases are a bit campy (\\"How should you like to dine?\\") and you will learn NO PHRASES related to the information age, i.e. internet, cell phones, etc. This is just a minor downside, but a major DISHONESTY on the part of Listen & Learn, who go to great lengths to modernize the packaging (outside of the box has a 2004 copyright) without modernizing the content.HIGHLIGHTS: The Anglophone is a riot in general, but for maximum entertainment, listen to the first 2 seconds of \\"Numbers\\" (as many times as you can stand). Also, in the final \\"Restaurant\\" chapter, all of the phrases are lambasting the waiter for the mediocre soup, overcharging the bill, and ruining everything; the last phrase, however, is this: \\"La cuisine et le service &eacute;taient excellents!\\""},{"Title":"Listen & Learn French (Dover's Listen and Learn Series)","review":"It was fine for wanting to learn some basic French. The only thing I wish was that they would say the Frech phrase 2 times after the English instead of only once."},{"Title":"Listen & Learn French (Dover's Listen and Learn Series)","review":"I needed some brush-up on French. Actually, my French never really progressed to the stage where it would ever need a brush-up - more like a jump start. Anyway, I needed French lesson CDs. These were inexpensive and I've learned there isn't a lot of point in spending big bucks on language CDs.After numerous trips to Europe, I know this much: CDs will not make you a brilliant conversationalist in French or any other language. They can help you get around, check into a hotel, read street signs, order dinner, and so on, and that is actually all I need. I know now that I will never be required to say, \\"What a charming child!\\" to anyone, or ask where the discotheque is, or demand that the valet come to my room.These CDs give you the English phrase, followed by the French phrase, then a space where you can repeat it. The English phrase is spoken with more feeling than you might expect, from a man I imagine to be an out-of-work actor who specializes in distinguished sorts of roles. He puts a lot of feeling into \\"I have lost my friends\\" and \\"I am seasick.\\" Then there are two French speakers. One is an older man who probably wears a beret and smokes cigarettes and is lasciviously inclined toward young girls. He is agreeable and never self-conscious, delivering lines like \\"How do you say 'pencil' in French?\\" without a trace of embarrassment. The other speaker is a woman. She is severe and has no patience. I picture her in a black dress and sensible shoes. \\"Here is my baggage - five pieces,\\" she tells the customs agent, \\"Must I open all of them?\\"While these are all conversations I am extremely unlikely to have, the CDs do help familiarize you with vocabulary and how to ask for things. They're not going to make me into a wit who is in demand at French cocktail parties, unless they need someone to ask how to say pencil in French."},{"Title":"Listen & Learn French (Dover's Listen and Learn Series)","review":"I found this French learning audio CD to be on the pathetic side mainly because the French speaker repeats the French very slowly, which is not going to help you understand a native speaker who is speaking at a normal pace.

It sounds like he is trying to make sure you understand what he is saying but he is so dramatic it's annoying! He does not make himself clear, I could not understand what he was saying. I couldn't stand listening to him for more than 5 min. They don't explain why they are translating certain things the way they do, simply teach you to memorize. This technique isn't very helpful because when you try to speak the French language with your own ideas and thoughts they don't transfer the same way. They only say each word in French once, this does not give you enough experience with the words. This CD may be helpful for someone who is just wanting to learn a few French expressions for travel or a quick visit to France. It would have been more helpful to me to have an explaination of the language in between lessons. For example, when they say \\"I have a brown dog\\" literally translates to say \\"I have dog brown\\". Or why you put the numbers after the street.

The order of phrases and topics are not organized well, it is outdated (speaks of \\"where to develop a 35 mm film\\", etc. - sounds like it was done in 90s), it doesn't repeat phrases twice like other language CDs do. And since some of the phrases are longer in French, you don't necessarily have enough time to repeat and memorize the whole phrase. Plus, since it has 2 CDs, some of the topics that logically should follow each other, are in different CDs.

For the past 50 years, only students and professionals in the child protection field have learned the profound significance of Mary Ellen's story. This, the first book entirely devoted to this landmark case, brings Mary Ellen to life along with all those who helped her survive.The story opens in May 1864 on a battlefield in Cold Harbor, Virginia, as Thomas Wilson receives word of the birth of his little girl in New York City and dreams of returning soon to his wife, Fanny, and their child. Shortly afterward, however, he dies in battle.Amid the hustle and bustle of New York City life, Mary Ellen's mother attempts to care for her little girl, but poverty soon forces her to abandon the child. We learn of Mary Ellen's stay in an almshouse for a time before being taken into a foster home where she is beaten, locked in a closet, burned, and permitted no contact with the outside world. She remains in this home for 6 long years.Shelman and Lavoritz accurately and poignantly describe the New York City of the 1860s and 1870s, allowing the reader to experience the overcrowding and the sounds and smells of the infamous Hell's Kitchen area of NYC where Mary Ellen is finally found and rescued.The story follows two threads, first told separately, and then woven skillfully together. We learn of Mary Ellen's plight, while at the same time in NYC, Henry Bergh is working to found the American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA). We are with Bergh as he enforces the new animal protection laws in NYC. He fights to protect them all --from turtles to horses. He is often ridiculed as he charges, &quot;Turtle abuse!&quot; But he persists. Amazingly, in 1874 there was no agency to aid mistreated children. When Etta Wheeler, a dedicated social worker, appeals to Bergh and his animal rights society to take the lead in the child's rescue, he and the ASPCA's talented attorney, Elbridge Gerry, conduct the then famous trial that ultimately brings Mary Ellen freedom and a new home and results in the founding of the New York City Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, still in existence today.The story culminates in the standing-room-only trial where Mary Ellen's foster mother is charged on several felony counts. The authors effectively recreate the circuslike atmosphere that prevails throughout the trial at which witnesses from all walks of life testify about what they have seen and heard. The transcripts of the trial are complete and authentic.While most will read this book as a novel, a complete index at the back provides access to the wealth of factual material carefully researched by the authors. An epilogue tells what finally happened to Mary Ellen as an adult. Adding to the authenticity are a number of previously unprinted photographs provided to the authors by relatives of the principals.An invaluable reference for those interested in the history surrounding child and animal protection, &quot;Out of the Darkness: The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson is also just &quot;a good read.&quot;"},{"Title":"Out Of The Darkness: The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson","review":"Out of the Darkness - The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson by Eric A. Shelman and Stephen Lazoritz, M.D. Dolphin Moon Publishing, CA. 1999. 342 pp. notes; index.Out of the Darkness is not only the story of the abused child Mary Ellen Wilson of the latter 1800s, but also the story of Fanny Connor, her mother who abandoned her after the death of her husband in the Civil War; Mary Connolly, the stepmother who cruelly abused the girl; Henry Bergh, founder of the ASPCA, who anguished by Mary Ellen's case, founded the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children; the judge who presided over the court case of Mary Ellen, the journalist who covered it for the NY Tribune, and other individuals who were involved in the matter in various ways. The authors describe their book as dramatized history; it's based on extensive research, while employing the techniques of creative nonfiction, including scenes and dialogue, to bring Mary Ellen's story alive. Shelman's experience as a screenwriter is evident in the informative, revealing, and dramatic dialogue, pithy descriptive passages, and brisk narrative. Lazoritz is a pediatrician specializing in the care of abused and neglected children. He is also the director of the Child Protection Center at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. The collaboration began with an acquaintance over the Internet. Out of the Darkness fills in considerable historical background on the timely subject of child abuse in American society. Mary Ellen eventually went on to lead a normal life, having two daughters who became school teachers.Henry Berry, Book ReviewerEditor/Publisher, The Small Press Book Review"},{"Title":"Out Of The Darkness: The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson","review":"This is a stirring book which holds a reader's attention from the first page until the last. As the true drama unravels, readers learn of the atrocities which were inflicted on an innocent little girl. Readers also learn of the birth of child protection in America as it unfolds through the efforts of a few determined and dedicated individuals. This is a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone with a heart for children and compassion for victims of abuse. Until now, this story was a missing piece of our history, yet it is now available for us to read about and learn from.

My thoughts on animals, children and human rights were challenged. Thank you to the authors."},{"Title":"Out Of The Darkness: The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson","review":"This story, is amazing. It is so well written that I couldn't put it down. I read the entire book the day I got it. The horror that this poor child went through is unbelievable, and the lack of help available to her at that time is shameful. Thank God for the ASPCA for helping this child when no one else could or would."},{"Title":"Out Of The Darkness: The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson","review":"Shelman's portrayal of the young life of Mary Ellen Wilson is astounding. The author takes a very difficult subject, child abuse, and integrates it with the history of animal rights laws, leaving the reader totally engrossed in the story! Definitely a &quot;must-read&quot; book for all appetites!"},{"Title":"Out Of The Darkness: The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson","review":"Review of Out of the Darkness: The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson by Eric A. Shelman and Stephen Lazoritz, M.D. Dolphin Moon Publishing, 2003I chose to review this book because it explains the job of a social worker in the early days of the profession. The book appealed to me as an author and advocate. Set in New York City immediately after the Civil War, this book offers a powerful story in a historical context. Using an original style that combines journalism with fiction, the writers completed a work of art that is based on a true story. The protagonist, Mary Ellen Wilson, was a real orphaned child who experienced devastating cruelty at the hands of the first woman to be tried and convicted of child abuse, Mary Connolly. The story climaxes when Etta Wheeler, a social worker; Henry Bergh, the founder of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; and Elbridge Gerry, ASPCA attorney, come together to rescue Mary Ellen. It's nearly inconceivable that animals were awarded victims' rights before children.Thomas Wilson was an immigrant from Ireland who fled the potato famine to shuck oysters at a New York City hotel. In 1861 he married Frances Connor, an English immigrant who he'd met while she was a laundress at the hotel. While he was on the front lines during the Civil War, she gave birth to their daughter, named Mary Ellen. The year the child was born was the same year that Tom Wilson died in battle, 1864.Frances found it difficult to work and care for her child, so she sought the services of a woman named Martha Score. Childcare for the working poor in the tenements of New York City provided meager nutrition and crowded conditions with no sanitation. However, Miss Score took good care of the baby while Frances worked long hours at the hotel. Travel through the tenements was treacherous at night, so Frances could not visit her child as often as she wished. After her husband died during battle, Fanny turned to alcohol for solace, leading to the loss of her job. Eventually, Fanny died in an \\"inebriate's asylum.\\" When the war ended, working women returned to housekeeping as their husbands went to work. This left Miss Score with no income, thereby having to abandon the then two-year old Mary Ellen to Blackwell Island almshouse. Mary Ellen was illegally adopted to the evil Mrs. Connolly, where she suffered for seven years.Etta Wheeler worked for St. Luke's Mission; she cared for the \\"outdoor poor\\" and frail elderly in the slums of the city. When neighbors spoke about the cries of a child called Mary Ellen, Miss Wheeler used all available resources to rescue Mary Ellen. However, she was often told by pastors, police, and lawyers to not interfere in the family's business. Undaunted by the advice, Etta persisted in her rescue efforts, eventually aided by Henry Bergh of the ASPCA. In 1874, with police assist, Mary Ellen was carried out of the abusive home, covered with a horse blanket provided by the ASPCA. The court proceedings set a precedent: \\"There had never been a recognized way to remove a child from an unfit home.\\" The jury trial resulted in felony assault charges against Mrs. Connolly.Etta Wheeler's sister, who lived on a farm in upstate New York, legally adopted Mary Ellen. Etta continued her social work in the tenements of New York City, where she was needed most. Mary Ellen eventually married, and her daughters spoke of their mother's burns and cuts that never fully healed. However, Mary Ellen lived until the age of ninety-two, surviving her husband by thirty-one years. Meanwhile, Mr. Bergh founded the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Mr. Gerry was responsible for forming the initial laws pertaining to the rights of children.This story will cause the reader to wince at the cruelty and rejoice at the rescue. Perhaps the most poignant message in the book comes with the ending: \\"Perhaps we should see Mary Ellen not as the victim of abuse, but as the survivor, and as a persistent reminder that the efforts of a few people on behalf of one child can make a real difference.\\" As a social worker, that is my hope.review by Lynn C. Tolson"},{"Title":"Out Of The Darkness: The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson","review":"I'm not regarded as intelligent and not an avid reader, for that matter either, but Out Of The Darkness captivated me. I found that I could'nt put the book down. Waiting at (Cheap Tickets) with a number 33 in my hand, just hoping I'll finish chapter 12 before they call my number. Behind a long row of cars waiting for the light to turn green, hoping that it would not until Henry finished his rescue of a cat. That night, in my dreams, I could hear the echos of little Mary Wilson crying. I feel this is a very important book, a book that begs to be on the wide screen so people like me, can slurp fruit punch and gnaw on dots while unscard by childhood brutality watching a small army of angels battle the fierce monster. Surely out of the thousands who've read Out Of The Darkness, one will have some influence in Hollywood and take the lead."},{"Title":"Out Of The Darkness: The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson","review":"Even as a well-rounded book reader, I must admit that the subject of child abuse was not one of great interest to me UNTIL I read the Out of the Darkness. Historical facts are presented in a well-written novel format seducing the reader into an almost voyeuristic journey into the life of Mary Ellen. Definitely a book difficult to put down until finished, it carries the reader into some of the most unspeakable acts of child abuse and finally presents resolution and the heroes who fought hard to end such abuse. A must-read for anyone angered by injustices to the defenseless."},{"Title":"Out Of The Darkness: The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson","review":"The authors of this book have created a wonderful window of understanding how child abuse/neglect has evolved over the years. This book should be required reading for anyone interested in the human service field. Through the heart-felt story of Mary Ellen, we can see why there is such a strong need to protect children and continue to evolve for many more years. Thank you to Shelman & Lazoritz for telling such an important story."},{"Title":"Out Of The Darkness: The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson","review":"I happened upon this book when I got my kindle. It looked interesting,but it turned out to be the type of story you don't want to put down. It was written in a way that you felt the emotions that the people were feeling. Thank you for bring this unknown story to light. I think it would also make a great movie!"},{"Title":"Out Of The Darkness: The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson","review":"I LOVE how this story is told. The child abuse is horrifying, but did not make me sick when I read it. The five characters and thier different stories made the book amazing and hard to put down. It made me love the ASPCA so much more to know where it came from."},{"Title":"Out Of The Darkness: The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson","review":"I loved \\"Out of the Darkness - The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson\\" by Eric A. Shelman and Stephen Lazoritz. It captured my attention from beginning to end. It was entertaining and educational. Even though I knew the outcome, the story remained captivating.This well researched historical fiction piece takes place in New York 1864 - 1875. It is the story of Mary Ellen Wilson, a terribly abused child and her ultimate rescue dubbed child abuse \`Case 1'. There is a parallel story of Henry Bergh's mission to adopt animal protection laws in the United States. The two stories converge when the ASCPA gets involved in Mary Ellen's rescue. It is an important story skillfully told by Shelman and Lazoritz. The breadth of abuse taken place repulses anyone with a conscience and empathy for the feelings of others. The authors confront us with this harsh reality but skillfully convey the tragedy of abuse without devastating the reader.The book is thought provoking and leaves us to wonder how it could have taken so long for America to take real action protecting abused children. And what does it say about our society that animal protection laws preceded child protection?I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Out Of The Darkness: The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson","review":"I read this book for the first time years ago as mandatory reading to become a volunteer CASA (working with foster children) and am now currently reading it to my three teenage boys. They are engrossed and don't want to stop. They have to read a non-fiction book every semester and it can be extremely difficult to find one that appeals to teenagers. Reading this to them was an afterthought after several unsuccessful trips to the library looking for non-fiction. It hit me that this book that I had so enjoyed reading might be something they would like, and it was right on my bookshelf!

This is a story you won't forget. As a S.A.N.E., the message I most want to bring to the survivors of abuse and assault who I tend to is one of the great human ability to overcome terrible things.

This account of the life of Mary Ellen Wilson will change that way of thinking. This story will open your heart to a little girl who, for much of her childhood had no friends, no hugs, no kisses, no bedtime &quot;I love you&quot; moments. The book will take you from the beginnings of a love story, through death, child abuse, hate, compassion, rescue, and survival. It's a must read for anyone who thinks that one person cannot make a difference in the life of a child. Thank you, Mr. Shelman and Dr. Lazoritz for bringing Mary Ellen into our lives...may the doors of our hearts be opened as a result."},{"Title":"Out Of The Darkness: The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson","review":"Out of the Darkness was a very intense novel. I had heard a little bit about Mary Ellen a few months ago but I really didn't have the time or effort to find out more. When I read this book, I cried. And I cheered out loud. I have been telling eveyone I know about this book, but not just because its a good real. I also feel that everyone needs to read this book for a lesson in humanity. Everyone has a safe place they go to when they hurt, or need love, and that place is usually your home and family. But what happens when the pain is caused by someone who should love you. Not only is it a well told biography, it also makes you re-evaluate how you view the world around you. I met Eric A. Shelman at a book signing, and met a person I would like to be friends with."},{"Title":"Out Of The Darkness: The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson","review":"This is a marvelous work, detailing the early years of the struggle for animal and children's rights in America. Written in a most-readable style, the authors convey the richness of detail so necessary to good historical work, and bring the reader directly in contact with the characters, places, and intellectual mindsets of the period. It is thoroughly enjoyable,despite it's distressing subject matter, and the story will remain within my heart forever!"},{"Title":"Out Of The Darkness: The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson","review":"I found this book to be very captivateing,and very well written.

A must read for everyone,a lesson in history,and a blessing to see how far we have come."},{"Title":"Out Of The Darkness: The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson","review":"A fascinating and compelling chronicle of love, war, hope, despair, good intentions, bad luck, brutality, and the misery of a child who was at the center of it all.One might well expect to be drawn deeply into a true American story penned by a well known and established writer---after all, a good writer is supposed to stir the reader on multiple levels and successful writers practice their art unto perfection. It is, however, quite rare to find such skill in an unknown author, and rarer yet to see a first novel that reaches into your psyche and awakens the part of you that used to care about people you never met. Mr. Shelman has surpassed any meager expectations with a well-researched, well-written, well-received book about the first child abuse prosecution on record. This was a story that cried out for 100 years to be told, and Mr. Shelman has answered with sensitivity and an absorbing narrative concerning scandalous times.Interlaced throughout this fine book is demographic and cultural detail that transports the reader back to the latter half of the 19th century as a familiar place. Much of the story is in New York City's &quot;Hell's Kitchen&quot; and the author again does us a service by reminding us how it is to live in utter squalor. Crime was a daily hazard for these poor residents and work---when you could find it---was usually hard, the hours long, and the pay meager. But worst of all was the fear of getting the fever, any fever. This is a time in America when disease would strike a tenement at a time and take almost all of the children and many of the adults within the space of a few days.The struggle and eventual success of the A.S.P.C.A. movement in their efforts to stop the blatant and open abuse of animals is superbly presented as a background to the horrible existence Mary Ellen Wilson suffered for much of her childhood. As Blacks were taking their first few steps toward their rightful place in American society, animals in New York City were suddenly being rescued and their owners fined and even jailed for their cruelty. Civil and animal rights had finally crept into the American consciousness yet there was no one to take a stand for the many women and children who were simply abused at will, the abuser operating without fear of retribution. Mary Ellen Wilson's story brought child abuse into headlines and finally into American ethos.Mr. Shelman tells a powerful story that should have been told years ago, lest we forget from whence came. I can't wait to see what this guy does next..."},{"Title":"Out Of The Darkness: The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson","review":"i am already in the human services field and when i read this book for a class project i was doing it only confirmed and reaffirmed as to why i was in this field to begin with. we all have human rights and our children do as well. this book, this child gave us all a precious gift, the love of children. the authors did a magnificent job in giving us all the ability to relive this child's life even though she is gone. god bless mary ellen, the authors and all the children that are living this terrible ordeal today called &quot;child abuse.&quot; it is up to all of us, the readers to learn and to stop it. the book gave me a new perspective on my work in the human services field and its victims of trauma. i would suggest everyone in the field of social work to definitely read this book and fast. you will never regret it and you'll cry when you are done."},{"Title":"Out Of The Darkness: The Story of Mary Ellen Wilson","review":"Just got the book a few days ago and could not wait to read it. Unfortunately, this book is essentially historical fiction. To the authors' credit, they admit to adding fictional characters and fabricating dialog and scenes, all in the interest of making the book \\"entertaining\\"; alas, I did not have the preface at my disposal before adding the book to my shopping cart. After reading the first several chapters, I gave up and merely skimmed the remaining pages, only stopping to read those that contained actual, substantiated facts. Potential readers should be aware that this is a novel based on true events, not true non-fiction.

I kept my word and sat by the pool and read it.I have dealt with child abuse personally and have read other books on the subject. I found that Out of The Darkness had been written in a way that did not read like social workers case notes, like I have found some other books. It does not dwell on each beating this poor child received, it gives you the facts in a beautifully written way that truly inspires. Mary-Ellen's story proves how just one person like Etta has to care to rescue a childs life. I am sure anyone who reads this book will not think twice about reporting a suspected case of child abuse.

Beyond that, Mary Ellen Wilson's life is such an example of resiliency. She lived through unbelievable abuse and after rescue grew up in upstate New York, married and had two daughters that positively impacted the lives of thousands.Both Eta and Florence (Brasser) dedicated their lives to the education of children.

Additionally, most of the essays require working knowledge of Sanskrit, a dead language. If you fit either of these qualifications then, by god, read this book and make your education worthwhile. Otherwise you're up a creek on this one.The introduction, incidentally, is very interesting, but pertains more to his book &quot;Exploring Mysticism&quot; which I've just ordered as he made it sound so fascinating. Read that one."},{"Title":"Universals: Studies in Indian Logic and Linguistics","review":"In this volume Staal tries to make an important point that needs emphasis: That C.P. Snow's 'two cultures' slogan, which insists that the humanities are not a science, (and which derives from the German Romanticists), is a mistaken one. Thus, linguistics and logic (as the study of discourse and reasoning) can be studied by empirical methods. These methods must be based on, or will eventually uncover, universals of logic and language, that is to say commonalities that can be subject to rational investigation. This at once torpedos the whole hermeneutical dilemma and the fashionability of much current thinking on the uniqueness of cultures. However, as Staal, says, this is only partially a philosophical presumption. There is also empirical evidence, and this book attempts to present some of that evidence.The only trouble with this volume is its rather technical nature. Contrary to the other reviewer, I do not believe that the symbolic logic used in it is much of a barrier. Anyone familiar with the predicate calculus will understand it. The additional symbolism is clearly explained in the book. Some of the papers, however, are marred by some unfortunate typos that make the symbolism harder to understand than it really is. As well, it is not necessary to have a knowledge of Sanskrit. That being said, some knowledge of the grammar of an inflected language (like Latin or Greek) and phonetics is necessary. It would also be helpful to have some aquaintance with the technicalites of Indian philosophy, some of which are rather not very well explained in the original papers that went into this book, written as they were for an academic audience that would have been familiar with them."},{"Title":"Hotel Savoy","review":"Gabriel Dan comes from war and he stays at Hotel Savoy in an unknown industrial town Eastern Europe -as a matter of fact is Lodz, now in Poland. It's the summer of 1919. The First World War has finished and destroyed many things, and one of them was the Austro-Hungarian Empire, that encompassed lands from Russia to the Mediterranean sea, Slavonic people from the North (Ukraine, Russia) and from the South (Slovenia, Croatia), Hungarians, Germans, Jewish... When Joseph Roth misses that Empire that was destroyed with the war, giving birth to many little National countries, he did not really miss the crown and the Habsburgs but a State in which people from different religions, from different nations and languages could be together. He's not only a wandering Jew, but a wondering citizen and European. And that loss of a common ground is showed in this book. People from many places arrive to that hotel, in which they're located depending on the money they have: the higher floors belong to sad, poor people, that die \\"among the steam of bleaching\\"; the lowers ones to rich men that entertain themselves with the beautiful but poor girls of the bar. Prisoners of war, Jewish that come from Russia, displaced citizens, revolutionaries... they all arrive there and there's really no other place to go. They expect the important and rich man from America -called Bloomfield, n&eacute;e Blomenfeld- to arrive and solve all their economical problems. But he comes and goes... and the only solution is the Revolution. Remember, this novel -very entertaining, indeed, but confusing if you don't understand the ethnical and political complexities of Eastern Europe- was written in the 1920s, and the Socialist revolution was the only hope in those days. The sadness, the poverty, the anguish and the displacement that the war created are difficult to bear. And Joseph Roth has a special gift to transmit those feelings, and a great great imagination to create metaphors, so poetic, that even translation improves his lyre."},{"Title":"Mercy Otis Warren Author & Historian","review":"This is a small book, written in language seemingly directed to the younger audience, which is important when introducing youngsters to historical writings - but perhaps this observation is due more to the fact that I have waded through the \\"actual (personal) writings\\" of the Revolutionists of that day, and have come to expect to work hard at reading their prose.When I opened to the first page, I was struck by it's ambiance. The outlay is in old appearance, slightly yellowed effect and it's illustrations and portraits immediately add charm to go with the importance of Mercy Otis' life story and her contribution to the accounting of the Revolution.It encapsulates the entire story of Mercy Otis without frills.

Everything he writes has truth in it and that makes it all the more interesting to me. I have read almost all of his books, and have read every one of the Sackett Books, and the ones about their relatives. If you are a Western fan, these books will give you satisfaction. His story telling is wonderful and takes me away from the present. This book gives us a female hero and she represents every woman that came west in those days.

I can tell you in 1997 he was still going very strong, because I bought my copy of the book directly from him -- he even graciously signed it -- when I visited his island home in the Carribbean. The book lays out his love of life and adventure and his ability to achieve seemingly impossible tasks, and what you read is exactly how he came across in person too. Apparently Mary was worth it. They married and sailed throughout the Carribbean for years before settling on the very unpromising Prune Island in the Grenadines. Caldwell signed a 198 year lease with the St. Vincent government for the island and then they spent decades transforming the bug-infested island into a beautiful, rustic and exclusive \\"get away from it all and enjoy the simple life\\" resort. The island, near Bequi and St. Vincent, is now called Palm Island in honor of the palm trees planted all over the island (palms aren't native to the Carribbean, but Caldwell acted like Johnny Appleseed and planted palms throughout the neighboring islands).Now the review: Caldwell's story lacks any literary pretensions. Instead it's a straightforward first person account of a tremendous (mis)adventure -- the kind no sane person would (or could) make today! You can't help but root for him and wonder how things will turn out. For me the story has even greater appeal because I had a chance to briefly meet Caldwell and knew his story wasn't a brief abberration forced on him by wartime -- but instead was just one chapter in the long life of a very nice man who clearly marched to the beat of a different drummer.- Jim"},{"Title":"Desperate voyage","review":"The most remarkable thing about this story is that it's true! John Caldwell became an adventurer by accident. He just wanted to get across the Pacific Ocean to his new wife, and tried to do it the easy way by ship. Unfortunately there were no ships going his way, so he bought his own - a small wooden yacht. His (mis)adventures start as soon as he sets foot on his boat and don't end until he almost dies in his attempt to reach his destination. Caldwell's courage in facing challenge was born out of naivete - he only had a vague notion of what he was taking on. This makes his achievements all the more extraordinary because his lack of experience only left him with a kind of animal resourcefulness to get him through. He blunders from hilarious escapade to life-threatening drama and back again in an amazing journey that packs more adventure into a few months than most of us get (or want) in a lifetime. His sense of humour and down-to-earth style make This book a delightful read. &quot;Desperate Voyage&quot; undoubtedly has appeal to yachties like myself. But I've lent it to several friends including some landlubbers, and all have thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Desperate voyage","review":"So many times I wanted to reach into the book and stop Mr. Caldwell from making some terrible mistake!

I'm delighted to see that it's available from Amazon and that other sailors and adventurers have had the chance to read this tome.I had to remind myself that if I'd been the same age as when he made this journey I might not have done as well.One thing is clear - Never invite a SHARK to dinner!Best regards,Tom"},{"Title":"Desperate voyage","review":"An amazing story of bad judgement and bad luck. This is a great read. Very Honest, Very compelling Story."},{"Title":"Desperate voyage","review":"I know there are already enough 5 star reviews, but I just finished the book and need to say, \\"Oh my gosh this book is great!\\" I allowed myself one chapter per night before lights out, and broke my own rules every time. I'd stay up so late I'd sleep in and be late for work. Now exotic imaginations are racing through my mind and heart. What a treasure. A book full of life in our time when so much entertainment celebrates destruction and degradation. This book renews the spirit and restores a sense of adventure. I'm 56 years old but feel like a 20 year old about to embark on an adventure, if only I can persuade my wife to sell all and head out to sea, after she reads the book! Oh Oh, maybe I should let her read it once we're out of sight of land."},{"Title":"Desperate voyage","review":"This is a true story that is more engrossing than pretty much any novel you are likely to find. After the end of the Second World War, the author's Australian wife is ten thousand miles away, and it is impossible for him to book passage from the States to Australia, what with the war just having ended and available shipping tied up for years. So he decides to do a solo sail in a small sailboat from Panama to Sydney.Therein lies a tale of hardship, resourcefulness, courage, and (may I say it) at least one part bad judgment, as the author single-handedly crosses the better part of the Pacific Ocean in a small and primitive, but plucky sailing vessel. I am sure that I am not giving anything away when I tell you that the author stares death and starvation in the face on more than one occasion.The author knows how to tell a good story, and I was unable to put this one down once I got past about the first chapter. I was up until 3 in the morning trying to finish it, unable to put it down or go to sleep. This is a terrific story with equal parts humor, desperation, and audaciousness.This is a classic mariner's tale that anyone who loves boats or the ocean will want to read, own, and read repeatedly. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Desperate voyage","review":"Please get yourself comfortable, settle in and be prepared to be separated from your surroundings while you read this book from cover to cover.

His story is just a fantastic adventure, reading it will make you feel like you are there. I was swaying to rhythm of the sea as I read.

Unable to find an easy way back home, the inexperienced sailor figures he could just sail home across the Pacific.The first two thirds of the book will leave experienced sailors constantly shaking their heads at his often absurd decisions. All through the trip though, you find yourself getting closer and eventually cheering him on to succeed. When he finally succeeds (I'm not giving it away, after all, he lives to tell the story!) with the heartfelt generosity of people from a wonderfully innocent world, you can't help but feel joy and think &quot;Wow, what a great story&quot;."},{"Title":"Desperate voyage","review":"I love sea stories, I love survival stories & I knew very little about this book besides the fact that almost every review was 5 stars. I thought I would give it try. This is the story of John Caldwell who at the end of WW2 was stranded at the opposite end of the world from his new wife Mary whom he had married the year before. Try as John might he could not find a way to get back to his wife in Australia. From his years of service in the merchant marine he had enough money saved up to buy a 26 year old 29 foot sailboat. With ZERO training & knowledge of sailing he set off from Panama for a 9,000 mile journey.One of the things that sets this book apart is at the start John really knows nothing about sailing & he isn't afraid to admit it. Right from the moment he casts off he is only minutes from disaster but somehow he prevails & after numerous mistakes he slowly learns to be a better sailor. He sails solo but he is far from alone, he has two kittens who you learn to love & other secret stowaways. Some become friends, some become dinner. John writes with a great sense of humor. As I was reading the book I was expecting John to get lost or beat up in storms but I wasn't expecting the epic tale of survival. It is one of most successful sailing stories ever. I won't delve any farther into what happens but I will say he has endless interesting escapades with the creatures of the south seas & you will see why this is a desperate voyage. Also you will be amazed at what a human being will eat if pushed to the brink of death.You will love John's storytelling. I was sad to learn that John has passed on. This week (Sept 2008) his wife has published another book (Mary's Voyage) about further journeys with John - I can't believe he stepped foot on another sailboat. If you love sea stories this book will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Desperate voyage","review":"John Caldwell, a young American who served in the Australian air force and the US merchant marine during WWII, found himself at the end of hostilities stranded in Panama. He had no way to get back to Australia and his new wife Mary.With more pluck than brains Caldwell, who had not done any small boating, buys a small sailboat (about 29 feet) with the idea of sailing to far off Australia--more than 8500 miles of open Pacific. First he learns how to maneuver his boat in and around the islands off Panama, with many hilarious screw-ups. Finally he sets off across the ocean. He has a tiresome voyage to the Galapagos Islands, again with many screw-ups, some of which almost cost him his life and nearly wreck his sailboat and disable his auxiliary engine. After the Galapagos the sailing goes better as he has wind and current with him and only some 8000 miles left to go. Then about half way there, between the Marquesas Islands and Samoa, Caldwell is hit by a terrible hurricane that destroys his rig, nearly sinks his boat, and forces him to jettison all of his food, water, navigation equipment, and supplies. His prospects for survival, not to speak of getting to Australia, are remote. Fortunately he had an almost indestructible craft, and that was his greatest piece of luck.Under jury jig and near death from starvation, he eventually fetches up in the Fiji Islands. He is nursed back to health by the kindly natives and soon makes it the rest of the way to Australia by hitching rides on boats and planes, and is reunited with his beloved Mary. They apparently have lived happily ever after (or at least until the late 1990s), even founding and running a resort in the Caribbean.Desperate Voyage is a wonderful and wonderfully engaging story. Caldwell writes so well and so engagingly that this book is really hard to put down. I thoroughly enjoyed it. You cannot help liking this plucky screw-up with a penchant for survival. Of course, I feel somewhat guilty enjoying this tale so much--after all it is mostly about screw-ups, disaster, pain, and close brushes with death most of which resulted from Caldwell's rashness and carelessness. Caldwell's voyage is not one to emulate. But as A.J. Mackinnon says in his masterful The Unlikely Voyage of Jack de Crow (another boating story full of screw-ups) \\"No screw-ups, no story.\\" Certainly if Caldwell had been an accomplished yachtsman and as careful as we boaters are supposed to be, there would have been nothing here to laugh and cry about. Also when reading Caldwell's tale I was reminded of Mackinnon's admission: \\"Of course, I exaggerate for effect.\\" How much has Caldwell exaggerated to enhance his tale? No one knows, but I sincerely doubt that he really drank his engine oil in order to assuage his hunger when he was starving."},{"Title":"Desperate voyage","review":"More than thirty years ago when my young family were avid deep water sailors, I read many survival and adventure stories written by those who had had narrow escapes. John Caldwell's vivid tale of his struggle to return to his Australian lady love following his release from the Navy at the end of WWII still stands out in my mind. This year, as I home school my grandson and encourage him to develop innovative thinking, determination and loyalty, \\"Desperate Voyage\\" once again comes to mind. One of your other reviewers remarked that Caldwell \\"had no literary pretentions,\\" but his book is, nevertheless, well worth reading for Caldwell's own humor and durability in the face of disaster. I am happy once again to add it to my library on my grandson's behalf."},{"Title":"Desperate voyage","review":"Not knowing anything about sailing, I found the lingo a bit of a challenge in the beginning.

Caldwell's courage, determination, and passion are inspiring. However, the reader can not help but sense that he needlessly put himself in danger time and time again. From a hurricane's fury to the agony of being on the ocean without food or water, we are reminded what lengths a man will go to to be with the woman he loves."},{"Title":"Desperate voyage","review":"I found a copy of Desperate Voyage at a second hand book sale at Goolwa, South Australia.

Is John Caldwell still alive, still married, and was Mary worth all the trouble and sacrifice ?And how did his health hold up afterwards ?If anyone knows the answer, please email me doggau@chariot.net.auThankyou.

Many crisises and loss of equipment and food. Definately a survival story."},{"Title":"Desperate voyage","review":"I went into this book not realizing that it was actually a true story. And it was an interesting story, although I couldn't help but shake my head at a few of Caldwell's decisions.Caldwell, after having to leave his new wife behind in Australia, decides that he can't stay away any longer, and buys a small sailboat in which to sail from Panama back to Australia. And he goes alone, with only two kittens as company. He suffers through more hardships than can be imagined. Some of its due to the weather, but sometimes its due to his own foolishness as well. But he meets some interesting people along the way, and also nearly starves. A very exciting adventure in all. And his descriptions of sailing on a boat for so long are very detailed and probably paint a very accurate picture of what he experienced.Since its mainly Caldwell and the kittens on the boat, he spends a lot of time with his thoughts. And he doesn't tend to describe himself very often, unless its to comment on the state of his non-shaving. But he does think often of his wife and that's very admirable. She must have been some woman, and you could definitely tell he loved her enough to put himself through such an ordeal. I also liked his take on the islanders, he always described them favorably. And his description of the cats, wonderful. They were very entertaining.I had a hard time with the parts of this book that described some technical aspects of sailing the boat. It just took away from the actual story for me and there's only so many times you can hear about pumping out the bilges really. And some of the things he does to himself just has me cringing. I guess I just wouldn't take such risks with my life on an already risky adventure. But then again I was only getting part of it as I'm sure he didn't give the whole story in the book. But I did admire his courage, and the fact that he survived such a journey.An interesting book. Maybe not to my tastes but anyone who's into nautical journeys should find it interesting. And since its a true story, it makes the tale quite amazing.Desperate VoyageCopyright 1949243 pagesReview by M.

Some have very little text,as little is needed.Others have many inserts that can be removed.Some have tabs to \\"pull\\" to creat action ,and on and on.One of the things that really interest me is the thought and skill that goes into making the pieces move when the pages are opened.The term \\"Paper Engineering\\" quite well describes how this is done.While children are always moved by these books;unfortunately,they are so intricate and even fragile ;that they must be handled with extreme care.As a matter of fact,these books are often damaged by people browsing through them while still on the store bookshelves.I suggest that one buys one that still has the cellophane wrapping in tact.From reading and viewing this book;I believe I must be one of the few people who has newer experienced a nightmare.I don't know if that is common or not;but if one has experienced them,it must be a frightning experience. My daughter has experienced ones somewhat similar to the one entitled \\"Haunted Bedroom\\" She woulld appear at our bedside,in the middle of the night,obviously very frightened as something was clawing at her window. We lived in that house for only one year,about 35 years ago,and any mention of it ,even today,has a chilling effect on her.I have'nt shown this book to her,but I think it would have an impact.The Pop-Ups in this book may not be as intricate as in some of the others that I have mentioned;but nevertheless, they are very good and effective.I noticed that Robert Sabuda is mentioned at the back of the book as a contributot.That doesn't surprise me as he is the author of several of the other ones I've mentioned.Along with the actual Pop-Ups ,the text provides some insight into what is believed to be the significence of the nightmares.Whether you buy into these thoughts ,is up to you."},{"Title":"The Pop-Up Book of Nightmares","review":"I love all pop up books, especially those falling into the newer category of adult pop up books.

I ended up removing the covers which I covered in plastic book wrap and replaced within the wire spiral - hopefully this will entend its life.It would be useful if future editions could include stature regression formulae for a wider cross section of world geographic groups (broader than just America - we are not all the same!).

I'm an anthropology student, so I have osteology textbooks (notably the one by Tim White) and what I was looking for this time was precisely what I got: something that condenses all of the information of a textbook into a more portable form. This is not, I believe, a book for actually LEARNING osteology, and I don't think it's designed for that, so if you're looking to get a really in-depth look at the human skeleton, I do recommend going for textbooks first (or a class if you have the opportunity.) But this is a great supplemental reference material.One drawback that people have already touched upon is the physical book itself. The cover seems in constant danger of falling off, and the wire ring binding gets in the way of comfortable perusal. I do hope they make a sturdier edition in the future.

Sparrow camel!, what is that? Obviously the ornithologists who discovered the bird were confused about it; as confused, perhaps as the ostrich sometimes looks with it's blank, non-blinking stare. Have you ever seen one up close? The term 'bird brain' is appropriate.This is all rather unkind, and in fact, unfair to the ostrich. A bird rumored to be so dumb that it supposedly sticks it's head into the sand when threatened; actually we are the dummies if we believe this bit of folklore - it's a myth. The ostrich is in fact remarkably well adapted to it's environment - the savannas of Eastern and Southern Africa, and has had a close association with man for the better part of a century, providing us with food and making fortunes for us.It is this relationship between man and ostrich that Mr Nixon explores in DREAMBIRDS, specifically his remembrances of the bird from his childhood in South Africa. A town called Oudtshoorn, near where he grew up, was, before WWI, the capital of the worldwide ostrich feather industry. In its heyday it supplied 100,000 tons of plumes to the fashion centers of Europe. The town was then known as the Jerusalem of Africa - a consequence of the large resident community of jewish feather merchants.That's about all the history there is though. The book is a more a biography, and the ostrich is the common theme, the link between Nixons early youth in South Africa and his adult life in his adopted home - the US. We run into the bird at the ostrich races in Chandler, Arizona and again at various ranches throughout the Southwest. It's not only places, but people that are mentioned. There are some interesting characters involved in the ostrich business. One of the central people in the book is Mr Nixons father, and we are treated to a bit of reminiscing about the relationship between father and son. DREAMBIRDS is a well written and humorous look at this &quot;gawky, boneheaded creature&quot;; gladly it's light on the father and son dynamic, but sadly it's also light on the development and history of the industry. For lovers of birds and biographies."},{"Title":"Dreambirds: The Strange History of the Ostrich in Fashion, Food, and Fortune","review":"This book is wonderful. It took me to places and times I never would have thought of to go. From Ladysmith (I knew Ladysmith Black Mombasa) to Austrilia. The life and times of things I knew nothing about. What a trip. Well worth reading if your interested in learning."},{"Title":"Dreambirds: The Strange History of the Ostrich in Fashion, Food, and Fortune","review":"An unusual combination of science, history, and memoir built around ostrich farming, primarily in South Africa. This may not sound like an exciting topic on its face, but Nixon's book is a model of how to write creative non-fiction."},{"Title":"Dreambirds: The Strange History of the Ostrich in Fashion, Food, and Fortune","review":"Though well written, this is NOT a history of the ostrich, but rather an autobiography of a man who grew up within view of the ostrich industry in his native South Africa, and then was able to run across them and write about them later in life.There is really nothing new in this book with regards to the history of the ostrich, and the author indeed had nothing to do with the industry at all - at any point in his life.If you are buying this book for insights into the history of this magnificent bird in food, fashion and fortune, then you will be disappointed to be sure.Nice story of Nixon's life, well written, and only occasionally pedantic; however a history of the ostrich this is not."},{"Title":"The Passing of an Illusion : The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century","review":"What do Saint-Simon, Szyszko, Reyes, Schafer, and Marx all have in common? According to &quot;The Passing of an Illusion,&quot; by Francois Furet, they were all the annointed prophets of the deadly cult of socialism (the deceitfully benign &quot;nom de plume&quot; of communism), which proved itself hostile to the most basic notions of individuality and freedom. These men provided the idealogical cornerstone for the bloody reign of Lenin and Stalin, and fueled the egoism and violence of dozens of more minor dictators and rebels throughout the last half of the Twentieth Century. Who better to expose the truth that our history books will not reveal than a former priest of the Red Religion? As a young man, Furet, a Jewish Creole of Haitian descent, was constantly excluded from social interactions by his French bourgeois peers for no other reason than his heritage. Understandably then, it was the revolutionary writings of the Polish Szyszko and the Belgian Schafer (famous for their simultaneous calls for the liberation of all nations subjugated by the European colonial powers)which first attracted Furet. As he matured, Reyes' ephemeral &quot;Notes on a Libido Theory of Value&quot; became more to Furet's liking, and his political activities in support of a &quot;Dictatorship of the Proletariat&quot; in France grew ever more intense. Thirty years later, and after a story of conversion that absolutely MUST BE READ TO BE BELIEVED, Francois Furet has returned to the world of the rational, and brings to us as his offering of penitence this ecyclopedic survey of the diabolical philosophy of communism in Europe. This book should be mandatory reading for every student and amator of political science in America, where the marxian discipline--sadly--rages on in the halls of some of our greatest centers of learning."},{"Title":"The Passing of an Illusion : The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century","review":"I had high hopes for this book. But as I got into it I found myself having difficulty linking the concepts together. At first I though it was me but after a while I started to parse the sentences. I soon concluded that the sentences are totally unreadable, full of vague terms, run on constructions and, perhaps, paradoxical comparsions that are not readily apparent. Take these two sentences selected at random:In both cases they were outsiders to the collectivity, thus exacerbating their opprobrium. Even a plurality of opinions had no effect on this second accusation, which followed from the first, since the bourgeois were no less detested on the left than on the right.Now maybe this makes more sense in the original French. The translation is by Furet's wife, Deborah who may be so intune with her husband so as to assume more from English reader than is usual.A great disappointment."},{"Title":"The Passing of an Illusion : The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century","review":"This book is a great book, but it is NOT a layman book. I read this for my graduate class in political science, and it was used as the theotical backbone for the class. The sentence structure is a little bit too hard to read at first, but the biggest obstacle, I think, is rather the concepts a person needs to know before he or she can really understand the book.If you do not understand the book, then may be you are not part of the intended audience of it anyway."},{"Title":"The Passing of an Illusion : The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century","review":"Furet says, in the preface to this book, that \\"The passing of an illusion\\" \\"is not a history of Communism, even less a history of the Soviet Union; it is a history of the illusion of Communism during the time in which the USSR lent it consistency and vitality\\". In my opinion, this book tells us a story, the story of a myth. That myth is no other that the Communist myth, that was supposed to bring a world of peace and freedom, and instead only brought more chains to those who chose to follow it.The October revolution was thought to be the continuation of the French Revolution, a new revolution that would finish the task the other couldn\`t complete. Many continued to believe so even after it was fairly evident that that wasn't the case: the dictatorship of the proletariat had turned into arbitrary rule of the proletariat by a few. Of course, it was much easier to believe in the Communist myth living far away from the URSS than in that country, having to deal with the reality of oppression.Furet points out how ingeniously the URSS managed to retain its universalistic appeal even after Stalin imposed the doctrine of \\"socialism in one state\\". He also mentions the intelligent identification that the URSS tried to make between Communism and Anti-Fascism, and the realization that \\"Communism had to conceal its reality in order to remain an 'idea' \\". Many intellectuals were almost eager to be mislead: they hated Fascism so much that they didn\`t wait much to \\"establish a subjective connection between Communism and liberty\\".\\"The passing of an illusion\\" is rather long, but it is more than worth your time and effort. Even though it doesn\`t exhaust the subject, it allows the reader to learn a lot about it... Moreover, it was written by Franois Furet (1927-1997), a well-known French historian that somehow managed to convey wonderfully how important the theme was to him. In his own words, \\"I have a biographical connection with my subject: in my youth, I experienced the passing of an illusion as a Communist between 1949 and 1956. My subject is thus inseparable from my existence, and I experienced firsthand the illusion that I am attempting to trace back to the time in which it was most widespread\\".Why did the myth persist for so long, and how did it finally fall?. The author examines these questions, and finds some answers that I consider very interesting. However, those answers are quite long, so instead of repeating them I advice you to read this book :)On the whole, I recommend \\"The passing of an illusion\\" to all those who want to understand our present. Believe it or not, doing so is impossible without understanding the communist myth and its evolution. Ideas are important, and the impact of Communism over our century is just another proof of that...Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"The Passing of an Illusion : The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century","review":"Whether the skill of his wife's translation or not, this man wrote in this work some of the best historical prose I've ever read.

Conditions were deplorable. Abuses rampant. Marx's response to this and his theoretical solution originated and evolved during this period in London. After this period ended due to public outrage, legislation and union movements, Marxist ideology was not modified by its' followers, but reinforced, with it's (outdated) concepts. After digressing from implementing (the doing of) Marx's major points they erroneously continued to advocate the motto and principles (the theory) of Marx's original critique.This book by the Furets is not about communism's policies, practices, and affect on certain societies. It's about its' idea, ideology, and vision. This makes it compelling. Because in the future there may be some who claim that communism wasn't \\"interpreted,\\" or \\"implemented\\" correctly. Hence, they may advocate a \\"new\\" or \\"more effective\\" form or version of communism again in the future. This book takes a look not only at the the origins, interpretations, and implementations of Marxist ideology, but the disastrous ramifications of it. In actuality, Marxism was and still is nothing but heuristic value, becoming as pass&eacute; as Freud by 1900. Marxism, in its true form, has never existed beyond the political theory in the books of Marx and Engels. Over 100 million people died as the result of this vision, which was never brought to fruition. No one can honestly argue against historical fact that today in 2003, that the altered and diluted form of communism that was implemented imploded, self-destructing from within.Two Main Communistic Ideas That Never Came Into Existence1. Marx: \\"the state will whither away\\" = State CommunismDid the state dissolve because there was no need for it, as Marx theorized? He wrote that the \\"state would whither away,\\" because there would be no need for it to exist. But in the Soviet Union, the state was the most ever-present, omnipotent, and omniscient facet of Soviet life. The Soviet government was a monopolistic corporation: controlling, owning, producing, surveying, imprisoning, legislating, decreeing, and supplying, everything. Some claim this was the \\"Soviet Interpretation.\\" This is impossible because one cannot interpret what was never stated nor implied.2. Was the communist party representative of the proletariat or the average person?Membership of the communist party was a very small portion of the population. Those who rose to Apparatchick status had special privilege and practiced and received favoritism in many areas of life. This small group of elites dictated to everyone else what to read, listen to, think, study, and say. Consequences were severe. In addition, most communist nations were rampant with venal bureaucrats, corruption, internecine politics, self-interest, censorship, secret police, and control of the media. Citizens were not allowed to travel. Is this a society based upon equality? Of the proletarian, or \\"working man?\\"Were there various interpretations or Marxist ideology?The basic principles proposed by Marx (and Engels) were never applied in any of the communistic societies of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, Cuba, or Cambodia. This makes it as a working, applicable ideology, even less credible. Marxism was never implemented in the real-world. It was an empty dish of critiques that was later filled with food of alien ideas. There is no documentation that Marxism has ever been practiced or has ever existed in recent world history (save agricultural communes).Marx's critiques of capitalism were critiques and critiques only, offering only limited and vague general theoretical alternatives. These blanks would later be filled in by Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Le Duan and Tito among others. Only a few of Marx's tenets, were practiced by communist nations (i.e., atheism, agricultural collectivization).After the fall of communism, these nations have the audacity to ask for financial aid and business know-how from the United States in particular and and Western Europe and market-economy-based nations in Asia. What strong ideals these people have...."},{"Title":"The Passing of an Illusion : The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century","review":"The history of ideas teaches us not only about the particular idea being discussed, but also how our minds and emotions are put together at a basic level. Furet shows us the mechanisms by which humanity kept the idea of Communism alive even in the face of such facts as totalitarianism and raw terror. His conclusion is that we need a hopeful political idea, and capitalism just isn't sexy enough to ticle our fantasies. What idea will fill the role that Communism has played until its recent collapse? My guess is that the anarchists who show up at the international monetary meetings are the dreamers who have filled the gap that the Communists left behind. Unfortunately, just because an idea isn't sexy enough doesn't mean that it isn't the best, least terror-filled way."},{"Title":"The Passing of an Illusion : The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century","review":"The late Francois Furet informs us that this book is not a history of Communism, \\"it is a history of the illusion of Communism during the time in which the USSR lent it consistency and vitality.\\" (x) The first third of the book first looks at the revolutionary passion and the First World War which made Bolshevism possible, then at the intellectual reaction to the revolution before 1933. The second half of the book deals with how Communism managed to obtain a powerful hegemony in the European Mind by taking the banner of anti-fascism. This was most undeserved, since the two ideologies, though genealogically distinct, were morally similar, and at times were even allies. But after Hitler's death, \\"During this period, Communism no longer had any open enemies in the West; they were hiding or were silent.\\" (384)This book has a number of flaws. It is very repetitive and it suffers from incompetent proofreaders. Bela Kun's Communist rebellion is placed in 1910, not 1919 (223). Victor Serge dies in 1974 instead of 1947 (514n14). John Lewis Gaddis' surname is turned into \\"Gassis,\\" (548n6) while the dates of an essay by Mona Ozouf are moved a century ahead (552n43). Meanwhile interwar Yugoslovia and Romania are wrongly described as republics (58). More importantly, Furet makes sweeping statements about the intellectual climate of Europe based on little or no primary evidence. Statements such as \\"The Soviet Union was above suspicion\\" in 1945 (391), that in the sixties \\"the prohibition on anti-Communism at this time was as strict as ever,\\" (493) and that on the eve of 1989 \\"anti-Communism was more generally condemned than during the heyday of victorious anti-Fascism\\" (497) are constantly reiterated. They are not sourced, they are not clearly argued, while the intelligentsia who support them are not clearly delineated, which is not surprising since all three statements are untrue. If they were true the French Communist Party would not have been completely excluded from power from 1947 to 1981. Nor would Communist parties in the rest of the NATO countries by all excluded from power and be, for the most part, marginal, despised and sometimes illegal entities.Furet also does not deal with opposing arguments. He comments (166) that \\"There is nothing more incompatible with a Marxist-type explanation...than the unparalleled dicatorships of the twentieth century.\\" Perhaps, but Furet does not discuss such authors as Trotsky, Carr, Deutscher, Neumann, Bauer, let alone the large neo-marxist scholarship of the present day who have sought to provide one. He uses Hermann Rauschning's memoirs to show Nazi sympathy for aspects of Communism (191-92), but Hitler's latest and most thorough biographer states that Rauschning's memoirs are very unreliable. Whether on the Spanish Civil War or the Nazi-Soviet Pact Furet ignores or is unaware of such scholars as Helen Graham, Geoffrey Roberts or Michael J. Carley.When it suits his purposes he quotes socialist rhetoric by fascists and extreme right-wingers (163-67, 304-09). When it does not he ignores Francoist rhetoric about its fascist and totalitarian character to argue that it is safely \\"reactionary.\\" (259-60) Nazism is called \\"anti-bourgeois,\\" apparently for no other reason because of its constant calls for meritocracy (which one would think was a classic trope of bourgeois politics). He quotes David Schoenbaum's argument that Nazism led to a social revolution, but Ian Kershaw notes that this argument has been severly qualified by more recent research. Much is made of the complicity of intellectuals, but the acts of the Italian elites who voluntarily brought Mussolini to power are absolved \\"as the product of ignorance and incompetenece rather than of complicity.\\" (176)Fundamentally this is book that tells little about why Communism developed the way it did, or why so many French citizens supported it for so long. Ultimately it is the story of the heroic intellectual who rejected his Communist path and saw the light. Rather than read this self-serving account, scholars of Nazism and Stalinism should read authors such as Christopher Browning, Omer Bartov, Sarah Gordon, Terry Martin and Yuri Slezkine."},{"Title":"The Passing of an Illusion : The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century","review":"It is strange, is it not, that Western books and authors such as this use unusually strong language when referring to Marxism and Communism. Although I am not a communist, and I detest the notion of being one , I equally detest the righteous &quot;goody- goody&quot; hypocrisy, used by the West to combat it. To put it short, the West is guilty of doing many things that they despised the communists for, even worse, in the period of the &quot;New World Order&quot;. Not all such accusations belong to the paranoid underworld of conspiracy theorists. They have supported some of the most shamelessly corrupt and wretched client regimes in the world, such as Zia-ul-Haq and Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan, the murderous Guatemalan regimes, the Shah of Iran, Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire, the Arab Sheikdoms, to name but a few...They were responsible for the creation of the Taliban terror of Afghanistan, which is now one of the biggest thorns in their side.

Roberts who died in 1933, but attained rank as an LDS General Authority before he died. B.H. Roberts was the very antithesis of a dogmatic, inflexible, religious fanatic. B.H. wrote a great deal throughout his life on the Church. It must be remembered that he wrote &quot;The Truth, the Way, the Light&quot; and a &quot;Comprehensive History of the Church&quot;. Anyone who reads the book should make certain they review the introduction written by the late Sterling McMurrin. McMurrin points out that B.H. wrote many books defending the LDS faith and this collection of writings has to be viewed in the context. However, after reading &quot;Studies of the Book of Mormon&quot; one really has to ask what Roberts believed about the Church when he died. The answer may not be simple, but in my view its unimportant.In one series of writings, Robert tries to scientifically answer questions such as whether horses could have been in the Americas at the time the Nephites and Jaredites (look in your Book of Mormon) were supposed to have lived here. He tries to answer whether steel swords and metallurgy could have part of the culture in these continents at these times. The answers are inconclusive, but strongly suggest &quot;difficulties&quot; with the Book of Mormon.However, the most fascinating part of the book is when Roberts attempts to draw parallels between a book written a few years before the Book of Mormon was translated (View of the Hebrews) and the Book of Mormon. The parallels are interesting, and at times, startling. He also explores--and answers affirmatively--the question whether Joseph Smith might have had the imagination to have written the Book of MormonIn the end, though, one can't really answer what B.H. Roberts believed towards the end of his life. However, I concluded that would have made him most happy was the knowledge that people tried to investigate and answer for themselves, the questions that he raised. In that respect, he qualifies as a true scholar who possessed immense honesty. He's someone who both Latter Day Saints and non-Latter Day Saints should admire."},{"Title":"Studies of the Book of Mormon","review":"B. H. Roberts was one of the 26 general authorities of the Mormon Church from 1890 to 1933. He was appointed Church Historian and in his day was considered the most accurate and unbiased authority for early Mormon history and was regarded as a great defender of the faith. He was a thorough researcher and prolific writer. Among his many books was the seven volume &quot;Comprehensive History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.&quot; I consider his &quot;Studies of the Book of Mormon&quot; the most reliable and interesting backgound information on the Book of Mormon.Roberts wrote the material on his studies just a few years before his death but never published it. About 1985 his family finally released the manuscript for publication. He made an excellent study of the environment and source material available to Joseph Smith in the 1820's.Divided into three parts the first part of &quot;Studies of the Book of Mormon&quot; Roberts deals with his quandry in attempting to answer five questions which were asked by a Doctor who had read the Book of Mormon given to him by a friend. These questions were of archeological and linquistic nature and when his study could not provide adequate answers he wrote 141 pages to the general authorities of the Mormon Church presenting the problem. A two day meeting was held in the Salt Lake Temple to get their input and to ask for help from the Lord but no resolution was forthcoming. Shortly thereafter Roberts was called to preside over the Eastern States Mission.In the second section of &quot;Studies of the Book of Mormon&quot; Roberts gives a report of his research while traveling around the Eastern States visiting libraries looking for what was being published in the newspapers and books in the days of Joseph Smith. He found a book &quot;View of the Hebrews&quot; by a minister, Ethan Smith, published 8 years previous to the Book of Mormon. There are many parallels between the two books. One example is six chapters of Isaiah quoted in the Book of Mormon was previously used by Ethan as proof of his point that the American Indians were part of the lost 10 tribes of Israel. Ethan preached this idea in some of his sermons stating that we should treat the Indians as equals not as animals as was done by many in those days.Roberts found in the Manchester, NY newspaper of August 1823 where Joseph Smith's family lived that Ethan Smith was advertising his coming lecture and presentation of his book.Furthurmore, Roberts found that Oliver Cowdery, Joseph Smith's cousin and later scribe, lived in the same town where Ethan was minister and that Cowdery's Mother and Sister were members of his congregation. Cowdery also was a traveling book saleman in the summer time for the bookstore/publisher of &quot;View of the Hebrews.&quot;The last section of Roberts' &quot;Studies&quot; is a side by side column comparison of passages from the Book of Mormon and &quot;View of the Hebrews.&quot;Roberts' books have always been regarded as great source material but few Mormons are even aware of his last writing and invaluable source material. Having been an active Mormon myself I found this book very facinating, enlightening and well documented. I recommend it to all Mormons and Non-Mormons alike as a book which is well written, easy reading and will hold your interest."},{"Title":"Studies of the Book of Mormon","review":"This book should be a requirement for anyone studying the Book of Mormon. B.H. Roberts was the first Mormon apologist, President of the First Quorum of Seventies and Mormon Church Historian. B.H. Roberts was additionally recognized as the Mormon Church's most accomplished scriptorian of his day. Apostle Talmage gave Roberts five questions that had been asked by a member. B.H. Roberts researched the questions and went to the Twelve and First Presidency and said he could not give satisfactory answers to the questions. He asked for the Brethren to pray about the questions and get the answers from God. Each of the Brethren stood, bore their testimony of the Book of Mormon and the meeting was over. Roberts was then asked to come up with the best answers he could. These answers were given to the member who originally asked the questions.This started Roberts on the mission of proving or disproving the Book of Mormon. He reviewed the book for inconsistencies in technology, zoology and anthropology. He presents a study of the technology of steel, glass, the wheel, metal coins and other advances that were questionable. He also covered the problems with horses, elephants, oxen, cattle and other problems. He covered the linguistics and anthropological information available at the time in trying to reconcile an Israelite migration to North America. In all, his conclusions are consistent with the current scientific community. He proposed, and then rejected, what Mormons know today as the Limited Geography Theory. He then undertakes a review of Joseph Smith and the literature available to Joseph Smith and concludes that there are significant parallels to \\"View of the Hebrews\\" by Ethan Smith. He did not at the time have the information that Oliver Cowdrey's family were parishioners of Ethan Smith. He concluded that with the structure of \\"View of the Hebrews\\", the 1796 version of the King James Bible and Joseph Smith's imagination, he would have no trouble writing the book.The book is analytical in nature, reviewing all possible options. Mormon Apologists claim that this book was written so the Brethren would know the weaknesses of the Book of Mormon. If you read the book you can clearly see that this is not the case. Roberts was struggling and searching for ways to justify the inconsistencies found in the Book of Mormon. By the end of the study it is clear that he no longer has a testimony of the Book of Mormon. The book was not published for 60 years and finally released in 1985. The Mormon Church has had this information since 1930, but never released it. The problems discussed in this book are the same problems that Mormon apologists struggle with today. The answers that the apologists give are no more satisfactory today than they were at the time of B.H. Roberts.This book is a necessary read for any budding apologist. It is also a book that can be given to a believing Mormon, because it was written by a recognized General Authority. B.H. Roberts was the editor of the \\"Comprehensive History of the Church\\" and the \\"Mormon Doctrine of Deity.\\""},{"Title":"Studies of the Book of Mormon","review":"Back in 1979, while working as a manuscript cataloger in the Archives and Manuscript division of the Harold B. Lee Library, I first came across a copy of this manuscript. Someone had donated a photo-copy of the original and I had to evaluate and catalog it for the collection. I discovered that the library already had an excellent copy of the manuscript with associated documents and that the set was already cataloged and available for examination. Instead of tossing the second copy, my boss let me keep it.When \\"Brig\\" Madsen published this edition, I was a bit confused. I studied under Dr. Madsen for my BA in History at the U, and I generally liked his approach to Western Americana. Why then, I wondered, did he neglect to include B.H. Roberts' cover letter that accompanied the original manuscript? The cover letter states 1- that the manuscript is not complete and thus not ready for publication, 2- That Roberts is assuming a \\"Devil's Advocate\\" position and that the conclusions in the manuscript are not necessarily his own, 3- The manuscript represented what B.H. Roberts felt were the best arguments anti-Mormons could make against the Book of Mormon, therefore they had to be seriously considered so that Mormons could prepare accordingly.The relevance of this work today is really the most curious issue. At the time Roberts put this study together, most Mormons accepted the \\"continental model\\" of the Book of Mormon. The only Mormons who advocated a \\"limited geographical model\\" seemed to be limited to those who had actually created the \\"graphical models\\" based on the text of the Book of Mormon. Since 1984, when the _Ensign_ published several lengthy articles that advocated the \\"limited geographical model,\\" the continental model seems to be accepted by the fringe or by individuals who (strangely enough) don't even accept the Book of Mormon as anything but fiction.This realignment is significant to the relevance of this Study. Roberts' evidence pounds a stake directly into the heart of the continental model. Once you begin to restrict the geographical area into a small section, his primary arguments collapse.That leaves only the parallel, which was the weakest argument to begin with. Heck, I might as well draw similar parallels between Ben Hur and the Book of Mormon and argue that Lew Wallace drew on Joseph Smith for his little romance. Parallels like this could be significant if one of two things could be shown: 1- the paralleled item was unique only to the Book of Mormon and the View of the Hebrews or 2- the paralleled item could be shown to be unique to the early 19th Century. For over 50 years now, the Mormon apologetic literature has shown over and over and point by point that neither of these conditions hold. That means, since both works are addressing the same subject area, there is going to be a naturally occurring Venn Diagram overlap. Emphasis on the similarities ignores the much more significant differences occurring outside that Venn overlap. Because interest in View of the Hebrews was so high, and because the differences were so readily apparent, for many years the only place one could purchase a copy of \\"Views\\" was through BYU Press.I found the Study to be interesting, because it reveals the intellectual integrity of B.H. Roberts. And because I am aware of his post-Study actions, the Study demonstrates that Roberts compartmentalized his faith and the material he understood up to that time.While the LDS church concentrated on celebrating its centennial in 1930, B.H. Roberts (on his own) organized and celebrated in New York State a Book of Mormon centennial in 1929. I've read several oral histories of Mormon missionaries who were in the Eastern States Mission at the time and who observed Roberts and listened to him. His actions and statements don't come across as someone who had \\"lost their testimony\\" in the Book of Mormon. In 1926, B.H. Roberts authorized the 2nd Edition publication of New Witnesses for God. The 2nd and 3rd Volumes of that set contained Roberts' detailed analysis of the Book of Mormon. Again hardly the actions of a person who had lost his faith in the Book of Mormon. There is some evidence that as early as 1909, Roberts was toying with a \\"limited geography\\" view of the Book of Mormon (see New Witnesses For God 3:502 - 1909 edition). Since this Study was published, there have been many other published studies detailing Roberts public and private statements on the Book of Mormon.In conclusion, I think that the failure to include the cover letter and to include the entire context of Roberts public and private statements reflect poorly on the whole context of this document. However, I am pleased that the Study was published. I will read anything that B.H. Roberts writes. I hope all the other reviewers of this book feel the same."},{"Title":"Studies of the Book of Mormon","review":"B. H. Roberts critically analyzes questions from an inquirer regarding the Book of Mormon. This set is really a set of three studies into the book's difficulties and origins.The first &quot;Book of Mormon Difficulties&quot; involves difficulties in the diverse number of languages of the American Indians, the presence of various animals (e.g. horse, elephant) in historic times, the use of silk, and the presence of various metallic constructions (steel) not entirely apparent to have existed the New World. Roberts answers the questions as best as can be possible, with the major exception of the language problem which baffles his inquiry.The second and third pieces, &quot;Book of Mormon Studies&quot; and &quot;Parallel&quot;, examine the evidence relating the origin of the Mormon scripture to E. Smith's &quot;View of the Hebrews&quot;. This evidence is compelling, especially in the context of its presenter, an ardent defender of the Mormon faith. What is exemplary about Robert's presentation is his honesty in resolving his dilemmas and the manner in which he goes about his research. Far too often, a researcher will seek evidences to support his position, as is the cause of the numerous contradictory apologetics presented in christianity today. There are few researchers today who would even consider the remote possibility of an assailant's argument being correct, with a worthy attempt of discovery. Most simply disregard all arguments contrary to their belief system. The Roberts' studies are a refreshing source of inquiry in the field of religious discussion.I would recommend this book for Mormon and non-Mormon alike and would recommend further the discovery of other works which both contribute to the Book of Mormon difficulties and answer them.There are two sides of any argument, often neither is right. This motivates my own personal study in many areas, please respond to my email for further comments or further reading suggestions involving the Book of Mormon."},{"Title":"Studies of the Book of Mormon","review":"The agony that a fine academician and scholar such as B. H. Roberts must have endured is evident in this collection of his letters and essays. One can empathize with his struggles as he tries valiantly to reconcile his religious yearnings with the rigors of genuine inquiry. Ultimately, the book makes no sweeping conclusions as to B. H. Roberts's personal beliefs regarding the authenticity of the Book of Mormon. But, what is clear, is that he was deeply troubled by the preponderance of the evidence that comes down against it. The book is as much an exploration of the difficulties of maintaining intellectual integrity while trying to hold religious beliefs as it is a continuing source of serious challenge to the lofty claims made by the Book of Mormon itself."},{"Title":"Studies of the Book of Mormon","review":"Brigham H. Roberts was initially a devout Mormon. However, he was asked by an elder in his church to answer some questions about the veracity of the Book of Mormon that had been posed by a non-Mormon. To formulate a response, he made a study of the New World cultural and natural environment as it related to the Book of Mormon. That study was the beginning of a difficult examination of his own religious beliefs. Much of what he found about the New World and its natives did not square with the content of the Book of Mormon. He was also deeply troubled by many similarities he found between the Book of Mormon and Ethan Smith's View of the Hebrews which was published five years before the first publication of the the Mormon scripture. In his study, Roberts presents several parallels between the Book of Mormon and View of the Hebrews, showing that the Book of Mormon had literary ties to the early nineteenth century.Though this book presents a lot of interesting information, it was written during the early twentieth century, and much has developed since then. For a more up-to-date look at the beginnings of Mormonism, I might suggest reading David Persuitte's &quot;Joseph Smith and the Origins of The Book of Mormon.&quot; It goes into considerably more detail in showing the similarities between the Book of Mormon and View of the Hebrews and provides much additional information about the beginnings of Mormonism."},{"Title":"Studies of the Book of Mormon","review":"B.H.

He shows in the first half the many problems there are in proving the Book of Mormon to be historically correct. In the second half, he takes on the question, could Joseph Smith have used some other work to create the Book of Mormon? Roberts disscovers, that indeed he could have. The name of the work was &quot;A View of the Hebrews&quot; by Ethan Smith. Roberts goes through chapter by chapter of Ethan Smiths book to show the similarites between the two books. Then in the last part Roberts takes The Book of Mormon and A View of the Hebrews in two columns, side by side. He shows how the Book of Mormon could have been created using &quot;A View of the Hebrews.&quot;"},{"Title":"Studies of the Book of Mormon","review":"The Book has the making of a drama worthy of MI5 in the 1950's ; someone on the inside making a startling discovery and perusing old and forgotten manuscripts and coming to shocking questions that could upset the status quo. Unfortunately for Roberts and for the readers of this book there is less glamor than 1950's spycraft and more emphasis on old and forgotten books. What is fasinating is the depth of research and the amount of time is book obviously included. Regardless of how boring you may find the material, the book is an unpolished masterpiece and mounument of effort. Some may say that B. H. Roberts evidence is outdated, and certainly they are right. People will get stirred up whether the case has gotten better ( which it would appear to Roberts that it couldn't have gotten much worse), or whether the historical truthfulness of the Book of Mormon is looking better in face of the research decide for yourself, but read B.

I heartily recommend it to the entire staff of FARMS, particularly."},{"Title":"Studies of the Book of Mormon","review":"I enjoyed the book simply because it gave me a view (other than the typical pro-LDS view) into the mind of an old-time LDS general authority. Some thoughts:1) Several reviewers here and on other sites dwell on whether Roberts had become a semi-unbeliever later in life and they point to this book for discussion of that. Frankly, I don't think it matters whether he continued to believe or not, since his personal views on the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon don't make the book true or false.2) However, the book does show how roberts eventually got stumped (rough paraphrase of his own statements) by some critic's questions. He assumed that the LDS apostles, being inspired as he believed, would be able to get further light and knowledge from God to answer the questions. He presented his concerns to them and they gave what he stated were unsatisfying answers.3) I found this encounter interesting since this happens to lay members all the time. They develop questions, go to their leaders for answers, come away dissatisfied, read stuff by apologists, come away appalled at the lame answers and even dishonesty, then quit or just suffer with cognitive dissonance. It's interesting to read how a general authority went through this and got a similarly poor response.4) Some reviewers claim the material in the book is outdated. True to some extent, but much of it is just as valid today. The parallels between the Book of Mormon and View of the Hebrews are still as striking as ever. And with regard to archeology, etc, the case has continued to grow worse and worse for the LDS church. DNA, for example, has all but shut the lid on church claims, even with the limited geography theories."},{"Title":"Studies of the Book of Mormon","review":"Those who conclude that B.H. Roberts died a non-believer will be in for a bitter disappointment. It can be argued that this critique of Elder Roberts played a significant role in reevaluating the widely held and silly notion that the Book of Mormon is a history of the entire American continent, a view that has all but vanished among serious LDS scholars. As noted in an earlier review, much of Roberts' criticism topples once the \\"continent\\" view is ejected and a \\"limited geography\\" model is adopted. This makes Roberts' critique somewhat less than satisfying for the Book of Mormon's critics, yet it remains valuable to the historian as it reflects a step in the evolution of scholarly evaluation. In fact, now that the limited geography models are widely accepted, pieces of the Roberts' puzzle no longer fit. In short, the critique accomplished what it set out to do, and that is applying history, archeology, geography and culture to a land and peoples about which little is known. I suppose that critics will continue to wave this critique under the noses of believers, but if they try it with someone who knows better, they'll draw back a nub. The serious student will read John L. Sorenson and other Mesoamerican-based theories."},{"Title":"Studies of the Book of Mormon","review":"The introduction first starts by going over how B.H. Roberts is the smartest Mormon ever (pgs. xvi, xx, xxi among others), then goes into talking about B. H. Roberts being one of the dumbest people ever 9pgs xxiii, xxiv, xxvi among others). If he did write this book as his own opinions, I find the second one plausible. It should be noted though that many of the things he talks about were in light of the limited knowledge we had in the western world when he was alive. Everything in this book talking against the Book of Mormon is so easily dismissed, there is no way it could shake the faith of anyone that has actually taken the time to read the Book of Mormon or learn the facts about it.1. Linguistics (pgs 63-94) - Robert's couldn't have known what we know now about old world linguistics. He compares the language of the Book of Mormon to the language of the Native Americans, when he should be comparing the word on the small plates to those found in Jerusalem around the same time. We now know that the linguistics matches, but the large plates (Words of Mormon to Moroni) do not have anything to compare to, as those people were distanced by time and their race died out around 400 AD. Much of the rest of the ideas he shares are ideas about the Old World we now know to be false. In fact, many of the names in the small plates of the Book of Mormon, for example, are actual Hebrew or Egyptian words, which make sense seeing that Lehi and his family were well versed in both languages.2. Animals, weapons/metals etc found in the Book of Mormon not found in the Americas or even the ancient world (pgs 95-115) - Compared to Old World archeology, we only have 1% of the amount of data we could have on the New World. It is now known that the Americas did have horses, the ancients did know how to make iron earlier than expected, etc. There are many conclusions come to here with the idea that we know everything there is to know about the inhabitants of the Americas, which even now we do not.3. Where DID the native Americans come from? (pgs 116-143) - This is a question still debated by modern archeologists. While some came from the north, via the land bridge between Russia and Alaska, it is also clears that some came in from the south via ships. One small group of people lost to time will be harder to find in spite of the fact that we do know more now than we did when the author put these papers together.I could go on, but there is little point, those that are looking for the truth will find it and those that are looking for excuses will find those as well - on both sides of this issue. He goes on to talk about the book \\"View of the Hebrews\\" (of which I own a copy, please feel free to pick one up - it has nothing in common with the Book of Mormon) and other ideas that those that oppose the Book of Mormon might use to trick those that are not familiar with the facts.I really can't find one reason to recommend buying or reading this book. It is much like any book you can pick up trying to disprove the Bible, rubbish to the believer, proof for those fighting against it and pretty much worthless to those in the middle looking for actual facts."},{"Title":"Studies of the Book of Mormon","review":"I have quoted below what Roberts said about \\"View of the Hebrews,\\" and it is not at all clear that this was not his genuine belief. A couple other reviewers said that Roberts letter about playing \\"devils advocate\\" should have been included, and I agree.Nevertheless, these writers completely ignore the social pressure of Roberts many family and friends. If he had not backed off, he would have lost everything. I personally knew an aged professor who told me that he was an atheist. He had been on a mission decades before, and when he died, he had a Mormon funeral at a Mormon ward.I'm not making up this story, and in my own life, I could name at least fifteen people who do not believe a word of the Book of Mormon, but who are still on the roles because of social pressure--fear of hurting parents or other relatives, and fear of loosing friends.The pressure on a public figure like Roberts would have silenced him.

This book will force most who read it to retreat into complete mysticism with head deeply planted in the sand, or a complete reassessment of their religious faith. Not for the faint hearted or the seeker of comforting fables, nonetheless it is a work that every thinking Mormon will have to come to terms with sooner or later. I pray for church leaders with the courage to help us in this quest."},{"Title":"Studies of the Book of Mormon","review":"I also own the original hardcover release from the '80s and agree with another Amazon critic that Mr. Roberts' cover letter should be included in all releases. B.H. Roberts and James Talmage are my two favorite LDS authors. I'm a former LDS convert to Roman Catholicism. Still, LDS history is *my* history and I just can't get away from it.In this collection of letters and writings by Brigham Henry Roberts, we get a better story about a good man than criticisms about the Book of Mormon. Much of Mr. Roberts' observations with regard to American archaeology are sufficiently dated as to be only compelling because, at the time, they were novel and painful for a faithful LDS leader to bring up. His later personal investigation into the potential intellectual and literary seeds of the Book of Mormon through his examination of View of the Hebrews and other \\"common knowledge\\" circa 1830 were more interesting.Above all, the fearless, faithful B.H. Roberts continually exhorted his ecclesiastical superiors to examine their faith in the context of the issues he scratched at. He implored them to seek inspiration to get celestial answers for, especially, the \\"youth of the church.\\" He encourage them to enlist God to supply answers to what he considered to be troubling, yet ultimately answerable problems with the cornerstone of the LDS Church: The Book of Mormon and the claims of Joseph Smith."},{"Title":"Studies of the Book of Mormon","review":"This book exposes the fact that B.H. Roberts, an early 20th century LDS historian and Church leader, through scholarly research and analysis, thoughtfully questioned the origins of the Book of Mormon. He was disturbed enough by his findings that he approached the Brethren, i.e., the LDS Church President and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and finally received an audience. He spent most of 2 days explaining his issues with Book of Mormon geography, lack of anthropological support and most importantly, his theory that Joseph Smith appears to have plagiarized most of the Book's contents. He advocated that the Brethren should \\"frankly state events as they occurred, in full consideration of all related circumstances, [and] allow the line of condemnation or justification to fall where it may...\\"However, instead of genuinely considering his remarks, the Brethren sent Roberts to serve as the Mission President in the Eastern States Mission. There, although he publicly averred Mormonism, he privately researched additional primary source documents and Ethan Smith's \\"View of the Hebrews.\\" Roberts then wrote his treatise, \\"A Parallel,\\" showing the similarities between \\"View of the Hebrews\\" and the Book of Mormon. Upon his return from the East, Roberts requested another audience with then, LDS President Heber J. Grant. This was denied and it appears that Roberts' three scholarly works questioning the origins of this key Mormon scripture were most likely hidden from the faithful Mormon majority until his son, Ben E. Roberts, spoke to a private club about his father's writings in 1946.Eventually, B.H.Roberts' heirs donated his papers to the University of Utah. Even then, the University of Utah appears to have been reluctant to publish them; the First Edition of this book was originally published by the University of Utah Research Foundation. However, this second, Signature Books Edition, was \\"published by arrangement with the University of Illinois Press.\\"Both the forward by Sterling M. McMurrin and the editing by Brigham D. Madsen are indispensable previews to a full understanding of the importance of Robert's discoveries and the actions/inaction taken with regard to his insights. This book proves that Mormon Leaders have known for almost a century now, that Joseph Smith's work was not what he claimed. And yet Mormon Leaders have continued to misrepresent the origins of Mormonism as messages/histories from ancient American Continent prophets, written on gold plates, hidden in the Hill Cumorah and then translated by Joseph Smith. This is proof positive that the Brethren have engaged in deception toward their followers.Kay Burningham, AttorneyAuthor of \\"An American Fraud: One Lawyer's Case against Mormonism.\\""},{"Title":"Studies of the Book of Mormon","review":"Brigham Henry Roberts (1857-1933) was a Mormon leader, historian, and politician who published theA Comprehensive History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 6 Volume Set plus Index (Box Setas well as other books (such asThe Mormon Doctrine of Deity (Signature Mormon Classics, No 3.)). He was denied a seat as a member of United States Congress because of his practice of plural marriage.This book contains several of Roberts' \\"studies\\" relating to the Book of Mormon. Controversially, they discuss 19th century parallels with the Book of Mormon, and some of the historical difficulties of the book.Here are some quotations from the book:\\"...I shall be most earnestly alert upon the subject of Book of Mormon difficulties, hoping for the development of new knowledge... but I cannot be other than painfully conscious of the fact that our means of defense, should we be vigorously attacked along the lines of Mr. Couch's questions, are very inadequate.\\" (Pg. 50)\\"(T)here is no connection between the American languages and the language of any people of the Old World. New World languages appear to be indigenous to the New World.\\" (Pg. 91)\\"The question to be considered here, then is:... was (Joseph Smith) a person of sufficiently vivid and creative imagination as to produce such a work as the Book of Mormon from such materials? It will appear in what is to follow that such 'common knowledge' did exist in New England; that Joseph Smith was likely in contact with it; that one book, at least, with which he was most likely acquainted, could well have furnished structural outlines for the Book of Mormon; and that Joseph Smith was possessed of such creative imaginative powers as would make it quite within the lines of possibility that the Book of Mormon would have been produced in that way.\\" (Pg. 154)\\"Could it be that Ethan Smith ... was innocently followed into this error by the author of the Book of Mormon? For there is nothing on which the later investigators of our American antiquities are more unanimously agreed upon than that the matter of the absence of the knowledge of, and hence the non-use of, iron or steel among the natives of America.\\" (Pg. 198)\\"Can such numerous and startling points of resemblance (between the Book of Mormon and Ethan Smith'sView of the Hebrews 1825) and suggestive contact be merely coincidence?\\" (Pg. 242)\\"These evening recitals could come from no other source than the vivid, constructive imagination of Joseph Smith, a remarkable power which attended him through all his life.\\" (Pg. 244)\\"And under all the circumstances is it much to be wondered at if intelligent people to whom the Book of Mormon is presented for consideration, should ask: 'Do we have here a great historical document, or only a wonder tale, told by undeveloped mind... and is supposed to account for all inconsistencies and lapses that challenge human credulity in the thought and in the easy philosophy that all things are possible with God?'\\" (Pg. 258)"},{"Title":"Studies of the Book of Mormon","review":"The book contains a lot of details and facts concerning the Book of Mormon. It was written by a general authority, who did his own investigation of the book. Roberts finds that it is very unlikely that the Book of Mormon people ever existed. He found numerous parallels between the Book of Mormon and View of the Hebrews. He shows how it is very possible and most likely, that Joseph Smith plagiarized View of the Hebrews. In fact Roberts dedicates approximately 150 pages or about half of the book to the parallels between View of the Hebrews and the Book of Mormon. The last 22 pages of the book are a brief side by side view of his manuscript called A Parallel. Roberts tried to tell the Apostles of problems with the Book of Mormon and they refused to listen. This book is a real eye opener for a Mormon."},{"Title":"Studies of the Book of Mormon","review":"I have spent significant time and money researching Mormon history, taking into account both sides of the argument for and against. So naturally this book was an important purchase: B.H. \\"Defender of the Faith\\" Roberts was one the Church's earliest historians and apologists. His works cannot be ignored. He was also in the presidency of the Quorum of the Seventy (next in authority below the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles). In this volume he is presented with 5 questions in regards to the Book of Mormon that he struggles to come up with satisfactory responses to. He presents this to the Church's leaders in hope of a positive outcome but only receives assurances that the Church is true. As a result he produces this Book of Mormon \\"study\\" in hope of presenting to the Church leadership arguments against the Book of Mormon that the youth of the church may come across and need answers to. He realises the response from them could be to simply ignore the issues raised, but regardless, he hopes for a proactive official response from the Church. Realising the former was more likely, and being involved in other matters, he never ended up presenting his study to the Church.The book begins with correspondence between BH Roberts and those above him in the Church hierarchy. This was the most 'enjoyable' section to read. It then moves onto the actual \\"study\\" where BH Roberts draws comparisons between 'The Book of Mormon' and Ethan Smith's 'View of the Hebrews'. This section is extremely comprehensive. Finally the final section is a brief summary of that same study with a side by side comparison of some of his main arguments.I have to say up front that I found the main body of the \\"study\\" to be extremely boring and repetitive. The same argument is made over and over to the point I often thought my bookmark had fallen out and I was resuming my reading from a few pages back. As a result, of all the books I have read recently on Church History (for and against), this would have to be the hardest one for me to get through. I just found it very boring and repetitive.Nevertheless, BH Roberts presents some good arguments in his case against the Book of Mormon, but those few pearls were buried too deep for me to rate the book a must have. My favourite is his commentary on 2 Nephi 5, where Nephi takes his righteous followers and separates from the Lamanites to start his own civilisation. There were at most about 100 in number, consisting of elderly, women & children. One of the first things they do is build a temple \\"after the manner of the temple of Solomon.\\" He goes into detail how much effort (over a hundred thousand workers), time (7 years) & materials it took to build Solomon's temple, and here, this group of 100 people or less (I have read an account where this maximum was estimated to be 34), are trying to survive in unchartered countryside, go ahead and build a temple of like magnitude. It would be like watching an episode of LOST and seeing that small group of survivors living in crude shelters and while coping with just trying to survive, also gathering food for their families, mining for precious metals, refining them, fighting off any enemy attacks, all of this, at the same time building a magnificent stone cathedral, using \\"wood, iron, copper, brass, steel, gold, silver, and other precious metals\\". I've read the Book of Mormon many times, and have never picked up on this point.Overall, this is an important book and it sits on my bookshelf along with many others dealing with Church history. This book indeed raises some thought provoking arguments, and I'm still a believer. But unfortunately, its style and repetitiveness precludes me from highly recommending it."},{"Title":"Studies of the Book of Mormon","review":"I was struck by the pathos Mr. Roberts must have felt when his studies led him to (apparently) conclude that Joseph Smith was a very imaginative fraud and that the Book of Mormon was fiction, and then finding the Church presidency seemingly not able to or not willing to comprehend and appreciate his findings. Imagine the sadness in knowing such an important (to Church members) finding and trying to discuss it with the people who most needed to know and who could possibly offer alternative explanations and then finding such seemingly ignorant and indifferent responses. A very sad ending to a distinguished career.Mr. Roberts certainly has done his homework, with meticulous research and detail, in keeping with his accomplishments on previous works. A most interesting book."},{"Title":"Studies of the Book of Mormon","review":"This book is written by B. H. Roberts a general authority for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and the church historian back in the 1920's and 30's. He was given the assignment to answer some questions concerning the Book of Mormon. This he attempts to do in the most fair and scientific way possible. In the process he finds a book, \\"View of the Hebrews\\", which has a large amount of similarities to the Book of Mormon. He develops a hypothesis that Joseph Smith used this book to base his book on and then tries to find what supporting or not supporting evidence there is to back up the hypothesis. This is a must read for anyone who wishes to learn more about the writing of the Book of Mormon or to understand Joseph Smith better."},{"Title":"Studies of the Book of Mormon","review":"This is an interesting book, but it isn't a particularly powerful argument against the Book of Mormon. (Studies of the subject have progressed immensely since the 1920s, when serious Mormon scholarship was virtually non-existent, and many of Roberts's statements are now obsolete.) It is emphatically not a statement of B. H. Roberts's personal stance. I once thought that it might be just that, but subsequent study has convinced me that it cannot be taken in that way. B. H. Roberts was nothing if not outspoken. He was constantly in hot water with the First Presidency over various statements. Yet he &quot;bore his testimony&quot; of the Book of Mormon, in print and vocally, right through his last illness to within days of his death. In his only-recently published book &quot;The Truth, the Way, the Life,&quot; Roberts always refers to the Book of Mormon peoples and prophets as ancient. He gives their dates. Yet this book remained unpublished for decades after his death because he refused to change certain statements that leaders of the Church objected to. Hiding his real thoughts was not in B. H. Roberts's nature. Why, if he had come to see the Book of Mormon as fictional and its people as mythical, would he have been so careful to give their dates, etc.? The evidence is simply not there to substantiate the claim that Roberts had surrendered his belief in the historicity of the Book of Mormon. In fact, he was careful to state, in connection with the &quot;Book of Mormon studies&quot; that he had done, that they did not represent his own position. (Why do critics and many others routinely ignore that explicit statement?) He expressly said, in one letter, that his testimony of the Book of Mormon was &quot;not only unshaken, but unshakable.&quot;"},{"Title":"Adventures in Odyssey: The Complete Collection","review":"Want you kids to learn good things when watching a DVD, this series is for you.

When I received this book, I was surprised how far I had gotten without it (to the point where I had to find the notebook). The book gave me all the hints I needed to solve the game, and I didn't even need to look at the chapter &quot;All Revealed&quot;. The book has the following chapters: characters, equipment, navigation, Fictional Walkthrough, Hints and Tips, History, World of If (a look at the possibility of time travel), Glossary of Nautical Terms, Hints and Tips-All Revealed, Puzzle Solutions, and appendixes. It also includes screen photos. It is not just a guide for solving a game, but a nice little historical and scientific study as well. My advice is to try the game without any help until you reach a point when you do not know what to do next and are just wandering around (sometimes talking with characters, especially Penny Pringle, can help you figure out your next move). Once you reach that point, consult the Hints and Tips chapter so you can move onto the next stage. Only consult the &quot;All Revealed&quot; chapter as a last resort (as I mentioned before, I didn't need that chapter to solve the game). Someone asked about the doll in Sasha's room.

The copyright page notes that the main text was originally published as \\"Geronimo's Story of His Life\\" in 1906.The revised edition includes the 1906 preface by Barrett; a 33 page introduction by Turner; a \\"Note on the Text,\\" which describes the genesis of the book; a map, \\"Apache Country, 1865-1886\\"; a bibliography; and a generous collection of photographs showing both Geronimo at various stages in his life, and other people of his times. Barrett's introduction tells how the text was delivered orally by Geronimo, and how translator Asa Daklugie helped Barrett turn it into book form. Indeed, in his introduction Turner notes that Geronimo's story is \\"a preliterate and essentially a prewhite narrative.\\" Altogether the text and supplemental features are about 200 pages long.Geronimo's fascinating story begins with an Apache creation myth. He discusses his early life, his family, his battles against the Mexicans, his conflict with United States forces, and his life as a prisoner-of-war under U.S. military control. I was especially interested by his descriptions of the military tactics he used. Geronimo also discusses Apache life: religion, hunting, cultural taboos, etc. The book includes some really remarkable accounts, such as Geronimo's visit to the St. Louis World's Fair. The text is quite poignant when Geronimo reflects upon his hope for the survival of his people and their culture.I would recommend this book to all who are interested in Native American studies, 19th century American history, military autobiography, and the relationship between oral and written literature. But above all, this book is an encounter with an extraordinary human being whose voice remains passionate and compelling after all these decades."},{"Title":"Geronimo : his own story","review":"Geronimo: His Own Story is an endlessly fascinating autobiography that belongs in the pantheon of other great American works of autobiography and memoir. This book should take its place alonside other great works of personal non-fiction such as The Autobiography of Malcom X, A Moveable Feast, The Autobiography of Mark Twain, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, and (arguably the best of the bunch) The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. This is a strong statement, but after reading this short autobiography it's at least an idea that should be entertained. I found things in this book that I was not expecting, and it ended up being a far more complex and intriguing portrait of Geronimo than I had previously entertained. The most fascinating side of Geronimo that comes across in these two-hundred pages is not Geronimo the warrior but Geronimo the diplomat.S. M. Barrett's introduction tells us that after Geronimo finished what he wanted to say he would not take questions or add anything more, but merely stated \\"\`Write what I have spoken.'\\" These are the actions of a man who has a very specific purpose he is pursuing. After reading Geronimo's story I believe his purpose in publishing his tale was to accomplish in peace what he was unable to in war--he wanted to deliver his people back to Arizona.Geronimo dedicates his story to Theodore Roosevelt, because, in his words, he \\"knows I speak the truth;...he is fair minded and will cause my people to receive justice in the future; and because he is chief of a great people.\\" Even before his story has started Geronimo strikes a cordial tone. Not only are Geronimo's words flowing with accolades, but they are also giving Roosevelt something to live up to. By stating that Roosevelt is \\"fair minded and will cause my people to receive justice in the future\\" he is almost challenging Roosevelt to live up to this description.Much of the fighting in Geronimo occurs between the Apache's and the Mexicans. Geronimo doesn't try and hide his feelings about the Mexicans, stating not only that he as \\"no love for the Mexicans,\\" but also that if he was younger, \\"and followed the warpath,\\" he would \\"lead into Old Mexico.\\" In fact, his battles with the Mexicans take up a slight majority of the book. He does not make any similarly broad statements when speaking about Americans. Whenever Geronimo criticizes American policy he makes certain that he focuses his criticism on the officer in charge rather than American policy as a whole. Geronimo realizes that merely lashing out at an unfair, but time honored, practice of breaking U.S. treaties would alienate his audience and hurt his cause.The rhetorical technique Geronimo uses in telling his story is rather matter of fact. This is in stark contrast to some of the more melodramatic works that were popular around the turn of the century. Certainly this highlights a difference in two cultures, but it is also indicative of how Geronimo goes about trying to achieve his goal. Instead of histrionically telling his story he presents it in what seems to be an objective and reasonable voice. When Geronimo gave himself up to the U.S. Army one of the conditions was that his band of Apaches would be sent to Florida with the rest of their families. When the U.S. breaks this condition Geronimo flatly states that this \\"treatment was in direct violation of our treaty made at Skeleton Canon.\\" He lets the action speak for itself. If he railed against the injustice committed then he would have turned off a mostly white audience. After all, it was their government who was responsible for breaking the treaty.I won't make this into a thesis (although I probably could). Geronimo: His Own Story is a wonderful portrait of one of American History's most courageous heroes. In the book I was surprised to find out just as much about Geronimo the diplomat as I did about Geronimo the warrior. I'll end this with Geronimo's words: \\"There is no climate or soil which, to my mind, is equal to that of Arizona. We could have plenty of good cultivating land, plenty of grass, plenty of timber and plenty of minerals in that land which the Almighty created for the Apaches. It is my land, my home, my fathers' land, to which I now ask to be allowed to return. I want to spend my last days there, and be buried among those mountains. If this could be I might die in peace, feeling that my people , placed in their native homes, would increase in numbers, rather than diminish as at present, and that our name would not become extinct.\\""},{"Title":"Geronimo : his own story","review":"No greater story can be told about Geromino than one told by the man himself. Not only do we gain insight to this famous figure in history, but we also get an in-depth account of Apache life and philosophy. There are many books that describe the Apache lifestyle, but it is rare to come across a first person account. Learn about Geronimo's ancestry, how he got his name, and the many wars he waged on the Mexicans. Read about life on the reservation and if the U.S. government upheld their end of the bargain. I definitely recommend this book to any lover of Native American history"},{"Title":"Geronimo : his own story","review":"This was a pretty good book and a fast read. The book has an introduction with some history about the Apache conflict and then goes into the part that is Geronimos own words, translated in the early 1900's. The book does point out places in the text that are disputed as being the words of Geronimo. He talks about things that happened to him as a child and as a young man.However some things that are discussed in detail in traditional history books are barely mentioned here. There are some good pictures in the book. It's very interesting to hear it from his point of view, but I would also recommend other sources to get the complete story from both sides. I would compare the way the text reads to the book &quot;Black Elk Speaks&quot;."},{"Title":"Geronimo : his own story","review":"Geronimo! The kids' saying I used in the 1960's just before I launched a dirt clod against my neighborhood enemy hidden behind the garbage can. This book puts Geronimo in perspective, an Apache Indian from the southwest, that spanned the traditional indian culture of the first half of the 1800s to the pre-modern white world of the early 1900s and the 1904 World's Fair in St. Lious. Geronimo gives his side of the story to S.M. Barrett, a Superintendent of Schools while he (Geronimo) was a &#34;prisoner of war&#34; on the Fort Sill Indian Reservation in Oklahoma 1905-1906.Geronimo presents his story, laid out by topic: Origin of the Apache Indians, Early Life, The Mexicans, Raids That Were Successful, Heavy Fighting, Coming Of The White Men, Greatest of Wrongs, Removals, Prison And On The Warpath, The Final Struggle, Surrender of Geronimo and A Prisoner of War. Each brief chapter tells a vivid and honest picture of Geronimo's life through his own eyes, clearly documented by Mr. Barrett.Geronimo's story describes the life of an Apache Indian warrior and chief, as the traditional Indian culture is smothered, as the American and Mexican cultures envelope and then quickly swallow many of the ancient ways of the past.The 20 or so photographs in this book are excellent, they include portraits of Geronimo, his family, and friends."},{"Title":"Geronimo : his own story","review":"This book deserves its own rating system: A great man from a culture that does not have the written word has dictated a fine autobiography that preserves a time and way of life that are gone forever. For this book you can throw out all the usual criteria regarding sophisticated paragraphing, footnoting/end noting, hyperbole, etc. \\"Geronimo: His Own Story\\" easily merits five stars. It is not merely writing about historical events; it is an historical event."},{"Title":"Geronimo : his own story","review":"I really, really enjoyed reading this book. Although I am not particularly fascinated by our aborginal American brethren, I do feel sorry for their plight at the hands of my ancestors and find myself in awe of those such as Geronimo who attempted to fight back against the inexorable tide of foreign inmigration to Indian lands. As the American Indian did not have a written language (excepting the Cherokee, late in their history) it is nigh on impossible to observe the situation between the White man and the Indian from the Indian's perspective. Thus it is almost like manna from heaven that one prescient being, in the form of S.M. Barrett, prevailed upon Geronimo to recount anything at all about his life story. This book is disappointingly short because Barrett approached Geronimo toward the end of his life, and because the Indian chief deigned to tell his story on his own terms, in his own way, and only once each time that he began to speak. Still, what little information Geronimo was willing to impart is vital and spell-binding and utterly fascinating. Interspersed amongst Geronimo's bits and snippets of incidents in his life and descriptions of Apache cosmography and social structure is background information from the author and editor which help to place the story in the context of the White man's historical account of the Apache wars. Obviously, such a short and unstructured narrative is wholly inadequate to illuminate a great man's life, but it still allows one to begin to form an opinion about a man who has by now become a legendary chapter in the story of the conquest of the American West. An especially nice aspect of this book is the dozen or so photographs of Geronimo and members of his extended family."},{"Title":"Geronimo : his own story","review":"Mr. Barrett interviewed Geronimo after several years of his captivity and this is his version of what happened in the Apache Wars. Definately an interesting read and a great story. Not what you should read if interested in a complete history of the Apache Wars and the part Geronimo had, but still worthwhile as it tells it from his prespective in his old age."},{"Title":"Geronimo : his own story","review":"Good book, nice to hear the true story from the character himself, especially in great detail, would definitely recommend for anyone interested in American Indian history"},{"Title":"Geronimo : his own story","review":"The book provides a much need perspective form the Apache point of view.

It brings sympathy and empathy for a flawed but great man to the serious reader. Written from \\"The Victim's\\" own perspective, this book is an essential read for anyone who cares about a balanced evaluation of the sad plight, (then and now) of our true Native Americans.

I knew Geronimo was a great warrior, but did not realize that the part of his life when he was free, was almost dedicated to war - even before the white man came on the scene.

I was impressed that basically until then, it did not seem to occur to the Apaches that anyone would be dishonest. It was great to read his story in his own words."},{"Title":"Geronimo : his own story","review":"This is an important book for anyone studying the history of the Geronimo Campaigns. Although Geronimo's words are often selfserving and he glosses over the horrible things he did, it is important to understand how he saw the world and his place in it. In those instances where he described the details of historic events that didn't have to do with his personal image, he sheds interesting light on matters that are often confused in other historical accounts. An example is the credit he gives to Lawton and his scouts for wearing him down as opposed to the credit that is often now given to Gatewood for actually talking him into meeting with General Miles. Although, perhaps the most interesting portion of the book was Geronimo's description of his experiences at the World Fair in St. Louis. It is fascinating to read. Although the book is scanty in detail and leaves the reader wishing Geronimo had been more long winded, it is a critical read for those wishing to understand the mind of the last great Indian warrior to surrender."},{"Title":"Geronimo : his own story","review":"This version of Geronimo's autobiography includes a 33 page introduction by Frederick Turner. The introduction nothing more than an insight into Mr. Turner's personal prejudices. I can only assume that someone with such strong biases will be unable to prevent them from affecting his editing. My interest was in reading Geronimo's words and not after they have been filtered by someone with an obvious agenda. I am a student of History and not, of the history of political correctness. I will now have to read the original text without Mr. Turner's censorship."},{"Title":"Geronimo : his own story","review":"I own the Kindle edition of this book, and haven't investigated any other version. There is no copyright information in the book. It contains some nearly useless front matter, and then the Geronimo narrative, lifted (apparently) verbatim from his actual autobiography entitledGeronimo: His Own Story: The Autobiography of a Great Patriot Warrior, available in several editions (including Kindle) from Amazon. That book contains over 40 more pages, including some excellent introductory material and a brief history of the era about which Geronimo speaks. I highly recommend that you consider purchasing that book, even though it is quite a bit more expensive.In addition, the Kindle edition of this book is so poorly scanned that it contains page numbers and other garbage embedded throughout the text, including (apparently) captions for pictures that have been deleted.

Apaches do not waste words, generally. G. didn't. G. was facing ethnic cleansing, for much of his life. His entire family was killed, twice, each time by troops of a sovereign nation. That would ruin anybody's day. He wasnt really a chief, he was more of a spiritual leader, who made some staggering mistakes early on, and learned from them. G. is not speaking to the romance novel, gossip magazine crowd. He is simply speaking. Have a look atJourney to the Ancestral Self: The Native Lifeway Guide to Living in Harmony with the Earth Mother (Bk.1), andInitiation: Boys Are Born, Men Are Trained: My Journey with an Apache Medicine Man, and maybeGrandfather, if you want to understand something of this guy's culture.

Most of today's modern families will not be able to relate very well to the family, because in addition to being wealthy, they seem insular and out of touch with the rest of the world. Because of Rex's traditional upbringing, it's hard to understand why he chooses to marry Florimel, although once he brings Florrie home, the fun begins.While Florrie is intended as an entirely selfish and scheming character, nonetheless I found myself laughing aloud at some of her actions, including a wanton dance in front of the family's horried friends. The book also contains several mentions of her black eyes &quot;snapping&quot; as she spoke, and I'm still unsure how eyes can snap! The depiction of Florrie does not stand up well over time, because today's reader will just find her ridiculous rather than menacing.It's also hard to feel sorry for Rex after he thoughtlessly brought Florrie home, especially considering that he was young and had no way to provide for her. However, I did feel sympathy for the mother and her despair over her son's marriage (which in those times would normally be a lifelong commitment) to someone who doesn't fit in the family at all.The writing itself is fine, even if the plot is uneven. As mentioned before, though, the ending is puzzling since, while it takes care of the immediate problem, it doesn't account for the sins/laws that were unwittingly broken as a result. Worst of all, nobody in the family seems to learn anything from the experience, unless perhaps Rex learns not to marry any more hussies he finds on the street. For a supposedly Christian book, it doesn't really embody Christian love or wisdom, but it is enjoyable as a timepiece.For a much more thoughtful and edifying Grace Livingston Hill book, I recommend &quot;Blue Ruin&quot;."},{"Title":"STRANGER WITHIN THE GATES","review":"I agree this is a little atypical for Grace, but thats not a bad thing!

Reluctantly, Phelan agrees because he pictures a mouse that would never warm his bed and demand a commitment.When Erin and her twin Nolan arrive from America, Phelan is stunned that Con thinks she is a wallflower.

What Erin doesn't know is that Con and Aisling have known each other longer than *she* and Con have known each other, but Con, for reasons never really made clear, never told Erin about Aisling. Meanwhile, Con has set up Phelan McDermott to distract his &quot;nerdy and shy&quot; friend Erin. Phelan, for his own deep, dark reasons, does not want to get close to Erin. And the plot thickens...OK. There's the basic story. The characters were pretty enjoyable and the bare bones of the story were plausible, but there are enough small holes in this plot to collapse the Hoover Dam (maybe I exaggerate a little, but small holes in the logic drive me bonkers!). First of all, if Erin and Con are so close, *why* doesn't Con ever mention Aisling to Erin? Erin's brother, Nolan, has known all along. Con's parents, who appear to regard Erin as their own daughter, never tell her either. And this is over an 18-year period -- never once is Aisling brought up! Secondly, when he saw Erin so determined to stop Con's wedding, *why* didn't Nolan, her &quot;close and caring&quot; twin, say anything? Finally, if Con and Erin are so close, *why* does Con think she is shy, when it is made extremely clear that she is not?I would also like to know what &quot;nerdy&quot; means in Kate Freiman's mind. The adjective brings to mind the stereotypical glasses, pocket protector, no-sun-exposure skin image for me -- in this story, we have three &quot;nerdy&quot; people, Erin who is beautiful, her twin Nolan who is as handsome as his sister is beautiful, and athletic to boot, and Con, who is never described as handsome, but you get the impression he is, and *he* is also active and athletic! If only all &quot;nerds&quot; could be so lucky....these three aren't nerds. They're intelligent people who have trouble relating to others, but they are definitely not &quot;nerds.&quot;Despite all of this, I still enjoyed IRISH MOONLIGHT. The secondary characters are very sympathetic, and Phelan is one of these wish-they-really-existed heroes (apart from seeming a little full of himself at times, that is!). The sense of connection between Erin and Phelan is very real -- this love story is believable in spite of its holes.Unlike some other books I've read, I do no regret spending my money on Kate Freiman's charming tale."},{"Title":"The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines","review":"This is an unprecedented work of scholarly insight, a must have for anyone interested in Isma'ilism although you never really read this sort of work from cover to cover, it's useful to dip in, on every issue.The history covers the development of Shiism...right through to Ismailism to the modern day...that's 1400yrs of development and history not too mention all the branchs and movemnets that split off and their current status.I can't praise this book enough. One issue though is regarding the modern Bohra's (Mustalian Tayyibi's), I would recommend Jonah Blanks \\"Mullahs on the Mainframe\\" to understand them in the modern period; as Daftary used too much information from the Bohra reformers in regards to that branch of the Isma'ilis...however an excellent work all round. if you haven't dipped in here you are missing out."},{"Title":"The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines","review":"This extensive work covers about 1400 years of history and provides a great deal of insight into political and religious pressures which both join and split Muslims throughout their history. The notes are extensive, and the research is quite obviously tremendous. The work is a bit dry and I found it tedious at points, which is why I give only four stars, but perhaps a good solid four and a half would be a better evaluation. For myself, I was especially intrigued by the treatment of Hasan-I Sabbah. Seperating the legend from the real man proved fascinating to me. Although I might enjoy the myth more, the bearing out of the facts provides good foundation for taking a revisionist point of view. For anyone interested in Shia Islam and/or the Isma'ilis, this book is essential. Beyond this possibly limited audience, I would also recommend it to anyone with more general interests in Islam and the sorting out of what can be deduced historically from existent writings. Further, I would also recommend this work to anyone interested in political movements in general, as the historical accounts provide valuable insight into formation and disintegration of both mass and fringe movements. For the real scholar, I would say this book is probably a five star treasure, but for the merely curious like myself, well, like I said, it's a tough read."},{"Title":"The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines","review":"This is an excellent work on the Ismailis--one of the primary branches of Shia Islam, that is nearly unknown to the other Muslims, let alone the rest of the world. The world is very very detailed and thus requires meticulous and detailed reading. However, the rewards are tremendous. The author has written other works on the Ismailis, but this one that is seemingly based on his doctoral dissertation, is the most detailed and systematic.I most highly recommend this book, realizing how detailed and systematic it is, but also for its very affordable price. It is must.The only thing that is desired for improvement is a detailed and accurate count of Ismailis AND their specific location in various countries in the Old World. Some of this is available in the author's other (and far less detailed) works, but not in this one."},{"Title":"The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines","review":"The most detailed book on Isma'ilis - the best unbiased, factual and complete book on Isma'ilis out there."},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"I first discovered T. Jefferson Parker in Silent Joe, a carefully crafted and intriguing story with a twist. Joe, a sweet man with a damaged face, is one of Parker's great heroes. Naughton, in Where Serpents Lie, is another. He's a self-acknowledged flawed character who lives with regret and sorrow and deception while struggling to do his job as head of the Crimes Against Youth division of the Orange County Sheriff's Office. I liked him immensely, perhaps because he is flawed enough to be real. The crimes against children which he investigates make your hair stand on end, partly because you know they really happen. But Parker appears to have done his research and presents the cases and circumstances with compassion while creating a villain who is both monstrous and yet sympathetic. This is an exciting if long read, maybe a trifle overwritten. The novel contains one glaring error that no other reviewer has commented on, so I will. After Naughton sees photos of himself that he knows are doctored, he goes to a friend and asks the friend to doctor some photos himself, of a woman bathing a child, a woman and child who have never actually met. Apparently, Naughton means to use this doctored photo as proof that the photos which resulted in his suspension from CAY were also doctored. As readers we get on board with this idea and wait to see what happens. But we wait in vain, for this entire plot line and the requested doctored photo is never heard of again. The photo never materializes and the friend is never again mentioned. It's an editor's job to catch these things so I blame him or her more than Parker himself for this big ooops. Other than that, Serpent is another winner in the Parker ouevre. I put Parker in the company of Dennis Lehane, James W. Hall, and Carl Hiassen--all gifted writers and good storytellers."},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"This is a big chunk of a book: 557 pages of thick type, a Stephen King-length piece of modern fiction reading. But &quot;Where Serpents Lie,&quot; while following a well-worn path of sociopath criminal novels (&quot;Red Dragon&quot; comes immediately to mind), moves quickly and is very exciting. The reader is spared wordy digressions, long explanations of the obvious. One-dimensional supporting characters also are kept at a minimum. A notable virtue is the author's careful avoidance of excess gore: the book's not an exercise in can-you-top-this gruesomeness. It shows restraint. And yet that does not detract from its power. In fact, the truly awful crimes are hinted at, they are threatened, looming like a distant but approaching summer thunderstorm, with the beginnings of a corkscrew tornado cloud descending. The most disturbing undertone may lie in the protaginist's psyche. A detective leading the investigation of a potential child killer, he's recovering from the death of his own son, in a seeming accident, although the details of that aren't revealed until the shattering final chapters. Indeed, that mystery is the greatest, as the &quot;Horridus&quot; storyline is strictly paint-by-numbers. Thrown in, to great effect, is the possibility that the policeman might have some truly pervese instincts himself. You never are given so much information that you can judge, 'til the smoke clears at the end. Mr. Parker's language is as clear as a reporter's, and he does not insult the reader's intelligence, clearly the biggest fault of most popular crime fiction. I'll be picking up more of his books to see if he's the real thing. With a few more plot twists and refractions on the central storyline, &quot;Where Serpents Lie&quot; could have been a classic. As it is, great potential is the verdict."},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"T. Jefferson Parker is by far my favorite writer and, as such, I am extremely humbled and happy to write this review. I hope I can do him credit. This book was originally published in 1998. when I first read it. Then when Amazon offered it at a very low price as an ebook, I ordered it and reread it. Mr. Parker writes in a such a flowing, descriptive style that the scenes unfold before like you like watching a movie. The reader becomes so engaged in the characters; their motives, emotions, circumstances, that it becomes very difficult to to stop reading. The antagonist is a vile monster who kidnaps children from their beds as they sleep. The protagonist works with a sheriffs department in the Crimes Against Youth and has his personal reasons to pursue the villain. It is a compelling often brutal novel but is so skillfully written that is difficult to put down. A really terrific read."},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"What makes T. Jefferson Parker's novels so great are the way that they paint a picture in your head on how twisted people can become.While being a regular detective/mystery thriller novel, this one leads a little to the darker things in life and some very strange and bizzarre rituals that the 'baddie' involves us in.Also there are a few sub plots to the book that really display great character development. There are a few instances of real page turners where you the author shocks you and your jaw drops.What stops this from 5 stars is a slightly 'hokey' climax, and a very quick resloution to one of the sub-plots, but on the whole a very eerie, bordering on supernatural thriller."},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"After a tragedy devastates his own family, Terry Naughton helps create the Crimes Against Youth division of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. Now, as head of the unit, Terry leads the hunt for a disturbing pedophile known as The Horridus. At the same time, Terry is attempting to bring some order into his own haunted and messy personal life.Not surprisingly, The Horridus was himself the victim of sexual abuse as a child and he dreams of being reborn as a snake. (His namesake, the Crotalus horridus is a Timber Rattlesnake.) The Horridus keeps a large collection of reptiles and has fed at least a couple of his victims to one of his larger pets.In the midst of the investigation, Terry Naughton is accused of being a pedophile himself, and the evidence against him seems incontrovertible. Naughton is charged, jailed, and then released on bail, pending trial. Although ordered away from the investigation, he cannot let it go and becomes entangled in an increasingly complex and scary effort to clear his own name and at the same time track down a particularly menacing killer who is about to strike again.This book appeared four years before Parker exploded into prominence with his breakout book, \\"Silent Joe.\\" Good as it is, it is not the equal of that book or of Parker's subsequent work. But then again, few books are, and for those readers who enjoy watching a great writer rounding into form, \\"Where Serpents Lie\\" will well reward the time spent reading it."},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"T. Jefferson Parker's &quot;Where Serpents Lie&quot; is a thriller that treads on dangerous ground. The story begins with Terry Naughton, head of Orange County's Crimes Against Youth unit, working undercover at the home of two parents who prostitute their young daughter to pedophiles. Later, Naughton finds himself on the trail of a man known as Horridus, a predator who has abducted two young girls only to release them unharmed and unmolested. Naughton's great fear is that Horridus's behavior will escalate to sexual abuse or murder--or both.Chasing a criminal such as Horridus would seem to be difficult enough, but Naughton has enough baggage to make the task almost impossible. An alcoholic who feels responsible for his son's death, Naughton suffers blackouts, has troubles with monogamy, and has enemies within his department.The &quot;dangerous ground&quot; I mentioned at the start is naturally the subject matter. It is one thing to write of a serial killer (which is not to say that Parker does that here), but it is quite another thing when the victims are children. Mystery authors often report that one thing readers will not tolerate is the killing of animals. Graphic violence against children, then, should be worse. It would be inappropriate to disclose what happens to the Horridus's subsequent victims, but I will report that Parker manages to keep the violence against children mostly off-page.&quot;Where Serpents Lie&quot; is a competently written thriller that offers little new. The Horridus, while appropriately creepy, seems to be a bit too much of a cartoon. At the same time, Naughton is far from sympathetic. As a result, the book reads like a well-crafted and well-researched thriller, albeit one without significant emotional pull. It distracts, but it does not engross."},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"While the storyteller does an excellent job of weaving 2 seperate plots, he leaves out one important factor. The villian wasn't scary. The villian has to be like a horrible car accident. While it makes your insides shudder and crawl, you still can't look away. All the reviews for this book compare the villian, Horridus, to Hannibal the Cannibal. Not even close. Looking into Hannibal's soul was like looking into a snakes eyes. You are completly mesmorized and cannot look away, even when you know the danger that lurks within them. Don't get me wrong it was a good read but it won't keep you up at night."},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"Parker captures the attention of the reader from page one and does not release you until the end of the book--which ends all too soon for the entralled reader. Naughton is a believable non-hero with a lot of problems and a lot of good in him, too. I cheered for his triumphs, cried over his defeats and read the whole book in less than 24 hours. You must have this book!!!"},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"This was the first book by T. Jefferson Parker that I have read and it was a stunner. An ingenious plot with twists and turns that kept you guessing and intrigued. Character development was excellent - I sympathized or detested almost everyone in the book. I was a little disappointed with the climax regarding the Horridus, but this is minor. One sub-plot involving Terry Naughton's son is wrapped in the final pages and my jaw dropped. This book is generally an easy read, but enthralling. Grab it and devour it!"},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"It's been well over ten years since I read T. Jefferson Parker's LAGUNA HEAT. I remember that it was a good book. For whatever reason, I didn't follow up on Mr. Parker's other works as he continued to write. That was my mistake! Thankfully, I've rediscovered him. I just finished WHERE SERPENTS LIE and though the novel was written over two years ago, I have to place it on my list of best books that I've read so far in the new millennium. The story deals with Sergeant Terry Naughton, head of the Crimes Against Youth Division of the Orange County Sheriff Department in Southern California, and his hunt for the Horridus, a man who preys on young children. Two years before, Terry suffered the lost of his five-year-old son, Matt, in a swimming accident. He still feels the immense pain of the tragedy, not to mention the sense of failure and regret he experienced when he and his wife could no longer live together after what happened. Terry now pours all of his energy into trying to save as many children as possible from the human monsters out there, who secretly hunt, sexually abuse, and kill these innocents as a means to fulfilling their sick desires. There is one man who calls himself the Horridus, and he's the worst of the monsters. His pleasure comes in the form of kidnapping the children right out of their homes, then using them to complete his dark fantasies before feeding them to his thirty-foot long python. Now, in my opinion, this is definitely a guy you want to do a &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; on. Terry feels the same way. His one goal is to put this predator down the hard way, hopefully before he kills again. As Terry gets deeper into the hunt, he's suddenly sidetracked when mysterious pictures of him having sex with a minor are discovered by members of his department while checking out a crime scene. Terry knows that he is innocent, but few others seem to believe him. The question is who's setting him up for the big fall? Who has the most to gain? Is it the Horridus, or is it possibly one of the members of his department? Terry quickly finds himself on suspension while an investigation is started into the incriminating pictures. He refuses, however, to just sit back and wait, especially while the Horridus is still kidnapping children. With or without the help of his department, he's determined to nail this guy. He simply has to do it before he finds himself in jail on false charges. WHERE SERPENTS LIE will surprise you again and again. Just when you think you know where it's going, there will be a twist that takes you in a completely different direction. You may at times feel sick as Mr. Parker delves into the hideous side of human nature, but at no point will you stop rooting for our hero to put down this evil specimen of humanity. The writing is taunt and the suspense is relentless. Mr. Parker has created a hero with a tormented soul in the character of Terry Naughton, and your heart will go out to him at the ending when he's forced to look at himself and the people around him, realizing that monsters can come in many different disguises. This is certainly the kind of book you will try to read in one day. Don't rush it. Savor the anticipation and excitement of each page, and take your time. Allow yourself at least two days of delightful enjoyment. I'm now getting ready to start Mr. Parker's next novel, THE BLUE HOUR. From the blurb on the back cover, it appears to be every bit as good as this one was."},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"Wow.

Well, that reaction ended quickly.The characters are wonderful; there are sufficient hints at the outcome to make a careful reader feel secure;and there are still enough twists in the plot to make one gasp aloud as I did in a crowded room,drawing unwanted attention to myself.

With whose help?"},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"A psychopath is kidnapping young girls in Orange County California, dressing them up as angels with hoods over their heads, and then releasing them into the woods a few hours later. Although the first several girls have been found unharmed, investigators fear that the crimes will escalate into rape and murder.Terry Naughton, chief of the Crimes Against Youth unit, is assigned to the case. Terry is a 40-year-old divorced investigator, whose son died under unusual circumstances just two years prior to the case. Terry is very passionate about protecting children and is determined to capture the madman responsible for the kidnappings. The suspect becomes known as, The Horridus, because of his infatuation with snakes. The Horridus taunts Terry over the Internet, and manages to stay one step ahead of the police by covering up his tracks. Meanwhile, Terry's personal life is crumbling around him while he is trying to solve the case. He experiences alcoholic blackouts, as he is depressed and drinking heavily over the death of his son. He is living with a woman whom he does not love, and is having an affair with a woman who he does love. To top it off, he is framed with phony photographs depicting him as having sex with a child. He gets charged with child molestation, is thrown off the force, and is facing conviction. Now he must clear his name and find the person who did this to him, and try to put a stop to the Horridus before it is too late and a child is raped or killed.I found the character of Terry to be a bit dry. His personality was dull and I could not find myself empathizing with him despite his troubles. The Horridus, while not original, was a well-written character. The Horridus had a huge collection of dangerous snakes and at times believed he was a snake himself. His disorganized thought processes and odd manner accurately described someone suffering from delusions. Where Serpents Lie was not particularly outstanding or unique but is was a good read nonetheless."},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"In my humble opinion, Where Serpents Lie is the best crime fiction novel in the last four or five years. Parker has crafted an intricate, unforgettable plot rich with engaging characters. From start to finish the pace never falters, the action is believable and truly scary.For the so-called experts at Kirkus to call his work &quot;annoyingly unoriginal&quot; reeks of jealously and envy. They couldn't write as well as Parker if their lives depended on it."},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"This was my first experience with this author, and I would recommend this book to everyone. It took me a full 2 weeks to finish, because I found myself not so engrossed in the story through the middle of the book. The final chapters of the book though kept me wanting to find out more. There were plot twists that were unforseeable, to me anyway. I was stupified a couple of times. The characters in this story were believable, although not memorable. Donna Mason, the main character's &quot;mistress&quot; was too supportive, it made me wonder if there was something she was hiding. Come on, no one is that nice!Over all I give this book a thumbs up and will put it on my to-read-again list."},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"This book was recommended to me by a police officer.

It started off to be very interesting, but slowed down in the middle. When the plot focused on The Horridus, I.R. Shroud, and CAY it was engrossing. However, all the extraneous stuff about the main character's personal relationships with women was just tedious reading. The story again speeds up at the end and I found myself reading through the last few chapters very quickly. It was well written and a pretty good read, but I don't understand those who say they couldn't put it down. Maybe they were referring to the last few chapters. If you are from Orange County in California, you will enjoy reading all the references to real life locations. It helped bring the story to life for me."},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"I became a fan of Parker's by accident and now I actively look for his novels. Parker not only writes a compelling story, but he developers his characters with an eye to giving them characteristics that really draw you into the work. And of course in an era where we all know that black and white is gray, Parker's protagonists that are less than perfect are particularly attractive. In this novel, we can't help but cheer for the guy, after all he is every ones hero and going after a horrible villain helps. Parker's novel will keep you turning the pages and when you are done, you feel you learned something about yourself in the process.

Parker's protagonist in this story is Terry Naughton, who not only has to contend with the monstrous but memorable villain, Horridus, but also cope with his inner demons.

I have just seen the snakes that my son raises and watched them over the years. Watch any basic Discovery Channel show and you will see what I am talking about.Spoiler alert: There is no way that a snake eats a person (yes a large snake can eat a small child or person) and digest all of it, but the skull and leave it intact so that it can be identified. This is a constrictor, the bones are crushed while killing pray. What isn't crushed during this process are crushed while they are digested and work their way through the snake. It is basic biology. When it is finished digesting, there are different poop colors, white for calcium and other colors depending on what was eaten. Complete, intact bones are not expelled from the snake after digestion. I have seen enough with my son's snakes over the years and have yet to see a bone. His snakes eat small rodents. No, I don't particularly care for snakes either. I tolerate them.Spoiler Alert: This book also deals with children being kidnapped and/or killed by a pedophile. There is a lot of pedophile type stuff written about in this book. Yes, I know it is out there. Yes, I know it exists. Yes, I knew it when I bought the book. I just wasn't expecting as much and as detailed as it was. I almost stopped reading the book because of it. The children depicted start out very young, like 2-3 years old. Just be aware.All in all, I think this is one of his lesser works and I have read a lot of them over the years. I was disappointed, but I did finish the book. I kept hoping that it would get better."},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"I bought this book because I loved the T.Jefferson Parker books that I read before. I'm glad I know how good his books can be so I won't be put off by this one but I might have been if this were the first one I had read. I gave 2 stars for the large portions of the book that droned on and on about 'life and stuff'. I would give 3.5 stars for the rest of the book that had some police procedural/politics in it and the 'scary' parts.Buy a different book by Parker and you'll probably find something you'll want to re-read. Like one of my favorites \\"California Girl\\"."},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"I always look forward to reading anything written by T Jefferson Parker . The plots are complex and hold your interest."},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"This book has MULTIPLE errors in spelling, grammar, and even several places where a completely wrong word is inserted. All the T. Jefferson Parker books I've read are this way. The stories are great but there obviously is not proof reading involved.Best story yet though the errors really take away from the enjoyment of the story."},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"This book will make you uncomfortable, angry, introspective and take longer to read because of thought pauses than any recent book. In the end, you will be thankful that you read it."},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"Excellent characters, plot, treatment. Deep psychological insight into the dark waters of the human soul. Insiders knowledge of police procedures. However, I'm still puzzled at the casual stance on extremely heavy drinking, and casual acceptance of numerous instances of driving while drinking/buzzed by main characters."},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"This novel contains all that you would expect from a police novel.

When I did have to out it down, I could wait to get back to it. I just want to know, what about the snakes??"},{"Title":"Where Serpents Lie","review":"This one had me riveted from start to finish. The crime thriller genre doesn't get any better than this, and I'm rapidly appreciating T. Jefferson as one of the finest writers on the scene. Here he draws you in with the twisted novelty of the pedophile subculture, spiking the brew with the primal horror of venomous snakes. As the plot advances, he gradually builds up layers of credibile complexity in his main characters: the flawed and self-destructive guardian of innocence Terry Naughton, and his sociopathic nemesis Hypok, aka The Horridus. There are few books in my experience that live up to that old saw &quot;can't put down&quot;; this is one of them."},{"Title":"Olive Parrot Shares her Birthday","review":"This book has it all. Kids will love the gorgeous illustations, the \\"happily ever after\\" tale that is neither trite nor too predictable, and most of all, the lyrical flow of the prose.

It is one of those rare children's books that combines clever humor with a compelling and exciting storyline, allowing an adult to enjoy it as much as any child. It serves to bring out the child in an adult while challenging a developing youngster with its clever puns and twists of fate. The book is also beautifully illustrated and bound with such high quality materials, that it looks and feels as good as any coffee-table glossy.

My wife and I have shared it with our family on multiple occasions and it remains fresh and funny.We give it maximum stars (Jegs too)."},{"Title":"Olive Parrot Shares her Birthday","review":"What a delightful and charming book, not to mention funny as well with jokes for adults and kids.

It was full of unbeliveable magic, adventure, and legend. With certain items like a mirror that shows what you want and an invisability cloak it puts this book to a greatr mark in excellence. It may seem akward at first, but that is the point to stump you in the begining. It makes you actually want to go to hogwrts school of witchcraft and wizerdy. With an interesting life of the Non-Muggles, you will see pictures don't stay on the picture, food comes different, many creatures roam freely on the outside magic world, dragons come at different kinds. Same as brooms,such as the pegasus 2000. Also wands are made from combinations that pick the magic weilder. Cauldrons come in different condiotions, you have a bank run by goblins. this will actually make you leave reality for a long time.-James B.

The two reasons why it was so suspenseful, were, first, danger: if Harry is in a lot of danger you want to read more to get into safety; second, ideas: this book is quite like a mystery and in this mystery you get many ideas about how to solve it, so, you want to read more to prove whether your idea was right or wrong. Those are two reasons why I thought this book is excellent, but there are many more reasons, for instance the high level of excitement and the speed at which things happen."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter takes your imagination on a wild ride through witchcraft and wizardry.

READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Bought this book because I wanted the book with the original title for my collection. I already own HP and the Sorcerer's Stone. I also own a copy of Deathly Hallows with an upside down binding. Saving it for my kids to sell someday..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A short, skinny boy with untidy hair and broken glasses and a scar on his forehead. A tall, gangly red-head with various hand-me-downs from his five older brothers. A bushy-haired girl who is absolutely book-smart, but also sometimes bossy and rash. It amazes me to this day that such a hugely popular book series could star a main cast such as the one I just described. Even more amazingly, we actually care about these characters and all of their adventures.Harry Potter owes a debt to the great fantasy that came before it, but it never falls into the trap of copying everything that preceded it. Sure, there are the fairly cliched plot devices of a young boy with dead parents who goes on an incredible journey to kill the male antagonist, but others like Hagrid the half-giant, Diagon Alley, Platform 9 3/4, Quidditch, the Invisibility Cloak, and the incredibly touching Mirror of Erised all came straight from Rowling's incredible imagination. There is something marvelous in every chapter of Harry Potter.The writing in Sorcerer's Stone isn't perfect, and one could argue that it's not even good, but Rowling's sense of humor, and again, her imagination really shine through. Her writing is very accessible but never patronizing, making Harry Potter a perfect choice for young readers, not only to give them a perfect reading choice, but also to spur a possible life-long interest in reading.One thing I like about the series is that it's not a clear-cut tale about good vs. evil (this is made clear by the last few books in the series). Plenty of important themes are tackled, and all of them with grace--another argument for why young readers should read Harry Potter.All in all, there is just so much to love about the series. The first book will have you hooked; by the time you reach the third book, you will desperately want to finish up the whole series, even though you know that means about 3,000 more pages of reading. I think that Harry Potter will go down in history as one of the best fantasy series of all time--you can think about that what you will, as not everybody would agree with me on this one. But I can give this whole series a heartfelt recommendation."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Sadly I had seen the first Harry Potter movie before I read the book. For all of those who declared the first book superior I would have to disagree. Granted it is the begining source for all that we come to love about Harry and his friends, Hogwarts and the long driven drama against Voldemort but the story itself pales in comparison to such a brilliantly done movie. However, for those who have somehow avoided the tidal wave of media buzz concerning these books I would recommend that you start from the begining and enjoy this wonderful world one page at a time. Between the prose and film productions you are about to take a grand journey unlike anything available in the fantasy market."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"\\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" Apparently, I am the 5434th person to leave a review. I will try to keep it short.I am a retired older person and, ten years ago, I bought a copy of the previous edition for myself and my wife and a second copy for my, then, eight-year-old step granddaughter and her eleven-year-old brother. We, each, enjoyed the story tremendously. We have followed the Harry Potter stories through to finishing the seventh book, last year.This is the easiest and the shortest book of the series. However, the author, J.K. Rowling, introduces the reader to many new sorts of things. The ending of this book is very good and this novel is a complete story.I have read this story several times and am still happy with it, from beginning to end.You may hear or see criticisms of the Harry Potter books. You may, also, hear or see many folks who praise the books. Please form your own opinions by reading this book for yourself. At first, Harry will be the character that you get to know the best. As the series continues, you will get to know several characters, very well. None of the characters are perfect people. However, Harry and his friends are people whom you would like as your friends. Finally, Harry and his friends do good things throughout the series of books. That is an important point that some folks have a hard time seeing, but it is there in every book.I recommend this book, highly."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Not much new can be said on the Harry Potter series, so I'll just go with one impression from the recent read: Quidditch sucks as an actual sport. With 150 points for catching the Snitch, it's completely absurd, like if field goals in American Football were worth 10 points. The outcome of the game is almost entirely in the hands of someone that has nothing to do with the bulk of the gameplay or teams, and relies on an entirely different skillset. It's still convincing in terms of pointless English boarding school sports, but not as the unofficial sport of Rowling's wizarding world.The rest of Rowling's worldbuilding is generally better, although never particularly organized or systematic; there are never any clear rules of magic. It's more a hodgepodge of various myths and tales and some inventions. None of it is startlingly original, but despite some occasionally stilted prose Rowling weaves it together remarkably well. None of the characters are particularly complex yet, and the plot is straightforward children's fare, but the book as a whole works better than the parts seem to sugggest."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It's obvious that Ms. Rowling put a great deal of thought into the structure of this book. Coming in very late to the whole Harry Potter phenomenon, I've come to understand why these books are so popular with kids and adults. The vocabulary isn't taxing to grownups (I'm 48 and an avid reader) as well as being a little bit challenging for the younger audience, which is a good thing. It also has plenty of colorful characters and enough twists and turns to keep the reader interested. This first installment in the seven-volume series lays an excellent foundation as well as leaving a few unanswered mysteries to keep me hooked. I enjoyed the first book and certainly intend on reading the next installment. It makes me feel like I'm a kid again.(Also as a side note, if you haven't had the pleasure of hearing Jim Dale's narration, you are missing a real treat. The CD's are worth every penny. My two boys have read the books, but listened to the CDs over and over.)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It's great to have this fine quality volume in my collection. I will buy every forthcoming \\"Anniversary\\" edition of the Potter series. With the J.K. Rowling's own sketch of Snape included here, I wonder why she did not illustrate all of her books. Her sketch of Snape is exactly how I imagined him and has much more gravitas and interest than the rather too whimsical drawings of her illustrator."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have the complete series and wanted the UK version just to see if anything else was different."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a new elaborate world with some of the best characters written, and some of the most unique experiences imaginable.

Suffice it to say that, 10 years ago, I read this jewel on the airplane from London back to the States, and it seemed a fitting end to a delightful vacation abroad. I not only find the novel's characters charming, but I love the very British world that Rowling has created--simultaneously proper and quirky.

His weight is just a detail. Second, H.P. dosen't encourage rule-breaking-Hermione, one of the bravest people in the book, is very concerend about both grades and rules. In the book it says that one of the main attributes of Slytherin (house of Harry's greatest enemies)is breaking rules, therefore putting it on the &quot;evil side.&quot; And besides, what's a good book with out rule breaking- some of the time!

Later on, Harry is at Hogwarts and Malfoy, Harry's enemy at Hogwarts, tricks him and he goes into a room that has a giant dog with three heads!!!!!!!!! I liked that part too.

Wonderful Rowling!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I acquired R.K. Rowlings' first work as a skeptical parent. When I finished reading, I was a mesmermized fan. In the past year, I've gotten my millenium-approaching fill of 20th Century classics by reading Harper Lee's &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot;, Mario Puzo's &quot;The Godfather&quot;, F. Scott Fitzgerald's &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; and Ernest Hemingway's &quot;A Farewell To Arms&quot; &amp; &quot;The Old Man &amp; The Sea&quot;. None of which were as well crafted nor captivated my soul quite like Harry Potter's first yarn.Comparing Rowling's style to these authors may seem preposterous. But the fact remains that I was thoroughly entranced in her world of muggles, Vol - I mean what's-his-name and Albus Dumbeldore - none of which should make sense to most Amazon.com critic readers, but will evoke fond memories of those who have read her tales.If you have children, BUY THIS BOOK AND SHARE IT WITH THEM.

But, for the most part of the book, her &quot;tea-cup predictions&quot; and &quot;futures told&quot; are regarded and hogwash. Except for a one serious prediction, which the student didn't ask for. But she is still considered full of balogni by the author/book/reader.Just in real life-there IS evil out there, and you may find it even when not looking.The spells used in the books are to benefit the students in Hogwarts (the wizarding school Harry attends), and defenses against the &quot;Dark Lord&quot; Voldemort's powerful spells. Which is like christianity, we have to learn to defend and protect ourselves from Satan.These books are very good, and if you read them, you should understand. Some reviews and newspaper/magazine articles only tell parents about the negative things-and not how truly great these books are. I am 12 years old, not quite your normal child. As I hope you may have noticed, I am quite literate. And although I am young, I think I know much more about these books than some adults do, and can read pretty deeply into them.Please read these books before banning them from your child. Oh, and unless you have read the books, the movie trailors won't help. They put on a quite &quot;serious&quot; effect, and don't show the comedy relief/fun parts of the book. I hope I don't sound too grouchy! Just trying to get my point across with my positive pount on these books! They are the best I've read!!!!

He does not learn the feeling of true happiness until he goes to Hogwarts' school of wizardry where he meets other kids just like him. The story continues to blossom with the introduction of Quidditch, sort of like basketball on brooms! Harry is a natural player and is admired by his peers.

This is a must read for anyone, even if you don't like fantasies."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Budding Author J. K. Rowlings makes an astonishing first time hit in her book, Harry Potter, The Sorcerer's Stone. Here is a side to fantasy we've all been waiting for. Not the incomprehensible and mysterious fantasy so traditional today, but a fantasy so natural I could almost go to station nine and three quarters and get on the Hogwarts Express. Harry Potter, the famous muggle raised wizard who defeated You-Know-Who when he was but a child knows nothing of his heriage, or the magnificent world that awaits him. Until a letter arrives that brings fulfillment to his greatest hopes, that he will escape the hated muggle family with which he lives and find a life he could only dream of. As a hero, he is refreshingly humble and makes mistakes, just like anyone else. And the atmosphere of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is as believable as any muggle school. If there is anything I can think to complain about, it is the repeated use of the word Reckon, making Harry sound like an british cowboy. But I do not wonder at the great sucess Harry Potter has seen, and I bid Miss/Mrs. Rowlings to exceed the sucess of this book with each new year."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When my older brother gave me this book to read, I wasnt really sure what he was thinking, knowing this was a childrens book, I wasnt sure how much I would like it. But as soon as I had read the first few pages I knew it was somthing special. This is a really great book, it just drew me in, and I didnt want to put it down. The characters are wonderfully written, I wish that this book had been around when I was younger."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's (Philosopher's) Stone well deserves the critical acclaim it's won over the past few years. Even though Rowling's characters Harry, Ron and Hermione are very likeable and we are very intertwined in their lives, it's Rowling's use of plot that drives her novels to their real success. She writes very deliberately and very furtively, which is fun, if you're someone who likes to try to figure out what's going to happen next as you read. The best part, in my opinion, is that there are several points in the novel where the plot is turned inside out, leaving the reader astonished -- her writing style is very reminiscient of the writing of M. Night Shyamalan movie, of the Sixth Sense fame. Perhaps you've heard the criticism that these books encourage witchcraft because they are not set in &quot;another world.&quot; From the moment Harry steps on the Platform 9 and 3/4, he enters another world, a magical one at that, and the reader is thrown into a place that has its own sports, lingo, and rules. There is plenty of room to let the imagination roam, which is fun. If you are too concerned that these books have some evil lurking under the cover, let me assure that these books not only seem very innocent, but that the books actually promote the distinctions between good and evil over and over and over. Anyone who has read them (not skimmed, but actually read) will be in no doubt that good is upheld in these books and evil is shown for what it is - dark, ugly and deceptive. I believe that in order to know good, we must also know evil and look in the face once in a while, which is why the Harry Potter Series is so great. There is no confusion what is good and what is evil. Every great series seems to have this good-evil distinction (Narnia, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings...), and even though evil is explained and even examined, it is not glorified nor does it ever emerge victorious when it is faced with the good, the beautiful and the true."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As a fantasy story-teller about the world of magic, J.K. Rowling has enjoyed remarkable success. The adventures of Harry Potter and his friends at Hogwarts, the school where young wizards learn the skills of magic, are highly imaginative and thoroughly enjoyable. It is no wonder that this series has captured the imagination of children and given pleasure even to adults. Many of Rowling's concepts are strongly reminiscent of the brilliant children's fantasy fiction by the British writers Enid Blyton and Roald Dahl, and she likely has been influenced by their work. But Rowling clearly has a style of her own, and in this fourth book of the Harry Potter series, has confirmed her reputation as a story-teller for children. This novel has all the ingredients of a good children's novel - suspense, imagination, and excitement.The remarkable popularity of the Harry Potter series has led to its author J.K. Rowling being frequently mentioned in the same breath as the fantasy greats J.J.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis. Yet this is not entirely deserved, because the works of Tolkien and Lewis go far beyond the level of story, imparting great truths about human nature and theology on a deeper level. Rowling's books do not have this deeper level, but are simply imaginative books that entertain. That is not to say that Rowling's novels are not good. They clearly are. The incredible sales record of the Harry Potter series tells its own story of success.The Harry Potter series has been much criticized for the extent to which magic has been incorporated into the story-line, and the increasing interest in the dark side of magic has left people wondering whether Rowling is leaving the door open to the occult. Rowling herself has publicly denied any personal interest in the occult, and explicitly repudiated being an advocate of the occult or intending to attract children to it. Most of the magic she describes is clearly fantastic and bears little relation to the magic of the occult. Yet it must be conceded that there is a growing contemporary revival of the occult, and that occultic themes and ideas are hardly absent from Harry Potter's world, but rather play a key role in it. When accompanied with an increasingly dark and macabre tone, this element did make me seriously question whether the Harry Potter books are suitable for children.But in the end it is not the magic of Harry Potter that has made it so successful. The real reason is that readers can identify with its characters. Although Rowling describes a fantasy world that exists only in her imagination and ours, it is clear that this fantasy world is largely a mirror image of our own 20th/21st century Western world. What makes this series so successful, is that we recognize ourselves in the novel - our system of education (Hogwarts), our ideology of human rights (Hermione), our worship of team sports (quiddich), our love for competition (school contests), our political world (ministry of magic), our media (interviews with the Daily Prophet), our concern with health and beauty, our fascination with love and guy-girl relationships, and our love of feasting and food (The festivities around The Sorting Hat). Unlike Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and Lewis' \\"Narnia Chronicles\\" which are more demanding and deep because they bear little resemblance to our world, Rowling's world of \\"Harry Potter\\" bears a great deal of resemblance to our contemporary godless world and its idols. Although \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is outwardly about a fantasy world, beneath the fantastic trimmings it is essentially about our own world. And that is why we love it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was amazing! My grandparents bought this (along with the second book in the series) for me a few years ago. I was not really into these books yet, although many of my closest friends would come to school telling me about Hogwarts, and wonderful Harry Potter with the lightning bolt scar, and a really cool game called Quidditch, which (oddly enough), is played on BROOMSTICKS! I didn't really understand the plot of the story, so I mentioned the books to my mom, and, a few days later, my Nana and Papa showed up in our driveway with. . . BOOKS! Not just any books, these were THE books, the books which are now my most FAVOURITE books EVER!!!! I am presently into the fourth book for the fifth time (my best friend and I are going for a record, and we're very far behind the other fans), one of the owners of the Harry Potter Club at my school, and impatiently awaiting the arrival of the fifth book. I give the books a gazillion stars!!! :)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a thrilling and exciting book. It has sad, scary, great and funny parts in the book. Harry Potter is a famous boy wizard but he doesn't even know it. He tries to figure out what the mysterious object is that someone is trying to hide at Hogwarts. It was so good I'm reading book 2 now. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is adventurous and really lets me use my imagination.I think your child will really enjoy this book and get them using their imagination and not watching TV.Melissa"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Suddenly reading Harry Potter I felt like I did when I was a kid and found the most exciting un-put-down-able book - Secret Seven, The Hobbit - and disappeared into a wonderful world of magic and adventure for an entire vacation. It's a nice way to feel at 43! My friendly local bookseller could not recommend it highly enough - the only trouble was she was selling it faster than the books were coming in! It's a great holiday read for young and old and I am recommending it to all my &quot;adult&quot; friends (put down the A.S. Byatt, gals, and read this!) If they are very, very good, some kids might get copies for Christmas - so I can watch them try to keep the book away from their parents."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am not, perhaps, the normal reader Ms Rowling had in mind when she began writing this series. I am a 35 year old career woman, and while an avid reader who has read thousands of books in my life, and really enjoyed hundreds of them.......this is without a doubt the BEST book I have ever read (as an adult or child). I bought it to read to my young son, but when he fell asleep after the first chapter, I had to stay up until 3 in the morning to finish it. I am also normally a fast reader who often just skims books, skipping the long descriptive passages, but I had to read every single word of this in order to be sure I didn't miss a thing. I then rushed out and bought the 2nd the next day and the 3rd as soon as it was released. I have gotten everyone I know hooked on these books, from my mother and brother, to co-workers who don't even have children. What a fantastic imagination J.K. Rowling has. I can't even explain exactly what it is that has me and my friends so entranced, except that maybe the books have spells on them placed by Harry Potter himself. All I do know, is that once these 7 books are done, I don't know what we'll all do, as Rowling has made it impossible to ever be as entertained by any other book. Every other book can only hope to be mildly pleasing to me after this.

The novel moved to a top selling spot. The book is better than screen version could ever live up to.A poor, dejected boy, Harry Potter, lives in 'the cupboard under the stairs' with his Aunt, Uncle and wretched cousin. Unknown to Harry, he was born to famous parents and he possess many powers he knows nothing about. Hair growing back, speaking to snakes, making things appear are only a few unexplainable things we are described. This is all before we find out he is the infamous Harry Potter who is non-other than Wizard.Off to the statuesque castle of Hogwart's, we meet Hermoine and Ron, Harry's two best friends. Everything seems perfect for Harry, he's gone from his horrible family and he starts learning about his parents. However, not everything is perfect. Who is after Harry?

Far from a disappointment, this is a book generations will be reading."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was kind of kiddish for me but that's ok. I like reading about wizards and magic and magical creatures. This book made it good because it has a story theme. The Story takes place in england in present day. It is about a kid (whose name is Harry), who doesn't know who he is. He has lived with his Aunt and Uncle for the past ten years. But one day he gets a letter. To bad his uncle wont let him read it. But more letters keep coming, and more. So his uncle wisks him away to a shack in the middle of nowhere. But little does he know that someone else knows where they are. Hagrid, a wizard of some sorts come to his rescue. He tells Harry all about his past and where he is going. He is going to Hogwarts, Wizards school. But something is not right. someone is doing bad things. Someone is trying to steal something from the school. And it can only be one person and harry is the only one who can stop that person. It is up to him to save the day.The book, as you have read so far, is fiction. This book would be really great for kids 8 to 16. But really it is a good read for any body. Compared to other books I have read this one lands close to the top of my list. So take my advice and read the book. It is worth it!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"HARRY POTTER BOOK REVIEWThis powerful story of imagination and mystery has been captured by readers of all ages worldwide. Whilst battling as a single mother in Edinburgh, Joanna, Kathleen Rowling, slowly developed her first published novel, &iexcl;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&iexcl;s Stone&iexcl;. This mysterious and magical adventure created by J.K Rowling, is not only enjoyed, by children, but by adults alike.Harry Potter and Sorcerer&iexcl;s Stone is a story of a young boy, whose parents died when he was very young. He inevitably ends up residing with his evil aunt and uncle. Harry new that he was different to his aunt, uncle and cousin, but this was confirmed one night, when Harry received a visit from Hagrid, the friendly Games Keeper of Hogsworts School of Witch craft and Wizardry. Hagrid, took Harry back to the world of the witches and wizards, where he realises that he is famous. Harry attends Hogwards, where he not only develops friendships, but also creates enemies, due to his unknown past. Harry&iexcl;s year at Hogwards is full of adventure, as himself and his two friends, Ron and Harmonie, try and combat evil.The lifestyle and adventures that are created for Harry are magical experiences, that children and even adult&iexcl;s (not admit tingly) dream of. The storyline, removes readers from their robotic daily lives, and enters them, into a world of spells, enchantments and mystery.J.K Rowling developed such a diverse audience, by inducing a particular style in her writing that makes each reader feel equal. She never talks down to the reader, as if they were a child. This is a key indicator, to why adults find the style and story line so entertaining. She also includes experiences, jokes, references and characters that can be enjoyed by both the young and old.Once you have picked up the story, you will be reluctant to put the tale down. The creativity of characters, activities and dangerous adventures, that take place, cause the story to be such a highly recommended read. Be sure to read the book before you see the movie.By Meghan Glynn"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My rating for this book, is for the whole series, not just one. It is a good adventure, great stuff for the youth. Just to worn you, there is some cusing in there for you who would like to know. The rest of the stuff is great, the story between good and evil, stuggles to do what is right.I just can't wait to see the third movie.

DuongPeriod 3The book i read was Harry Poter and the Sourcerer's Stone. I enjoyed this book very much. I thougt it was wonderful. It is about a british boy who learns that he has magical powers. He lives with his Aunt, Uncle, and his cousin. They don't really love him and treat him badly. When he finds he's a wizard, he goes to the Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizadry. He makes new wizard friends and starts to be able to use his new powers. As harry gets to know his fellow wizards, he joins a certain magical sport. He became one of the best in the sport.Although, when he returns from his school, his Uncle hated him even more. They didn't appreciate witchcraft, and was scaredof it. I liked this book very much. I thought it was wonderful. It filled my mind with many different pictures. Thebook pretty much came to life in my head. It boosted up my imagination and my vocabulary. I especially loved how creative this book was. It had many wonderful things, ghost, witches, wizards, invisable cloaks, three headed dogs, and many other different things. Also, I liked the way the author described every single thing that Harry saw. It was as if I was the main charcter, and was in this book. I enjoyed this book very much. I only have one word to describe this book, FANTASTIC!Although I liked this book very much, I did dislike some parts. One of the things were how some british words were used. It confused me very much. Also, when the characters spoke, they used British slang words that confused me a lot. Also, somethings the author explained were confusing, like the things that Harry bought, or used. Overall, i thought this book was very well written, and i still give it a five.My favorite part in this book is when harry first learns that he is a wizard. A giant stomps into his house and and starts using magic all over the place. Another one of my favorite parts is when Harry plays a magical sport. All the players ride on a broom stick and while harry chases after a ball that goeas at the speed of light, every one else is trying to get a ball into the goal. Although, if harry catches the the little golden ball, his whole team wins, and vise versa. I aslo liked the part where a hat would decide which group harry would go in to. It was a talking hat, and it said he should go into griffendore. I liked this book very much and I've recommended it to many of my friends."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book starts out with a lot of actions and follows through out the book so I didn't get bored at all while reading the book. There's always something happening with a great thrill or impact. The author, J. K. Rowling, writes this story, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer Stone, with a great tone and a friendly text that everybody can understand. This story is not only meant for children, but the book can also be very entertaining for adults also. The fascinating story expands imagination for children and especially adults who had forgotten about fairy tales and myths.From my experience of the book, I found the book extremely interesting that I practically finished the book almost in one day. In the book, Rowling writes about things that would not happen in our practical world. By reading the book, the Rowling gives us hope and beliefs of the impossible actually having a possibility of occurring. As a young adult, this book help my imagination expand similarly to the imagination that we have lost while we grew up in this practical world.After reading plenty of books in my lifetime, I do not believe this book is only for children; however, I would rate this book higher than most adult's book. As a adult, I recommend this book for adults who have lost their imagination and who had forgotten how it was like to be a kid."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is such a real hero. Harry&#65533;s not some super hero with amazing powers, (well for wizard standards). Harry is just a simple kid thrust into a world of unexpected surprises with a hint of danger around every corner. Harry shows such humility in the face of his fame. He also shows that even unexpected unpopular kids can one day do extraordinary things, and that there will always be a place for them in the world, even if they can&#65533;t quiet get there on their own.Harry Potter, the boy who lived, has never played a sport on a broomstick, eaten Bertie Botts Every Flavor Beans, or seen a ghost fly through his classroom. In Harry Potter and The Sorcerer&#65533;s Stone, he is given a glimpse. Harry is now eleven and soon strange letters begin to arrive for him at the Dursleys, the awful muggles he lives with, and soon Harry is thrust into a world so magical and full of surprise he has only dreamed of such a place. That place is Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. That&#65533;s right, Harry is a Wizard, and not just any wizard, Harry is the only survivor of the most evil dark wizard in history Lord Voldemort. Now, Harry must figure out what strange things are happening at the school and if they have any connection with Voldemort, while getting through all his homework.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#65533;s Stone, is spellbinding, with surprises of magic and adventure around every corner. This wonderful first book in this series will definitely ensnare the senses of all kids and adults alike."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"For those, who think \\"I saw the movie, I don\`t need to read the book.\\" Wrong, our Schools and local libraies,are making a big mistake. by not encouraging our youth. to read the books upon which, their favorite movies are based.

The plot is great, the style is remarcable (even translated into Romanian), characters become real as you read and they become your friends. I took the book even on holiday for some friends who hadn't read it yet and they were &quot;touched&quot; too and we spoke all the time then about quidditch, Gryffinders and so on - it became our secret language.

I also wondered how could anyone be this crazy for a book. Until one day I went to the drug store near my job and was looking at the book section and seen book 2. I bought it not knowing there was a book before it. I paid for it and bought it back to work and began to read. Now I must remind you I was a 23 year old professional woman and I have kids of my own. But when I read this book it seems like my whole childhood came back to me. I haven't read a childrens fantasy novel in years. This book had my full attention. When I finshed, it left me hungry for more until I purchased and finished them all. Never has a book or a series of books have my full attention like these. I even read them twice. I'm just dying to get the next book #5. The whole story line was so livid I could picture the whole scenario in my mind from begining to end.

Anything that gets young people interested in reading on their own is a good thing. I read my brother's Amazing Stories in the late 50's: I had flunked 3rd grade and was just beginning to learn to read on my own. The texts at school were boring and ordinary, but science fiction was exciting and different. Good children's books from &quot; The Wizard of OZ&quot; to the Harry Potter books have been those where the young reader is carried away into the strange and magical world of the imagination! I hope someone better than Disney makes the first movie of these books!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm very much a fantasy reader. I love magic tales, fairies and through the looking glass types of stories. This story hinges on how many children feel like misfits in their homes and schools. The escapism of a totally magic world where none of our physics applies and amazing things are ordinary is just so nice and for a scientist it is relaxing, because the pressure to be always right/ correct isn't there. Spells and curses, mythical creatures and the blackest of evil make this just so much of a fun read!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"....I love Harry Potter! My first thoughts of the Harry Potter hype was not in the books' favor. I was sure that they were unoriginal and like the other gazillion books with a magical story-line. When many people recommended them, I gave in, and figured, &quot;Hey what the heck? I might as well see WHY everyone loves them so much!&quot; And I'm glad that I did, because now I'm a Harry Potter fan too. What I like about the books, besides all the magic (which makes the books fun, cute, and interesting....not your typical magic, monsters, and dragons, by the way!) is that the characters are very personal, &quot;normal&quot;, real, and also brave, spunky, and fun. What I mean by &quot;normal&quot; is this: Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione do anything a &quot;Muggle&quot; (non-wizard/witch) kid would do: get into trouble endlessly with teachers, receive cards on Valentines Day, study and stress for final tests, argue, tease, etc. etc. The story of 3 best and inseperable friends nicely compliments (and sometimes relieves) readers of all the &quot;gibberish words&quot; (such as &quot;Muggle&quot; and many other terms to describe spells and potions), monsters, curses, magic wands, etc. If you haven't read the Harry Potter books yet because you are skeptical, give them a chance like I did. I hope you like them too!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Not too long ago, only last year, I hate reading books. But it all changed... In one of my classes we had to read Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone. I thought this book is going to be very, very boring. But being a good student I took the book home to read the first chapter, and I'll say &quot;never judge a book by its cover.&quot; That night I couldn't put the book down. My family thought I went ill because I was actually reading a book. The first night I got to page 200. I finished the book in only two days. If I wanted I could have finished that one day but I was getting really tired. After reading the book I went out bought the Sorcerer's Stone and also Chamber of Secrets, lets not stop there I bought year three and year four.

The same book you'll wonder, yes only the first one, because I live in Panama (Central America) and the only editions available are in spanish.

I was quite taken aback after reading this book. I definitely recomend it for readers of all ages, and I can say that 9 out of 10 readers will like it. I like those odds. The book is a good start to the series and the character development starts off with a bang as Harry Potter is introduced, and then Ron and Hermione, and everyone else at Hogwarts. All the characters you can relate to and imagine clearly in your mind with ease. The suspense of the book is also gripping and the ending is irresistibly good, and many plot twists are abound in the whole of the book itself. All in all, a truly good book, combining suspense, magic, and fantasy into a combo blend of good reading. Recommended."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As a self-proclaimed vocabulary nerd and lover of things like Russian Literature, I was quite wary of the Harry Potter craze that was sweeping the nation. In an age when people like Oprah are dictating the public's reading lists, I am skeptical of any novel that produces mass hysteria.After reading the Harry Potter series, I may be a changed (however slightly) woman. The books are beautifully written and full of clever characters that you can't help but fall in love with. I found myself laughing out loud and cheering Harry along in his journeys, something that is not exactly the norm in long, stuffy old novels. It may not be induced into the canon anytime soon, but it certainly should be - Harry Potter is one of the most fun, entertaining, whimsical series I've ever read. It's impossible to put down, and perfect for summer reading when it is far too hot to think extensively anyway. At the very least, give it a try - you can never have too much magic in your life."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If you haven't read this book yet....you'd better start now. The first time i read this book in the beginning i was confused and a little tired of reading the book. Everyone said it was good, but i wasn't getting into it. So i read it a little more and i started to understand and book became fascinating to me. It is really a great book. You just have to give it a try. It's about a boy named harry potter who finds out a big secret that has been kept from him since he was a baby, that he's a wizard. Not to mention that him and his parents r famous for something he doesn't even remember. Now that Harry has found out wut he is he off to Hogwarts....the school of Whichcraft and Wizardy where he meets others like him and soon gets caught up in an adventure....but will he survive it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After hearing how awesome the Harry Potter books are from my dad, brother, several friends, and even one of my friend's mom's I had to read Harry Potter to see for myself. I did not know what to expect because I never really had read a fantasy book. As soon as I started the book, I was attached. I could not put it down. I never found a good place to put the book down because I always wanted to know what would happen next. The first Harry Potter book definitely lived up to all of the praises I had heard about it.Harry Potter lives with the Dorsey's on Privet Drive. Harry has so far lived a miserable life with his aunt and uncle and their son, Dudley, a spoiled bully. Harry cannot help but notice the odd occurrences that always seem to happen. For example when he wishes for something to happen and somehow it does without him knowing how. Finally, Harry is offered some answers for all these weird \\"powers\\". On his twelfth birthday, Hagrid comes to pick Harry up for his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry has many questions for Hagrid. Hagrid manages to explain most of what Harry needs to know. Harry finds friends, sports, and magic in everything from classes to meals at Hogwarts. He cannot believe that he is really in the presence of all this greatness. Harry has many adventures during his first year. He often finds himself in trouble, but always seems to be able to make up for it. Harry has found his destiny, but must find a way to survive the testing experiences.Rowling uses many colors throughout the book, almost creating a picture in the readers mind. She also uses many metaphors, comparing two things to help the reader relate to what she creates in her fantasy story. Many of the names she creates in her stories have meanings. One example is \\"slytherin\\" referring to \\"slither\\" because the mascot of the house group is a snake.I enjoyed every part of the book and would not change any part of it. The book is not hard to read or understand. Any person who is in the fourth grade or above could read this book. I hope that everyone reads Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone so he/she can experience the amazing and adventurous story."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What can I say? Harry Potter has become part of our culture, just like star wars, Disney princesses, and the beatles. Thousands of years from today, this story is still gonna be alive and and kicking in history texts, and archaeologists will treat first editions from Bloomsbury 1997 like holy grails. Ten years from now, people will be like \\"Where were YOU when Harry Potter was first published?\\" Reading this book for the first time is one of the most electrifying things anyone can experience. Our hero, Harry, has lived with his deliciously horrid aunt, uncle and cousin (the dursleys) since he was a baby. He has already accepted his underprivelidged life, when he discovers he is a wizard, and must begin schooling at Hogwarts school for witchcraft and wizardry. He has to uncover the mystery behind the evil sorcerer who caused his parent's death with the help of his friends Ron and Hermione (Her-my-o-nee!! Before the movie came out everyone pronounced it Her mee own). Hogwarts is so perfectly described, and the teachers and students create tons of comic relief (especially Fred and George) that it is a great book to read over and over again. However, the first 2 books in the series were far more enjoyable for me than the third or fouth ones, only because the plots are getting darker and stuff, and I really don't like reading books that are as morbid as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. And one thing more... couldn't the courts crack down on the Dursleys for letting Harry's cousin Dudley punch him and stuff? And actually, do they even have those courts in Britain?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm a 27 year old professional, and I just loved this book. What drives me to books is simply because I want to read a good story. This book definately delivers. The characters are well developed and likeable. You can identify and feel for the \\"good guys\\" and loathe, but understand the \\"bad guys\\". The plot is fun and fast moving and full of humor and enchantment.I know a book is good when I start to miss the characters when the book is done. I do miss them greatly now that this journey is done, but I look forward to sharing more of his journeys.I know a lot of people are protesting these books. They do this because they don't understand them. These books are simply a story of a simple boy who finds greatness, and fights evil with his friends. There is not a person a live who, when a child, didn't fantasize about this. Every person who reads this book identifies with Harry because they once where in his shoes, and hoped to break free and beyond what they are to become what they only in their wildest dreams could have imagined.This book is not only for the young, but for the young at heart. It is definately a story to read and cherish."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"\\"There is no such thing as magic!\\" This would be the last thing for any reader to worry about. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is filled to the brim with ghouls, goblins, and most importantly witches. Once Harry received his letter of enrollment at Hogwars, school for witches, Harry's life dramatically chnaged. Getting enrolled into a school where everyone knows your name through legacy is one thing, but getting intertwined with black magic and Hogwarts darkest secret becomes a problem. Harry, with his suspicion of Hogwart's faculty, adventures out and unravels the secrets that killed his parents in the beginning. The moment I read this book I was in love with it for it gave an enchanting aura that made me feel connected with the book's purpose. I loved the vivid imagery that was present throughout the book's text. It really gave me a sense of the world that Harry Potter had to go through. The most important feature about the book was the plot that gave the story its life. The plot really made sense to me because it kept me updated with all the details that were presented in each chapter. The most fascinating thing about the book was it's complex vocabulary and diction. The book really made it clear by including the various terms that were used throughout the book. For example a \\"muggle\\" is how Hagrid would describe a \\"non-magic type folk\\". This is by far the best accomplishment J.K Rowling has written. I would give this book a 9.5 for it keeps the reader captured and gives suspense and a vivid view of the world of witchcraft."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"First, I think this book was too hard for me to read, because I don't know many English. But finally, last year, my teacher make me read it. When I start to read, it was really hard, but after 1 month, it was easy. After I finish this book, I learn much more English than the past. It help me a lot, I love it.This book was about a boy, who name Harry Potter, lost his dad and mom. And he had to live with his aunt and uncle. Then he find out that he was a wizard.

This wonderful novel of diversity is a prize for students to learn to overcome the obstacles life may throw at you. This child who has no sense of being in life manages to find his true identity when he is told he is a wizard. Once at Hogwarts, Harry forms two wonderful friendships with students that are looking for their own identity as well. Harry and his friends go on some amazing adventures filled with laughter and danger. Harry Potter is a great source to study diversity in the classroom. Harry and his two friends, Ron and Harmonie, come from such different backgrounds, but that does not matter to these three students. Their friendships is what is is most important to these friends. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants a book for an adventure, laughter, and a few tears. Harry Potter is a Ten!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Have you ever read a book and could not put it down? Well, this was the case with the book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. This book is well written and will keep you on the edge of your chair. J.K. Rowling, the author of this book, presents a very breath-taking, imaginative, and an adventurous story about a boy, Harry Potter, who gets a letter (from a wizardry school) after spending his first ten years living with his uncaring aunt, uncle, and cousin. Thus, realizing that his life is changing, he goes through many obstacles---meeting new people, adapting to a new environment, and making a new family for himself. Because the plot and character changes repeatedly, many people could associate to one of the characters or know something like this at school whether they were like the bossy but knowledgeable Hermione or the comical Ron. The story identifies the anxieties and conditions all children go through; dealing with the bully, the mean teacher, the agony of keeping secrets and having the bravery to work against inequality. Therefore, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a book for all ages at which you will enjoy. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone had great character development, plots, and action. The main character, Harry Potter, changed throughout the book. In the beginning, he was like any other teenager.In his case he felt that he was not accepted by his family. He had no friends and hated life. He felt alone in the world. Then toward the middle and at the end he became popular and had many friends. His school, Hogwarts, becomes his home and family. Harry Potter finds his niche in the world. JK Rowling created a magical and unique plot. I loved how the plot in the beginning was very dark and dull, but towards the middle it developed into something that was magical and fun. I wanted to be there attending that school, learning how to make spells and flying on a broom atick. The action contributed to making the plot fun. The action developed as Harry learned how to make glass vanish, then to fly on a broom stick and then how to fight evil wizards and monsters. Every child and adult can relate and have fun reading this book because it is unique. This book relates to reality in a way. Every child and adult wants to be accepted by society and be popular. They want to find their destiny in life. J.K. Rowling used one character, Harry Potter, to illustrate this."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter...hmm...what can I say; it brings out the imagination of a child. The book was wonderful. I enjoyed it very much with all the action going on at one time. It seemed to me as if there was so much action going on, but yet still you could understand it. The writing style is wonderful, easy to understand and fun to read. Just think when you read Harry Potter you are entering into a dream world of magic and fun.Harry Potter goes through so much excitement at his stay at Hogwarts. He is always trying to see what is going on at this Wizardy school. The book is about how Harry finds out that is beloved parents were wizards before they died, and he has that same power as they do. He goes to Hogwarts a school for wizards and is forced to learn all the magic and powers. His problem that he has to face is that the man that killed his parents, Voldemont, has come back to regain his power and finished where he left off and kill Harry. Only Harry can stop this evil sorcerer, but I am not going to tell you what happened next. Each character brings out a trait of some kind and allows you to relate to him/her. While reading this book have fun, kick back, and relax. Harry Potter will bring out the imagination in a child and an adult and you will enjoy every moment of it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was one of those parents who thought this book should be banned until I read it for myself!

I got through the first three tapes &amp; gave it up. Hagrid sounds as if he should have a parrot on his shoulder saying, &quot;Thar she blows matey! Har Har Har&quot;.

Lewis, Madeleine L'Engle, Edward Eager, Lewis Carroll, Norton Juster, Roald Dahl, or whomever--this is a little strange. If it's only &quot;as good as&quot; the work of these other writers, that means it's EXCELLENT. And a lot of the kids who are caught up in the Harry Potter phenomenon are bound to discover these other writers' books. (This is a good thing.)To those who feel that Slytherin is an evil house, I really think you're making an unwarranted inference. Harry didn't want to go into Slytherin because he'd heard too many dark wizards came out of it, but he is sensitive to this because of his parents' deaths. So far we've had 3-4 unsympathetic Slytherin characters, out of the 200 or so in that house. I'd be willing to bet that Rowling will eventually give us a sympathetic Slytherin character!And to those who are afraid of its &quot;un-Christian&quot; overtones: I think rather than keep this book from your kids you'd do better to teach them the difference between fantasy and reality."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I bought this book for my 8 year old son, but after perusing it, found myself as engrossed in at as my son was - so much so that I extended his bedtime just so that we could read it together.Imagine being Harry Potter, and waking up one day to find out that you have magic powers.

Her depiction of a parallel world brings back memories of Madeline L'Engle and will appeal to the reader who enjoys an escape from the daily grind. Tight, fresh writing made it easy to visualize the creepiness of dark hallways and the excitement of the chase. Good chapter lengths mean this is an ideal choice for reading aloud at story time for children aged 6-96, just make sure to reassure the younger ones.

Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the greatest debut in speculative fiction since...The Hobbit? No, it's better than The Hobbit. Though the Harry Potter stories are about children, they never make the adult mistake of becoming arch or patronizing at the wrong times, as Tolkien later regretted having done in The Hobbit. Sorcerer's Stone is famous as the opening chapter in the Harry Potter saga, but even on its own it is one of the best entries in the Potter series.As an orphan whose mistreatment at the hands of his stuffy relatives is exaggeratedly nasty, Harry draws the reader's sympathy from the first moment he is introduced. The many deft touches of detail that distinguish Rowling from her herd of imitators are on display even early in her first book. The precise addressing of a letter to Harry in his \\"Cupboard under the Stairs\\" both amuses readers and informs them that someone out there is very conscious of Harry's plight.The hints that something out of the ordinary is going on with Harry are not drawn out to the point of exhausting the reader's patience. His suspected ability to perform magic is quickly confirmed (by an umbrella-wielding giant), and we are soon shown the alternate wizarding community which Harry has unknowingly been a member of all his life.The main reason that the series has become so wildly popular is the friendship between Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The other reasons that Rowling has succeeded where so many have failed are disarmingly simple. Instead of relying merely on action, or plot, or humor, or characterization, or mystery; Rowling has used all these tools. More impressively, she has skillfully used them to complement each other (action perhaps a little less well, and humor perhaps even better than the others); letting humor lighten certain serious passages without spoiling them, etc. She has managed to create a great coming-of-age story which also thrills, amuses, mystifies, and in the end, satisfies.The one thing Rowling does only sparingly is moralize - which of course is another strength. There is the occasional summation or point-driven-home passage (often made by Hermione, Dumbledore, or Lupin, in later books), but it never spoils the overall nature of each book - which like the first, are all designed primarily to entertain. The lack of depth of the books has frequently been criticized. This is a charge that earlier generations of critics lobbed at P.G. Wodehouse and before him, at Dickens. Needless to say, both authors have held up well over the generations and have finally had their reputations confirmed simply by their lasting success.Eventually even the dullest critic gets the point: a writer who has made millions of people's lives more enjoyable simply cannot be dismissed as someone who doesn't address the big issues. Rowling doesn't have to stand on her soapbox and preach about life and death, misery and happiness, and the human condition in general. Instead, she actually does something about them.Rowling frequently speaks of liking her characters: being amused by what they say, being saddened when they suffer. This is another deceptively simple rediscovery that she has made: the best creations often result from authors trying to write the kinds of books that they themselves would like to read. That was the inspiration behind the imaginative writings of Tolkien and his friend C.S. Lewis as well.It takes Rowling half the book just to get Harry to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. On the trip there, the most important occurrences in the entire series transpire in short order: Harry meets Ron Weasley and the two of them then meet Hermione Granger. The triangular friendship that soon develops among the three is the foundation of the rest of the series.The magical world, the school, the rules: none of them really make sense if thought about too closely. Rowling makes a wise choice in not getting caught up in magical minutiae. The wizarding world is the way it is. The lack of detail gives the book an almost dreamlike quality, which is not a negative, unless the reader likes their escapist fantasy to be grounded in grim reality. This impression of that world is accentuated by our seeing it through newcomer Harry's eyes. If wizard-born Ron had been the main character, much of the new sense of wonder would have been lost.The mystery within the story of the Sorcerer's Stone is simpler and less convoluted than those in the later Harry Potter books. This book and the second book are relatively straightforward kids' mysteries. What is important is that the character strengths of Ron (the steady one) and Hermione (the smart one) are defined. Even other secondary characters who will later gain in importance, such as Neville Longbottom, the Weasley twins, Draco Malfoy, and of course loathsome Potions master Severus Snape are introduced and have their roles fixed.The only part of the book that I take a bit of an issue with comes at the end. The way that Dumbledore gradually awards Gryffindor the points necessary to first tie, then pass Slytherin in the house standings makes for dramatic storytelling. And to the Gryffindors, it would have seemed like the best and most satisfying way to win. But from the Slytherin point of view it must have been the worst and most unfair-seeming way of losing that could be imagined. It seems needlessly cruel on Dumbledore's part to allow the dining hall to be decorated in Slytherin colors, then to award Gryffindor just enough points to tie, then to allow them ten more crucial points. I can't think of a better way to provoke justifiable Slytherin resentment of Harry, Gryffindor, and the school in general than to do what Dumbledore did.But aside from that minor misstep, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is great entertainment. And yes, I too wish the American publisher had left the title unchanged, but what's done is done."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"nuff said, if you're a fan, you're a fan, if you're not, you don't know what you're missing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If you see my reviews you'll see that I'm an avid reader.

All he has had to do so far is battle through his classes and homework, but that all about to change in a battle for his life!I recommend this book heart-stopping to anyone of the age of 8 and older. Harry Potter is by far the best book I have ever read! J.K. Rowling, the woman who writes these books, is one of the best authors and I would recommend her books to anyone who would like a fantastic, edge of your seat book like Harry Potter. I would give this book a top of the list 5 stars."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is very scary at the end. It is because Harry almost dies. Harry has two best friends named Ron and Hermione. They get into a lot of trouble. They're studying magic, and it's mostly hard for Ron to do. I thought that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is not the best Harry Potter book because it's his first year and it's not that interesting. Harry has a best friend named Hagrid who is a grownup who lives in a hut down by the lake of Hogwarts. I think that Harry has a lot of fun being a wizard."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I love this book and the movie that they made from it. The Sorcerer's Stone is the most lighthearted of the series. As you read it you will feel the sense of wonder and excitement that Harry experiences. Why stop with one, buy the whole series. You will regret having to wait for the next one if you don't."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a must for the Harry Potter.

Everyone should read these books. They take you to a magical place where the imagination can roam."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter And The Sorcer's Stone is an adventerouse book by JK Rolling. This book is about young Harry Potter starting his first year at Hogwarts, school for witchcraft and wizardtry. Harry Potter has just found out he was a wizard.

I hope this might help you decide-Temono de banelanden"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When my cousin first told me about her latest intrest- Harry Potter- I was skeptical at first. What would I want with a children's story about wizards and witches? How babyish! But as she kept on hounding me to try them, I finally gave in. The first chapter I thought, &quot;Okay, pretty good, but I definetly have read better.&quot; After I read the second chapter, &quot;Okay, it's pretty intresting. Maybe I was wrong.&quot; And the third: &quot;Oh no! What's going to happen to Harry!&quot; And just like that, I was hooked. THE SORCERER'S STONE and all the other Harry Potter books are wondefully written, and a great tale that any age will love. Even my mother loves them. She's reading the fourth book right now. For anyone not sure what to get a child, teenager, or even an adult, this first Harry Potter is definetly the way to go."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter was a marvulous book!! Recomend it to kids of all ages. Once you start reading, i swear, you'll never put it down. I began the book and finished it instantly. The auther did a great job. The book makes you feel like your Harry and puts you in his posission. It's a very magical book full of magic on every page. You don't have to like fantasy to read this book. Definatly read this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This work is, with out a doubt, the most suprising read of my life. I completed the first 2 volumes in the series within two days and am breathlessly emersed in the third. Miss Rowling has created something both wonderful and mysterious with Harry Potter. Wonderful because of her works ability to transend generational barriers and capture the imagination of every age group existing seperately within several cultures. The mysterious being that there is something within the works that hits me as not quite right. I wish I could put a finger on it, but alas it alludes me as does Harry from &quot;You-Know-Who.&quot; Do yourself a favor and become part of history by picking up a copy of this timeless classic, this...work of art."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an excellent book for any age reader. Harry is nothing more than an eleven-year-old wizard, but he has charmed his way into the hearts of millions of people already, old and young alike. If you read the first book in this outstandingly breathtaking series, you will ache to get your hands on the next. J.K. Rowling uses wonderful imagery and character descriptions as she unravels the story of a young wizard in a brand new world he'd never heard of until he became a part of it. I agree with Cho Chang in that from the moment you pick up this book to read, you can feel the energy of Harry's experiences. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is like a spell in itself. You will be bewitched from the beginning when poor Harry is sleeping in a cupboard under the stairs in the house of his \\"no-necked\\" uncle, \\"horse-faced\\" aunt, and \\"pig-like\\" cousin. From a seventeen-year-old girl's standpoint, it is a great book and definitely worth reading, no matter how old or young the reader."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Imagine living your life being the outcast of the family, living with your aunt and uncle who treat you like the dirt under their feet. This is the only life Harry Potter has ever known. One day he finds out that his aunt and uncle have been lying to him about his past. Harry finds out he is a wizard and receives an invitation from Hogwarts School of wizardry asking him to come and learn magic. Little does Harry know he is a famous well-known name among all wizards because he defeated the great evil lord Voldemort when he was only a baby. He is thrown into a magical world where the most famous sport is Quidditch, a game on brooms, and they have every flavor beans, I mean every flavor (pepper, strawberry, liver). He learns about a whole life he never knew existed and all about his past. This is a wonderful read for all ages because it is filled with fun, adventure, and humor. I recommend it to anyone who would like a good read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It has millions of life skills in it, friendship, courage ect.. I mean who wouldn't like it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Written by the imaginative mind of British author JK Rowling, Harry Potter &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone opens a world where unicorns, wizards, &amp; ghosts exist, where the slightest flick of a wand can take you places of enchantment, &amp; where pure evil is very real.The story opens at the 'Muggle' home of Vernon, Petunia, &amp; Dudley Dursley where it just so happens their orphaned nephew turns up on their doorstep. Instead of pity &amp; kindness, the Dursley's shove the infant into a cubard under the stairs in which he is to live, &amp; (like Cinderella) force him to become a servant. Harry grows up not knowing his true identity, not knowing why strange things happen to him, &amp; not knowing the truth of why he was orphaned to begin with.But everything happens in a instant when Harry recieves an odd letter in the mail, a letter that would forever change his life, a letter that would lead to riches, loyal friends, magic, &amp; danger. The letter that would lead to a place no mere mortal has ever been to, a place called Hogwarts."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The review written by Kirkus is a very interesting review. He summarized the story very well with many good discriptions. His review was about how the story portrayed itself and how Harry overcame his opsticles. The begining of his review was about how the novel was an award-winning one in England. He says also that it's toward an action-oriented readers. He gives the description of the story vey well and still manages to get readers to read it. Also leaving out important parts and most important the ending! I think Kirkus wrote a very intelligent review and it deserves prase."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a fabulous book. It had me enthralled from start to finish. I was rather leery, I must admit, when my aunt offered me the book. She told me, &quot;I tried to read them to my daughter, but got so wrapped up in reading it myself!&quot; So, I decided to give a try, and was completely engrossed from start to finish, and now find myself turning out to be a Harry Potter addict - going to the stores, hunting down the different books... what a great thing Ms. Rowling has done for children's books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am not going to go into a full description of this book, as I'm sure you've either read it, heard about it or read the other reviews.I received this book and the other two that were published at that time, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in around March 2000. I finished each book in one day and thouroughly enjoyed them all.Although J.K. Rowling is not my favourite author, Harry Potter is my favourite series. I have told my parents so much about Harry Potter, my father even told me who the Minister of Magic is (Cornelius Fudge)!I know Harry Potter may not appeal to everyone (More than a few children don't like it in my class), but please, just give it a try."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I recently read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

This is an excellent book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I first heard of the book from a friend who was reading it at the time. My friend encouraged me to read the book as well. I was amused by the fact that my friend never lifted an eyelid off the book while reading. It motivated me to buy the book, so I bought it that week.Harry Potter is a very real and lovable character. I never really seamed to embrace the fact that most of the people today have read the book, I think of Harry and his world as a friend and place that belonged only to me. I am transported into his form and feel what I think he would feel. I felt hate towards his life's long enemy, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named - which he did not know he had until his eleventh birthday. Harry felt so alone when he left for Hogworts, that I wished I were there to comfort him. I felt pure joy in the time he spent with his friends (Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, and Hagrid,) and pursue strange and thrilling adventures. I think this book is for anyone who likes fiction books.However, I have another side to my thoughts on the book. Although, (I am American and this might not even have to do with the fact that I am American,) it disappoints me that \`Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' has been changed to \`Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' to accommodate Americans. I feel that it is an insult to many people and to the author. Nevertheless, whereas the fact that many things have been changed in \`Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' for the convenience of Americans, it remains one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought this book was great.

I continued to read the rest of the series, and am looking forward to more upcoming books. I was first introduced to this book through the news. They said it was growing more popular than the Pokemon craze. (Boy were they right!) At fist I thought to myself, &quot;How good can it be, it's only a childrens' book!&quot;, but curiouser and curiouser I grew, and soon enough I got the book. I had totally misjudged it. The stroy line was absolutely amazing. I loved each and every single character in this book. I feel as if I already know them personaly. This book has so many twists and turns that it makes you not want to put the book down! The suspense, the action, and the adventure bring life to this book. I highly recomend &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; to anyone of any age because not only is it a good story, but also has many moral lessons in it such as friendship. It truely is a magical tale!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If you are looking for a book filled with jam-packed adventure and mystic tales, _Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone_ is the right book for you!

He then, attends Hogwart School of witchcraft and wizardry.There,Harry finds many new friends and never wants to go back home. Harry's parents,at one time were famous and caring witch and wizard's but were killed by the evil Lord Voldermort. Later, Harry faces Voldermort, and kills him. Is the evil one really dead for sure?

Then, about a month ago, I was really borded durring an overnight at work and picked up the first book. By the second chapter, I was hooked. I finsished it that night and went out and bought the next three books the next day: The Chamber of Secrets, Prisioner of Azkaban, and Goblet of Fire. Harry Potter is not just for kids. The characters are absolutly amazing and you fall in love with them immediately. The stories are purely enthralling. Rowling's immagination is unsurpasted and her imagery is beautiful. Harry Potter will make you laugh out loud, gasp in amazment, and keep you turning the pages to find out what adventure awaits there. These books are a must read. If you love The Chronicals of Narnia, you will also adore these wonderful books!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is the best book you will ever read by far. I usually do not like to read fantasy books, but this book really stood out from all the rest. With all the hype surrounding it I thought I would give it a try. I am glad I did! I guarantee you will get wrapped up easily in this book. The author J.K. Rowling enchants you with her superb use of words. I also like the way she made up words and incorporated them into the story.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a story about a boy who has no idea of his true identity until he starts to get mysterious letters in the mail saying the time is coming. His mother's relatives the Dursley's are scared by this so they run away from their home with Harry. They go to a little island and stay there over night. In the middle of the night a large man by the name of Hagrid is at the door. He takes Harry away from the Dursley's and brings him to Hogwarts the wizard academy. At this school he meets Ron and Hermonie they become new best friends. They go through many troubles but still maintain their friendship. Harry also picks up a very interesting sport called &quot;Quidditch.&quot; In this sport you fly around on a broomstick and the players try to find a flying golden ball named the &quot;snitch.&quot; Harry becomes extremely talented at this game! But there is something weird going on in the school, Harry and his friends try to find out what it is. To learn more about this book read it and find out for yourself.This book was full of excitement and laughter. This book was written in perfect chronological order. There was really nothing wrong with the way this book was writer except a few misspelled words here and there. This book overall was an easy 5 star rating. I think all the hype surrounding this book was true everything good said about this book was right. The bad things pointed out were not anything I agreed with. I strongly suggest you buy or at least read this book!! This enchanting tale is for approximately ages 9 and up. You will read it time and time again without getting sick of it. It just gets better and better each time! While it is still in stores go out and buy it so you can keep it for your children and their children. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best book you or I will ever read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The genre of this book is historical fiction because a lot ofthis story is true in different places such as castles which are inmany different places of the world. Three headed dogs have existed before while just this summer a two headed cat was born. With so many &quot;legends&quot; of witches and wizards, they must be real or where did they get the idea? Just because you don't see something doesn't mean it isn't there. It is also fiction because it came out of the author's head. There are many great characters in this book. The main main character is Harry Potter who is the boy that lived. He was the only person to survive Lord Voldemort. He got a scar but his parents got murdered. Harry discovered he was the most famous wizard when he was 10 years old. He goes to Hogwarts, a school of witchcraft and wizardry. Throughout the book he becomes the first first-year student in the century to become a Quidditch player. He keeps Lord Voldemort from getting the Sorcerer's Stone which would have let him live forever. Ron is Harry's best friend. He has 7 brothers and sisters that are mentioned throughout the book. Fred, George and Percy are the only ones who are still in Hogwarts. Hermione is the straight A student who saves Harry's neck millions of times. Snape is the Potions Master who hates Harry because he hated his dad, James Potter. Voldemort, A.K.A. YOU-KNOW-WHO, A.K.A. HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED, tried to kill harry as a baby and wants to live forever by stealing the sorcerer's stone. Voldemort gets Professor Quirrell to do his dirty work for him. The plot line is hilarious. For instance, Harry unleashes a boa constrictor, who has never seen South America, on his bratty cousin, Dudley. Harry's best friend, Ron, has twin brothers who always make wise cracks like mixing their names up into Gred and Forge instead of Fred and George. Another time in a game of Quidditch, Harry almost swallowed the Snitch, which is a small, walnut sized, very fast, flying ball with wings. The plot line is always surprising. Sometimes incredibly normal things happen, and sometimes, just plain old weird stuff happens. Harry nearly gets killed twenty times. For starters, Quirrell tries to curse his broom in a Quidditch match. Snape performs a counter curse and Hermione bumps into Quirrell so he can't perform the curse. Another time is when Marcus Flint blocks Harry and nearly knocks him off his broom. Harry nearly gets smashed into oblivion when he and Ron save Hermione from a troll. Harry almost got crushed in the Devil's Snare while he was trying to catch Snape. When Harry is in the Forbidden Forest, a Centaur saves him from Lord Voldemort's possible spell. I recommend this book to anybody because its plot line is easy to follow, it's hilarious, filled with adventure, near death experiences and plain old fun. On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the highest, I give it an 11!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"First of all, let me just say that the Harry Potter books are awesome. I'm 16 and love them, my 12 year old cousin loves them, and so does my 38 year old aunt. I've only read the first two and am working on the third. (My 12 year old cousin read all three in about a month.) These books are for people of all ages, I do however recommend that no one under maybe 10 read them, not because they're bad, but because they are longer books, and have some larger words. They do manage to make the reading go by quickly, and you'll never get tired of Harry. If you're up for some good, entertaing reading, and have a love of imaginative writing, then the Harry Potter are for you, not matter how old you are!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is by far the most outstanding novel I have ever read. Why, you may ask, has this Harry Potter tale (along with the others) become such a huge success? First of all, the characters are skillfully crafted. The struggles and triumphs of Harry, Hermione, Ron, etc. are easily related to the struggles and triumphs of today's generation. Then, there's the exciting plot. Let's face it: most, if not all of us, hate boring books with pedestrian plots. This novel grabs the reader's curiosity, due to the thrilling events in the story. Next, there is the despicable villian (essential in every good book!), Lord Voldemort. Finally, there is a suspenseful ending and an important lesson to be learned (of course, I will not disclose either one)! As you can easily see, these factors all contribute to the success of these stories. These days, I see many people devouring all three of the current Harry Potter tales, and I don't blame them!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"For some reason I put off reading the HP books for nearly a year. Then a friend handed me the tapes and said, &quot;Stop being stubborn. Listen to this. You'll love it.&quot; Well, she was right. After listening to the first tape, I couldn't get to the second and third book fast enough. These books are wonderful. They're fresh and creative and simply a delight to read or listen to. The narrator, Jim Dale, does an excellent job on the tapes, and Ms. Rowling deserves all the success she's received!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It took me a while to actually read the first Harry Potter book, as I am a fourteen-year old girl that is constantly busy with work and extracurricular activites, not to mention that I was skeptical at the idea of me enjoying a book that my eight year-old brother could read with facility. However, today, I was extremely bored, with it being the end of the school year, so I decided to read the Harry Potter book that I had heard so much about and it just so happened that it was sitting on my shelf that very moment. Once I started reading, and the hours passed, I found myself totally engrossed in the book and with the setting, the characters, the plot, everything! The fantasy of it all makes you feel little again, and as if you want to be right there with Harry Potter, going on all of his crazy adventures. The plot was also riveting and suspenseful, and I was absolutely addicted to it, and I cannot wait to read the rest of the series. This book was definitely a page-turner, and with its humor, charm, uniqueness, and a stellar surprise ending, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is definitely the book to read, no matter what age you may be."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My 13-year-old and I are reading the series, and I've just finished this first one.

I love Harry, a completely wonderful skinny boy with glasses who has strength, integrity and a wholesome vitality.

I'm sure ALL of you out there would have read this book, so I'm not writing an outline. But I'll just write about the parts which I liked best. In this book, I liked the part when Harry imagines that when the sorting hat is put over his head, it won't sort him in any house &amp; he'll be sent back home. I also liked the part where Dumbledore says &quot;I know all of you must be tires, so I'll just say a few words. Here they are...&quot; and he mumbles a few words. I started laughing.

It is a delightful read for adults (speaking from experience) as well as kids. Many of the previous reviews attack Rowling's use of the Cinderella story-line/theme. I don't think this use is a bad thing; there are several themes/stories that are used over and over, like the Cinderella story, because these themes are universal and appeal to a broad range of people. It's the new characters with their qualities and personalities, settings, and details that make each use of an old theme a new and viable story. True, it can make the overall story predictable at times, and this is not altogether untrue of &quot;The Sorcerer's Stone&quot;. But the characters have depth--their own style, personality, and values--as well as some of the human traits like hope, perseverance, courage, bravery, and loyalty, and also jealousy, cruelty, pettiness, and biasedness. There are a lot of things that spark the imagination--a new world to explore; fantastic, &quot;magical&quot; creatures; new games; and just plain magic.I would recommend that anyone with an imagination and a sense of adventure read this book. It is written for younger people, so much of the vocabulary is on that level. But even so, it is a good book for older people to read--to remind them of what being a kid is like at times, and for many, to reawaken their imaginations; and it's good for the younger set--to awaken and develop their imaginations and sense of possibilities."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A Poem: Harry Potter was a ten year old boy, Where he lived there wasn't much joy. His Mother and father were killed when he was small. His aunt, uncle and cousin weren't good roommates at all. In the mail a letter came, and Harry's life would not be the same. He found out that he was a wizard. With magic he would be using owls, magic wands and a lizard. His friend Hagrid was very helpful, but his wizard skils were somewhat doubtful. He went off to Hogwarts School, hoping he was not a magic fool. Ron and Hermione were his pals and of Voldemort the evil nobody tells."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Many thanks to Ms.Rowling for giving us such a wonderful character like Harry.

The ending was most compelling for a children's book with a perfect climax. My heart almost stopped at the climax.

They gave him bad clothing and they didn't let him do anything that was remotely fun. Until one day a mysterious letter comes in the mail telling him that he was supposed to go to a wizarding school that year. Harry at first doesn't know whether this is just a joke or if it's realy true. Then Harry Potter tries going to the school.

In &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone&quot; Harry goes off to Warthogs the school of witchcraft a wizardry.

It is the greatest fantasy that I have ever read in my life. I loved this book so much because I like books where anything can happen. When things seem impossible you don't think they are because you never would encounter a situation like it. J.K. Rowling knows how to write fantasy and thats the bottom line. He knows how to make a story have suspense and excitement. He gives the reader something to keep reading on and on all night long just to find out what happens in the end. I hope to read all of his books in the future and I hope that he writes many more exciting, suspense filled, fantasy novels in the future.

I mean, I'm sure they are just fine for the kids, but I've been an adult for a VERY long time. Well--I was WONDERFULLY surprised when I finally did start reading! Sure, the territory wasn't blazingly new--but it still had that quality that puts you right back into your childhood--with all the fun and fears and terrors and adventure and MAGIC that goes along with it.

I was hooked from that time on. I left the theatre and went and purchased the books. This first book is truly amazing. I am not sure how JK Rowling was able to create in such depth the Harry Potter world, but it is spectacular. I would recommend this book for ANY age person.

This is definitely a someone-read-out-loud-to-everyone-else book.Sephie age 10"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Just for the heck of it, I revisited this book the other day and a rush of memories came back to me, images of sitting on my parents couch and reading for hours while I ignored calls for dinner and neglected friends so I could read as much as I could. Sadly, I felt like I was reading the movie in my head; for some reason I can't shake Daniel Radcliffe as Harry or Rupert Grint as Ron and so on.This truly is a wonderful story. What works here are two primary things: one, Rowling appeals to the imagination in a lot of people. As children, it's hard not to reflect on dreams of being part of a magical world like this, a secret world away from the tribulations of a non-magic, Muggle world. The second thing being that Rowling is a strong writer. She writes with great detail for a kid's fiction; she maintains precision with her details without being vague and without condescending the reader into thinking they won't understand what she's describing.I thoroughly enjoyed (something I didn't notice as a child) the way she begins this book and essentially the whole series. She spends pages discussing the Dursley family and their stubborn desire for normalcy. Rowling focuses a great deal on Mr. Dursley and how he strives for happiness in his normal, non-magical life. What this accomplishes is stark contradiction that immediately creates mystery. We learn very quickly that Harry is a special child who had been involved in this terrific magical moment and forces readers to find out what they can about this new world.All in all, it's just a fantastic book and series. With eight movies out and of course the seven books, new readers can still immerse themselves in this culture and love it for what it's worth."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"JK Don't hesitate to Create a Series on Ohrers.

Thank you for your work."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The first in the series, Harry potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was published in September of 1998 by J.K. Rowling for children, but teens and adults of all ages have read this series. It's basicly about a young eleven year old boy named Harry Potter whose parents were killed by Voldemort, the main villan in the series, so Harry had to be raised by his aunt and uncle, who hated him, he was forced to live in a small closet under their stairs while his aunt and uncle's son, Dudley, lived upstairs and got everything he wanted. Then Harry started getting letters from a school known as Hogwarts, and Harry's uncle got angry and they moved out to a shack in the middle of the ocean because he thought that would stop the letters. But then Hagrid, the school's gamekeeper, hand delivered the letter on Harry's birthday, and he found out he was no normal child, he was a wizard. And the school that sent the letter? It was a school for witchcraft and wizardary.It's one of the best books I've ever read, and if I had to rate it on a scale of five, I'd give it a five."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling is a thrilling adventure through Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry.Harry Potter is about a famous boy named Harry who doesn't even know he's famous. One day the Dursleys started getting mail for Harry but Mr. Dursley won't let Harry read it. They kept getting more mail. Harry finally got a hold of one of the letters. It was an invitation to a school of magic called Hogwarts. Read it to find out what magical things there are.I think Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a great book for people who love fantasy books. I thought J.K.

I think everyone should read it because it's a great book for everyone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K.Rowling listen up!are you ready?OK her goes.....(drumroll please?)NEVER EVER STOP WRITING!!!!!!!!!!please?I mean it!I hope you heard meOh well"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Now the movies are over and its less likely I can parade my enthusiasm and the sheer joy I got from reading this. From the first chapter alone, it became increasingly obvious as to how J.K. Rowling ended up a millionaire (or is bigillionaire...?). I'd always been a BIG fan of the movies, but I didn't read the books based on my pre-Reading Obsession years when I didn't very much enjoy them. I realized, though, that at the time, I didn't have it in me to appreciate this series. Now, I do. Boy, do I! This book incites the fan girl (or boy) in you!Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is full of magic and adventure, sparkling story-telling, and is the embodiment of nearly every child's dream to run off to some foreign, magical place where excitement and danger is around every corner to chase off the boredom. What is so purely great about this first book (and I'm sure the others as well) is the effortless world-building that mirrors our own world in past and present spaces in our history. Nothing is over-done and it's plain how deep Rowling's knowledge of the world runs. From wands and cauldrons to magical beasts to wizarding sports, The Sorcerer's Stone will fascinate you at every plot turn and through every character. It ensnares your attention and leaves you craving the next book!I loved Harry. His book portrayal made me much more sensitive to his circumstances and feelings. Gosh, I can't tell you how many times this boy succeeded in making me cry! The cruelty of his care-givers had me fuming and crying all at the same time. And the feeling of loss for his parents strikes you throughout the course of the movie series, but it hits much harder after reading the books. Growing up with the movies, the movie adapted characters stuck with me while I was reading. I saw Emma Watson when I read Hermione, and Radcliffe and Grint and so on. It honestly made me love the book that much more!I appreciated the Big Mystery, and it was nice to go through the motions of unraveling it, because I had forgotten almost everything from the first movie. It was like starting fresh, and as I read the book I slowly began to recall what was going to happen. Strangely, that made it all the more exciting.Perhaps it is because Harry Potter has been dear to my heart all this time, being apart of the Harry Potter generation, that the entire book captivated me from start to finish, but I can truly say, without bias, that The Sorcerer's Stone is an enthralling, unique, and astoundingly overwhelming read! I can promise that I was as bewitched as Harry when, together, we stumbled upon the wizarding world, and absolutely guarantee that my friends will be finding the Harry Potter books in my bag until I'm done with the series!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm a librarian who insisted on committing the cardinal sin of ommission by never having read J.K. Rowling. I never could find the time. Enter the audiobook. It was an entertaining listen."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Listening to this on cd while on my current travel swing for work, I realized that I read most of the Potter books long before I started blogging on Livejournal, and definitely before I started putting so much effort into my book reviews here. I came to the Potter books relatively late: it wasn't until Goblet of Fire came out in hardcover that I gave in to the recommendations of the countless teenagers (and quite a few random adults) in my life who were virtually ordering me to read them. This first book hooked me enough to read the second; the second likewise; but it was the third, Prisoner of Azkaban, that made me a fan who would read the whole series in hardcover and buy the books the day they came out.Being the obsessive-compulsive I am when it comes to book series (and comic books, and tv shows on dvd, and ... okay, yeah, just about anything of a continuing nature), I also decided I had to have the Potter books on cd because they were performed by one of my all-time favorite actors, Jim Dale. I got the first four, lent them to various people ... and never actually got around to listening to them myself. The first two were returned in less-than-good condition (boxes crushed, cds scratched), and I pretty much tucked them away for a long time. Even with all the travel I've done the past four years, I kept avoiding bringing the Potter cds with me. I think perhaps I was afraid of aggravation at the skipping on the cds (which was not as bad as I thought it would be) and afraid of disappointment because I'd built Jim Dale's performance up so much in my head. A needless fear, as his performance is everything I thought it would be. His light tone fits this first book especially, and he makes the character voices distinct. Of course, the characters with the heaviest accents -- Hagrid, McGonnagle -- are the performances that most closely match the actors from the movies (Robbie Coltrane, Dame Maggie Smith), but for the most part Dale eschews trying to match the actors and just imbues the characters with his own take on what they would sound like. It's a wonderful performance overall.Because I never actually wrote a book review for this when I read it, I'll say a few words about the book itself. Listening to it, the joy I had in discovering an interesting new world returned. I entered Rowling's world not knowing much about it. I remember thinking her characters were a bit simple but not simplistic, if that makes sense. I took to Harry, Ron, Dumbledore and McGonnagle immediately in those early chapters; I wondered how much of a threat Draco would become as the series went on (the answer, of course, was \\"not much of one until HBP\\"). I knew early on that Snape would not turn out to be the major bad-guy of the book (the set-up for him to be the bad-guy was TOO obvious, something that really stands out in Dale's reading), although I didn't call the real villain's identity at all. Overall, I felt the book was a good start, and a nice tight little mystery on it's own. Had I read the book when it was first published, I'm not sure I would have immediately rushed out to grab the second book -- knowing books 1 through 4 were immediately available may have helped my decision to push on to the next book right away.I was very proud, the past few months, that my now-twelve-year-old nephew has decided to read the Potter books (after he'd read, and gotten me hooked on, the Percy Jackson books and I told him his excitement for the Jackson books matched my excitement for the Potter books). And I think that also played a part in my decision to \\"reread\\" the Potter series by listening to them on cd. I do plan, on the next travel swing, to bring Chamber of Secrets."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. It is about a wizard called Harry Potter who goes to the school \\"Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\\" The Head master there, Albus Dumbledore, had hidden the famous Sorcerer's Stone at the school. One night a wizard tried to steal it and Harry has to rescue it. This overall was a great book I strongly recommend this book to any one over 8."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Excellent book! It was a summer reading selection for myself and two daughters, ages 10 and 15. We all loved the adventure. You can identify with the characters, and I embarrassed myself by crying at the end while reading it out loud to my girls."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Clearly the target audience is juvenile/young adult readers, which is fine. I commend Rowling for building an entire world around Hogwart's, especially one large enough to sustain a 7-book series.One thing that I would have liked to see in the book is a little more interaction with the Dursleys when Harry was at Hogwarts. The evolution of the Harry Potter world is interesting, but is somewhat trite and predictable. Nevertheless, it was enjoyable."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is what I wrote as a review for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.After reading book one, I can defenitely see why these stories were so popular. The author does a great job of creating suspense throughout the whole book. She sets you up to believe one thing and then surprises you in the ending. She sparks your imagination with the fantasy world and life at a wizard school. But I think there are two themes that come out in this book that touched me the most:1. The rise of the underdog. Harry Potter is raised in a family that doesn't value him; his peers in school don't value him;he is a true underdog. But he is famous in this other world of wizardry because he (as an infant) had defeated the great dark wizard. Many kids and adults can relate to Harry's circumstance of be devalued by the culture, society, world in which you live in. You do find yourself rooting for him throughout the book.Years ago we went to a family camp and the speaker used movies throughout the weekend. One thing he said has always stuck with Acey and me. He talked about movies being the modern day parables, similar to the stories which were used in the Bible. How many times do you find yourself relating to a scene in a movie, or being brought to tears by something protrayed on the big screen. Yet these parables need to be interpreted in light of Biblical thinking. Why do these scenes, themes, shows touch us at the core?2. In light of that, Acey asked me today when I finished the book what was the spiritual theme that needs to be redeemed in this book? As I began to think about his question it came down to the the last chapter when Harry asks the trustworthy Dumbledore for some answers to his mysterious life.One question he asks is why the bad character in this story, Quirrell, couldn't hold on to him and was acutally burned when he tried to touch him. Dumbledore's response brought tears to my eyes: \\"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort (the dark wizard who tried to kill Harry) cannot understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leave its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign...to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul wiht Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\\"Isn't that the message of Christ. Christ died to save us. If there is one thing Satan does not understand it is love. Christ's love leaves its own mark on our lives. To have been so loved by God that He sent His only Son, Jesus into the world is what stirs our hearts that are so desperetley seeking love. This belief in what Christ has done will give us protection forever from the the enemy who desires to destroy us.My conclusion as a Christian parent is that I would allow my children to read this first book under two conditions: (I am only concluding this about the first book so far...I haven't read the others)1. I get to read it with them2. They have to discuss it with me.This allows me to talk about what is true, what is fiction. It helps me to find out what things from the story they are connecting with. And in the end it allows me another opportunity to present the gospel to my kids."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Great book and seller. Fast shipper and the book was in better than new condition. Thanks"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book that started it all. I remember my mom giving me this book when i was seven and I didn't want to read it at all. Then she started reading it to me and i was enchanted by it. Not only the storyline is fantastic, but the way its written just mesmerizes me.A few years have past from then but I still read this book and its sequels over and over again and its become my favorite series off all time.also, it opened up the world of reading for me and if it weren't for this book, I would probably be stuck playing videogames all day instead of reading beautiful pieces of literacy.Thank you JK Rowling."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Trolls, wizards and warlocks are only a few of the challenges ten-year-old Harry Potter must face in his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry grew up with his \\"muggle\\" family never knowing of the future that waited for him or of the past he held. Along with his friends, Ron and Hermoine and Hagrid, Harry faces his first year away from the Dursleys. This book is an exciting adventure for both young readers and the adult audience. The language J.K Rowling uses also makes the book appropriate for all ages. She uses words that children can understand but places them in ways to still hold the adult reader's attention. She also uses amusing vocabulary to hold the attention such as \\"muggles\\" instead of saying unmagical humans and other words such as Quidditch. The characterization Rowling uses is also wonderful because she makes them so believable. Dumledore is shown as being full of wisdom and helps harry many times like a teacher should. A reader from Seattle, WA believes that this book is turning children away from Christian belief. This reader believes that the school in the story is giving children a realistic belief in witchcraft. My theory is that the point of this book is not satanic but focuses more on Harry's experiences. Harry Potter is shown to be a little boy who is not only small for his age but also discouraged by many such as the Dursleys and Professor Snape to do no good in life. Many children feel this way and I believe J.K. Rowlings uses Harry as the example because he ends up saving the day numerous times. I believe Harry Potter is the King Author of the millennium. Much like King Author, Harry is a small boy who in appearance does not look as though he will amount to much but they both end up as the hero in the end."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A Great Book For Any AgeI'm a seventeen year-old and a junior in Enlgish III Pre-AP. When I saw Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone on my independent reading list, I decided I'd read it to see why it received so much publicity. I really enjoyed reading this book and I have seen for myself what makes it such an excellent book to read. It is filled with magic, mystery, suspense, and humor. J.K. Rowling did a wonderful job on describing and presenting details to give you a clear picture on all the characters and everything that is happening. The vocabulary that she used in the book, I thought was very neat. Humans that had no magic abilities were called \\"muggles\\". She even explained a game the wizards played called \\"quidditch\\" which reminds me of a game of hockey, but with the techniques of football, and baseball combined along with it. And most importantly she makes the main character (Harry Potter) an easy individual to admire. The reader can understand the dilemmas he is going through and feel sorry for Harry. When Harry gets awarded points for Gryffindor (his dormitory at Hogwarts School) the reader rejoices, like an audience in the stands when a touchdown is made. Harry Potter is definitely a fun, good book for anyone to read whether you are 8 or 82."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Rowling has done what few, but great, others have. She has created an enjoyable read appealing to the fancy and imagination of all age groups, by masterfully binding each fiber of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone closely together and building each detail upon the other. The vocabulary increases gradually with reading, but with ample context clues so as not to lose the children with words they do not know. She also creates a language all her own, throwing in artistic and ingenious words like muggles, knuts, galleons, and many more to add a mystic air to the storyline. Rowling came up with games played with live chess pieces and a sort of soccer in air, called Quidditch. She fabricated pictures in which the people don't stay still, they move and much more. She created a fanciful journey filled with dragons and bullies, unicorns and evil wizards that keep the pages turning. She gives Harry a whole life history in the first few chapters and continues building on him, adding new pieces to his life and adventures. We first find out what life is like for Harry with his Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and cousin Dudley. Life there, with them, is horrible. He sleeps in a little closet under the stairs and always seems to get in trouble for something he cannot even remember doing or cannot control, like when they cut his hair and it all grew back. This part goes into great detail of how he was treated at home and at school. Then, a magical letter appears that changes his life for the better, because along with it comes the key to a mystical world of enchantment and adventure, danger and courage, a world of witches and wizards, where he can finally fit in. He and his friends, Ron and Hermoine, come across adventures right and left with Draco Malfoy, Magrid, trolls, centaurs, and others. However, underlying it all in a shroud of mystery is a small, brown, package picked up from Grigotts the very day an attempt to steal it was made. Although she goes to great depths of Harry's life with where he came from, how he's lived, and such, she didn't go into all that much detail with the sidekicks, which creates in them a quality of mystery. All in all, I agree with Matchgirl's review when she wrote, \\"She has built a superb story from the ground up...\\". Rowling is like the Poe of children's fantasy books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was originally disinterested in reading Harry Potter - after all, everyone and their mother was doing it, and I perversely refused. I also prefer my magic to be &quot;higher&quot; - think The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper. However, I finally broke down and read this book and its sequel, and I am glad that I did. J. K. Rowling's imagery is bright and well-visualized, and her character development is excellent. Second to none, though, is her ability to define the plot and keep it moving at a pleasant, snappy pace. This is a refreshing change from many stories, which either get bogged down in the details or move the action along too quickly. These books are a good read and shouldn't take more than a few days for the experienced reader. They are also excellent read-to-me books, as evidenced by my mother's fourth-grade students, who hung on every word!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This debut novel and the starting book of the Harry Potter 7-part series captivates you and make you read until the last sentence. Many people have banned the Harry Potter series because of the witchcraft and wizardry thing. This is an insult to the Wicca world. I am not a Wicca but I have friends who are Wiccas and I am sure that they feel insulted by it. Some people have no compassion and are so selfish that they can't even think about anything else but themselves. People who ban the series really need to get a life. Anyway, I really loved this first novel by J.K. Rowling. Magical Stuff. I couldn't put it down for a second after I started reading the first page. When Harry discovers he's been lied to by his (really cruel) relatives, Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, all this years, he also finds out that he's of magical blood. Son of James and Lily Potter, former head prefects of Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry and the victims of Lord Voldemort, the most feared wizard on the Dark Side that even folks are scared to even mention his name. They refer to him as &quot;You Know Who&quot;. On the school train, Hogwarts Express, Harry meets his future best friends, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. He also meets his arch-rival, Draco Malfoy and his two sidekicks, Crabbe and Goyle. All sorts of magical stuff begin to happen the moment Harry steps onto the grounds of the prestigious school, Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This is a book that anyone who loves adventure and magical stuff and not racists should read!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have to admit, I was pretty annoyed when my mom made me start reading this series. I knew the books couldn't be all that bad, if so many grownups gave them good reviews, but I still wasn't all that inclined to pick the first one up. I had just finished reading Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, so, as you can imagine, Harry Potter was a bit of a change.Despite all this, I was utterly amazed by how good the story was. In fact, I hardly did any homework for an entire week as I blazed through the rest of the other books in the series, and I'm breathlessly waiting for number five. In fact, I finished numbers two and three in a a day each, and number four in two. I have never been able to stick with one genre for so many pages in a row. For instance, I could never read The Fountainhead, one of Rand's other books, just after reading Atlas. It just wouldn't work, far too dense, even though Atlas was an excellent book. Yet, with these Harry Potter books, I've been left yearning for more. JK Rowling has an amazingly annoying talent for leaving her readers without any good stopping places. Once you finish a chapter, some amazing new adventure crops up, and you have to physically tear youself away from the beckoning pages. In fact, for three or four nights in a row I stayed up until 12:30 reading, until I realized I had probably better get in bed for school the next day.I started reading this series because my mom made me, with the added incentive of buying me a book or two off of Amazon.com for every extra book in the series I read. Now, although I'll probably hold her to it, I don't need an incentive to read the books; I need one, and a damn good one, just to keep away from them. In short, I'm asking all of the skeptics out there to put aside their pride and pick up this book. Soon, you'll be swept up into the magical world inside, full of adventure, humor, wit, and danger just like I was. Without a doubt, you'll also end up like me, begging for JK Rowling to just hurry up with No. 5..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What a great series!

This story is very entertaining, and I find it to be very unpredictable, because it's nonstop excitement.

I highly recommend this book and the Harry Potter series for all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A Harry's, parents are killed by an evil wizard, Voldemort , which makes him famous because he survived. He has to move in with his only family, the Dursleys, who are muggles and later gets a letter inviting him to Hogwarts, school of wizardry. When he goes to the school he meets friends, which is something he has never had before and has to over come many tretcherous obsticals to get through the school year alive. You should really read this book to find out what happens. It is very exciting and leaves you on the edge of your seat and you will not want to put it down untill your completely finished. I strongly believe that Ms. Rowling's book: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a five-star rated book, that is fun for all readers, young and old. I did not believe the book would be that well written since it was wrote for young children. But once I started reading it I became so intangled in it that I would not go to bed the second night of reading it untill I finished it. Who wouldn't want to put down a book that talks about muggles, every flavored beans (that even have the taste of grass and sardines), and Harry's best friend is a giant named, Hagrid. Muggles, ordinary people like you and I, who are not supposed to know about the school of witches and wizardry, Hogworts, but now the secrets out, all the muggles know now. They play games on broomsticks, with a golden snitch, ball that has wings. How you supposed to catch a ball when it's flying away from you? Harry's aunt and uncle, the Dursleys, did not want anything to do with the begrudging wizardry or even Harry, at that matter. They disbelieved in wizardry and witches, just like we have people in our world that do not believe in religion. The magic in this book is a metaphor to our religion. Their school being yet, so off the wall from ours is yet so similar to ours. When they act up or are found in places they are not supposed to be (unauthorized areas), they get points deducted from their house just as we get detention. Harry is just an ordinary boy in his world, even though he is so different than you and I. So who wouldn't want to live in the exciting world of Harry Potter, or at least, who wouldn't like to read these marvelous books written by a very good author, J.K. Rowlings. I totally disagree with the review that I read about Ms. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, which rated it with two stars. I strongly believe it is a five-star book, that is a good read for those young and old. You say it might be exciting now but it will be forgotten by next Tuesday, well its lasted four books now and has not been forgotten and people are awaiting the arrival of the fifth already. My mom would rather my siblings and I to read a book we are interested in than a boring book like James and the Giant Peach. If you can write a book that entises fifth graders to get off their Nintendos and sign off the internet, where they are probably looking at things they shouldn't, than you are really an educated writer because that is a hard thing to do, get children interested in reading."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"First of all, let me say I am a female with grown children. I had heard all the \\"Potter\\" hype but bought the book on a lark to read on the plane (some friends who were teachers recommended it to me). By the end of the first chapter I was totally smitten; in fact, I couldn't put it down! This book reminded me of a combination of the old fairy tales I grew up with. Perhaps a combination of the brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen. There are the sweet heros & heroines, the protaganists, the adventures, and the wonderfully happy ending! Character development is fabulous and Rawling's descriptions are perfect. I have also read this book to a couple of my 4th grade classes and my students were also mesmerized with the story. I would have loved to have gone to Hogwarts myself!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A trademark of good children's literature is that it can be read and enjoyed by adults. Now, this particular adult admits that he has not particularly enjoyed Rowling's book, despite the considerable effort he has put into trying. I cannot and will not judge its educational value, since there have been many books I've read as a child which had very little such content (such as Roald Dahl's books; and what is the educational value of Winnie the Pooh, exactly, besides being the world's most adorable bear?).I can't find any faults with Rowling's writing, but on the other hand I can't find any virtues, either. Rowling's imagination is nothing more than the conscious and unconscious borrowing of cultural motifs and the mixing of them together, hoping that if she'll mix enough different motifs we won't be able to recognize them. I don't even think Rowling herself realized how lacking in originality her book is. Example: the three headed dog guarding the underground - Greek mythology. The chess game - Alice in Wonderland. Boy sent to cruel relatives (and then gets back at relatives) -almost all of Roald Dahl's books. I don't buy her arguement that these were done intentionally, and even if they were, borrowing without bounds from other works doesn't make your work any deeper or more meaningful. It's all form, not content.I suppose Harry Potter has its merits and little children do enjoy reading it, but adults, unless they have a special interest in children's literature, should really try out for more adult fiction - Rowling's characters are simply one dimensional and uninteresting. If you're really feeling a rush of nostalgia, why not check out more magical children's books? George Macdonald's works are just as good today as they were in the 19th century, and Roald Dahl's books are hilarious. Life is too short to waste on mediocre fiction such as this."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Of course, I just made up the words I used in the subject for this review and likened them to some of the words Harry and his friends used while performing \\"spells\\" at wizard school. The gist of my words translates to \\"Totally Perfect Reading.\\"Just one chapter into this book and already I could see what all the hoopla is about. With just seventeen written pages, J.K. Rowlands has taken me out of Pennsylvania and transported me to Privet Drive, the soon to be home of one Harry Potter. Not only did I unexpectedly enjoy this book, but I loved the feel of the smooth pages and the very different feel of the cover as well. This turned out to be one great reading experience. Since the book was written for young adults, it didn't even require me to read between the lines, as everything is right out there at your disposal. Each chapter was an adventure and all I had to do was read away.Since a number of reviewers have already explained the plot, I'll give you a crash course in Harry Potter 101....Harry is a boy with wizard powers...Muggles are people like you and me who don't have any unusual powers...Hogwarts is the school of Witchcraft and Wizardry where Harry attends...Ron and Hermione are Harry's best friends at Hogwarts...Quidditch is similar to our soccer but is played in the air on broomsticks...The Sorcerer's Stone can be dangerous if put in the wrong handsIf you're like me, then you're probably thinking, \\"I'm a grown person...why would I read this book?\\" Well, think again. The phenomenon of Harry Potter is one that is well deserved and it is only after reading this book, that I was able to come to that realization. It is so clever that it's no wonder it has captured the hearts of all the young kids today. And what a perfect time I chose to be reading it - during the week that the movie is premiering. Every day I see clips on TV showing scenes I had just read - what fun!I remember those days when my son was young and I got to see all the new and exciting kid's movies simply by taking him. At 17, he's no longer interested in going with me but my daughter (25) will be home for Thanksgiving and has promised to accompany me. It's a good thing I have kids. Otherwise my husband would be seeing Harry Potter with me because, after reading the book, there's no way I'm not seeing the movie."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It took me a long time to choose reading this first Harry Potter book. My primary hesitation was that it is a children&#8217;s book and I wasn't sure if I wanted to invest the time. I was also concerned about all the attention to its&#8217; occult references.Having finished reading it, I can honestly say that this is a really sweet, compelling story and a pleasant read. Rowling has done a fine job of building a story in the Roald Dahl mode. You know where &#8220;certain&#8221; adults are simply irredeemably cruel, countered by a truly innocent character. In this case, an innocent Harry Potter is counterbalanced against his cruel Aunt, Uncle and cousin.As I said, like Dahl&#8217;s characters, Harry is simply a victim of circumstances but his true character is intact, strong and courageous. There is a confidence about him that seems to give him strength. Like all escapist fantasy, this story just seems to strike a common chord with so many people. I liked it a great deal. Additionally, I think the author does a really good job of introducing us to this otherworldly place of wizards and witches since Harry learns along with us.That being said, and as a Christian, I found constant references to witchcraft, spells and dark magic to be really bothersome. I can accept it as a plot device for the foundation of a fantasy book. The witchcraft and wizardry in this book is similar to that made-for-television witchcraft, in so much that some people have inherited magic genetically while others do not in the variety of Darren and Samantha Stevens. This sort of witchcraft simply doesn&#8217;t exist in reality. Real witchcraft is dark and sad. I am concerned that undiscerning kids would take their fascination with the story and explore the real thing.With all that in mind, I would have loved this series when I was a kid. I&#8217;ll allow my children to read it when they can discern (they&#8217;re too young to read now anyway). I would suggest that parents read it too. I think it's important to be involved in your kids&#8217; activities and this is certainly a very quick read.People who criticize this series for occult content based on presuppositions without reading it should be ashamed. It is a good piece of work and not worth the negative attention. Though Rowling is probably experiencing the truth of the phrase, &#8220;There is no such thing as bad publicity.&#8221; I&#8217;ll look forward to the movies."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"if you want to read good action get the Harry Potter book.Harrys parents are dead so he has to live with the Durslys and their son Dudley.Dudiey and his famly treat Harry like a pile of beans.Then Harry find out he is a poweful wizerd and he needs to go to a special school.If you want to find out more get the book and start reading."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter had a horrible childhood being bossed around by his slave driving Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. His Uncle and Aunt forced him to live in a cupboard under the stairs which he has lived in for nearly 11 years.

For instance, letters start being sent to Harry's house addressed specifically to the cupboard under the stairs.The letters state that Harry is not a muggle (none magical folk) but a wizard who is to attend a wizarding school at Hogwarts. The day Harry arrives at Hogwarts is the point of the story where all the fun and excitement happened. He meets two friends Ron and Hermione who become best friends. Harry also meets an enemy almost instantly, Draco Malfoy. Harry gets into a lot of sticky situations and meets new people. At one part Harry even comes in contact with the most powerful wizard of all times, Lord Voldermort.This book not only expands the imagination but it's a real treat for people of all ages.

I'll probably read the others (I have kids, so it's only a matter of time). After the first book, I must say I enjoyed the reading, but I'm not a fanatic yet: I have heard that the series started strong and gets better, so I'm looking forward to it.Rowling writes a lively, accessible story that is well-crafted and draws her readers in. She also has a good feeling for what moves her readers: anxieties about isolation and friendlessness, mistreatment by those in authority (the Dursleys) or the loss of parents; search for a sense of belonging and true community.Rowling's hero is an admirable optimist. Despite all mistreatment, he perseveres and in the end receives a hero's welcome from his peers.Rawlings is not condescending, and she never shrinks from naming evil. In fact, one of the traits that separates Harry from others at Hogwarts (even adults), is that he refuses to call the nemesis \\"You-know-who\\" and insists on referring to him by his name, \\"Valdemort.\\"A thoroughly enjoyable read. I'm looking forward to the others."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The first Harry Potter book is a gift for everyone who has ever dreamed of being someone special and doing something important. That, of course, is all of us. The real world today so often seems utterly crazy. When I get tired of it all, it is so pleasant to read Harry Potter again."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is first of a seven book story the school life of the now famous character Harry Potter.This is an ongoing story of a young wizard and his pals coming of age and his adventures in learning how to deal with people and situations that become more of a challenge as he advances through age. This first book is lighter hearted as Harry is still young sees the world in black and white, with true heroes and those that must not be named. The book can stand alone however the story really spans seven books and as Harry grows up the world is no linger black and whit but murky yet thrilling.There is a lot more depth and research that went into this series than the superficial story that holds it together. You may want to pick up some of the supplementary books and the one describing where J.K. Rowling picked up the background information.What I fond to be fun is to collect different covers of the book. One of me favorite is the Paperback from England that shows a real train instead of the comic train version.If you are real adventurous the book has been translated into several languages including Latin."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am not telling the story here, if you don't know it you should relly read the book. I think that Rowling's books about Harry Potter filled a gap left by such monumentous children's authors like Enid Blyton, Rosemary Sutcliffe, Beatrix Potter, etc. There was just nothing like them when Rowling entered the scene. Rowling very cleverly contrasts a dreary British suburban middle class existence with the dreamlike magic of Hogwarts. In essence, Rowling manages to capture all our dreams of escaping our dreary lives, fleeing to somewhere where dreams come true, and that our existence has meaning - we are someone special! Other authors write excellent children's books - Pratchett and Gainman for instance, but they are either a bit to frightening or too adult for most children. Rowling's strength is that her language is very simple, but the themes she deal with are very real and imprtant, and most of us can relate to them. Harry likes being special, but he also sees that being special will draw him unwanted attention. He learns the magic, but power also attracts danger. There are two sides to every coin, and Rowling makes that clear from the beginning.At one level, these books are escapism, but on another, more subtle, level they are an introduction to adult life."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Here goes with the much needed review number 5,040 of \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\"- as of this writing. It'll be a little difficult to say anything that hasn't already been said many times over by others, and probably much better at that, but I'll give it a whirl. This will also be from the viewpoint of a 48 year old Bible-thumper, so perhaps it will give some different perspective.The story, as everyone knows by now, begins in a fine Dickensian, young adult literature tradition. Like \\"Wolves of Willoughby Chase\\", \\"Great Expectations\\", and a multitude of other young adult novels,the protagonist is an orphan brought up in a tough spot without much love. Harry is watched from afar down through the years by other witches and wizards, and finally they make known to him that he is a bit special, to say the least. It would at this point disintegrate to a \\"Prince and the Pauper\\" kind of rags to riches story, except that Harry must still stay dependent on his unpleasant relations, a process that has the effect of keeping him humble and a bit grounded. He also has the blessing of falling in with the right crowd, and making some great friends.The first time I read one of the Potter books I knew I was in for the kind of enchantment I'd not encountered since the Lord of the Rings. Vivid, exciting, they immediately lift one to a place reservered for the loftiest of fantasties. Lots of good versus evil, and in the tradition of Lewis, magic can be either, and lots of drama. Only occasionally does one feel that Rowling has forgotten what it's like to be a kid, and even rarer does one feel preached at or condescended to.The books are problematic theologically, no doubt about it- and I sometimes wonder if they are not unwittingly part of a larger push to make the dark supernatural attractive. It's not so much that they are evil in and of themselves, in fact I think they are quite the opposite- although clearly Rowling is not an apologist like Lewis. Rather, the problem comes more from the mood it helps to set- that \\"magic isn't all that bad\\"- and that kids starved for a supernatural encounter have nowhere else to turn save the occult. This is not true, but few Christian authors have come even close- Peretti comes to mind as one, and Lewis's muse George MacDonald is another- to opening this possibility to the young mind. I have no kids, but I probably wouldn't let very young kids read HP until they were able to determine good and evil at a fairly sophisticated level for themselves.I also read the book in German, one of the first books I've ever read in another language. I'd read it twice in English, so the story wasn't all that tough to follow in German. For the record, it translated pretty well and I thoroughly enjoyed it in both languages. I think it's some of the best new literature out-for kids or adults, and even the larger and less well edited later volumes of the HP series I've thoroughly enjoyed as well. To compare to Lewis one last time- if you're looking for good theology, dry intellectual humor, and well developed characters, then go with the Chronicles of Narnia. If you're looking for a more in-depth view of a child's world through modern eyes with less theology, and the most vivid, vibrant, alternate world you've ever encountered, then Rowling is choice one. Reading them both is best. And you might want to track down some old George MacDonald as well- \\"The Princess and Curdie\\" or \\"The Princess and the Goblin\\"."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I picked up this book to read a couple of years ago I hadn't read anything in quite awhile. I fully expected not to like it and most likely put it aside before I finished. My expectations were very wrong. The book grabbed my attention from the beginning and drew me into the magical world. I found it hard to put down. I read all the other books in the series and found myself anxiously waiting for the completion of the series. I have read that Harry Potter inspired children to read. I can honestly say that Harry Potter inspired me to start reading again - on average one to two books per week. Thanks Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is an orphan that has to live with his aunt and uncle that treat him as a slave. Harry was like a maid to them. He never received any letter because nobody knew him but one day he received a mail but not any class of mail. Uncle Vernon realized that if they stayed in the house Harry would discover he was a wizard so they moved to the middle of the sea in a little house. Either aunt Petunia or uncle Vernon let Harry read his mail. Until his birthday a gigantic man broke the door and brought Harry his only present and also let him read his letter, his name was Hagrid.J.k Rowling is a great author that expresses all the fillings of her characters. When she wrote her first book, Harry Potter and the Socere's stone, it immediately caught my attention. When I first read it J.K Rowling made me feel completely into the story not even my cell-phone could distract me. Many parents are against this novel because of the witchcraft but if you take that away the vocabulary, the word choice it is excellent is one of the best in the whole world, it also has a lot of show-not-tell."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I will start off by saying I still know dozens of people who have yet to read this book. I was one of them until very recently.Fear not the stereotype that this book is children's fiction. J. K. Rowling has given us a book that isn't all magic and fancifulness. Sorcerer's Stone is an incredible murder-mystery. And here is where I, a fan of Agatha Christie and Alistair MacLean novels, have found an alternate reason to tell skeptics, or late-comers, to read this book.Ms. Rowling has already written a good portion of an adult mystery novel (while on a break from Books 4 and 5), and it comes as no surprise. Her published novels are so well thought out, you will turn the pages at the end of the book to find resolution on subjects that you may have completely forgotten about, or thought unimportant. Everything comes together beautifully. There is one major question here that leaves this book impossible to read merely as a solo effort: why does Voldemort want Harry Potter dead?Ah, well, there you must read about Years Two, Three, Four, Five, soon Six, and conclude with Seven eventually. Then, and only then, will Year One: The Sorcerer's Stone come full circle and that last question will be answered.Rowling has produced a novel that is so intricate and complex, while so immensely enjoyable, that re-reading it is an incredible experience. There are things that will click, make you think, Ah! a character clandestinely introduced to me here but who doesn't appear until much later, or a magical gizmo that comes to play farther down the timeline.I am honored to be a part of the (at this time) 5000 reviewers who are proud to share this story with friends, and strangers (you, hopefully!) alike."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Hands down, I've read this book five times.

There is such joy in Rowling's writing. Such fun and danger and such wonder. My only complaint is that it should have been longer. There is so much to cover in Harry's first year at Hogwarts that it could have been a few hundred more pages easily. The Sorcerer's Stone sets the stage for the brilliance to follow and one can't help but get caught up in the fun.Thanks Mrs. Rowling, you are the true magician."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Envision living in a world where just about anything imaginable is real and alive.

What if J. K. Rowling were to think you up? Who would you be? What powers would you hold? Where in this strange new, yet ancient world of Harry Potter's would you belong? Would you be mean, would you be kind, would you be old or young or brave, or dastardly or perhaps dead? Oh, I wish I could really live inside J. K.

I along with the rest of the people in the world who have read it, am bewitched. It is a wonderous book, filled with excitement! I would definately not cast this is a &quot;Kids Only&quot; book. Rowling's writing allows the story to progress at a natural pace, with a very moving climax. After you read it, you want more. Some people have said that this book is not good, and there is too many hate themes...I say that it is about being a kid and having adventures. It is about friendship, pain, excitement, horror...some things every kid and adult knows about.Each character has his or her own flaws and is not perfect, even Harry. But they are all likeable, especially when working together. It shows the power of the friendship between them. I have also heard that there is not a likeable person in the book, that you can't relate or what not. How untrue! I feel just like Harry, and can relate to Ron.

There is nothing overly difficult about reading these books and they are a quick one day read for most adults. There are some interesting child-sized philosophical questions for children (i.e. in the second book Rowling exposes the superficial as nothing more than a moron with a nice smile in Gilderoy Lockhart.) These books send a clear message that money, good looks and a fast broomstick are not the end all--that there is more to life than just the material.The only problem I have with Rowling's writing style is that she is not very tidy. Rowling leaves loose ends untied like how Harry got his invisible cloak back in the first book or how Harry got his wand back at the end of the second.Otherwise, Rowling is a natural with a knack for detail and wit. There is a great deal of tongue in cheek humor that had me, along with other adult readers I know, rolling. The books appeal to both children and adults with humor a child would not be able to understand, but presented in such a way that a child would never know they had missed something. This is a very sophisticated way to appeal to a larger audience and something Rowling should be applauded for.These books are great for reading outloud to children."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think this book is really cool and interesting....it brings you none stop excitment.And you never want to put the book down...i rate this book(in my view of it)a 2 thumbs up...for all the young readers who havent even heard of harry potter take my advice and read it...thanks for reading this"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling, Harry was just a boy. He had no signifacance in his life at all. He lived with a Muggle family, the Dursleys. They hated him; to them he was nothing. Little did they know that Harry would be leaving them for a whole new world. As time went by Harry had started to recieve letters from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Soon after came Hagrid, the keeper of the keys. Hagrid took Harry even after all Mr. Dursleys complaints to where he would get his school supplies. When he returned, Hagrid gave Harry a ticket for platform nine and three-quarters. As strange as it sounded, Harry got there the next day with the help of the Dursley family. As soon as they reach Hogwarts the adventures began. First, they have to be sorted into houses they will be in, each first years sit under the cap and she screams out their house. Harry is as nervous as anyone, &quot;GRYFFINDOR&quot; the hat shouts. Harry goes through every thing from flying too high, to making it onto the Quidditch team, to seeing his family in The Mirror of Erised, and then from going into the forbidden forest to find out the mystery of the Unicorn's death. But he major adventure for Harry, Ron and Hermione will be to find the Sorcerer's Stone before Vold...OOPS! I mean you'll have to find out for yourself. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy books. It is always hard for me to find a book I can enjoy, but this one hit the spot. It has a great narrative hook that will grab you and pull you into Hogwarts as Harry, Ron and Hermione. Once you pick it up you can't put it down. Each chapter has it's own adventures. I can't wair to read the rest of Rowling's books. But remember, watch our for Vold.... OOPS! I almost gave the secret away again."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is a novel based on fantasy and variety. The simple structure of the book makes for a easy read but the complex content is stimulating and very enjoyable. Everyone, children, adults, elders, everyone, can relate to the fantasy. Harry Potter brings this mysticle fantasy to each person that each of us tend to grow out of, yet we a capable of connecting with the fantasy and believing it. Honestly, i think that there is noone in in the country who cannot enjoy Harry Potter. With the play on words and mysticle themes Harry Potter can touch even the most conservative adults. Therefore i strongly believe that everyone should take the time to atleast read one of the collection."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone was an excellent book. This book is a very fun and exciting novel. Throughout this book there are many differnent sub-plots. At first Harry Potter was a normal kid until he received a letter stating that he had been accepted to Hogwarts School of Wizardy and Witchcraft. While at Hogwarts Harry encounters many different problems. Some of these problems consist of Harry trying to obtain the Sorcerers Stone before Professor Snape,a teacher at Hogwarts, could. The reason Snape wanted the stone was because once you have it you become immortal. At the end of the book the stone gets destroyed so none of this would happen again. I would recommend this book because it is very fun-filled and exciting to read especially when Harry is trying to get to the Sorcerers Stone at the end of the book before Snape could. This book appeals to any age group. If you enjoy a book that has unexpecting turns and is very interesting I recommend you to read this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Although the first book in this wonderful series is not the best compared to the other three, it is still a marvelous read that any reader would enjoy/.The story is about young orphan Harry Potter and his life as an 11 year old boy.

After Harry starts receiving mysterious letters Uncle Dursley moves everybody out to a shack in the sea. Late one night a huge giant by the name of Hagrid shows up and he takes Harry and explains that Harry is a wizard and a famous one too.

At school he meets many new people like soon to be best friends Ron and Hermione and the horrible Draco MAlfoy. The Sorting Hat puts Harry in the Gryffindor house along with Hermione and Ron.

It has a lot of different characters and some weird and funny names. When I saw the book my teacher said it was selling fast and very popular. I wanted it because she said it was popular and everybody wanted it. When I got the book and started to read it, I started to get into the book. The beginning couple of lines were great! So after that I couldn't stop reading it. It was like I was inside the book. I didn't even hear anything around me! This is one of my favorite books. I hope there are more books out in libraries like Harry Potter And The Sorcerers Stone. I am very glad I'm reading this book because it's just extraordinary. The part I liked best in the story was when Hagrid busted in on Harry's muggle family and was about to hang him on his umbrella because Uncle Vernon didn't tell Harry the truth about his family.

At first, they seemed enjoyable, and they definately held my interest. They are obviously children's books, and I am keeping this in mind, but there are two glaring problems with these books:1. All the characters, whether good and evil, all sneak around and cheat to accomplish their aims. There are generally no consequences, or else the consequences don't match the deceit involved. Harry Potter and his friends (the good guys) constantly sneak around, lie, and steal to do whatever it is they need to do. When caught, they manage to miss the most severe punishment or else get off scott free. There are two problems with this: First, it just gets annoying after a while to see every plot twist accomplished by a &quot;good&quot; character acting this way, especially when they are kids, and second (and more importantly), Is this the message we want to send to the millions of young kids who read these books?2. Rowling constantly employs Deus ex Machina to solve plot problems. Harry Potter is extraorinarily passive. At first, he is at the mercy of the evil Dursleys, and then of Hagrid, and then of bullies at Hogwarts, then the teachers there, then the bad guys. He is always &quot;getting into situations&quot; from which he must be extracted with strained plot twists. Someone comes along to save the day, or whatever it might be. After a while, this becomes extremely tedious to read. Harry Potter is contantly in the middle of situations he didn't create for himself. He is blamed for doing things he didn't do; he is at the wrong place at the wrong time; a teacher or fellow student hates him for no apparent reason. All of this adds up to a storyline full of holes.I gave it two stars because, in spite of all this, the books did hold my attention, and Ms. Rowling is, I think, good at writing (if not storytelling)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Have been reading this first in the series ( I bought the rest to make sure I had them in stock when ready to move on) in my car, at lunchtime, and I am mesmerized. Reminds me a lot of The Wind in The Door and Lion, Witch and Wardrobe books. I feel like I am 10 years old again (am 41)while reading the Harry Potter book. Thanks J.K. Rowling, for inspiring my creative urges for fantasy and bringing back my youthfulness! Can't say enough about a book that keeps me spellbound in my car at lunchtime!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I must admit that I've never been one to jump on the bandwagon of trends, much less like them but this series may prove as the exception. Wary at first about picking up a children's book, but intrigued by friends' comments, I reluctantly picked up a copy of &quot;The Sorcerer's Stone&quot;, expecting to add it to my ever-increasing pile of half-read books. Imagine my surprise when not only did I like the story, but actually loved it. J.K. Rowling added another fan to her ever-growing list that dayPosed with the question as to why someone should buy this book, I counter with the obvious why not. Any child with half an imagination could better from this read. It's magical and mythical, wonderful and whimsical and chock full of all the elements a good fairy tale is made of: Good Harry's ever-present battle with the evil He-Who-Can-Not-Be-Named, Hermione's ugly duckling turning into a beautiful swan in &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, and Hagrid's turn as the gentle giant to name a few. The best thing, however, about Rowling's series is that they are written in a manner that is easy for a child to understand, but not in a manner that is too childish or simple. Rowling remembers that children are smarter than what they seem and that most are capable of embracing stories, no matter how touchy the subject matter, when presented in a pleasant and self-effacing manner.Children aren't the only ones that can benefit from this series. Adults can also learn a few things from Rowling, especially the fact that I earlier pointed out: that sometimes children can handle delicate subjects, as long as they are explained in an easy to understand, concise manner. My other reasons to recommend this book are little more than selfish ones, ranging from the fact that it reminds me what it was it was like to dream and believe that anything is possible and that Quidditch looks pretty darn fun. Either reason guarantees that you're buying a book well worth its back cover price."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"At the time that I decided to review this book, 2685 other people had already beaten me to it. That in and of itself says something.The first time someone suggested that I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I held back a rather disgusted sneer. This was a children's novel and far below me, the reader of such lengthy pieces of work as Les Miserables and The Mists of Avalon.I thought of Harry Potter no more until one day when my mother brought this first book home explaining that she was reading it for a book club. Eventually, boredom (and a lack of books I hadn't already read four or five times) drove me to pick up the greatly scorned children's novel. I was almost immediately hooked. I finished the book, set it down and stared at it for a moment, then proceeded to beg whoever happened to be nearby to take me to the library so that I could read the second one.I find it hard to put a finger on what exactly makes this book so difficult to put down. Is it the characters with their quirks and quests? The twisted, tangled plot? The humor that appears unexpectedly? The suspense that keeps you reading even if it's 2:30 am and you have to wake up early the next morning? The enchanting way that the author blends fantasy with reality?In any case, I do know that, for me at least, a good piece of fantasy is one that you finish and it leaves you aching to live in the world that the author has spun. That is the case with this book. It makes you believe that if you were in London and you looked hard enough, you could step into the Leaky Cauldron or onto Platform 9 3/4 and you would be transported into a world of magic, mystery, and mayhem. Happy reading."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Ever miss reading a book that is light hearted but still adult enough for you not to feel silly reading it? Then pick up a copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone and you will find yourself a fan of the series. I read this book and had to order the second through fourth one after finishing it. It's so hard to put it down.If you enjoy classic wizards and witches stories with English style writing (trust me, it's funny!) then you should consider picking up this book. It will make you thirst for more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I first heard of Harry when my two younger brothers beganreading it. It was a few months later when I picked it up justbecause I was bored when I saw why everyone liked it. It had an excellent plot and had mystery, humor, suspense, and adventure all packed into one story. My favorite part was in the begining when Hagrid had to explain everything to Harry. It was the first fantasy book I ever read that made sense. I'm looking forward to the other three books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It was a great pleasure and surprise reading this book. Rarely in a book can you find such a powerful writing regarding the descriptions of the people and places. From the reading, you get the sense of watching a movie: the Quidditch game, the chess room, the unicorn in the wood and the invisible train station, all are described very impressively. It is not possible to put the book down once you start reading and with each new page you discover a surprising and charming new world and you regret to find yourself in the real world once you finish it. Congratulations to Mrs. Rowling who has such wonderful imagination and creativity. I think the story contains a very rich material to make a movie out of it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As an adult reader of the book, I was a little skeptical at first of its ability to capture my interest, but this book was extraordinary. I could not wait to pick it up and see how Harry was proceeding in his many delightful situations.Also, I loved the creative descriptions and the vibrant characters in the story...wonderful light reading..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Being an avid fan of the Rosie O'Donnell show I try and watch everyday. One day one of the guests on the show was J.K. Rowling, I was amazed by the response of the crowd when this English woman came out onto the stage. I almost changed the channel, but became hooked when this lady started reading from her book. I knew that I HAD to read this book. I became addicted to Harry and his adventures at Hogwart's with Ron, and Hagrid. I wanted to watch a Quidditch match, have an owl and an invisibility cloak of my own.Though I still believe that I am a child at heart, this book made me feel like a 10-year old again. It helped me to believe in magic again. I pretty near ask everyone that I meet if they have read Harry Potter. They give me this look of disbelief, as if to say, &quot;Sarah, you are 19-years old, why are you reading a kiddy book.&quot; Then I give them my reasoning, I say,&quot;Guys, if I were 12 and Harry were real, that kid would be my best friend.&quot;I not only recommend this book to the young at heart, I say, read this book if you want to fell 12 again, or want to feel your heart pound as you read about Harry going in search of the Golden Snitch or cross your fingers in hope that Harry becomes Gryffindors. I haven't felt so passionate about anything, the last time I can remember being this passionate about a book was in 4th grade when I wanted my teacher to read the class my favorite book &quot;The Witches.&quot; If you don't do it for yourself, do it for your children. They will love it more than Pokemon."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I really enjoyed Harry potter and the sorcerer's stone. The book was funny, and somewhat sad.

I liked it alot. and I recommend it for all."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Take a likable hero, put him in a miserable situation, then free him to explore the most amazing things and meet the most amazing people. It's a formula that's worked ever since Homer and has charmed the British people since at least Dickens. And it works for last year's surprise literary hero, Harry Potter.Harry is the very grudgingly accepted boarder of his godparents, who force him to live under the stairs in the broomcloset of their modest suburban home while they lavish all sorts of presents and sweets on their own child. Harry is different, you see. More different than his godparents will admit. He is not born to be a &quot;muggle&quot; (a non-magical being) like them. He is born to be a great wizard, and in spite of his godparents' every intention he finds himself on the way to wizard school.This first Harry Potter book is lighthearted, zesty fun and quite literally fun from seven to seventy. Don't wait to borrow it from a child--get ahold of your own copy and enjoy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a wonderful book! I just finished reading it to my entire family. (Even my husband didn't miss a reading session!) We all loved it!What saddens me, though, is reading an article today from the Los Angeles Daily News stating how parents from several school districts in CA are trying to ban Harry Potter from school libraries and classrooms. One parent stated that she is even working toward a &quot;censored book list.&quot;We have so homogenized what is available to our children that it is no wonder so few children leave anything to imagination anymore. Ask a child today to make up something, and you're bound to get something related to what they've seen on a Saturday morning TV show.This book is a wonderful, fantasy-based book that lets the reader's imagination soar right along with it. Our family is looking forward to reading the further adventures of Harry Potter!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I liked Harry Potter so much that I'm going to be him for Halloween!Now all my friends think I'm crazy because I'm a girl.

We have just finished the first book and are starting the second. They are all hoping that there are more books on the way. I will be encouraging them to send their own reviews in very soon.

EVERY BODY in my school has read it. If you haven't read it already, get with the times and read the book of the millenium (and the next 10 milleniums!!). So guess what?

If this were a movie and Siskel were here, Ebert and he would give it two thumbs up. Imagine you lived with your Aunt and Uncle and your mean and fat cousin Dudly. I am talking about the book called Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone or in England it is known as Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Soon you find out that you are a wizard and that your parents were too, but they were killed by Voldemort the evil wizard. Then you go to Hogwarts, a school for young Wizards or Witches. It is very exciting and anyone who doesn't think so is crazy. It was the best book I ever read. Imagine being hated in the world of the Muggles but out of that world you are famous and well known. Everyone knows him and knows that he was famous. Also he was magical because when Voldemort tried to kill Harry he couldn't and all it left was a mark on his head.You also soon make friends and eat candies such as every flavor jelly beans and chocolate frogs. Also you find the greatest secret of all and become a hero. Imagine being the seeker finding the golden snitch, and riding on the newest and best broomstick called the Nimbus-two thousand. That is what it was like for a hero, survivor, and many other things. His name was Harry Potter. If you haven't read this book read it fast. I couldn't put the book down once I started reading it. I think you will do the same thing. I am a 10 year-old named Trevor Dawson."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Little did I know that my life was about to be changed - ok, maybe I'm being a little over dramatic here - when our school librarian said over the loudspeaker that I had won my school's door prize from the recent book fair. When I went down to the library, she said that I could pick out any book I wanted, and get it free. So I looked...and looked...and still I couldn't find anything. I went back the next morning to look some more. And then I saw, in the highest corner almost hidden from sight, was Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. When I first set eyes on it I knew this was the book I had to get. I still had to pay $7.00 for it, since it was $16.95, but.. Anyway, I took it home and started reading right away. From the first sentence, I was hooked. &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much...&quot; Unfortunatly I also had a report due the next day...but anyhow, my point is that this is likely the best book I have ever read (and that's a lot)and you should read it too.

I've read the book before, but it's been quite a while. The darker later books were fresher in my mind.The Sorceror's Stone is a children's book through and through. The story structure is simple and the threats are mainly minor (at least until the end of the book.)But it's interesting to see how many elements were there right from the beginning though. Just small references, their significance not obvious at the time. Were they always intended for bigger things? I don't know and it doesn't really matter. It works either way.It's not a sophisticated book and the writing is more journeyman than master. The characters are broadly drawn, the elements are not particularly original when taken individually.What became really obvious to me while I was reading this to my children though was that this book is fun and optimistic and full of wonder. And that's what draws you in and makes you want to come back.

If there is any real magic to these novels, then J. K. Rowling has cast her spell. These books are enchanting, engaging and a sheer delight to read. You will be drawn into the lives of Harry and his friends and be enthralled with their adventures.The best thing about finishing this tale, I know there are more books about Harry Potter to enjoy!!!Not just for children, they are a treasure to read for every age!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This part of the HP series is the best so far. I have read all 5 and this is my top one. The adventure never gets old, it keeps getting better all the time. Its always good to read this to re-fresh your memory on how he made all his friends and enimies."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I first heard about this book I was very suspicious. I couldn't see how the story of a wizard could be interesting. One day, however, I saw the book lying around at home and curiosity overcame me. I started reading it and I couldn't put it down. It was the best book I'd ever read. After Book 1 I read Book 2, the Book 3 and so on. One better than the other. When I finished Book 4 I re-read all of them (twice!!).I've already ordered Book 5 and it is on its way. I can't wait to start reading it! Ms. Rowling is simply amazing, she is a genious! I really hope Books 5, 6 and 7 are as good as the first ones."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My son tried reading this book last year, but he felt scared and didn't continue. After all the publicity for book 5, I started reading the first.The story is not only about the orphan Harry who is living a miserable life at his aunt's. It is about courage, truth and self-confidence. Magic comes from the inside and shines through one's self. It is a lovely story, the magical part makes it out of this world, but if you look deep, they are only humans with conflicting feelings and different aspirations. Each with his own dream, choosing his own path to achieve it!It is funny, bright and for all ages!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"for enriching me with the wonders of reading and allowing myself to know that 'Fantasy' is be enjoy by everyone than just kids. J.K. Rowling is Brillant!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is probably the most well written children's book in a while. The charactors and even the school of Hogwarts itself are so well described that they almost seem real. The book is full of surprises and an ending that keeps you begging for more. You'll never guess the story behind Professer Snape or the Sorcerers Stone. I recommend all the Harry Potter books. You may also like The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches. I recommend these books to any age group."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a brillant novel by JK Rowling. The plot was eventful and action packed to the end. It was practically impossible for us to put down. The ending was unexpected but definitly rewarding. A great for all memembers of the family! I also recommend The Kingdoms and the Elves."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fun reading for everyone of all ages. I think that Harry Potter can be a learning experience for everyone. Even though they say some wierd stuff in this book. I think little kids understand it, because they have very imagative minds. I am not just saying kids have it adults have it too. Harry Potter is a book a family could read together and discuss about it with one another."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is a different kind of series when compared to The Lord of the Rings. While people argue that J.R.R. Tolkien will always be the master of fantasy, I disagree with them. Rowling writes with suspense and fun...without wasting her time on those incredibly boring descriptions like Tolkien. She is a master of her craft, creating incredible yet believable characters and putting them into frightening situations where they face off against monsters and mighty wizards. Tolkien just makes his characters go on a quest that has a predictable ending after more than a 1000 pages, characters I can't remember and compare myself to, cities with such stupid names, and things so freakish it's not even worth mentioning. Though her books continue to grow larger, Rowling writes so we could start at any book in the series and still understand what is happening. Tolkien's writing gets confusing at some times, especially at times when he writes with that Elvish language that no one understands. Harry Potter does not have that big chapters while Tolkien's book become literally a torture to read. I experienced something new everytime I read Harry Potter but at the end of The Lord of the Rings all I wanted to do was to lock the book in my basement and wait till it becomes rare so I could sell it.Harry Potter, as everybody knows, is the story of a boy who on his birthday finds out that he's a famous wizard whose parents were murdered by the evil wizard Voldemort. For the past eleven years, he's been living with his aunt and uncle Petunia and Vernon Dursley as well as their chubby child Dudley. After visiting Diagon Alley, a wizard marketplace, where he gets his supplies Harry finds himself in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where nothing is what it seems. With his friends Ron, a curious young boy, and Hermione, an intelligent independent girl, Harry begins his adventures through Hogwarts, discovering things that will both shock and entertain you, finally leading to a grand confrontation with Voldemort that will keep you glued to your seat all night (or day as I read it in one and a half days).The characters in this book are splendid. Although Hermione tends to be a little annoying at times she and Ron are a fine addition to the story. Both supply Harry with clues that keep the reader guessing. Besides the mysteries, some magical characters are missed. Hagrid, the gamekeeper is another one of my personal favorites, because of the suprises he brings that often get Harry and his friends into trouble. It's the plans Harry hatches to save his school is what urges us to continue reading. Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall, two professors in the story, have more of an effect in the later books but nonetheless create a fun experience at Hogwarts.The storyline is strongly built so don't expect anything that will wreck the book as in the Lord of the Rings. There are no descriptions as in the Lord of the Rings: The grass was green. The sun was shining. The sky was blue. Frodo walked across this grass and looked at the blue sky with its yellow sun. Being my favorite book of the Harry Potter series, the Sorcerer's Stone is highly recommended for anyone who wants a book with fun, suspense, and action. It's pure magic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Start with some Roald Dahl, mix in some C.S. Lewis, add a touch of Tolkien and maybe a dash of John Bellairs and viola! J. K. Rowling is a superb storyteller in her first adventure and many more to follow (seven in all). Any reader of literature should buy this book and read it to their children (4 and up); they'll certainly enjoy it too, maybe even more than the kids. Fabulous!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is a great character, someone everyone wants to be. I couldn't put the book down, it was well written and the descriptions were full of humor."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was so fun to read and engaging that I finished it in one day. I just could not put it down. This book was written for children but it will also appeal to older readers as well. I should know, I'm 18 years old. The descriptions of the magic world were so fun and imaginitive. This book will probably make a great movie but it will be hard to put all the enchanting descriptions into words. I loved it so much that I had to order the sequel Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets from Amazon UK. I can't wait to read it and I hope the author continues Harry's adventures for years and years. A fantastic book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was one of my favorites. I like how different it was. I also liked how strange Harry was.

Like many other people I can't wait for the next ones to come out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Well, there's really nothing to say that hasn't already been said about it.

I LOVE anything dealing with fantasy and/or humor, so I hardly put this book down when I started reading it! This book ranks up there with any of Roald Dahl's dark kids' books. My dad and my mom are going to read it, too, and I gave a copy to my best friend. I can't wait for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets to be published in the USA! Take my advice: If you haven't read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, then you haven't read anything yet!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book kept me up all night...meant to read a couple chapters but just couldn't put it down. Rowlings has created a truly magical world, with complex characters and details that'll make you smile. Her inventiveness will help keep me going in the Muggle world!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think Harry Potter is a great character. I like the word &quot;muggle&quot; and I think it might become an ordinary word. My favorite chapter in Harry Potter was Quiddich - I wish it was a sport that was real. I liked it because it was a mix of sorcery and basketball. I was really lucky becauses my mom got a hold of the second book which is only out in England, but soon will be in America. I will give you a little hint. Harry Potter and his friend fly in a car and get in trouble. I can't wait until the third book comes out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"HARRY POTTER is the best book I've read. The mixture of freindship, sports, courage,fantasy and humor makes this a truly terrific book. If you haven't read this book yet, I strongly suggest you read it NOW! Read or regret it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Reminiscent of T.H. White's The Sword in the Stone, this lovely book captures one's imagination and sets off on a fantastical adventure. Equally appealing to adults and children, it weaves an intricate world that is pleasant to visit even though evil lurks and must be avoided at many turns. It's biggest fault is that it ends much too soon!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"excellent choice for the harry potter collector, keep in pristine conditiongreat book leather bound a must. keep collecting i was going to buy thid on ebay but the prices were double for the same book"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved this story. I was hesitant at first to read Harry Potter, because i thought it was just for kids and would be really intolerably childish and immature, but it wasn't at all. I really enjoyed the story and i loved the characters. The best part i loved was how descriptive it all was. I feel like Rowling did an amazing job at describing everything and making you really feel like it was all real. I recommend this book to everyone. I usually get more specific than that, but i think everyone will enjoy this"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Do you want to read a book that will blow your mind away? Or maybe you want one that will sweep you of your feet. If you want a book that will do those things read, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. This book is by J.K. Rowling. In this book there is an eleven year old boy named Harry Potter. Harry is a wizard but he doesn't know it. The book states that Harry lives with his aunt, uncle, and a horrible cousin named Dudley. After one little problem with Dudley. Being a normal boy will change forever for Harry Potter.This book is about an odd boy that nobody likes. Harry doesn't even like himself because Harry's parents have died harry and he feels lonely. He has no friends, and nobody will talk to him. It is a surprise when Harry gets a letter saying that he has been accepted at the school named Hogwarts. (Hogwarts is a school for wizards and witches.) Harry goes to Diagon alley with another wizard named Hagrid.Harry buy's his wand, cauldron and other things he needs for school. On the train, Harry meets an owl named Hedwig, a boy named Ron, and a girl named Hermione. When Harry gets to school his teachers tell him about a very dark wizard named Voldemort. Harry tries to catch Voldemort because he blew up Harry's parents. He ends up into some deadly situations. One almost kills him. His friends try to help him but in the end there is only one person that can defeat Voldemort. That person is... Harry. My favorite part of this book was when Harry meets Draco Malfoy in Diagon alley. Malfoy starts to talk about Quidditch (Quidditch is a wizard sport.). Harry doesn't have a clue about what Malfoy is talking about. I think J.K. Rowling does a very good description for how confused Harry is.The most important thing I have learned about this book is how to stand up to people with come backs.If you liked this book and want to know what happens in the next book read the other books in the Harry Potter series. I recommend this book for nine year olds and up because there are some words in the books that seven and eight year olds wouldn't understand. Otherwise this is a great book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Oh, Harry how I love you. I am re-reading the series in great anticipation of the culminating movie. It's been awhile since I have read them all, and I have never read them back to back with no breaks in between. I still love Sorcerer's Stone. When Harry meets Hagrid and finds out he is a wizard I get so excited. I love the Diagon Alley scene, and the final scene through the obstacle course is brilliant. JK sometimes repeats herself, but all is forgiven. She has created an amazing world, and the introduction of The Boy Who Lived is perfection."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This adventures book is about a young boy who has no knowledge of magic, sorcery, and evil encounters. Harry potter only knows of an abusing life with his selfish and destructive aunt and uncle, and their repulsive son, Dudley. However, one winters evening harry received a letter brought by a mysterious bleached white owl, that was inviting him to a remarkable place called Hogwarts. Harry was soon to discover a world he has never known, a world of magical experiences, and things he has only dreamed of. There he will discover his love for magic, friends, and much more. Harry will now realize his destiny that has been awaiting him, but it will take a lot of strength and courage to overcome the challenges he will face.In this book, the experiences were as real as it could get. I felt so intrigued; I felt a connection with this novel. My personal connection to this book was with Harry's best friend, Ron Weasley. I felt this connection because Ron is Harry's greatest friend and Ron help harry with everything, he would do anything for harry. He was an astounding friend to everyone. Ron wasn't the most courageous but throughout the book and the series he found his bravery and showed it and became something of himself.When you read this book, if you felt as connected and as fascinated, as I was than these are the books for you. Harry potter is a 7 book series and consists of the most invigorating adventures and encounters. However, there are other books than the Harry potter series, books that harry potter readers would enjoy would be \\"the lord of the rings trilogy\\" or \\"the hunger games\\". I think readers would enjoy these other novels because they are exciting and in depth and overflowing with detail on every page! You cannot go without reading these if you enjoyed harry potter and the sorcerer's stone.This book is honestly such a great book, and I'm not just saying that. I am not the biggest reader out there, and I can't say this about most books but I completely loved this book and the rest of the series. Every time I read this book I feel like I'm in Hogwarts and I never want to leave! Every page is like a storm of detail and excitement. Every chapter is a new adventure and a new piece of the story, and right when you start you just want to find all the pieces. This book is like being in a world where anything can happen, and you can make it happen. I vastly encourage you to read this novel, and once you do I promise you will unquestionably love it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This story starts out when Harry is a baby and Lord Voldermort discovers that Harry is a sorcerer that will one day be stronger than he is; therefore, Lord Voldermort decides he has to kill Harry.

Throughout Harry's time at Hogwarts, Harry encounters many challenges that he must overcome; however, along the way Harry finds friends that will be by his side through thick and thin.This is a very intriguing book. The book always has you guessing what is to come next and you never want to put it down. This book will spark your imagination and have your creative juices flowing. This book would also be a fantastic book to use in the classroom as a read aloud. Many students could relate to the experiences that Harry encounters to a certain extent."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read this series once a year every year because I like it that much. It's amazing how many details you pick up after you've read it a few times. The layers and work Rowling did in the series is astounding. Small things are mentioned casually that become huge elements in later books. The series is magical and reading it is a literary experience.If you enjoyed the movies, the books are better. They are more detailed and provide much more information about the HP world. While books 1 and 2 are more children books (written in a simpler, fast pace) the series, much like the main character, grows and matures as it progresses. By the time you get to book 5, it's a YA or adult book.The series is about good vs evil, about friendship and loyalty about growing up and dealing with others' expectations of you. Yes it's about magic, wizards and spells, but it's so much more. It's a great read for children and teens and still entertaining for adults. And it's funny!If you haven't read it and are debating it, I urge you to pick up The Sorcerer's Stone and start your own journey. Even if you think you won't enjoy it, you should still give it a try. It's immensly popular, yes, but for good reason. This series is destined to be a literary classic and it's worth a read. Give it a try if you haven't read it, and if you have, read it again because it only gets better with time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Not only is J.K. Rowling's story amazing, Jim Dale does an incredible job with each character's voice. I have since listened to all 7 books and he maintains the integrity and quality to each character throughout!

I'd always wanted to be a reader, but all the books that I was assigned to read when I was younger--I hated them. Then, I picked up Harry Potter and read it in two days and it changed my life. I loved this book and I started to love reading.As far as the Harry Potter series is concerned, I rate this as the third best book (after Goblet of Fire and Deathly Hallows).I'd recommend this book to anyone that hasn't found a book yet that they like. I feel like it's one of the few books that everyone at least likes a little--barely anyone hates the Harry Potter series and most people love it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"\\"...

Before he goes to school he must get all his supplies like a magical wand, robes, and books. When he gets there he meets two people named Ron, and Hermoine who later become his friends. Later, Harry finds out he is in the same cabin as Ron and a few other boys. I would compare this book to the Lemony Snickett books. They are both fantasies. I like the Harry Potter books better.

I felt like something was missing so I decided to read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Even though I like the Harry Potter Series, I have to say that this book was a bit of a disappointment.

His Mom wrote me a note the following day to please excuse his sleepiness because they extended his bedtime so he could finish. Another student took it home the following day, and the same thing happened. Now, it was my turn to read it. I was walking out of school with it tucked under my arm and the mother of twins in my class stopped me. She gasped when she saw the book and she said that she couldn't find it anywhere (sold out!). I am sucker for people being excited about literature so I forked it over with the promise that I could have it back once we returned from Winter Break. That Monday arrived and the older sibling showed up at my door begging me to give her a few more days to finish it. She too couldn't put it down. Well, I've finally got it back and I'm reading it aloud and needless to say, my students love it! They laugh out loud, gasp and we have wonderful discussions. Read aloud has become the highlight of our day!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone was very well written and the book had wonderfull imagery. It amazed me how the author could even think of the name Hogwarts for the name of a boarding school and how he could come up with all the different kinds of rooms Harry had to go though before he could get the special object he needed to obtain. This book is an absolute two thumbs up!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the BEST book I have ever read. I like it because all other fantasy books make you just want to put them down and never open the cover again, but that is not true for this book. I love the plot and characters. I like Hermione because of her wonderful spells, especially the one she cast on Snape at the Quidditch match between Slytherin and Gryffindor. Thank you very much for making this wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am reading this book aloud to a group of 24 sixth graders. This book has captured the attention of my predominately male class (16) from the first sentence. Actually the entire class is loving it!!! I am not allowed to either skip a read aloud session or shorten the amount of time I read. My only complaint is when will the next book in the series be available on the West Coast!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"On the recommendation of a friend who also writes young adult fiction, I purchased Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for my 11-year-old nephew, a self-proclaimed geek. He raved about it, couldn't put it down, annoyed his parents (and grandparents!) by reading passages aloud and insisting on recounting plot points, and refused to go outside to play until he had finished it. (Since he lives in a remote part of upstate N.Y., the later may have been prudence rather than fascination.) I, meanwhile, had somehow managed to end up with an extra copy of the book. Bored with my book club's selection for the January meeting, I picked up Harry Potter and began to read. I, too, couldn't put it down and stayed up until 2:00 a.m. to finish it. It is terrific, I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good story with strong characterizations, and I've already ordered the sequel from Amazon.uk.co!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book swept me away, and now my colleagues (!) are borrowing it. The Chicago Tribune wrote about &quot;Harry Potter..&quot; last October. They could tell that the publisher had made two jackets for it: one with a drawing for kids, and one with a black&amp;white photography for adults (who were reading it behind newspapers...). Any which version you get hold of: enjoy!! Regards from Helene 8)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book captures what every child dreams of, finding out they are not really a normal child but a have amazing majic powers. The art of wizardry has facinated human kind for centuries and and this book has a story line that brings out this facination and more. Doing transforming spells or sneaking out of his house at night, even playing a game of giant enchanted chess for your life. This story makes you feel like you are Harry's best bud, and I would have given anything to jump into that book and never come out again. When I reached the end I cried, I didn't want to leave Hogwarts and Harry and go back to the world of nothing but muggles. I recommend this book to all, even grown-ups, maybe you'll remember that childhood fantasy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is great! I couldn't put it down. My Dad would sneak it away and read it after I went to bed! I think that everybody would like this book. I can't wait for the next Harry Potter book!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is very funny. It is one of my 5 favorites. I just couldn't put it down, and I hate reading books, especially fantasy! Harry Potter is a kid who has to live with his wretched aunt and uncle and their spoiled, pig-like son Dudley. That is until one day, someone comes to tell him that he is a wizard, and can go to Hogwarts, the best (and only) school of witchcraft and wizardry in England! There he faces trolls, a three headed dog, many ghosts, and a blood sucking cloaked figure. But most astonishing of all, is what he finds beneath a teacher's turban!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I read a book, I get absorbed into a different life for an hour, maybe two. When I read a good book, I get drawn into a different reality for a few days, and always hate to return to my own. When I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I disappeared, willingly I might add, into a time when my heroes were Nancy Drew and Enid Blyton, and I longed for the day when I would find myself a wardrobe and disappear into the Narnia of C.S. Lewis. But with age comes peer pressure, with that comes disillusionment, accompanied by an attitude of being too mature for fairy tales and imaginary worlds. But, from the moment I opened that book, I was caught in the carefully woven trap of fantasy that J.K. Rowling had expertly crafted. I was engrossed in the story of a boy whose home life had shades of Dahl's Matilda meets Dickens' Pip, and whose true identity is like an Ugly Duckling for all ages. Through Harry, I saw lives that I thought authors had stopped writing about seventy years ago, a parallel universe that didn't have guns or war planes or invading aliens, but an everyday world, on the outskirts of an extraordinary one. The extraordinary secret of these books is how Rowling makes us believe that magic can truly exist in this Muggle world of Mundania. It doesn't matter whether you are six or sixty, whether you have lived through Disneyworld or the Depression; the irresistibility of the Harry Potter books is based in the human desire to believe in the unbelievable, no matter how fantastical or magical it may be. That is what makes a children's book so special for adults everywhere. But, for me personally, this magical fantasy is only a part of the reason why I love Harry Potter. It wiped away all the cynicism I had carefully cultivated over the years, and grabbed at a piece of me I thought I had lost when I was ten. Not only did it provide a magical world for me to base my reality in, but it also provided an entirely new perspective on that reality. For example, when I went to Duke, I was expecting at least a minimal amount of racism in the \\"Deep South\\". Instead, one girl who asked me about the book was a blond, blue-eyed child with a Southern drawl that would have put Scarlet to shame. I could start whole conversations, with adolescents no less, based on the parallel universe of Harry Potter. Those incidents gave me faith that there are a few things that can, at the very least, minimise the social chasms that exist in the world. If we have to start with fantasy and magic, then so be it. Maybe it's healthier for adults to believe in unreality just as strongly as children can. It will provide for us, as it did for me, something to smile about when I think the world leaves no room for joy, to recognise that, amidst all of the mundane realities that we face, all the pollution, all the crime, everything that critics claim is collapsing our society, there is one place where magic will always exist for me - in the wonderful world of Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Forget reading for 20 minutes a night! Once you start reading Harry Potter you'll find that you and your kids want to devote whole evenings to reading it! They'll choose Harry over TV any night! One evening we read 90 pages, two hours aloud. The time just flew by. My son says he loves Harry Potter because he feels like he is inside the story when we read about Harry and his incredible adventures. The book is creative and well written with vivid details that captivate the reader and take us to a wonderful fantasy land!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"OK. I was initially embarrassed that I-- as a 27-yr-old-- received this book as a gift from my mother, who heard through friends at work about the Harry Potter series. Now I CANNOT put it down! I have only been through the first book and can't wait to read the next two. Rowling captures all the things I imagined as a young child. I have not been engrossed in such a magical novel since The Hobbit, which I've read about 15 times over the years. All I can say now, is: Rowling, PLEASE keep them coming! :-)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was referred to me by the mother of my son's classmate. She told me that although the boy's were young they would be able to follow the plot of the tale. Well, we were not disappointed! My husband started reading it to our son and very soon we were all in the bed together at night listening attentively to Harry's adventure. This is a delightful, exciting tale for children of all ages, and adults who still have the ability to imagine and dream of the wonderful and fantastic. The writing is quite sophisticated and the structure of the text is ingenious. This is a fresh innovative addition to the many vibrant novels written for children. My family looks forward to sharing many more evenings with Harry, Dumbledore, Hermoine, Ron and Hagrid"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Sadly disappointed by this book. Everyone who'd be interested in a collector's edition will already know the story, so I'm not going to bother with a plot summary. This book is seriously overpriced for what it costs to actually produce it--but then, they're milking wallets like crazy.I found that the leather binding was rather funny-looking, the illustration had somehow been altered in a way that was VERY unappealing, and the picture of Harry by Rowling somehow... uh... it just didn't make me feel any less odd about it. I don't have a problem with, say, the leather-bound LOTR volume because they bothered to make it more worth the money.I'd advise that either you take the advice of the other reviewer and get it from the UK (where people apparently don't get quite so milked for their merchandise) or buy several paperback copies. It's not worth seventy little ones just for a semi-nice cover."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I must say that I didn't want to read this book. I'm sixteen years old and a huge fan of Stephen King, and the thought of reading a children's book--whether Mr. King recommended it or not, which he did--was just dreadful. However, knowing that in a month the movie would be coming out, (and my girlfriend wanting to go to it very badly), I decided to read it so I'd know what was going on so I might enjoy the film...However, as I started reading, I found myself much more interested than I expected. This book was like The Lord of the Rings and all the other childhood fairy tales I've read throughout my life, all thrown together into one. The characters are well developed, the ideas clever, and the plot--although a lot like other fantasy books--interesting enough. At 310 pages, it's a quick read, (I read it in 3 days), and moves along at a great pace. In my opinion, the last two chapters were by far the scariest, more action-packed and really made me want to keep reading...in the end, I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars, expecting to rate it a 2 at best.My final thought: If you think this is a book for kids, think again. It's a great story that's truly worth reading...I'll be borrowing the second book tomorrow so I can see what happens next. Thanx for reading."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is actually a review of the first three Harry Potter books as a whole. While the first is the most enchanting (only because the concepts are newer and fresher) all three are excellent. The Harry Potter series captures the same sense of wonder and adventure that the Frank Baum 'OZ' series delivered to me when I was a tot. These are the sort of works that parents should celebrate, granting an opportunity to share and interact instead of engaging in vapid television marathons. This is children's fantasy at its best: delighting young readers and restoring youth to their jaded elders. I've seen children with attention spans too short for comic books turn hundreds of pages in rapt attention thanks to Harry Potter. I myself, 26 years young, am anticipating the next release, like I did birthdays when I was a kid.And for those few knee-jerk ultra-reactionary book burners who decry these novels as Satan's work, shame on you. References to witchcraft notwithstanding, the Harry Potter books are a stark excercise in good versus evil, which you'd realize if you'd actually read. I am a Christian, and have taught Sunday school for 8 years; I have no qualms about placing any of these books in a child's hands."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Well, I was a bit skeptical when I received this book for christmas from my parents. I'm an 18 year old literature major after all, what would I want with a series of childrens's books? However, after reading the first chapter, I was completely hooked (and have spent the beginning of this semester in collge trying to convince my english professor to allow us to study the harry potter series). Frankly, I was astounded at the reviews suggesting the &quot;evil&quot; nature of Harry Potter, and thought that it must be mentioned that these books also teach outstanding lessons concerning friendship, love, and &quot;doing the right thing.&quot; I loved all three of these books, and can't wait for the next."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Since I am both an evangelical Christian and a lover of good fantasy, I was a little perplexed when I learned that certain parents objected to the content of _Harry Potter_. While I understand the basis of these fears, I think they are certainly exaggerated. _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_ is a wonderful story, funny, with lovable and human characters. Harry, Ron, and Hermione make their mistakes, but they also move beyond that and try to fix them. Moreover, the book has a wonderful message about the nature of evil: we give it power through our fear. That's a message that is applicable to all children, especially Christian children. There are also complaints about the dark nature of the books. Again, that is a fact of life. Parents who have concerns about these matters would probably be better served by reading the book with their children, so they can guide them, rather than by forbidding Rowlings books completely. (My only concern was the portrayal of Slytherins, which is so overwhelmingly negative that is seems a little unfair, and that is a very nit-picky complaint). There is no reason for Christian children to miss the wonderful friendships and exciting story found in this book and its sequels."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm not much into kids' books but when my mom brought home Harry Potter, I remembered it from the NY Times bestseller list. In bed one night I flipped open to the third chapter and after five minutes, reverted back to chapter one. After 11 years of torture living with his foster family (Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and cousin Dudley), Harry is shocked to learn that he is actually a world famous wizard! When he was only an infant, a powerful, evil sorcerer killed his parents but was unable to destroy him. All that's left of the encounter is a lightening shaped scar on his forhead. The incident having driven the sorcerer into exile, Harry is a celebrity everwher he goes, from diagon alley(for school supplies) to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. At Hogwarts, Harry befriends other schoolmates as they learn the arts of magic. While trying to keep his grades in check, Harry learns of a plot to undermine the scools headmaster. Harry risks his reputation and life as he does his best to get to the bottom of the situation. A captivating read, The Sorcerer's Stone contains the imagination of Roald Dahl, the magic of J.R.R. Tolkien, and the humor and suspense J.K. Rawling throws in to even it out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"this book is probably the worst book i will ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it took me weeks to finish this book. the words are to small and the is as thick as my head. this book is for people with bad taste in books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Once upon a time, JK Rowling came up with a truly magical idea, one that deservedly made her very wealthy: children at a magical school, one which overlapped London. However, Rowling never really let us enjoy that magical world. Beginning with the first book, Rowling corrupted and destroyed her own creation. With each successive book Harry Potter's world became uglier and less magical. With each new book Rowling added more and more political preaching about the real world.So this is a review of the entire series and I am about to give the ultimate spoiler. The forces of good are utterly defeated in the Potter series. The real villain is JK Rowling, not Voldemort. By the time the series completes there is no joy anywhere in the magical world, and there are no heroes. All the characters are dead or tainted by evil. Banality, conflict, anarchy, corruption, and violence run unchecked throughout the magical world.Everyone wants to read about students at Hogwarts. How does Rowling cheat us out of that?#1 - ALL AUTHORITY FIGURES ARE BADAny school story must include students being taught by teachers. Rowling refuses to allow that to happen, because of her attitude towards authority figures. Every teacher and authority figure in Potter's world is either incompetent, corrupt, evil, or for some reason unable to help the students. The authority figures also neglect the children and fail to protect them. Books, Hermione, and Harry end up being the real teachers and leaders.#2 - RULES ARE MADE TO BE BROKENNeither the children nor the faculty respect the rules of the school. Punishments are arbitrary and rule-breaking is even rewarded. The rules are often bizarre. Most characters seem to view the rules as meaningless pedantry, a formality which all must waste time pretending to comply with.This makes Hogwarts seems less like a school than a hotel where Harry meets his magical peers.#3 - ABUSE, VIOLENCE, TORTUREThe books are loaded with abuse, violence, and torture, including cruelty to animals and children. No one in the books seems to care. Characters like Harry Potter respond with their own cruelty and no one cares. The abuse begins in the first book and steadily worsens throughout the series.#4 - THERE ARE NO HEROESRowling goes beyond corruption of authority figures. Her rule is that there can be no good people at all, no heroes. Everyone must be cut down and leveled.No one in the Potter books seems to have a moral code. Harry loves to lie, read other people's correspondence, argue with his friends, etc. Concepts like self-sacrifice surface from time to time, but there is no follow through.The end result of all this is a grim world in which there is mechanical magic, but nothing truly good. There is no idealism in Harry Potter's world. There is no duty, no honor, no family, no self-sacrifice, no wise teachers, and no experts.In Harry's world there is only SELF."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I really do not like this book.

I have seen and LOVED all the HP movies, and consider myself an HP fan, but, this first book is a major disappointment.I was expecting much better writing, more descriptive story telling and better characters. I am not finished with the book yet, and I will finish it, but I am not too sure I will finish the series.To be fair, my 10 year old did tell me it was kinda boring, but he has read it 3 times... maybe I need to introduce him to the rest of my library! It has some fabulous fantasy in it. MUCH better than this.This is the rare case where the movies are FAR superior to the books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It was very unrealistic, and some of the scenes came out of nowhere, and there were chapter cuts where there should not have been chapter cuts, and that's all I have to say."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Why Do We Love It?J.K. Rowling's exciting, award winning novel Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is about an eleven year old boy named Harry Potter who lives with his dreadful aunt and uncle, until a letter is delivered to him by an owl, inviting him to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Learning that he is an actual wizard himself, Harry decides to attend Hogwarts, where something very valuable and special is being guarded - the legendary Sorcerer's Stone. When Harry and his friends suspect someone is trying to steal the mystical stone, only then do their adventures really begin. This page-turner has become so popular with readers of all ages because the elements of magic intrigue and captivate the reader, while the incredible suspense leaves the reader wanting to know more. Magic has always been a subject of interest for people of every age, and this imaginative novel is saturated with it. In the reader's mind, the delightful possibility of magical concoctions means that practically anything is possible at Hogwarts, which will spellbind them even more. Since magic sometimes breaks the laws of science, it is very appealing to the imaginative reader,who willingly escapes the world of reality and enters a world where anything is conceivable, with Harry Potter as the hero, of course. The second reason people love this book so much is because of the ever-increasing amount of suspense, which grips the reader and doesn't let go until the very last page. From the very beginning of the novel, the author creates suspense when she describes Harry's mysterious past, the death of his parents, and Voldemort, someone who did something so wicked that wizards don't like to say his name. However, not until a few more chapters does the reader really begin to understand the truth. Throughout the novel, the author uses this device that is very important in keeping the reader's attention. People, not matter how old they are, love to be on the edge of their seat, yearning to know what is going to happen to their beloved hero. Suspense also allows the reader to be surprised by the unexpected. For most readers, their definition of a good book is a story that they become engrossed in, which requires a certain amount of suspense and excellent subject matter, in this case, magic. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone definitely fits that description, if not surpasses it. Magic is, by definition, the use of charms and spells to control events, something that humans cannot do. However, the fact that this story turns the impossible into the norm is very fascinating to its readers, and it appeals to many people, anyone who can read. Readers delight in the uncertainty of suspense because it helps them to relate to the characters, and often they feel as if they were actually experiencing what the protagonist is going through. Readers who thoroughly enjoy the book can't seem to get enough of Harry -- everyone is clamoring to read its sequels, too!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I've read this book (Not to mention the other two) over and over, and I still find it the most exiting book I've ever read.

I was only slightly curious about them when my cousin told my aunt that she wanted to read the Harry Potter books, &quot;because that's what Beth writes.&quot; I write fantasy, and my cousin is one of my greatest fans.Sure enough though I found a Harry Potter book under my tree on Christmas morning. My curiousity had been piqued earlier, but I still put the book on the shelf unread. A few weeks later I caught the flu and was stuck in bed with my books to keep me company. Once again I remembered the book left up on my shelf. I pulled it out and began to read.Instantly I was transformed into another world full of Muggles and Wizards, magic wands and strange Quiditch games. Harry Potter was enchanting from the start. You just wanted to reach out and pluck the character from the cruelty of his aunt and uncle.Rowling does a great job bringing out the character and interweaving everyday problems like standing up to your peers, or being accepted at a new school. It makes the characters believeable, and even loveable.Yet there is still that element of mystery and the macabre that draws the older audiences. The parts that require the mind, and are not too hard to understand for younger audiences. Yet there are the parts that are only the level of the mature.I was amazed to hear that many adults and teens were reading these books. Harry Potter is a must read. You'll never read anything like it. It has the right balance of humor, mystery, and everyday problems to keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is a book for those who still have an imagination. One of my friends read the book and she hated it because she doesn't have the imagination. I personally loved the book.

I felt the pain of Harry's losses and when he fell I fell to.When he triumphed I felt like I was a part of it.

I think there are great descriptions of his harsh living conditions. I really enjoy when he gets to Hogwarts and he has to wait to find out which room he is in. Boy, he certainly got in a lot of trouble. However I think he made the right decision to go out at nightand give away Hagrid's dragon. I think it was really cool trying to stop Sprout or another professor from getting the Sorcerer's Stone. I would be pretty scared if that was me and if I was going after it.

You won't be able to put it down until you're finished!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Although deeply flawed, this book did manage finally to entertain. The story is remarkable in that it trusts children with a sense of the foreboding and isn't afraid to disturb them with dark imagery. Considering the truly frightening nature of certain of our most cherished fairy-tales, I suspect that this trust is not misplaced; it is, however, in little evidence elsewhere.For example, I found the book remarkably pedestrian for a work of fantasy. Elements of magic and fairy-tale tend toward the silly rather than the fantastic, and almost never evoke the sense of awe and wonder that good fantasy should. Funny names like &quot;Hogwart's&quot; and &quot;muggle&quot; are amusing, but little more; common magical conceits like witches' brooms are familiar, but therefore also mundane. The half-twist ending did surprise me, but only because the rest of the story convinced me that the author wasn't truly capable of doing so--or perhaps didn't bother trying otherwise, considering her audience.Why cheat (rather than challenge) a child's sense of the wonderful if one is willing to (uncharacteristically) trust her sense of the horrible?But, in the end, the book's core tale of schooltime friendship and adventure manages to shine through, and when considered as a work of English boarding-school fiction rather than fantasy, it enjoys more than mild success.If you're looking for a great work of children's fantasy you may want to search elsewhere; if you're looking to kill a few hours with an enjoyable read, then &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; could work for you.It's good fun at the very least, and certainly most kids will find it so."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"We are enjoying the Harry Potter series of books but inspite of the excellent stories and overall good writing, we have one major concern. Young readers want to believe in magic and dragons and wizards and such. If they are not prepared to understand that Magic, in this sense is a myth and all in fun, they may be encouraged to seek magical experiences through the occult which is the closest reality to the magic presented in the Harry Potter books. There is of course a very real spiritual dark side, only to anxious to initiate our young people into the &quot;secrets&quot; of witchcraft and supposed power over others. With this understanding, they are very enjoyable fiction."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought maybe I'd read the book, until I had to create a second profile to buy this for my Kindle.

The best part of this book is when they won the Qudditch game, and when he found the Sorcer's Stone. It's the best book. I think Ron likes Hermione alot! Dumbledore is nice to Harry by getting him of the hook, but Snap is different he gets Harry, Ron, and Hermione in troulbe and he doesn't let them explain. I think Snap should get fired. Harry met some great friends named Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, and Dumbledore. Ron always helps Harry, so does Hermione, Hagrid is nice to send Harry persent when the Durleys' don't, Dumbledore is nice to get Harry off the hook.

The writing is excelent, pulls you right into the story until you could tell it as if you'd been there yourself. You come to know the characters as you might know your best friends. Or in the case of some, best enemies.Well, I won't ruin the book by telling what happens - the suspense is thrilling! :) Definately a must read, though.

Neither of us will ever see the age of 9-13 again, but I can't wait for my four year-old daughter to get old enough to read this series. I can only hope that the wonder and enchantment she feels when she reads these books, will stick with her into adulthood. If she is not at least as impressed as I am, with Hogwarts and Harry, then I will know I gave birth to a squib. Don't let the young age group of the target audience deter you from reading these stories. I picked up the first one; literally couldn't put it down; and read all three books in three days.

When they got the book, they said they didn't think they would like it, but instead can't put it down. It has made the rounds through their school.

I am a 46 year old mother of 2 adult children, and it almost (I repeat, almost) makes me wish they were 12 again so I could share it with them. I would rank it right up there with the favorite book of my own adolescence - &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; by Madeline L'Engle. It addresses all the common fears, angst, and joys of growing up in this world, but in a fantastical setting, and has a twist ending uncommon in children's books. It treats the reader as though he or she had a brain, and that may be why we adults enjoy it so. I look forward to reading the others, but am a bit disappointed that a movie is to be made. Harry should remain in our minds and hearts as Rowlings has ignited them - that is the beauty of reading and imagination. As far as the concern that it is spreading evil - Oh, pul-leeeze!! As someone else here pointed out - all the traditional fairy tales (told to even younger audiences) included magic, witches, monsters, etc., often without the excellent messages relayed in the Potter books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I absolutely love the film series and now I'm making my way through the books.

I understood this reading as something everyone can read, from 2 to 52... ranging in knowledge. I have read many a book in my 14 years of living, and this has to be the only one that I refused to finish."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a person who loves good literature, including good fantasy writing. I have read and enjoyed Dostoyevsky and Solzhenitzin, but also love The Lord of the Rings, and other fantasy works by the likes of Stephen R. Donaldson and Philip Jose Farmer, for example.When my wife became an avid \\"Potter fan\\" I decided to give this book a try, but I found the prose style so dreadful that I was unable to continue beyond the first chapter. Whatever this series has to recommend it as far as the story goes (I watch the movies to keep up with that, and they are pretty entertaining), the writing itself is unforgivably poor. Most creative writing students that I spoke with about it at Fresno State agree with me, as well. This makes me think that Harry Potter is mostly read by people with limited experience with literature, as is the case with my wife, for example. If you never listen to Beethoven, Vivaldi, or Mahler, you won't recognize good from bad attempts at \\"classical\\" music."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My mother read me this at bedtime. I enjoyed this book, but it wasn't the best book I've ever had read to me at bedtime. Other, better books include The Hobbit, by J. R. R. Tolkien, and The Last Battle, by C. S. Lewis. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was exciting and I kept trying to guess what would happen, which was fun. But it wasn't at all scary or shivery, though it was sad that Harry's mother and father were dead, and that someone I liked was on Voldemort's side. I liked the magic bits, but Narnian magic seemed much more real. Also I didn't believe some of Harry Potter, like the defeat of the troll; it seemed too easy peasy lemon squeezy. But I liked it enough to read the next one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"IN this first installment of the Harry Potter series, Harry escapes from an oppressive family, enrolls in witchcraft school, makes friends, plays quiddich, and encounters an evil plot to steal a stone of magical powers.The writing quality of this book is good though not exceptional. The book has many well-conceived and integrated elements that lend to its strength.The Harry Potter books and movies have been controversial precisely because they have mixed good and bad elements.On the one hand, Harry Potter is at times good-natured, defends the weak, exhibits humility, is a sympathetic character due to his struggles, and rejects the temptation to turn to the dark side.Furthermore, the story encourages the value of sacrifice. For example, Harry is protected by the self-sacrificing love of his mother, reminiscent of Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross to save those who would come to him.On the other hand, the book has negative elements. It promotes witchcraft. Witchcraft, whether in its \\"black\\" or \\"white\\" form, is evil. \\"There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, one who uses divination, one who practices witchcraft, or one who interprets omens, or a sorcerer, or one who casts a spell, or a medium, or a spiritist, or one who calls up the dead.\\" - Deut. 18:10-11.Furthermore, the book promotes morally bad behavior. The heroes manifest racism: the witches commonly refer to those not like themselves in a scornful way (\\"muggles\\"). Harry is also a malicious character: he says at one point, \\"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley [his stepbrother]\\". He is also power-hungry: he lusts for the magic power the wand could give him. Harry and his friend Ron also harbor hatred and desire for revenge toward schoolmates. The message here seems to be that it's ok to repay hatred with hatred, racism with racism, cruelty with cruelty.In short, the reader who discounts the negative elements of the book might find this an entertaining read.However, I found the book boring. What's there to like about a power-hungry and racist main character, even if he is sympathetic? We're all sinful too, and we need to face that--but what's there to love about it?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book does not live up to the hype.

Well, I will give you that it is a childrens book, and anything that gets children to read is great, BUT why adults? I didn't find the book to be on the same level as \\"Crime and Punishment\\" by Dostoesvky, or \\"The Idiot\\"....I can agree that maybe this book will be a classic just because of the mainstream cult it has created, NOT because it is on the same level as true 18th/19th century classics. It's just another fantasy book about magic powers and etc. I even remember a long time ago, when I was a child and before Harry Potter, seeing a movie on the disney channel about a girl who was a witch that went to a school to learn magic powers and etc. Joseph Conrad, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Leo Tolstoy, John Milton, Charles Dickens, Edgar Allan Poe, even Jack Kerouac are writers who could be looked at as writing classics, but Harry Potter is mainly fad reading and no-mind entertainment. Basically, reading a Harry Potter book is like going to see the new movie that is going to come out. I still remember seeing a kid nextdoor who read a Harry Potter book all day outside so that everyone could see they were reading it -- there was kids playing in the streets, cars going by, builders building houses, yet they still stayed outside to make sure everyone could see them reading the book. While I'm sure people enjoy this book, anyone who claims it's a classic or that it's the best thing in the past years is obviously not a heavy reader and must lack a basic knowledge of the history of literature."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved it Rowling JK is a big hero !!!!!!!!!!Every ONE shold read these nice books I am going to school(That would be my unsupervised 10-year old daughter who wrote that review.)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"People must be in a dark place, that they like this book so much.

Only reason I can give of not giving this book five stars is probably because I saw the movie first (usually read the book first) and there were some differences to get used to. The Dursley family seem several orders of magnitude more harsh toward Harry then the movie implied, and it seemed Dumbledore was less present in book 1 then the movie. I do believe my opinion might be a bit skewed, since I have memory of multiple movies with only one book reading. Hagrid's character seems a little bit different then the movie protrays. I'm sure as I progress through the books I will become more used to the book format rather then the movies, as well as the writing style which I found easy to follow, humorous and nicely done."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have always liked the Harry potter books they are funny as well as well written I could read them over and over"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read this years ago and loved it.

JK Rowling is like an Enid Blyton of the OO's and I'm hoping that there will be many more of Harry Potter's adventures and heroes like him, so that I can read them to my son, just as my mother read Enid Blyton to me.

I clung to my classic literature roots, claiming I'd read Dostoyevsky for fun before Harry Potter. However, recently I was required to read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for an academic(!) event at school. I was stunned. Read Harry Potter for a Literary Criticism assignment- that's crazy talk! But sadly yes, I too found this book completely engaging. The plot is entertaining, the characters amusing, and the dialogue humorous. I hesitate to call it a modern classic, but all those who think that they are above Harry Potter, think again!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As an evangelical Christian, but one who likes to evaluate things for myself and not just take someone else's word for it, I took a great deal of interest in the Harry Potter hoopla. Are the Harry Potter books evil? Do they promote Satanism? I decided to find out for myself, starting with the first book. My verdict? These are the most enjoyable, creative, and imaginative books I've read in the fantasy genre (please stop calling these children's books!) since &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;. I do not believe the Harry Potter books are dangerous because they take place in a fantasy realm, not a realistic one, and, let's face it, with all the abuse poor Harry has to endure, both in the Muggle world and at Hogwarts, it doesn't make the wizarding life look totally appealing, if such a life were even a possibility. Too many difficulties, and too many close brushes with death (or at least expulsion)!Having read through the first three books by now, there are some questions I have to raise. Since the Dursley's obviously dislike Harry and put him through much emotional abuse, can they just not put him up for foster care, or does England not have such a system? And how can someone as hateful and patently unfair as Professor Snape be allowed to teach? As sympathetic a character as the headmaster Dumbledore is, I think the school needs a reformer to come in and improve the system, making for a more fair and equitable environment for young wizards and witches. But then, I get angry at injustice, and much injustice goes on in this series. I guess it adds to the plot.Kids will be reading this book 100 years from now, just as they are still reading &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. And, like &quot;Alice&quot;, this book is not just for kids, and in fact I think can be more appreciated by adults. I'm not sure I'd put it in &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; class, but it has classic potential nonetheless."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"With the thousands of reviews that this book has gotten, there really isn't much that I can add. There is a reason these books have done so well. They are simply marvelous! The target audience may be teenagers, but &quot;kids&quot; of all ages will enjoy the escape these books provide.I won't go into any descriptions about the plot since many of the other posts have covered that. However, I do want to help convince those of you who may be wondering if you should read this book. When it was finally delivered to me, I could not wait to crack it's covers and see for myself if all the rage about it was deserved. It was! So much so, that I ordered the complete set after reading about 20 minutes worth of it. My only regret is that I thought it would take me about a week to finish it, so I didn't select the Next Day shipping option when I orderd the remaining books from Amazon.com. Well, I couldn't put it down and finished it in about 3 evenings. Now, sadly, I must wait on the others; though I am very tempted to spend a few evenings in some of the local bookstores while I wait for my own copies. :)Honestly people, if you don't read this book, it's your lost.

I would recommend this book to any age."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"ok,I will start off by saying this is the best book I have ever read! It has so many twists and turns and that makes the book even more interesting to read! I have to say, I was not pleased when my mother told me, &quot;Gary, I have heard of books like Harry Potter, they are very popular! I want you to start reading them!&quot; So, of course I bought it and I read it! It was the best book! Of course i read the age level, ages 9-12 or 8-13 meaning around 10 years old to read it. But this book is definately not for a 10 yr old. It is sure not an easy book where a 10 yr old would get lost at all the twists and turns, yet the plot is easy enough! This book is surely a 11-13 yr old kind of book, where I have a friend who has a cousin and he is 9 and he tried to read the first 13 pages and he got lost! This book is definately not recomended to the younger kids. But as i go back to the point, I think that not only was this book good, but i can guarantee that the next 3 books will be good! I am up to the 2nd! I hope it is good, which is a big chance!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Who in the English-reading world hasn't heard of Harry Potter by now? No need to recap the plotline details here. Harry is a great kid, just the sort of vulnerable, yet feisty hero that MOST parents would like to think their child is. He's an appealing character for adults and kids alike.I have read that this book is the most-banned in the US for the past year. That would be the doing of all those weird fundamentalist types who seem to think reading Hemingway turns you into a suicidal fisherman, or Pride and Prejudice encourages girls to elope with unsuitable army officers.The lovely thing about the books is that despite all the hype accompanying the publication of the 4th HP book, it was bubbling along by the best possible method: word of mouth amongst kids themselves.These books are a librarian's dream (the kids want to read more) and curse (how many copies do you have to buy, and how soon they wear out!)The first 20 pages or so of this book provide all the background set-up for the following (and they are the hardest going passages for the young reader, in my view). After that, we enter the world of Enid Blyton with a very big difference - the English boarding school story suffused with magic, fun and danger. One of the delights is that instead of privation, this school is one of bounty - no need for secret midnight feasts when good food, feasting and celebration is part of the regular Hogwarts experience!Harry and his friends Hermione and Ron are terrific creations, and will remain children's classics - deservedly so. They're terrific books to read along with the kids. I believe young people still enjoy their parents or other adults reading aloud with them even at the age where they could read these independently (the target age group is about 9 to 12). Any parent or other grown up who does so will laugh along and be as enchanted as the kids are!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"but Argus Filch is a squib... oops, got to save that for &quot;The Chamber of Secrets.&quot; I'm not telling anything. :-9 The awesome debut of J.K Rowling's marketing strategy, uh, sorry... muggle-raised (being raised by a non-magical person/family) lightning-scarred chart-topper is a start of a series that follows in the footsteps of Roald Dahl and a few others, like P.L.

Harry was brought up by the Dursleys, who the matriarch was sister to Lily Potter, Harry's mum, who were mean, devilish muggles (non-magical, again) who has a very greedy, not to mention, obese son named Dudley. Harry, of course, had birthdays, but not parties or presents but stayed in a cupboard almost all day for 10 years. But, then something came up. A letter from a mysterious school, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, headed by the only person Volde, uh, nevermind, was afraid of, Albus Dumbledore (Dumbledore meaning bumblebee, in today's typical American society). This was the first letter Harry ever got. But, his uncle Vernon, threw it out, then got more letters by the pound, and then it got to the point where they had to move out. Then suddenly in the hut where the Dursleys and Harry were staying, a giant, large hulk appears who supposedly had a Somerset accent (I'm part English and my dad is Briton, so I got to know these things). He threatens the Dursleys to hand Harry over. They eventually do, and now the funny part is over, and I will throw an invisibility cloak over the suspense. I am waiting for Book 4 to arrive, and when waiting, I will catch up with &quot;Chamber&quot; and &quot;Azkaban,&quot; 2nd and 3rd books, respectively. So, if you don't already have the book, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN FOR THE PAST YEAR! PLUTO? Going to a library won't help, even if MY library has 34 copies of the latest book, because the waiting list, or holds, at my library, will have the total capacity of Fort Wayne, Indiana on it! (Over 150,000) So quit dawdling, and catch up! But don't buy, if you are very religious. BTW, Book 4 gave Amazon a world record. (Most back orders of one book before release. Good going, Bezos!) Besides, prices are going down. Get it, before I stretch too far."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I find the Harry Potter books fascinating. I have always had a wonderful imagination and still do at 25. I have always been an avid reader and heard mention on the radio about some of the controversy surrounding the books. So naturally, my curiousity was fueled and I was out purchasing the book that evening, I finished it soon thereafter and purchased the 2nd and 3rd book immediately. If anyone thinks these books could desensitize children or corrupt them, then they are truly wrong and should not pass judgement until they have actually read the books. It fuels a childs imagination which seems to be deteriorating over time, parents should be happy to see their child reading a book. Do people think that the 'Wizard of Oz' books are evil? desensitizing? or corruptive? NOT ME! I have the whole collection. Come on get w/the program dust off your imagination people! Come be a child w/dreams again. While your doing that, I am off to read #4...may take awhile. =)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"BUT who cares. I, too, can still enjoy a great book when I read one, even if it is a kids' book! Enough with this nonsense about Rowling and her so called publicity blitz...for once there is a series of books worthy of the media attention; on a par with Tolkien and L'Engle. Any book that encourages children to turn off the TV and read is a classic in my opinion. Harry is my new best friend! Makes me wish I weren't a muggle!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have always been a lover of a good fantasy novel. I constantly heard people ranting and raving about Harry Potter. I finally decided to give him a try and I fell in love. I couldn't put it down and once I finished the first book I had to run out and get the other three. I'm still counting down until Year 5 comes out.J K Rowling created Harry Potter's world to contain enough imagination to keep me interested with making Harry himself normal enough to seem real. It's the perfect balance."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In the movie Forest Gump there is the quote, \\"Mama always said, \`Life is like a box of chocolates, ya never know whatch ya gunna get.\\" This book is a wonderful example of that quote; each time you turn the page you don't know what's coming.Harry thinks that he is a normal boy whose parents happened to die in a car crash. He is now living with his aunt, uncle, and cousin. When Harry finds out that he is really a wizard, his world is turned upside down. He begins to learn all the different tricks that he never knew before, like how to get into Diagon Alley and Platform 9 3/4. There are so many things that Harry doesn't know and finds quite surprising when he reaches Hogwarts School of WitchCraft and Wizardy. Harry also learns to play Quidditch, a game like hockey played in the air, and becomes the youngest player for the house teams in years.This mystery draws you in farther and farther as you read. It is an exciting adventure you'll never forget and cherish for a lifetime. The sequels, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire are as good as the first. If you enjoyed these, just remember that there are more to come."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think that most of people have heard the name of this novel at least once. This novel is really famous, and I was also recommended to read the novel by my friends.The story of this novel is going on in the two different worlds, wizards and witches world and the normal, our world. Harry Potter who is the main character of this novel suddenly start to join unknown world, magic world, and unusual life. But he gets over the problems with his brave heart.I really like this novel, it is really exciting and impressive. The magic world is unknown world for us, but the auther makes some connections with our world. I think that is why it doesn't make readers boring. I reeally recommend you to read this novel."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"...Harry Potter is a pretty good book I thought. I think most people would like it, but it just isn't for me. The main part is Harry is a wizard and is trying to catch a bad villain, with the help of Herminie and Ron. With there help he completed his mission."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm was only going to give this four, because of lack of character development. At first I thought that Rowling didn't portray Harry as a human being. I read this book to the end and thought \\"Hey...it seems that Harry is perfect. The kid has no flaws. He's got the whole \\"Lion/Gryffindor/courageous\\" thing going.\\" Don't argue with me by saying that his flaw is that he's an average student, unlike Hermione. That is NOT a huge flaw. He's GOT to have a weak spot or at least a character flaw.Also, I think everything is portrayed in a rather stereotypical light. The stereotypical wise old man that's full of pearls of wisdom versus the stereotypiacl evil incarnate who's loaded down with thoughts of hate and revenge, etc. I'm not going to critique this book about a stereotypical male hero, because I don't think that's so stereotypical these days. See the above paragraph for what I think of the hero.The book has a quirky sense of humor that even adults can chuckle at. Even though there's all this stereotypical stuff in there, Rowling does put a few new twists on it. No doubt there's going to be the stereotypical showdown good vs. evil at the end of the series which nevertheless I am DYING to read.Now that we're past all the critiquing I give the book 4 stars and say that you should definately read the whole series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"...I generally don't like fantasy stories (witches and elfs and all of that) and I can't imagine being interested in a Children's book. However, one day I was at the airport (two hours early!) and I finished my book! I went to the bookstore and there was Harry Potter. I decided it was time to give it a try and I picked up Sorcerer's Stone.Several months later, I, a 33 year old single man with no children, have read all four of the Harry Potter books and I'm anxiously waiting for the fifth! I NEVER would have believed that I would get hooked! But I did! They are wonderful books for any age. The stories are engaging and the writing is simple but powerful. J. K. Rowling deserves all of the kudos she receives! I strongly recommend this and the other three books to \\"kids\\" of any age!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best book I've ever read! It is filled with action! J. K. Rowling is a very creative writer! That is one thing that makes this book so great! It is really interesting and good for kids and adults. My mom read it, and couldn't put it down. I've read all of the Harry Potter books and like them all. It is about a boy named Harry Potter who thinks he is just an ordinary boy, soon to find out he is a famous person in the wizarding world. He then starts at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. I recommend it to anyone who likes imaginative things!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'll admit, I was one of the thousands of adults that thought Harry Potter books were kids books and that I would not enjoy them. But after hearing friend after friend pick up these books and enjoy them, I thought I would give them a try.I am sure glad that I did. From the opening of the Sorcerer's Stone, I was taken to a world of wizards and witches. The writing was very easy to read, but there were some story lines that were very interesting. This was a book that took me to a different place, Hogwarts. It was great ways to take your mind off the stresses of life and read a happy story about a young boy making his dreams come true.This was a good book for all ages, and I highly recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My friends always say stuff like Harry doesn't a character or what's he actually like? But Harry spent the First ten years of his life locked in a cupboard! which is just the begining of the list of miseries. Then Harry gets a mysterios letter which changes his life forever. With the Dursleys he's a nobody, but in the wizarding world he's one of the most famous wizards of all time! He goes to Hogwarts(some name) school of witchcraft and wizardardy. And runs into the two best friend a teacher who hates hima and a whole bunch of adventure.Despite the first chapter which is a little dull, (but hey I can't talk I can RECITE the first page from memory) I liked this book a lot no matter what people say about Harry's character."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a very good book. It is one of the few books that I will allow myself to read. I started reading it when my mom told me about it, and I'm grateful she suggested it! This book has drama, humor, suspense, and mystery. It is fun to learn about Hogwarts and the wizarding world. If you are looking for a good book and just can't find one, you should read this one- you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book keeps you involved the whole time without giving you a chance to take a break!!

I can't wait to give it to my wife. She is going to love it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It's not my first time reading this book and surely it won't be the last. I just wish the movies based on these novels could have been done even closer to the books. However, I do have all the 8 movies which I also enjoy now and then. Hopefully J.K. Rowling will soon be putting together a \\"Harry Potter's Series Encyclopedia\\" for even more delight to the readers. I'm looking forward it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It definitely held up to my expectations!
