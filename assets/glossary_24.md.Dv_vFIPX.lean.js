Saying no more kids, Magnus vows to remain celibate. He also needs to spice up his life so he takes ten of his brood with him (one is married) on a sea trip, but a mysterious fog traps the vessel within its darkness.In present day Hollywood, Angela Abruzzi along with her family struggle to save the family vineyard, Blue Dragon, currently not producing any wine. Angela thinks a Viking movie filmed at Blue Dragon will save the Vineyards. Meanwhile her grandmother worries about Angela and prays a man will come for her single granddaughter. Magnus and his family land at Holly and Wood in Angela's time. Because of his garb and accent, everyone thinks Magnus is an actor. Angela is persuaded to keep an eye on him to keep him out of trouble. As he battles modern times, Magnus finds Angela is the real challenge as she makes him desire an end to his vow of celibacy.Up front this is not a Carpenter type novel. Instead readers obtain an amusing time travel romance that is outrageously funny when Magnus voices or acts on his observations. The plot avoids the one book joke by placing Magnus and his football team into varying scenarios. Angela is a charming counterpoint trying to provide normalcy, but failing because she loves her displaced actor. Fans of contemporary Viking tales will obviously enjoy this novel, but so will anyone who appreciates a very humorous almost slapstick story.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Very Virile Viking","review":"The most recent (and heaven forbid, not her last!) installment of Sandra Hill's Viking Saga's, this story quickly became very dear to my heart. Once again, Sandra has not disappointed us. Magnus'endearing brood of 9, along with his commitment to maintain his vow of celibacy keeps you laughing out loud, at one point and wiping the tears at another. His unexpected adventure and eventual &quot;Destiny&quot; will keep you entertained to the end. I could not put this book down, and when I had to leave, all I could think about, was how soon I could pick it up again...Well written, fun and not to mention very steamy, the author has once again come through for us. If you are a fan of time travel, and especially Sandra Hill you will not be disapointed...Sandra, Please, Please, Please don't make this the last! We love your Viking stories and look forward to every new one!"},{"Title":"The Very Virile Viking","review":"I enjoyed this book from page one to the end, and laughing all the way...I mean 10th Century Viking discover Wallie World...what a howl! Magnus is the brother from Truly Madly Viking and the Last Viking.Magnus is sort of the joke of his village. He has 13 kids, two have died and he is just marrying off his eldest daughter. We soon begin to understand, that not all these kids are his, but every woman wanting to get rid of her unwanted baby has passed it off as his. But Magnus is not stupid, he just loves his children, though they do drive him - and the village nuts at times. So he takes the A-viking and ends up as his brothers did in present day. Boy when they go A-Viking they really go A-Viking.In this one he and his 9 kids land in the land of Holly &amp; Wood...and he instantly finds his destiny in Angela the granddaughter of Rose, owner of the Blue Dragon winery. Rose want grandchildren, wants her granddaughter happily married and would like to see the series of accidents reversed so once more the winery can produce wine.It is charming and so utterly witty! I simply loved this book, the best of Sandra Hill."},{"Title":"The Very Virile Viking","review":"I am not usually a fan of time-travel romances, but this one was good. I really liked the main characters. Magnus is a viking who has a number of children and a heart of gold. He is transported through time with his children to modern day California. Not only is it funny to see a grown main adjust to a new time, but adding all those children into the mix really added to the humor in the story. The only thing that really did not add up was how long it took for all of them to realize they were in another time. For the longest time, Magnus and his children thought ways were different becaue they were in a new land, not time. I thought that made them seem dumb. Other than that, it is sexy, warm, and funny. Very entertaining, even if time-travel is not your usual genre of romance."},{"Title":"The Very Virile Viking","review":"Sandra Hill takes the basic format of a romance novel and turns it on its ear to create a funny, clever, and thoroughly readable time travel/love story.The hero, Magnus, isn't the strong, silent type. In fact, he's a Viking pushover who has been saddled with eleven children (many of whom aren't even his). The heroine, Angela, isn't an innocent virgin with an idealistic view of life. Instead, she's a divorced realtor trying desperately to save her family's vineyard. When the two miraculously meet, apparently in response to a prayer by Angela's grandmother for a virile man for her granddaughter, the attraction is immediate. However, neither is willing to admit their feelings.Magnus (who appears in modern-day California with most of his motherless children in tow) has sworn himself to celibacy. And Angela is afraid to commit herself after the disaster of her first marriage. Their awkward courtship, with the help of Magnus' children and Angela's grandmother, is often hysterically funny and yet feels right to modern readers---many of whom have experienced &quot;blended&quot; families themselves.Read this book--and then go back and read its prequels, The Last Viking and Truly, Madly Viking. You'll love them all."},{"Title":"The Very Virile Viking","review":"Magnus is so cute, he's a strong viking, funny, gentle in other words great leading man. I could see a romantic comedy (movie) being made from this. I enjoyed this book from the get go.Angela is also very believeable and you don't dislike her, she's not the usual back biting leading lady. She takes Magnus for who he is and doesn't try to change him like others do.Wonderful, I'm so glad I found Sandra Hill last week at the local used book store. I've read three of these Viking Sagas and can't wait to read more!"},{"Title":"The Very Virile Viking","review":"Magnus Ericsson, the third brother from &quot;The Last Viking&quot; and &quot;Truly, Madly Viking&quot;, was a crude man, a farmer and a father of thirteen children he had had with several wives, mistresses and &quot;passing fancies&quot;. Definitely not hero material!But when he time travelled to the kingdom of &quot;Holly Wood&quot; with nine of his children, he really became Angela's hero.This is a humorous and sensual tale. The wordplay beetween the characters is well written and it makes you laugh out loud."},{"Title":"The Very Virile Viking","review":"The Very Virile Viking: it's a catchy title, a memorable title even.The book itself is based on a far-fetched tale of time-travel, between the murauding days of the Vikings (as suggested by title) and modern day Hollywood.The tounge-in-cheek stlye aimed for by the author falls flat on via the detailed explanations leading up to every joke. My favorite part was the son who kept asking for a bow and arrow set with every second breath- that at least rang true.It certainly was a brave attempt and obviously has succeeded with some, but I found it horribly unsatisfactory, crude, & dumb.Attempting tounge in cheek sexy romance but acheiving only corny porn.It's about 400 pages too long, and dwells with too much detail on everything, from the perfect physique of the Viking, his resemblance to a tree, and his great whopping 'tree like member'.How does one say such things in a review for Amazon? No matter that the book discusses it with every intimate scene. And there are many.Magnus the Virile Viking, something of a byword in his homeland on account of the many children delivered to his doorstep by various mothers, decides to outrun the laughter and launches his longboat with 9 remaining children (2 dead, 1 married and one left in charge at home).By incongrous mishap and the help of a chuckling whale, they end up on the lot of a Hollywood remake of \\"the Viking\\" where they encounter Angela. She's the heroine, and trying to broker a location deal with the producer to keep her family vineyard running.Of course they are instantly smitten and the whole viking troop ends up out at the vineyard and wiggle way into Angela & co. affections.Speaking of affections, the affectations of the constant rewording of things is belabored ad nauseum. Much effort is expended on constantly reminding the reader of the origins & differences of Magnus & children.This is the sort of novel my DB pal Amanda Richards could top without a pause, and I am sure the wit wouldn't be so belaboured or the people so dull.As for the bedroom scenes - they are described in constant graphic detail and one would heartily prefer not to think about them any further!kotori 2005"},{"Title":"The Very Virile Viking","review":"This book is one of a series about a family of male viking that travel into the future.

This book adds the humor all of Sandra Hill's books seem to have.

I have been chastised in some reviews for this trait. I was left hanging with my mouth open when I reached the end of this book. No resolution was even attempted. No connection with Magnus's brothers in the previous two stories. No idea what will happen to Magnus and Angela, although we can guess at that one. To me this was a missed opportunity to gather together the time-traveling Viking clan and have a truly romantic, funny and enduring ending to the series. I also felt there were many characters whose lives and stories were left unfinished. I still enjoyed reading this book even though some of the things were becoming repetitive and tedius from previous books in this series and the love scenes were also repeats with slightly different touches (ha!ha!). If you have not read any of the books in this series, you will probably like this one and none of my problems will concern you. But as a fan of Sandra Hill I find this less than her best work."},{"Title":"The Very Virile Viking","review":"I have all of Sandra Hill's books. This is the funniest book of them all.

Try it you will like it!"},{"Title":"The Very Virile Viking","review":"I haven't read all of Sandra Hill's Viking series (yet), but I've read several. I've read The Last Viking; Truly, Madly Viking; and this one, The Very Virile Viking, in their proper order, but not intentionally. They just happened to be the ones I pulled out of my box in that order. I loved this one just as much as Truly, Madly Viking, and I will continue to read this series, because I love the romance, the storylines and, most of all, the laughs. There aren't a lot of authors with books that are historical or time-travel *and* funny all the way through, so Sandra Hill is a gem. Her covers are pretty delicious, too.Although not always necessary, I do recommend reading series books in order, but this series can be read and enjoyed, whichever ones you pick up first."},{"Title":"The Very Virile Viking","review":"This is first i have ever read anything by this author. My loving friend knows i am a helpless romantic and bought a five of these Viking Romances for me and i decided to start with The Very Virile Viking(because of both the interesting title and the HOTTT ass guy on the cover!). Magnus is a very hot guy but not my favorite hero. He has 11 kids which he gained from four wives and several concubines, and he is basically the laughing stock of his village. He becomes depressed by all this and decided to go off with his kids to dicover new lands. Through certain happenstances he ended up in the 21st century where he met Angela who is a real estate agent and Grandma Rose's daughter, the owner of Blue Dragon.I liked this book because is of the vasts amount of humour and sexual tension between the hero and heroine. Though most people thought the sex scenes were too much, i absolutely loved it! She had to let her hero live up to his name people! The Very Virile Viking remember!Anyways thats just about it for me, certain things were left questionable. I needed a little bit more action, i'm a major Jude Deveraux fan and i am used to getting action and adventure between romance. I wish the author would haved placed her readers there when 'Big Bird' attacked and Magnus got shot. Also it would have been nice is Magnus actually accepted and went and did a little acting with Darrell. I don't think i needed to know that all the kids were possibly not Magnus's blood, that kind of spoiled the affection i had for them.The dialogs, though funny, were a bit undeveloped at times for people over 30 years olds. I just cant imagine a grown man saying \\"Whatever!\\" Not to mention a man like Magnus who was described as heavily muscular and tall as a tree!While reading, i kept thinking this novel sounded all too familiar, then i realised it was a bit like A Knight in Shining Armor.Anyways the book is a good read if your looking for a few good laughs and crazy sex scenes(not to mention the dry tuppings). I enjoyed it but it wasn't one of those novels that grabbed me. I dont think i will be reading the others i have on my shelf now because i have a feeling it might just be the same story repeated but just with different characters: Boy leaves tenth century on a long ship and ends up in the 21st century, then meets a beautiful girl then falls in love after a few saucy mouthings. Yeah, i think i'll pass on 'em."},{"Title":"The Very Virile Viking","review":"I loved this book, this book will make you laugh. Things we take for granted and know about, reading the hero's tries at trying to fit into the year of 2000, was comical.Sandra Hill's books are so funny. I love her writing. You will not be disappointed in the book.There was a part in the book, where he went to the pawn shop to sell his coins. His coins was antiques and in mint condition. He thought he had gotten cheated, because the pawn shop owner paid him in a check and cash. He had never seen paper money.And wait till he discovers about birth control.LOL That is FUNNY!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Very Virile Viking","review":"The Very Virile Viking -- a cute title and an intriguing idea -- too bad the book didn't begin to live up to it's potential. The premise of this book, a Viking and his many children who time travel into modern day Hollywood, is such a good idea and could have been a great book but somehow it wasn't carried through to it's potential.Parts of it I loved. I really liked Magnus a lot. Good hero. Angela, not so much. I didn't really find anything to make me like her, endear her to me or even to make me think I really \\"knew\\" her.The kids were fun and interesting and I don't even care much for children in romance novels as a rule. The grandmother and the cook, Juanita and her husband Miquel, were likeable too. The setting was wonderful.However, I found the sex scenes ridiculous, too long and too often. Just too everything! I think the conspiracy by a neighboring vintner to be glossed over and not developed enough. Same with Magnus meeting with his brothers in modern day America and how and why they came to be here.Basically there is so much that could have been done with this book and wasn't. It basically seemed that everything that happened was just another plot device by Sandra Hill to move the story along and nothing happened naturally."},{"Title":"The Very Virile Viking","review":"While this book was a little uneven in the its treatment of some subjects (the vineyard, Magnus and the children were all given a lot of description and attention, but the whole Hollywood angle and how Magnus got out of that situation were glossed over), I really liked it. My favorite part was Magnus' explanation for the word Whatever - that it was what one said when they realized they had lost the argument. I loved the slow revelation in how Magnus is not just some virile stud who impregnated a lot of women, but someone who is truly tender and romantic and believes in family above all else. Now that is a sexy Viking."},{"Title":"The Very Virile Viking","review":"Sandra Hill has given us the story of another great character from her previous books in this series. I love it when an author creates a world which has fun or intriguiging sub-characters the reader becomes emotionally invested in which the author then proceeds to develop by telling their story in their own book. Her Viking series takes us on a fun, romantic, historical and action-flled adventure with a large, extended Viking family from the 10th century and allows us to follow their escapades as they find themselves transported to modern-day America. Hill writes with a sense of humor and the dialog between her characters is amusing, to say the least. I have read all the books in her two Viking series, as well as her Cajun series, and I eagerly look forward to reading all of her future books."},{"Title":"The Very Virile Viking","review":"I enjoyed this book from page one to the end, and laughing all the way...I mean 10th Century Viking discover Wallie World...what a howl!

Disgruntled, but loving father of 11, Magnus sets out with nine of his kids to recover his two brothers who dissapeared years before, but not before taking a public vow of chastity.When Magnus and his kids end up on a modern day film set and meet Angela, who is trying to get the director of the film to use the vineyard as a set, Grandma Rose's prayers are answered.While some of Angela and Magnus's motivations aren't clearly explained, the strengths of the book are the clear definition of each of the kid's personlities, no easy feat, the steamy sex scenes,and the incessant humor. The weakness of the subplot is overshadowed by the scenes in which Magnus personality is delineated by his generosity with his love, and his money. And Angela holds her own, too.This book, which I picked up because of the unusual cover, isn't my normal type of read, and can't stand up to the likes of some of the more popular authors. At times, the dialogue is poorly written (the characters often say ha, ha, ha to indicate they'relaughing),some of the references to modern people and things can grate on the nerves(George Clooney, etc), and the typical\\"time traveler interacts with the modern world scenes\\" are included (fear of riding in cars, fascination with tv, etc.).Despite all that, this is still a humorous and heatwarming read that I would recommend to those who enjoy time travel romances."},{"Title":"The Very Virile Viking","review":"... will be utterly shocked to discover that, in Sandra Hill's linguistic universe at least, Old Norse is quite similar to Modern English!

I barely choked down the first chapter, and continued reading the book simply for the fact that I wanted more things to chuckle about later on.

When the author finishes teaching you the in's and out's of Media Player, he's just warming up. The author then goes on to explain how to set up your computer for music to get the most out of it, how to record from analog sources into your computer, how to use portable digital players (such as I-Pod), ripping CD's and burning them, downloading and purchasing music, listening to the radio via your computer, and finally setting up your own computer-based, home recording studio and using it. whew!!

As a collector of Mexican folk art, I know only too well how difficult it is to find books in English on this subject; McMenamin offers both the serious scholar and the casual collector precious insight into many folk art forms that have almost completely disappeared or are languishing because of the acculturation that inevitably occurs with foreign contact. Popular Arts of Mexico (1850-1950) is a good, basic overview of areas other than traditional dance masks and Los Dias de Los Muertos-related folk art."},{"Title":"Popular Arts of Mexico: 1850-1950","review":"I was first told about Donna McMenamin's book &quot;Popular Arts of Mexico&quot; by a fellow collector of Mexicana who thought I might like it. I remember telling him I had too many other interest to get involved in such a broad field of collecting. At that time I was collecting the most basic of Mexican chotzkie, anything with a &quot;Sleeping Mexican&quot; on it seemed appropriate. Then I saw Donna's book. One word...Wow. I was first just blown away with the pictures, such clear and concise images. And the detail! Sadly, I was hooked. I started taking her book with me on jaunts to the antique mall where I would pick up anything that looked remotely similar. Can you say expensive? Eventually, because of the book, I was able to spot things on my own, which was great, and much cheaper. :-) Donna's book has opened up a whole new world of collecting for me. I had never seen a carved wood panel, known as &quot;bas relief.&quot; When I saw the chapter in her book I just knew I had to own one. They are incredible and have now become a focal point in our collection of TRUE Mexican Popular Arts. OK, I still like sleeping Mexican things, but I'm crazy! :-) It would be difficult for me to say a collectibles book changed my life, I guess it seems so shallow, however, Donna's book gave me a new awareness of things that are amazingly beautiful. I'd say that's a positive life change. Can you say sappy book review? :-)"},{"Title":"Popular Arts of Mexico: 1850-1950","review":"Beautiful pictures, informed text!

The Other Side of the River tells of how warnings of divine retribution were used as threats to keep members in line; how such blatantly false or nonsensical beliefs such as the idea that faithful women never feel pain from childbirth (since pain of childbirth is allegedly the legacy of the Original Sin) were prevalent; questionable worship practices; the author's own search for truth in the words of Jesus Christ and scripture even as he became increasingly disillusioned with the cultlike behavior he saw; and much more. \\"...the true prophets of old and the original New Testament apostles didn't charge at all for the Gospel, but today's prophets, acting more in the know than even Paul or John, make a hefty living drawing in the crowds. As long as they're able to come up with one more hidden key to spiritual prosperity, as long as they can persuade the average believer that he is lacking in some Christian fundamental, today's gospel merchandisers will continue to draw the misinformed with their promises of more. And make them pay through the nose with it.\\" A sober and reflective testimony on the misuse of religious leadership, trust, and authority, highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River","review":"I left these practices years ago and this book hits the nail right on the head.

It is a must read for anyone who is battling with loved ones who have fallen away from the truth and become involved in practices that contradict the Bible. My battle has lasted 5 years now, but I continue to pray that God will remove the scales from their eyes. Very definitve on Word of Faith, Charismatic and \\"spirit-filled\\" deception."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River","review":"This book is a \\"must read\\" for anyone who has come to their senses within an apostate church and wondered what to do and how to do it. The Bible is clear that we are to mark and avoid false teachers (Rom. 16:17) and separate ourselves from those involved in sin (1 Cor. 6:17) while continuing to pray for them. But the issue of rejecting heresy and false prophesy becomes a matter of personal fortitude and deep emotional hurts when it involves close friends who have been brainwashed by \\"the river\\".My testimony is similar to Kevin's in certain ways, though the Lord saved me from deep involvement in the Third Wave. I lost a number of close personal friends when I found myself in the position of either obeying the Lord and His Word or coming to consensus with men. But the Bible does not give Christians an \\"option\\". We are to stand for the truth whenever and wherever it is demanded of us, whether in the world or in the churches. We must stand for unity, but that means we are to put on the unity of the Spirit and strive for unity in the Faith (Eph. 4). When unity of the Faith (unity in the core doctrines as taught by Jesus Christ and the Apostles) is not being upheld and taught, then the individual Christian is duty bound to reject that heresy and seek fellowship elsewhere. The Bible is clear that those who obey the Lord prove they love Him, and conversely those who disobey Him prove they do not love Him (John 14:15, 23, 24). We have many choices each day whether or not to obey the Lord. All of us fall down on this account. But we cannot be reconciled to the Lord without (1) repentance of sin and (2) not allowing ourselves into a situation of habitual, continual sin. Staying in a church that is teaching heresy, participating in false prophecy, and promoting false anointings (which are of another spirit) is putting yourself in a position where you are violating both of the above criteria for staying in the love of Christ. Only Jesus Christ can save because of His perfect substitutional salvation He purchased for us with His blood on the cross. But we must repent of our sins and turn to Him, taking up our cross daily and following Him. You cannot follow the Lord while living in habitual sin, and you will not be saved as long as you remain unrepenant. Remember that many will come saying \\"Lord, Lord\\" in the end but they will go to hell. They are those who think they will be justified by their many works of doing miracles, prophesying, casting out demons, etc. Today we have a whole generation of Christians who are enamored with works, and defend those they follow by constantly referring to them. But the Lord says this:Matt. 7:21-23 \\"Not everyone who says to me, \`Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, \`Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, \`I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'What is the will of the Father? That we obey Jesus Christ. Jesus says we are to reject heretics by marking and avoiding them. The commands of the Lord are simple, but the reality of obedience is not. But we cannot be blessed by the Lord and gain eternal life without obedience."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River","review":"If you have serious questions about what is God, or False folly that is breaking out in curches everywhere since the Toronto manifestations began, this is a book to read. It is an eyeopening account from a man who was in leadership for many years, and who has now bravely discarded 'the lie'. I suspect most christians will identify fully with the encounters he 'tolerated' despite his growing discomfort, due to the 'false' dilemma of loyalty to leaders versus loyalty to the WORD OF GOD."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River","review":"II Timothy 2:15 tells us, \\"Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\\" Much of modern Christianity has strayed from this important truth to their own hurt. Having been in the Charismatic movement for a number of years myself, I can relate to what Keven Reeves has to say about it's numerous excesses. For having the guts to expose the error in his own charismatic congregation, I admire him.I John 4:1 tells us, \\"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.\\" If this was true in the first century of John's day, how much more so are we seeing an abundance of false teachers or prophets dispensing teaching contrary to Scripture today! No longer are we encouraged to test the spirits, but rather exhorted to unreservedly enter into the latest move of God.Just as a person can be addicted to drugs, food, alcohol, spending, etc, they can also be addicted to emotional religion. While at first a little satisfies, just as with any other drug, you need ever increasing doses to get the same high (emotional rush).Having said that I really believe our God is the same yesterday, today and forever. Just as he healed when on earth, he still heals today. The important thing to remember is that when our Messiah did miracles in the gospels, people weren't rolling around on the floor, barking like dogs, writhing like snakes and on and on. In fact the Scriptures tell us that after being set free, a man who had moments before been inhabited by a legion of demons was \\"clothed and in his right mind.\\" (Luke 8:35) It was before Jesus set the man free that the demonic manifestations were taking place. Even if the leadership claims that a weird manifestation is of God, I contend that if what you see looks and acts like a demonic manifestation it undoubtedly is.While much of information in Reeves book is excellent, I have two problems with his presentation. First of all, Even though at times he comes across that way, he does not have the last period on Scriptural truth. None of us do.Also, while much of the Charismatic movement if full with error, we need to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bath water. While there are counterfeit healings, there are also genuine ones. Satan can't create anything. He's the master at counterfeiting God's wonderful works."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River","review":"I found Mr. Reeves' book after I bought \\"Why I Left the Prophetic Movement\\" which was very disappointing! Mr. Reeves shares his struggles with questionable teaching in the charismatic community in a way I found refreshing! He points out how a lot of what is being taught isn't found in the Bible but is based on experience and opinion. Much of what is being taught, especially in groups that adhere to the so called \\"Toronto Blessing\\" is actually heresy and Mr. Reeves' backs up what he's teaching with sound Scriptural teaching that sticks to what the Bible actually teaches and not what someone else may want it to say when it actually doesn't.I also found Kevin Reeves to be a man of godly humility and someone I can trust. He gives us freedom to doubt & question & helps us focus back on the truth of God's Word."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River","review":"A great book by someone who was deceived for many years by the \\"River Movement\\", which also is related to the \\"Word of Faith\\" and \\"Dominion/Kingdom Now\\". These movements are endorsed by people like Benny Hinn, Kenneth Copeland and many other TBN heretics. Other well-known names to watch out for are Jesse Duplantis, John Wimber, and Rodney Howard-Browne. I would honestly like to see the amounts of money being made by any one of these people. It's a shame that Christians do not compare what these people say with the Holy Bible (KJV).So-called holy laughter, shaking, heat sensations, etc are not holy at all. Thank you Mr. Reeves for having the courage to come forth with your story and enduring the chastisement from others and also the embarrassment that comes with acknowledging your errors after searching the Scriptures."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River","review":"This is an eye-opening book because I believe it may describe (though to a more extreme extent than is typical), the experiences of many a young Christian that got sucked into this word-faith / river/ apostolic movement and its wacky beliefs and practices.

I really recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River","review":"'There's no quicker way to start a fight with a friend than to tell him that some of his most fervent beliefs are wrong.' But a true friend will take the risk when it comes to things that matter. And this is what Kevin Reeves attempts in this auto-biographical account of his own charismatic church's move away from 'the primacy of the Word of God into the nebulous, self-defining atmosphere of experience.'He writes as an encouragement to those who have begun to recognize the errors creeping into the hyper-charismatic arm of the Church, and as an eye-opening warning to others. Based on careful research, in-depth Bible study, and his own involvement, he candidly demonstrates the lure, the pitfalls, and the misguided teaching involved in the River Revival movement and other tributary 'moves of God'. His assessment, though pointed, is not bitter, vindictive or mocking, but politely objective, challenging the reader to evaluate everything by the Word of God. His perceptions are especially relevant because he himself was an enthusiastic participant and leader in the practices and teachings he now warns against.Topics considered include: the \\"Word-Faith\\" movement, 'spiritual warfare', modern 'revivals', prophetic 'words', 'holy laughter', being 'slain in the Spirit' and the use of manipulative music in worship, among many others. But beyond cross-examining actual practices and teachings Reeves offers keen insights explaining the strong appeal of these teachings even to well-intentioned, passionate believers. 'River' life is not all it seems to be at the first dip of the big toe. This author has straggled out on the far shore with a wealth of wisdom. I applaud his diligence and courage in presenting his findings for the sake of the Body of Christ. And I commend his book to the reader willing to \\"test all things\\" and \\"hold fast what is good\\" (I Th.5:21) even when it runs contrary to personal experience and cherished beliefs that just may be in error."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River","review":"Thank You, Kevin Reeves for writing this book!!!A MUST READ BOOK if you are searching for truth.

While I would not rate this book a 5-star simply on the basis of the writing, as sometimes I find descriptive language to linger too long, I must give it an overall 5 stars due to its amazing content and intriguing story of a woman who dared to follow her dreams into one of the last wildernesses remaining on Earth. Jean Aspen went where few dare to go, and she did it as a college-aged young woman. The reader is amazed at the matter-of-factness of her descriptions of pushing off of the bank into the mighty Yukon River, alone with a boyfriend and a puppy in an unweildy overladen canoe. Have they packed all the necessities to live a year alone in the Alaskan bush? Will they really be able to find a site and build a cabin before winter? Will they survive despite Aspen's own admission that there odds at making it through the winter are perhaps 50/50? And obviously, though you know they make it somehow, you constantly want to know HOW? What was it like to live through a dark deathly-cold winter on the edge of the Arctic Circle, under the Brooks Range in a cabin built by two with no outside help? What does Alaska's bush really look like? What does it FEEL like to be out there alone? What are they going to eat? How will they stay warm? Don't read ahead!

I gave it to my wife and she also read it in one day. This book takes the reader to a place that many people will never see. The courage and spirit of true adventure in Jean Aspen prevails in this book and it is a shame it is out of print.

The story was that one of the adopted children of the elderly Ms. Congdon killed the poor woman for money. After reading this book, I see how very, very little I really knew--about the murder AND about Marjorie Congdon. As it turns out, being associated with the vicious murder of her own mother is virtually just part of a \\"normal\\" day for Marjorie. I was absolutely floored by her outrageous behavior--all in the name of attention and extreme greed. She literally stopped at nothing to get her way, and if opposed she exacted calculated revenge to very scary degrees. I've loaned my copy of this book to several people and have recommended it to many. In fact, while on a second tour of Glensheen recently, I stood in the gift store and pointed it out to patrons. There are many books about Marjorie, but I doubt any of them is as comprehensive as this one. It's written by the journalist who covered much of Marjorie's court drama and who became well acquainted with the lawyer from whose point of view the story is often told. It's far more than \\"just the facts.\\" It's written like a novel with richly-drawn human characters. (Truly, it seems fictional sometimes, because I've never known anyone who pulled off what Marjorie does.) The book also includes a good selection of photographs and provides an up-to-date account of Marjorie's latest status. In conclusion, you don't need to be from Minnesota or even the Midwest to appreciate this book. It's an American tragedy, quite certainly. And you'll find yourself recommending it often."},{"Title":"Will to Murder, 2nd Edition","review":"I just finished reading Will to Murder and I couldn't put it down until I was done with it.

It addresses nearly all of the basic simulation model designs in enough detail to allow the reader to come away with a good understanding of each of them. It does not focus on simulation and modeling in specific contexts, but rather on the general ideas behind and processes of modeling. On those occasions where more detail would aid in the illustration of concepts, that detail is provided. Lastly, the book addresses subjects such as conceptual modeling and multimodeling that are not usually covered in many other texts - concepts which are only now, some years after the publishing of the book, coming to the forefront of simulation and modeling research. Overall, use of the book should allow the reader to develop a creative, yet disciplined approach to simulation and modeling in its most abstract senses. A few words about another (anonymous, Lake Worth) review: I felt that &quot;Ad Hominem&quot; attacks and gross characterizations did not do the book the justice it deserves. Plus, the author of the review didn't take credit for it - what does that tell you?"},{"Title":"Simulation Model Design and Execution: Building Digital Worlds","review":"This text is well written and easy to follow. The concepts are explained clearly and thoroughly. The text is supported well with excellent diagrams and illustrations that help convey the concepts. The exercises at the end of chapters are challenging, thought provoking, and enhance the learning experience.The organization of the material is excellent. The text provides complete coverage of the subject. The bridging of the theoretical concepts to the application of these concepts to real world problems is excellent. The beginning chapters provide the background knowledge and a solid foundation of the subject to build on. The following chapters cover different simulation model designs. By exploring different ways to think and reason about any system, you will gain an appreciation for alternative approaches for a model design and their ramifications. After completing the text, you will understand simulation methodology as well as how to apply it to solve real world problems.Dr. Fishwick's use of an interdisciplinary approach in explaining concepts with examples provides an open environment for creativity and imagination for applying the knowledge gained. He teaches an object oriented approach which provides a method of looking at any real world system at any level of abstraction for design of a meaningful model. In my opinion, this approach in teaching the subject of simulation is very effective in understanding the material as well as learning how to use theory in a practical and useful way to solve real world problems. He is extremely knowledgeable in all areas of simulation and modeling and has excellent ideas on further advancement of the field. His ideas are sound and well thought out. Myself having a background in industry and now pursuing further education, I am of the opinion that Dr. Fishwick is an expert is the academia arena as well as in the industry arena.The subject is presented in an interesting way that creates a motivating and enthusiastic pursuit of the field of simulation and modeling.

The examples are bad or do not completely illustrate the concept he is trying to show. There are many errors in the book, especially in translating a physical system into a simulation model.

The Book is poorly written and choppy. One has difficulty following the author's trend of thought,( it is doubtful the author has established one). More importantly , however, the Book oversimplifies the theoretical aspects of simulation and presents a completely wastful and inadequate treatment of the subject matter. This book is for people who enjoy drawing pictures and nothing more. Thats all you will be doing. The book fails to treat simulation concepts fully and those concepts that are dealt with are oversimplified and misrepresented. It seems clear tht the author's intent is not to teach simulation, but, rather to give the reader the false impression that somehow thats what the subject matter deals with. To prove my point, refer to 'Simulating Modeling and Analysis' by Law and Kelton and find out how inadequate Fishwick's Book really is."},{"Title":"Simulation Model Design and Execution: Building Digital Worlds","review":"iam a graduate student who used this book in my simulation course. i didn't have a solid background in this subject and i found it very difficult to understand the concepts in the book. i needed a lot of help from my prof. not for beginners is my opinion"},{"Title":"Simulation Model Design and Execution: Building Digital Worlds","review":"[...] The previous review in its own right appears to be asimulation model of the ideal Book that doesn't exist. However, Paul Fishwick's Book is quite inadequate and subpar. Firstly, the Book is outdated, being published in 1995 and excluding many of the recent findings in the field. Secondly, the Book does not teach Simulation Theory. The author either assumes the student already knows simulation or simply wishes to deceive the student into believing thats somehow whats being taught. Fishwick's Book is quite inadequate, outdated, and far from being considered an adequate text on simulation. Fishwick's Book details only one aspect of simulation which is the graphical representation of modeling which is largely regarded a quite insignificant and minor feature of simulation theory."},{"Title":"The Wild Orchids of North America, North of Mexico","review":"When a new field guide appears that is focused on a special group of plants, one anticipates that a lot of information will be presented about the subject of interest.

Range maps and proper illustrations are appropriate as well. This book does a minimal job of all of this. Although the photographs are nice, they are too small to glean all of the necessary details and some look altered by computer effects or printer error. Furthermore, the pen-and-ink drawings are awful, if at least in the sense of being useful for identifying the plants. The information provided in the text with each species is surprisingly limited, not revealing enough on the form, biology and geographic range of these plants. This lack of necessary detail can actually be misleading to the reader in their undrestanding of the species. This lack of detail also makes the book far less interesting than it could have been otherwise. The large taxonomic key in the back of the book is useful, but keys can not provide the user with a good mental image of the physical form of the plants, rather only of a very limited number of features, in contrast to what a proper textual description can provide. Furthermore, this book skips on some other necessary details, such as an incomplete bibliography, not listing all the references cited in the text, for example. The original sources for a book are important avenues for readers to learn more, therefore they should all be properly listed. The point of a field guide is to educate; if enthusiastic readers are unable to find necessary information due to the general lack of attention to detail in many, let alone most aspects of a guide, then that can not leave them confident that they have learned much of anything new, let alone be confident that they can identify the species properly.I had high hopes for this book when I first heard of its printing, but unfortunately I find it to be one of the more disappointing field guides I have seen, for orchids or any subject. It is not a adequate substitute for old, classic orchid guides, such as Donovan Correll's book of similar title (Native Orchids of North America North of Mexico) and Carlyle Luer's book on the same topic (The native orchids of the United States and Canada, excluding Florida), or even books of half of that amount of content. Sadly, these two classic books are out of print and rare. Probably the best approach for the curious native orchidist is to purchase a set of state and regional orchid field guides that are loaded with interesting information, such as those by Case (western Great Lakes), Coleman (Arizona and the SW), Homoya (Indiana), Liggio (Texas), Smith (Minnesota) and others. The substance revealed about the lives of the orchids within these books is more than enough to allow the reader of several of these to put together the pieces of the wonderful puzzle of these very interesting plants. It would be quite useful to have a new book that integrates such information at the necessary and appropriate level for all of the North American orchid species, but &quot;Wild Orchids of North America, North of Mexico&quot; by Brown &amp; Folsom is definitely not that book, although I had hoped that it would be. I am very disappointed and feel that it is not a worthwhile purchase."},{"Title":"The Wild Orchids of North America, North of Mexico","review":"I have been awaiting the publication of this book for several months after I discovered it was forthcoming. If you are looking for a checklist of wild orchids with sharp color pictures then this is for you. For myself it lacked detailed information of the various orchids. This is likely not possible or the book would be too large to easily carry with you into the field. My suggestion is find an orchid book for your region that can concentrate on the local varieties. In my area of the Midwest, I would suggest &quot;Orchids of the Western Great Lakes Region&quot; by Frederick W. Case, Jr. That book is an older book but contains some very useful information."},{"Title":"The Wild Orchids of North America, North of Mexico","review":"The book serves as good checklist for the North American species.

THE LEGEND OF THUNDER MOON is the first in Brand's series of stories about a white boy adopted by Native Americans who becomes part of their culture and then faces the pressure of being caught between the settlers and his adopted family. At the time this was published, in 1927, this was daring and unusual material. Brand's sympathetic but not pandering treatement of the Cheyenne still holds up well today.This first book focuses on Thunder Moon's growth and his life with the tribe, and his fight against his fear of undergoing the painful Sun-Ceremony while he tries to prove his worth at a warrior. He comes into contact with whites for the first time, but the book is mainly about his life with the Cheyenne. Brand shows remarkable knowledge of plains Indian life and delves deeply into it. This is one of the books most enjoyable aspects, and again, was unusual at the time. But, as usual for a Brand book, there is plenty of action and excitment.This volume also contains an insightful introduction by Edgar L. Chapman that looks at Brand's attachment to the Native American way of life and gives an overview of the sometimes complicated publishing history of the Thunder Moon saga.If you wish to follow more of Thunder Moon's adventures, the story continues in RED WIND AND THUNDER MOON."},{"Title":"Phenotypic Evolution: A Reaction Norm Perspective","review":"This book introduced me to 'reaction norms' and 'phenotypic plasticity.' Believe me, these are critical notions for any discussion of evolution. Phenotypic plasticity is the notion that different environments produce different phenotypic expressions despite identical genetic material. The book discusses a variety of cases pulled from the animal and plant kingdom. For example, many plant have develop into different 'forms' depending upon the altitude of their environment. In the animal kingdom, twin spiders will build different types of webs depending upon their environment. The 'reaction norm' represents the 'normal' phenotypic response to the environment, something we often mistake as being the genetic 'design.'The book covers the somewhat daunting topics of allometry, ontogeny and epigentics, but does so in a very readable way. The books is accessible to the interested scientific reader regardless of background. Additionally, the book includes brief historical outlines of major lines of evolutionary thought. These provide an alternative avenue for accessing the theory when the terminology gets difficult.In short, its the best reference on evolutionary theory I've found."},{"Title":"Mac OS X Little Black Book: A Complete Guide to Migrating and Setting Up Mac OS X","review":"A computer book should, first and foremost, allow one to quickly and concisely reference something.

Read it &amp; enjoy."},{"Title":"\\"Anna, where are you?\\" (A Miss Silver mystery)","review":"Thomasina Eliot, an old school friend, is virtually the only human contact Anna Ball has; Anna is nosy, and rather abrasive.After receiving some of Anna's things for storage while she changed jobs (no forwarding address until Anna knew if it would work out), Thomasina is getting worried after the silence stretches to a few months. She feels responsible, since there's no one else to look out for Anna or care, and engages Miss Silver to trace her and find out if she's all right.Miss Silver, through ingenuity and some social connections that the police didn't have, manages to extract some useful information from Miss Ball's last (hypocondriac) employer and her household, and with the help of Inspector Abbot, traces Anna to her last known address: a 'mother's help' at Deepe House, Deep End, Ledshire. Over Abbot's protests (Anna's predescessor drowned, Anna is missing) Miss Silver steps back into governess mode and goes undercover, taking the job at Deepe House. (The Craddocks, or really, Mr. Craddock, have tried to rename it Harmony, while establishing an arts/crafts colony, but the new name really didn't take.)Reading the Miss Silver series, you might get a false impression that they're all similar; far from it. Each book does have at least one set of lovers who are in difficulties of some kind, and who revere her afterwards as a guardian angel (one view of her sitting room in this book stresses all the Victorian-framed photos of young couples and their children). They're generally similar enough in flavor that if you like one, you'll like them all; nice cozy English mysteries.Seeing Miss Silver in the Craddock household is satisfying. Mr. Craddock, the stepfather, is a pompous fool full of high-flown theories about the right to do exactly what you want, and applying it to the kids (unless they get in the way). The kids actually behave like normal kids running wild, with a mother whose health is breaking down under stress, instead of being written as midget adults. Oh, and if you don't have a sense of humor about health food and 'tea' that tastes like hay, you may be offended by this book."},{"Title":"\\"Anna, where are you?\\" (A Miss Silver mystery)","review":"I was having trouble finding this book, but I finally did, so that is why I read it out of sequence. I had finished the Miss Silver series some weeks ago. This book was written in 1951, so sometime near the last third of Miss Silver's long writing career, but it is by far the best in the series. In it we have all kinds of good things. The best part of the book is that we see our indomitable Miss Silver returning to her former profession as governess. She does this in order to get herself inside a household where strange things have been hanppening, and the latest in these strange things was the disappearenace of a young woman who had been employed in the position that Miss Silver assumes. This is a lively story with lots of eccentric characters, ss well as bank robberies, fraud and murder. This is a fine example of an English cozy, and I'm glad that I finally found the book."},{"Title":"\\"Anna, where are you?\\" (A Miss Silver mystery)","review":"When twenty something Anna Ball goes missing, no one seems to care, after all, by all accounts Anna is a rather unpleasant young woman. She does have one friend, however, Thomasina Elliot, who does care, and she makes it her business to find out why, after many years of exchanging letters, she has not heard from Anna since she ostensibly left her post as governess in a house in Lincolnshire.So, Miss Elliot retains the services of Miss Maud Silver, a retired governess turned private enquiry agent. This time Miss Silver goes undercover, assuming the position of governess left vacant by the missing Anna. It turns out that the owner of the house is the leader of a colony of artists and odd balls, all living either in the house or on set portions of the estate. As always, Miss Silver manages to discover snippets of information that, at first blush, appear to be inconsequential but which ultimately prove to be of value.While this is an entertaining enough mystery, I confess that I found some of the characters to be somewhat irritating. Still, I was drawn in, wanting to discover just what had happened to Anna. In this, I was not disappointed. Fans of the Miss Silver series of mysteries will find much to enjoy in this book, as will those who are fans of the English country house mystery."},{"Title":"\\"Anna, where are you?\\" (A Miss Silver mystery)","review":"I love Miss Silver. She sees through the wicked and the good with equal acumen, helps the helpless, and gets her knitting done.A young girl who is looking for a lost friend, and an artists' colony that may or may not be what it seems make a fine place to display a set of characters. I especially like the talkative weavers.In this book, we get to see Miss Silver, the former governess, acting as--a governess!"},{"Title":"\\"Anna, where are you?\\" (A Miss Silver mystery)","review":"The 20th book in a 32-book series of cozy mysteries is so over-the-top that it strikes me as almost a spoof of itself. Yet it's one of the more thrilling novels and has some vivid suspense. The basic setup is the same as in many of the books: a rambling country house, a bunch of residents, a quarrelsome pair of young people who are obviously destined for each other, and Miss Silver, a retired governess who has spent a couple of decades as a private enquiry agent, armed with knitting needles and a sharp brain. Written in 1951, it relies upon dialogue to carry the story, since there is no technology to speak of. The suspense is well done, considering that the author avoids graphic violence, strong language and explicit sex. There are a few new twists in this entry, the main one being Miss Silver going undercover - as herself! Yes, the former governess takes a position as a governess. Unfortunately, the book is too short to give more than a glimpse of her in the role. What we do see is charming, and I almost wish some of the mystery had been pared back in favor of this subplot. There are three children on hand, out of control, and possibly in peril. And there are more over-the-top, exaggerated characters than in most of the stories, from a one-named psychic in voluminous capes to a fortune-hunting man with delusions of grandeur to the eponymous anti-heroine. Anna isn't on scene for most of the book, and no one misses her except a single faithful friend, who goes to the expense of hiring Miss Silver to find her. Toss in a few types of crime, seemingly unrelated, and people who are into folk dance, weaving, embroidery, health food...if the book wasn't genuinely scary at times, I'd regard it as comic. I'm not giving it 5 stars because the strange characters were too much for me, but it is certainly a fun read."},{"Title":"\\"Anna, where are you?\\" (A Miss Silver mystery)","review":"Anna has stopped writing to Thomasina out of the blue and Thomasina is worried. She has inherited some money and having met Frank Abbot socially gets to hear about Miss Silver. She contacts her and explains what she knows about Anna. Her last known employment was as a mother's help with the Craddocks in a village called Deep End. Fortunately the Craddocks are currently looking for someone to fill the same position and Miss Silver decides to apply for the job to see if she can find out any more about what happened to Anna.Miss Silver finds herself in an eccentric household and living in a bomb damaged big property called Deepe House. Mrs Craddock is a frail lady married to Peverill Craddock a larger than life character who tells her what to do and what to think and uses her as a skivvy while letting her three children run wild unless they interfere in his own pursuits. Miss Silver soon manages to get the children under control and meets Frank Abbot to update him on her progress - nearly becoming involved in a bank robbery in the process.This is a complicated plot with some interesting characters and one of the most dangerous cases which Miss Silver gets embroiled in. It is far from clear to the reader what has happened to Anna until very close to the end of the story and any connection to the bank robbery seems obscure. This is an out of the ordinary crime story and one which I found most enjoyable as it shows Miss Silver at her unobtrusive best. Peverill Craddock is a marvellously pompous and bombastic character and I liked the two maiden ladies who are his devoted admirers. The book is as ever well written with some interesting observations on human nature and some excellent plotting."},{"Title":"\\"Anna, where are you?\\" (A Miss Silver mystery)","review":"The mystery about Anna is that nobody seems to regret that she has disappeared. Yet there has to be somebody who is concerned, and concerned enough to persuade Miss Silver to assist in finding her. Thomasina is the concerned young woman, and Miss silver is so willing to help that she rolls up her sleeves and installs herself in a household as a childrens' governess - an occupation she abandoned twenty years earlier.Half the book details the collection of clues and suspects, and then, when a local bank manager is shot during a robbery, suspense and danger are introduced.Miss Wentworth, the most readable of authors, provides lovely narrative touches in the first half of the novel. As the end approaches, the requirements of a thriller finish take over.Provided you don't apply too much analysis to plot and character motivation, you will enjoy this nice cosy entertainment."},{"Title":"\\"Anna, where are you?\\" (A Miss Silver mystery)","review":"This is NOT another book in the series - this is a REPEAT of \\"Death at Deep End\\" number 20.

He studies the methodology and content of the documents of Catholic social teaching, generally understood as comprising twelve papal letters beginning with Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical Rerum novarum, two documents from Vatican II, and two pastoral letters of the United States bishops. He contends that the fundamental basis for this body of teaching comes from an anthropological perspective that recognizes both the inherent dignity and the social nature of the human person--thus do the church's teachings on political and economic matters chart a middle course between the two extremes of individualism and collectivism. The documents themselves tend to downplay any discontinuities with previous documents, but the author's systematic analysis reveals the significant historical developments that have occurred over the course of more than a century. Although greatly appreciative of the many strengths of this teaching, he also points out the weaknesses and continuing tensions in Catholic social teaching today. Intended for scholars and students of Catholic social ethics, as well as those involved in Catholic social ministry, this volume will also appeal to non-Catholic readers interested in an understanding and evaluation of Catholic social teaching."},{"Title":"Buying, Driving, and Enjoying the Porsche 356 (Ownership Series)","review":"Having actively followed Mr. Schrager's excellent column in Sports Car Market, I was excited to find he had written this &quot;how-to&quot; book.

Schrager will take you on an interesting and highly readable journey during which you'll learn a little about a lot: history, nomenclature, opportunities, and pitfalls in searching for the car that's right for you. Only in terms of the prices is Schrager as out-of-date as a narrow necktie.

Love, Susan Manchester"},{"Title":"The Life of Jane Austen","review":"There are many biographies of Jane Austen available, but I urge readers to include this one. One of the most noteworthy features of Halperin's work is that he does not feel the need to idealize Jane Austen. He therefore enriches his book with information carefully ignored by other biographers.Austen accomplished the very rare feat of writing books that remain both commercial and popular successes after almost two centuries. I don't see what else she needs to do to be worthy of our attention, and I am exasperated by futile arguments trying to deny her position as a woman of her class and time. I am tired of her biographers \\"apologizing\\" or trying to explain away he failure to make direct comments on contemporary politics - her books are probably all the more universal and enduring because she didn't. Rather than making feeble attempts to tie the Elliot's financial misfortunes to general economic trends (instead of their own fecklessness, which is what I believe Austen intended), Halperin quotes very effectively from Austen's letters to show that she was aware of the political and social life around her.Halperin also portrays her as a much less pleasant person that most authors care to see. His Jane is shown in her letters to be often petty and gratuitously mean, heartlessly witty. The question, which Halperin doesn't really explore, but which might explain some of the discrepancy between the Austens' recollections is, how different was her public persona from her letters to Cassandra? Were the letters an outlet that helped enable her to be pleasant and civil? I am personally think that sincerity and frankness can be much over-rated vis a vis civility and consideration, so I wouldn't fault JA as a hypocrite, if this is true.Halperin also presents her as decidely less fond of children, or at least young children, than other works. He is ignoring some of the writings about her that are quoted by other authors, but his point of view is well-supported by quotations from her letters. Particularly in combinations with other writers, the reader is left with a much more complex and nuanced view of Jane.Overall, the book is well written and readable, and unlike some other biographies I could mention, does not go haring off on tangential subjects. Halperin also restrains himself from \\"overinterpreting\\" his material, attempting posthumous psychoanalysis and the like.I am not terribly fond of mixing too much literary analysis with biography, and I disagree with some of Halperin's analysis, but I thought that his review of Mansfield Park with reference to JA's life was very fine and plausible.I fault this, and all other JA biographies for their treatment of Cassandra Leigh Austen's (Mrs. George Austen's) \\"hypochondria\\". I have been told in every biography that she was a hypochondriac, but no-one has made a convincing case for it. The glimpses that one gets of her seem to be of a steady, cheerful, practical woman, not the most likely candidate for hypochondria, although it doesn't rule it out. I am also quite aware that in previous decades, doctors were much more likely to attribute illnesses, particularly in women, to psychosomatic causes, so I would urge modern biographers to re-examine the evidence. The most common quote is Jane's statement that she has little sympathy for a head cold unaccompanied by a fever or sore throat, but I think that may say more about the daughter than the mother. At 52, from my own experience, that of my friends and our parents, I am very aware that there are any number of bodily ills, all the more likely as we reach and pass middle-age, that are not apparent to outside observers, crippling or rapidly fatal, which none the less can cause the sufferer considerable discomfort and inconvenience while draining humor, patience, energy and enthusiasm. Just to name a few: chronic fatique syndrome, arthritis, pruritis, irritable bowel syndrome, incontinence, hemmoroids, insomnia, digestive problems, etc. Mrs. Austen would, in addition, be vulnerable to the ills that result from many closely-spaced pregnanacies, including such joys a varicose veins, joint injuries and a variety of gynecological problems. I would not ordinally fault Halperin individually, but he does carry it to new depths, finding it unreasonable, perhaps even neurotic, for the 72-year old woman to decide that she was giving up travelling in the slow, jolting, dusty conditions that prevailed at the time.Despite this last grumble, this is one of my favorites among the seven or so biographies that I have read, and the best of the long biographies. For those wanting shorter works, I recommend Carol Shields'Jane Austen (Penguin Lives)and Valerie Grosvenor Myer'sJane Austen, Obstinate Heart: A Biography."},{"Title":"The Life of Jane Austen","review":"Halperin really did his homework and debunks myths that Austen was all smiles and sweetness. Don't get me wrong, by no means does he speak badly of the author. He just portrays her as a human being with emotions, sarcasim and wit who had a not-so-perfect life or career.In his intro he states that the author of such books as Sense and Sensibility could not have been all manners and niceness. Anyone who reads her books has to feel the same. Halperin suggests there is a little bit of autobiography in Austen's works and documents his opinions with letters from Jane to her sister.Great read!"},{"Title":"The Life of Jane Austen","review":"What in Jane Austen made her capable of writing novels that have given such enjoyment and enlightenment that they have been read again and again to personal profit for generation after generation over two centuries? Any biographer able to answer that question will have done literature and Austen's readers a major service. Alas, Professor Halperin has not found the key.Not only has he not found the key, Halperin in writing a biography of one of the great satirists in the English language starts with a dour view of satire and satirists.\\"What distinguishes [literary satire and social comedy], perhaps, is an element of ridicule of mockery, of contempt even, which emphasises the faults and vices of others. There is a lot of hostility in satire. To write in the satirical vein demands a certain detachment, a moral distancing from the object of criticism. It demands a cold-blooded assessment of aesthetic and moral values.\\" (p. 36, ch. 3, pt. I)With an attitude like this Prof. Halperin was not the best person to write a biography of one of the great satirists in English literature.Halperin's view of satire results in a peppering of his text with descriptions of Jane Austen as mean, malicious, scathing, arch, prickly, unforgiving, cold-blooded, waspish, petty, snappish, impatient, irritable, vindictive, ungenerous, censorious, heartless, nasty, sour, tasteless, snarling, etc.Therein lies a problem. Halperin admits that the Jane Austen of the letters is the same Jane Austen who wrote the novels. (p. 60, ch. 4, pt. I) How could a woman of such character write novels which have been comedy and fiction favorites for two centuries of readers who find the novels entertaining, enlightening, humorous, brilliant and even fun? It's a problem Halperin cannot resolve.Halperin gives the novels a leeway which he doesn't give Austen's letters. He calls the novels \\"black comedy\\" but not nasty, tasteless or snarling. After all, who would believe any biographer who said they were?Halperin's inability to explain Jane Austen's comedy genius comes out in his dull reading of many of the letters. Too often he sees harshness instead of comedy. An example is when Halperin asserts that for Jane Austen\\"[e]ven parties are described with scathing sarcasm. Guests who come to one are 'permitted to . . . take their share of the heat and inconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add.'\\" (p. 85, ch. 4, pt. III)That's not scathing. It's humorous and insightful, as anyone knows who thinks about the heat a body emits and nevertheless goes into a hot, crowded room.Perhaps Halprin's most jaw dropping failure to catch the humor in Jane's letters is shown in his description of her letter to Cassandra of January 8, 1799. Halperin thinks it expresses \\"moodiness--the writer is alternately sunny and snarling\\". Thus, the wit of \\"You express so little anxiety about my being murdered [on the way] that I have a great mind not to tell you whether I was or not\\" is explained as Jane's testiness at \\"not been sufficiently inquired after by Cassandra\\" about Jane's visit with friends. (p. 96, ch. 4, pt. V) This despite the fact that Austen's humor is written in letters a foot high (like Twain's famous \\"The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.\\"). One wonders at Halperin's basic ability to catch an Austen joke.And Halperin completely misses Austen's propensity to satirize and laugh at herself.\\"In Cassandra's absence a good deal of the housekeeping duties have fallen to her: 'I am a very good housekeeper . . . I really think it my peculiar excellence, and for this reason--I always take care to provide such things as please my own appetite, which I consider as the chief merit in housekeeping.'\\" (p. 80, ch.4, pt. III)Halperin sees this only as a comment on the fact that Jane Austen had extra housekeeping duties in Cassandra's absence. He doesn't see the fun in parodying good housekeeping as arranging things for Austen's own pleasure. This is the sort of satiric description which Jane Austen often used to draw her marvelous literary characters.Halperin's penchant to see ill-humored testiness in Austen results at times in opposite takes on the same subject matter in order to fit his thesis. On one page Halperin indicates that Cassandra is a better correspondent than Jane:\\"On Cassandra as a correspondent: 'You are very amiable & very clever to write such long letters; every page of yours has more lines than this, & every line more words than the average of mine. I am quite ashamed--but you have certainly more little events than we have.'\\" (pp. 161-162, ch. 6, pt. II)Halperin puts this down to \\"competitiveness\\" and \\"[s]ibling rivalry\\" rather than good grace in Jane's praise of Cassandra's letter writing. Yet, on the next page Halperin has no problem asserting that \\"apparently Cassandra was a less willing and enthusiastic correspondent than Jane\\". Well, which is it? Was Cassandra more enthusiastic or dragging her feet in correspondence?Because Halperin is concentrating on competitiveness and sibling rivalry instead of wit he sees \\"a sour note\\" in Jane's comment on the rigors of writing and the joy of receiving long letters.\\"'I assure you I am as tired of writing long letters as you can be. What a pity that one should still be so fond of receiving them.'\\" (p. 163, ch. 6 pt. II)Halperin asserts throughout the book that Austen was not fond of children. But after learning that her nephews who had just lost their mother would be sent to her older brother's house, Austen writes:\\"[P]erhaps it is best for them, as they will have more means of exercise & amusement there than they cd have with us, but I own myself disappointed by the arrangement;--I should have loved to have them with me at such a time.\\"In light of this Halperin does not rethink his thesis that Austen didn't care for children, but instead asserts on nothing else but the words quoted above that Austen's desire for the boys was due to jealousy of her sister-in-law to whose house they were going. Halperin:\\"Once again Mary Lloyd Austen at Steventon had taken something that Jane felt as a matter of principle belonged to her--in this case custody of her nephews.\\" (p. 166, ch. 6, pt. II)A page later Jane's jealousy of Mary Lloyd Austen is supposedly assuaged when the sister-in-law writes to ask if Jane and her mother would like the then boys staying with Mary be sent to them.\\"'[W]e decided on them remaining where they were,' Jane says. Undoubtedly Edward \`will do us the justice of believing that in such a decision we sacrificed inclination to what we thought best . . . The poor boys are, perhaps, more comfortable at Steventon than they could be here, but you will understand my feelings with respect to it.'\\" (p. 166)Not doing the \\"justice\\" Jane hopes from her brother Edward, Halperin again pushes Jane's coldness and hard-heartedness to children.\\"The reference to her (italicised) 'feelings' is a bit cloudy; perhaps she and her mother disagreed yet again--this time on the question of the boys' visit. However, the plain fact is that, all her protestations of concern to the contrary, the novelist did not volunteer to care for any of Edward's children during this crisis period of their lives (and in later years she gave Godmersham a very wide berth indeed). . . . It is clear that the novelist did not especially like children, and certainly she did not like to be near them; grieving, sniffling, children were perhaps a particularly appalling prospect. In principle, in theory, she was all kindness; in practice, something less.\\" (pp. 167-168, ch. 6, pt. II)But, as Halperin is forced to admit on the following page, Jane was kind in practice. Two of the boys ages 13 and 14 did stay five days with Jane and her mother within days after this letter, and Austen praised the boys to Cassandra. More than that Jane spent quality time with them lifting their spirits. Halperin records that Jane was attentive to and played with the boys \\"bilbocatch, spillikins [jackstraws], paper ships, riddles, conundrums, and cards\\" and took walks with them. Still Halperin can't give Jane Austen credit. He ends this episode with his jealousy-conflict theory,\\"'Mrs. J. A.' [Mary Lloyd Austen] has written a pleasant letter about them, 'which was more than I hoped'; obviously the novelist could not see her sister-in-law coping as well with two adolescent boys as she herself was doing.\\" (pp. 168-169, ch. 6, pt. II)In this biography Austen too often is damned if she does and damned if she doesn't.For those who know Jane Austen and her writings well enough to fill in their own understanding of the fun and love of life expressed in her writing this can be a helpful book. Halperin goes meticulously through the letters and sets down a very good time line. But, unfortunately, he fails with the central issue of understanding Jane Austen and connecting the woman with the beauty and insight of her brilliant writing and satire."},{"Title":"The Life of Jane Austen","review":"Our book group decided to read all of Jane Austen's novels and someone recommended this biography.

This is not a biography, but a ludicrous attempt by Mr Halperin to psychoanalyze Ms Austen by means of extracting snipets and fragments from her novels and letters in order to show her in the worst possible light. It is evident that Mr Halperin is no lover of women in general, and has a vitriolic dislike of Ms Austen in specific. I envision Mr Halperin spending a tireless eternity rummaging through Ms Austen's \\"garbage bins\\" in order to support his biased and, at times, grossly inaccurate interpretations and suppositions regarding her nature. He is determined that we should know she was not a \\"nice\\" person. Is this scholarship? I think not. More likely the spiteful gossiping of a sour old women.We need only to read her novels to know that she possessed a biting, sometimes cruel wit, that she did not suffer fools gladly, and was somewhat embittered by her domestic circumstances - a young woman of no fortune with little prospect of making a \\"good\\" marriage. However, in the final analysis, do we really care if she was \\"Mary Sunshine\\" or the \\"Wicked Witch of the East\\"? Is it not her genius, and the quality of her novels that should be the matters of consequence.Mr Halperin's unrelenting ferriting for documentation to support his charges of Ms Austen's unkind/unpleasant personality traits makes for an uninteresting and tacky read.

His treatment of RMI seems to be thrown in to fill pages. No mention of a JDBC/RMI bridge for example. The SQL used in the book is basic with no coverage of more advanced features. The database browser, the final showcase of the book, uses a outdated version of JFC (0.4) and won't work with JFC 0.7 or later. This is perhaps inevitable with the rapid changes coming from Javasoft but the author works at Sun and given the publication date I had expected more up to date coverage.If you are looking for a good introduction/reference to the JDBC API I'd recommend 'JDBC Database Access with Java' from Addison Wesley.

They prowl the obscure corners of human behavior, seeking to drag something back out to the light. But sometimes, the path only leads them deeper, darker.Dr. Ricardo Ainslie -- both an author and a psychologist -- has been chasing shadows along Huff Creek Road in Jasper, where James Byrd Jr. was dragged to death in one of the past century's grisliest hate crimes. And each step has taken him deeper into the darkest recesses of a decayed mind.Countless articles, books and films have documented how King and two white friends -- fellow ex-con Russell Brewer and Shawn Berry -- offered the drunken Byrd a ride in the wee hours of June 7, 1998. But they didn't take him home. Instead, they chained him by the ankles to the rear bumper of Berry's truck and literally dragged him to pieces on a hard-pan logging road. They purposely left his dismembered corpse in the front yard of a small African-American church and cemetery.And King -- whose body was almost completely swathed in racist and Satanic tattoos, whose apartment concealed a stash of racist literature and clothing splattered by Byrd's blood, and whose distinctive cigarette lighter was found at the scene -- was the first of the three to stand trial. Widely seen as the ringleader of the butchery, he was convicted and sentenced to die. Unrepentant and his appeals all but exhausted, the 29-year-old King now awaits execution.But those trials didn't answer a central question: What made Bill King a monster?Partly at the request of King's father, the 55-year-old University of Texas psychology professor was drawn deep into the sometime savage, sometimes frighteningly ordinary world of a small-town killer.\\"Bill King, the man, is much more human than we would care to think,\\" Ainslie writes. \\"When the global media descended ... in a relentless hunt for sensational material, they constructed a perhaps comforting, but ultimately obscuring, myth about King's monstrous nature. ... The truth is that King is all too close, in kind and in temperament, to me or to you.\\"In King, we see a dim and distant reflection of ourselves, Ainslie suggests. Author Hannah Arendt coined the phrase \\"banality of evil\\" to portray the Nazis who perpetrated the Holocaust, and Ainslie invokes it for other acts of evil.\\"To attempt to understand the motives at work in Bill King's life, to understand that there were reasons for his behavior, is not to exonerate him,\\" Ainslie explains. \\"If we avoid examining King's life for fear that such an effort might appear to excuse him, then we risk missing precisely what we most need to know about this story.\\"One of the most unsettling elements of the 254-page \\"Long Dark Road\\" is its hypothesis that \\"given the right alchemy, perhaps anyone might become capable of monstrous cruelty.\\"\\"The transgressions involved may not be as momentously horrifying as the dragging death of an innocent man,\\" Ainslie says, \\"but I believe that human beings, by nature and perhaps by wiring, struggle with our dark sides. This is one of the key premises of Christianity.\\""},{"Title":"Long Dark Road: Bill King and Murder in Jasper, Texas","review":"I have to admit that the only reason I initially read this book was my curiosity at how the town of Jasper and the events which took place in said town would be portrayed. Jasper is my hometown, and I was 12 years old during that dreadful summer of 1998.Ultimately, when I found out that a professor at the very university I attend current day had written a book about my hometown and Bill King, I wanted to see if he, like nearly all others who had written or spoken of the topic, had made my town and fellow townspeople out to be some sort of ignorant, backwoods armpit in East Texas. Almost immediately, my attentions were diverted elsewhere...Ainslie does a terrific job of showing that this crime could have happened to any person in any town...ANYWHERE in the world.Although I may or may not agree with his diagnosis of Bill King, since I did not know him personally, I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book, if enjoyed is even an appropriate word. Coming from the mouth of a Jasper resident who has to deal with the horrid looks and comments from people who learn where she is from...that's saying a lot. This topic is quite sensitive to me, and that degree of sensitivity has not lessened in any way since July 1998. If any changes have happened, it's only gotten stronger.I strongly suggest reading this book for a better and less bias view of Jasper and James Byrd, Jr's murder."},{"Title":"Long Dark Road: Bill King and Murder in Jasper, Texas","review":"I thought the author did an outstanding job of writng about the humanity of a person who did what we call a \\"inhunman\\" crime. It is all the more chilling that these acts were not done by some sort of monster, but a person, who is to some extent a result of his environment. The best part of the book, however is the description of the community of jasper and the very real people who tried to do the right thing in the midst of lots of media hype."},{"Title":"Long Dark Road: Bill King and Murder in Jasper, Texas","review":"I enjoyed the first 200 pages of this book - the background, police investigation and trial. Ainslie then descends into psycho-babble, introspection and even admits to thinking that King could be innocent, such is the apparent power of this man over others. No matter how much Ainslie tries to muddy the waters, King was judged to be guilty of a cold blooded, callous crime. For Ainslie to imply at the end of the book that we are all not far removed from behaving like that is ridiculous. He even assigns part of the blame to Christianity!"},{"Title":"Long Dark Road: Bill King and Murder in Jasper, Texas","review":"Book was in excellent condition. It arrived on time and was just what I was expecting."},{"Title":"Long Dark Road: Bill King and Murder in Jasper, Texas","review":"I was so looking forward to reading this book, LONG DARK ROAD,(Austin: University of Texas Press, 2004) when I purchased it. I was very disappointed after the first two chapters. The 44 pages of the second chapter read almost word for word like a rehash of what Joyce King wrote with freshness and eloquence in her book, HATE CRIME, which was first published by Random House in 2002 and then by Anchor Books in 2003. On several pages, it looks like Ainslie simply rearranged some of Joyce King's wording. So I found myself desperately looking for originality in Ainslie's text, because he never acknowledges Joyce King's all-too obvious influence on his writing. Ainslie introduces some interesting psychoanalytic theories re: King in the middle of the book, including some, but not entirely new info on family history. Missing, however, is attention to the fact that most prisoners suffer from some form of mental illness, are usually poor, often come from dysfunctional families and have fallen through the cracks of the mental health care system in this country. Clear recommendations for early mental health care intervention for juvenile delinquents would have made Ainslie's efforts here more compelling and plausible. It is not clear why Ainslie interviewed King at all without clear recommendations in place for what could have been done to prevent Bill King's violent, criminal behavior. Instead of researching the failures of a system that places mentally ill juvenile delinquents in penal institutions with violent offenders, Ainslie focusses on the point that Joyce King already made clear in HATE CRIME--that there is a need for prison reform. We already read that in HATE CRIME. Moreover, Ainslie does not offer any comparative analysis of Bill King with other poor, bi-polar, traumatized young men or women who are housed in U.S. prisons or on death row. It is not at all clear where Bill King, then, stands in the broader analysis of the type of psychological study Ainslie is engaged in. The reader learns little that is new here. Moreover, they learn nothing new about Bill King's psychological condition that can not already be easily gleaned from news reports on the case, Joyce King's HATE CRIME, or other previously published materials on the dragging of James Byrd, Jr. I found this book lacking in depth and breadth of analysis."},{"Title":"Christian Fatherhood: The Eight Commitments of St. Joseph's Covenant Keepers","review":"FACT: Four out of ten American children will go to bed tonight in a home without their fathers (Blankenhorn, David, Fatherless America, 1995).FACT: About 90 percent of single-parent homes are without a father. (U.S. Bureau of the Census, &quot;Poverty in the U.S.: 1992&quot;)FACT: Seventy percent of long-term prison inmates come from homes where the father wasn't present. (&quot;Family Values Gain Control,&quot; The Wall Street Journal, December 12, 1995, p. A6)So go the statistics...Drawing from the Bible and works such as Pope Pius XI's, Christian Marriage (Casti Connubii), Pope Paul VI's, Of Human Life (Humanae Vitae), and John Paul II's, The Role of the Christian Family in the Modern World (Familiaris Consortio) and Letter to Families, former Protestant minister turned Catholic, Steve Wood, offers 8 practical commitments that fathers can make to ensure they will leave a positive, lasting mark on their children and their children's children.Wood takes the &quot;Eight Commitments of the St. Joseph Covenant Keepers&quot; and goes into much greater depth on them than he has in his audiotapes or brochures. Those commitments include: - Affirming Christ's Lordship Over Our Families - Following St. Joseph, the Loving Leader and Head of the Holy Family - Loving Our Wives All Our Lives - Turning Our Heart Toward Our Children - Educating Our Children in the Discipline and Instruction of the Lord - Protecting Our Families - Providing for Our Families - Building Our Marriages and Families on the &quot;Rock&quot;Wood effectively uses Scripture, secular statistics, and papal encyclicals to provide practical things that fathers can do to build solid marriages and secure families. The book shows how desperately fathers are needed in a world which seems to say that they are not.Any father wondering how he can raise a faithful family needs to own a copy of this book."},{"Title":"Christian Fatherhood: The Eight Commitments of St. Joseph's Covenant Keepers","review":"Steve Wood's, &quot;Christian Fatherhood&quot; has had a continuing and growing influence on me. Having been married fourteen years, my wife and I have had our share of challenges. The wisdom and charity within this book has helped me be a more loving husband, a better father and has given me the confidence to teach my faith to my children."},{"Title":"Christian Fatherhood: The Eight Commitments of St. Joseph's Covenant Keepers","review":"Steve Wood and James Burnham have hit the nail on the head. They have identified the critical areas where fathers become either successes or failures. If you're a young father and want to know how to be a great father - this is the book for you. If you're an old father - and want validation for what you did right and identification for where you went wrong - this is the book for you.The critical areas they deal with involve devotion to God, to Church, and to family. They show how to love and be faithful to your wife. They show how to love your children, and it's spelled T-I-M-E. They show the necessity of rightly ordering family life so that it aims at more than this family's life.Having observed both Mr. Wood and Mr. Burnham's families, I can say that they practice what they preach and their children (while giving the struggles to their parents that is ordinary) are happy, healthy, and holy. The happiness of their wives and the marvels that are their childrens are astoundingly powerful testimonies of the truth they speak in this book."},{"Title":"Christian Fatherhood: The Eight Commitments of St. Joseph's Covenant Keepers","review":"This is an outstanding book aimed at fathers like me that are Catholic and have embraced their faith but haven't fully realized the consequences if we neglect to pass our faith on to our children. One cannot read this book and not realize there is no greater obligation we have than to pass on our Catholic faith to our children. What could possibly be more urgent? Several times while reading this book I got that uncomfortable &quot;hot under the collar&quot; feeling because Mr. Wood is so effective at making one realize the things we are NOT doing as parents, and I'm a good parent!! I know Jim Burnham from when I used to live in New Mexico and he is a tremendous person and teaches Apologetics wonderfully. The lady who expressed concerns over Mr. Wood's thoughts on mutual subjection I think has either misunderstood the author's intent or focused on one thing that shouldn't lessen the message this book sends. I truly wish every father would read this book - there isn't time to lose."},{"Title":"Christian Fatherhood: The Eight Commitments of St. Joseph's Covenant Keepers","review":"This book is an excellent resource for fathers. The book describes how to follow St. Joseph, affirming Christ's lordship over our families, loving our wives, educating our children in the instruction of the lord, etc. Good resource for small mens discussion groups, too."},{"Title":"Christian Fatherhood: The Eight Commitments of St. Joseph's Covenant Keepers","review":"I was horrified when a friend showed me this book's outrageous claim that Pope John Paul II neither teaches or endorses the mutual subjection of spouses. The book's claim is, of course, patently false.The reasoning behind this false claim includes, among other things, an appeal to the writings of Wayne Grudem, a Protestant with a weak understanding of both scripture and linguistics whose works have been debunked time and again by better scholars.What Pope John Paul II *actually* teaches about the mutual subjection of spouses may be found in his apostolic exhortation &quot;On the Dignity and Vocation of Women&quot; (Mulieris Dignitatem):&quot;The author [of Ephesians] knows that this way of speaking [in Ephesians 5:22-23], so profoundly rooted in the customs and religious tradition of the time, is to be understood and carried out in a new way: as a 'mutual subjection out of reverence for Christ' (cf. Eph 5:21).... However, whereas in the relationship between Christ and the Church the subjection is only on the part of the Church, in the relationship between husband and wife the 'subjection' is not one-sided but mutual.... the awareness that in marriage there is mutual 'subjection of the spouses out of reverence for Christ,' and not just that of the wife to the husband, must gradually establish itself in hearts, consciences, behavior and customs. This is a call which from that time onwards does not cease to challenge succeeding generations; it is a call which people have to accept ever anew. St. Paul not only wrote: 'In Christ Jesus...there is no more man or woman,' but also wrote: 'There is no more slave or freeman.' Yet how many generations were needed for such a principle to be realized in the history of humanity through the abolition of slavery! ....But the challenge presented by the 'ethos' of the Redemption is clear and definitive. All the reasons in favor of the 'subjection' of woman to man in marriage must be understood in the sense of a 'mutual subjection' of both 'out of reverence for Christ.'&quot; (section 24)How could Steve Wood so flagrantly deny a clear teaching of Pope John Paul II? The only possible explanation I can think of is that perhaps his conversion to Catholicism was not yet complete when he wrote this book. At any rate, Catholics should follow Pope John Paul II rather than Steve Wood. &quot;Mutual subjection&quot; of wife to husband AND husband to wife is the authentic Gospel ethos."},{"Title":"Nightscape (Roswell)","review":"This was the second of two new Roswell novels written by author Kevin Ryan. The first of the two was \\"A New Beginning\\", which was not that great a book. Well, \\"Nightscape\\" is the complete opposite in terms of quality compared to the first book. I actually sat down and read the whole book in four and a half hours. I couldn't put it down it was so good.Unlike the last book, the author gets to the main action and interest of the story fairly quickly. After having an encounter with the Special Unit while traveling through Washington state, the group drives down a deserted logging road and finds a spooky old manshion to hide in for the night. During their stay, things happen to convince them they are not alone in the house, and the group end up encountering an evil from their past.The plot of this book is a great mixture of character exploration and suspense. I'll start by analyzing the character development:Max is really shown as being tired of having to take the lead all the time in this book, taking the time for the group to vote on even small decisions. He is determined to protect his friends, sister, and the girl he loves, but finds failure in his past efforts to do so, and wants to make up for it in the present. Liz is also exploring her powers more, and how they may be used to help Max and her friends.Michael and Maria are really explored well in this book. Michael is shown as having felt freer than ever before. Now, he has firmly concluded that Maria is his future. Just as this happens, Maria is deliberately pushing Michael away. But, the reason she is doing so is logical. She knows about Liz's premonitions about how Max, Michael, and Isabel, all die in the future during some alien attack. She is afraid to let Michael get close to her again because she is afraid of the pain she would feel in losing him.Isabel is really shown to be at a crossroads. She is stepping into a new life, but is looking back at the one she is leaving behind. She spends a lot of thought on how Alex's death has affected her, and how it may relate to her marriage to Jesse that she has given up. The events of this story allow her a chance to explore some of her emotional baggage and confront some of the feelings she has been suppressing for a long time, since Alex's death. Kyle doesn't get much play in this book, but he is shown as wanting to be closer to Isabel, and risking his life to save her from a powerful enemy.Now, for the plot. This is really a suspense/mystery novel. It almost reminds me of a classic haunted house story, but with a twist regarding who is shown to be behind some of the spookiness of the house. The atmosphere of the old house they end up in has a sense of otherwordly presence, but one that is rather sophisticated, not relying on chains rattling and moans in the night. Isabel also connects with the unseen forces she thinks are may be at work in the house in ways that really draw out her emotions and aid in her exploration of her past, especially her loos of Alex.As they explore the house, I was really interested in just why certain things are the way they are in the house. The reader continues to be drawn into the spooky and mysterious atmosphere, and can't wait to read on to see what the answer to all of it is. Then, in an action packed climax of the book, the group is in an all out battle for their lives against an evil foe who has occupied the house. All extremely well carried out by Kevin Ryan in his story.There are also some funny moments along the way, such as when Max and Michael chase away some Special Unit guys who try to capture them before they even get to the old mansion. Plus, I am convinced Kevin Ryan must be an Andy Griffith fan. In the last book, he had a mechanic named Gomer. In this book, the group runs into a Sheriff named Taylor. All that was missing was a deputy named Barney and a little boy named Opie.I highly recommend reading \\"Nightscape\\". It was trully an excellent book. Just give yourself a few hours, though, when you pick it up. Once you do, you are not going to want to put it down."},{"Title":"Nightscape (Roswell)","review":"i dont like reviews that mess up the story for readers so i just want to start off saying im not telling you anything to spoil the book.ok, so ive never read any of the roswell high books but i love the tv show and have read 6 of the 11 books that came out during and after the tv series finale. i have to say that this is the best one i have read so far. not olny was it suspenseful and just as funny as all hell as it was scary (seriously) but it was incredibly well written. i only have two little things about the story that bothered me which were the over explinations of two or three scences (if you explain a joke it just isn't funny anymore and ryan messed up a joke or two by doing this) also the way maria was acting when michael was being so uncharictaristiclly sweet and caring urked me (i could have thrown the book at her she got me so upset), but i digress, anyhow it was so good i couldn't put it down i read it within a few hours. even if you dont know the rowell story this is a good book just becuse it is so well explained and written, but if you do know the story and characters this book is sooooooooo great because the little plot twists and turns were incredible and unexpected that you get pulled into the story you already love so much. the ending was sooo hot too i cant even tell you how i had a smile a mile wide for that one perfect ending to everyones story (michael&maria;, max&liz;, and then the group as a whole). oh and don't mind the back cover it may sound scooby dooish but trust me it's anything but. i would recommend this book to any and everyone because it has just the right amount of everything that makes a good story. you dont expect anything that happens in the story to happen i litterally shed a tear at some points, i was cracking up through one of the special unit scence especially (michael and max were too funny) and was in complete suspence through out the whole story. what else can i say it was plainly a good read and its one of those books that you can read 10 times and it's like you just read it for the first time. two thumbs up to kevin ryan for this one."},{"Title":"Nightscape (Roswell)","review":"Nightscape is a much better effort by Kevin Ryan (and his editors) after the rather poor 'A New Beginning'.Once again this is no literary masterpiece and if that were the sole criteria, I would have only given it one star.

Every narrative convention is completely challenged. It is impossible for any two readers to read this novel the same way. Comical and impossible to understand yet steeped in meaning and depth. A tape recorded conversation of Hitler and Jesus in a taxi, murder, the invasion of the United States during World War II (which at the time of composition was a reality), ...what's not to like? \\"The Journal...\\" is a work of art and challenges you.

Reading again I realize that what set me apart from so many of my friends was this novel, and Patchen's poetry. Most of the kids my age were into Jack Kerouac and \\"On the Road.\\"\\"Journal of Albion Moonlight\\" is not \\"On The Road.\\" The only other novel I have read that compares to it in any way is Frank Stanford's \\"The Battlefield Where The Moon Says I Love You.\\"I admit that two or three decades of experience do make The Journal more intelligible, and I will probably always have a bookmark or two in this novel--because sometimes I am just in the mood for it."},{"Title":"The Journal of Albion Moonlight","review":"Recently came across a copy of Albion's Journal, signed and dated by his wife Miriam. So this made the re-reading more personal, somehow. I work as a bookpricer for a Friends of the Library group; someone donated the book to us.I'd read Albion Moonlight once or twice before, never in its entirety (an intriguing impossibility -- unless you are fond of lists, and outlines of possible books, and marginalia to the max).The journal as a journal pretty much disappears as a structure after about 50 pages -- but then later comes back -- and goes away -- and the dates proceed for a while, then sort of recycle. May to June and on, but you never get past August. And then you're back, somehow, to May again.Taken as a whole, the work seems more an artifact, or art object -- even a stunning one -- but also then something to look at and admire for its conception, rather than read. That's true of the last half or possibly as much as two-thirds of the work.Yet, all in all, I enjoyed meeting again with Albion and his rag-tag gang. The book is probably more over-hyped than any other \\"literary\\" title I've ever come across -- nonetheless, it remains engaging.I've read plenty of other \\"odd\\" novels, not always with pleasure. (OK, I'll confess, I seek them out.) I didn't care much for Nabokov's \\"Pale Fire\\" -- but loved many of Julio Cortazar's parables and novels, including \\"Hopscotch.\\" Gunter Grass' \\"Dog Years\\" remains an all-time favorite. Neither of those have much to do with traditional, progressive narrative time-lines. Yet that's very much part of what makes each one, in very different ways, effective.However, Patchen's rejection of narrative, or distaste for it, a love and hate affair working through the journal -- for me, this got very wearying.Moonlight is hilarious, did I say that? It has parts which are uproarious, and at places it is shockingly funny -- disturbingly so. These often very brief sections may be where it's most effective.But there's plenty of vile stuff, too. And and and ... is he preaching against murder or advocating it? Again and again he explains how he seeks to murder \\"murder.\\" Then he says he lied. Or that God (Roivas) made him lie when he said that. And so on.Patchen plays with making as many contradictory statements as possible, then makes contradictory statements about contradiction itself. This same sort of perverse persistence goes on with other themes and literary tropes. Often what makes the work live is the wild inventiveness present, but the invention then dies away with this tedious repetitiveness.So -- read with caution, but do read."},{"Title":"Shooting Straight: Telling the Truth About Guns in America","review":"Does a pretty good job of explaining why most if not all gun control concepts and demands will not work and in some cases may not even be meant to. Each chapter is extensively footnoted (I'd like more detail in them)and features numerous quotes from various figures throughout history on what the Country's founders really meant and why they meant what they said. In many cases examples are given of the various control proposals that have been made, followed by just how they've failed. I appreciate the care given to the reporting of what many have privately, if not always publicly, said about what they really want for guns in America.This book won't convince those that refuse to be convinced but should be read by anyone who has an honest interest in the facts about gun control."},{"Title":"Shooting Straight: Telling the Truth About Guns in America","review":"I'm not a member of the NRA or even a gunowner, but I have to praise this book highly. LaPierre and Baker do an outstanding job of defending the rights of gunowners in Shooting Straight. The authors address and rebut most of the common gun-control arguments. Their defense of the 2nd Amendment as being a personal right rather than a collective right was particularly convincing. Any fair-minded reader will be forced to concede that LaPierre and Baker have demolished a number of the myths of the gun control crowd. Even if you're a gun control proponent, I urge to read this book with an open mind. The NRA has been treated unfairly by the established media; I'm glad they decided to take their case to the public.However, I do have one strong disagreement with the authors. On page 52, they urge \\"the enforcement of the 20,000 gun control laws on the books.\\" Wait a minute. The authors devoted the rest of the book to showing us gun control laws don't reduce crime. So why do we need to enforce thousands of laws that are ineffective as well as probably being unconstitutional? The authors don't explain this inconsistency. In my judgement, this weakness keeps the book from meriting a 5 star rating. Nevertheless, it is still an excellent book that I can proudly recommend."},{"Title":"Shooting Straight: Telling the Truth About Guns in America","review":"Mr. Arthur Hayhoe comments below contradict his own opening paragraph.To all readers please read the United States Supreme Court (USSC) Decision in Perpich v.

It corrects all of the intentional errors put forth by the liberal media in this country and gives you the facts, both statistically and from a historical perspective. Wayne LaPierre is currently the head of the NRA, yet you don't get a feel for biased perspectives or crazy rants, distorted facts that are common in other left-wing media based text. The author simply states facts, both statistical and hisorical concerning gun ownership, right to carry laws and the second amendment. This book correctly summarizes what the founding fathers intended through the second amendment and he proves this by citing indisputable examples of their quotations and writings through the federalist papers.There is NO denying the fact that our founding fathers were concerned about any governmental intrusion on the individual right to bear arms for both self protection and government tyranny. The Bill of Rights, including the second amendment are critical for America's survival today (in the light of an increased awareness of fanatical terrorism) and for future generations of Americans.Not only should everyone read this book, but its contents should be priority teaching in all public and private schools today."},{"Title":"Shooting Straight: Telling the Truth About Guns in America","review":"It is unfortunate how many people think they know something about guns, however, they have absolutely no idea (never owned one,never viewed children in the field with their parents enjoying the outdoors, etc...). The media tries so hard to brain wash the ignorant and weak to believe guns are bad.

The weapon's menacing looks, coupled with the public's confusion over fully automatic machine-guns versus semi-automtic assault weapons. Anything that looks like a machine-gun can only increase the chance of public support for restrictions on these weapons.\\" - page 44.Deception and confusion are standard operating procedure.The author cites numerous statistics proving that crime rates increase with a disarmed population. That contrasts with lower crime rates in conceal-and-carry states. Crimonologists Gary Kleck and John R. Lott,jr are sources for that data.\\"The point is clear, crime is irrelevant to the gun control lobby, control is the issue.\\" The author quoted on page 66.The media bias in reporting on the conclusion of the shooting at Appalachian School of Law in 2002 is addressed. What the media widely ignored or censored was the fact that two armed students disarmed the shooter.John McCain's Campaign Finance Reform bill is analyzed as well as McCains' relationship with Americans for Gun Safety(AGS). AGS has no relationship to gun safety, it's a stealth approach at gun control.The myth that the government or police force must protect you is shattered by a D.C. Court of Appeals ruling in 1981 which reads in part, \\"a government and it's agents are under no general duty to provide public services such as police protection, to any particular citizen\\".As Mr. LaPierre accurately points out, the problem is not with laws. The problem lies in woefully inadequate enforcement and prosecution of federal laws! The common sense solution is enforcement of current laws and responsible gun ownership!One point of contention I have is one that was brought up by an earlier reviewer, that is the seemingly high number quoted for existing laws by the author.\\"Shooting Straight-Telling the Truth About Guns in America\\" is just what the title implies, a straight forward book about the inalienable right of self-protection, responsible gun ownership, and the tactics used by the gun control lobby."},{"Title":"Shooting Straight: Telling the Truth About Guns in America","review":"There is absolutely NOTHING WRONG with owning firearms.Whether out of stupidity, ignorance, or naivety, most leftists really do believe that firearms ownership is a \\"left versus right\\" issue. It is NOT.Every person has THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE.Every person has THE RIGHT TO DEFEND OTHERS.Possessing the contemporary arms to do so, IS PART OF THAT RIGHT.A historical case in point:Alan Berg, a leftist radio talk-show host from Colorado, recieved a number of death-threats from neo-nazis. Berg was brash, abbrasive, and controversial, which is what you have to be to succeed in particular talk-show venues. I myself would probably greatly disagree with Berg's political views, but in America, we all have a RIGHT to express ourselves, whether anyone agrees or not. NO ONE CAN STOP YOU FROM SPEAKING YOUR MIND.Due to the death-threats, Berg applied to the police for a permit to carry a pistol. THEY SAID NO. Guess what? The Aryan Nation KILLED Berg.Now, even if he had been armed, they still may have been able to murder him, ...or maybe he may have been successful in defending himself. Being armed, he at least had a chance.This example demonstates, in part, what our Second Amendment was meant for.There is an agenda behind every proposal to disarm private citizens. There is NO VALIDITY to any of the usual leftist propaganda cited arguing in favor of the disarmament of law-abiding citizens. All such leftist propaganda is logically de-bunked in Mr. Lapierre's recent book.Unfortunately, the anti-gun rabble WILL NOT listen. They very desparately WANT to believe the propaganda from their commisars, as all good communists do.Consider these FACTS:-Some people think \\"gun-control\\" is needed for \\"public safety\\":99% of all firearms in America are owned by responsible, private citizens who abide the law and are NO THREAT to anyone. The fact is, the anti-gun politicians are AFRAID that the specific demographic groups who possess guns won't comply with their prospective \\"politics\\". Hitler and Stalin had the same problem when they came to power.-Some people really want to believe that banning firearms will result in \\"less crime\\":In fact, in every country in the world, ...the vast majority of which DO NOT recognize a citizen's right to self-defense, and DO NOT ALLOW their citizens to keep any kind of weapon ...THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT IS ARMED TO THE TEETH! This is true even in nations under totalitarian rule. Revelation: criminals DON'T OBEY LAWS!The TRUTH, is that gun-banning is all about CONTROL of the LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN.-Some people, LEFTISTS IN PARTICULAR, think that \\"only the police and military should have guns\\":I have never known liberals to be supporters of the police or military. According to them: \\"the cops are racist\\" and the \\"military is a fascist organization\\". Why then, would they endorse a policy in which ONLY the police and military may keep arms?In fact, in many nations, the police and military are a tool of the state, whose major task is to suppress the citizenry, not necessarily law-enforcement or national-defense. In fact, a number of emminent statesmen such as Stalin, Lenin, Mao Tze Tung, Pol Pot, Hitler, Saddam Hussein, and Idi Amin (just to name a few) were quite aware of the advantages of just such an arrangement. Its rather easy to enforce your \\"policies\\" when the populace has no means to resist.Mao Tze Tung, said: \\"Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun\\".-Some people think that you should depend on the police to protect you:In a city of a million people, do you really think a few hundred police-officers can magically appear to save you, PRECISELY at the time of an assault? Has this EVER happened? What if the police are already overwhelmed with previous calls, which is all too often in many urban areas? Often, even if the victim DID have time to call for help, the police arrive long after the crime was commited. Sometimes, only the corroner and forensic team can do anything at that point.ONLY YOU can be resonsible for your own safety. If you can't comprehend this, you are living in a fantastic delusion.THE TRUTH: Those politicians and activists who are so determined to disarm the law-abiding populace, have an agenda. Hitler, Stalin, and Mao did. They too, were very strong advocates of \\"gun-control\\". They too, stated it was for \\"public safety\\"."},{"Title":"Shooting Straight: Telling the Truth About Guns in America","review":"&quot;It's just plain common sense that there be a waiting period to allow local law enforcement officials to conduct background checks on those who wish to buy a handgun.&quot;- Ronald Reagan *endorsing* the Brady handgun control bill, at a March 1991 event commemorating 10th anniversary of the assassination attempt."},{"Title":"Shooting Straight: Telling the Truth About Guns in America","review":"There is absolutely nothing new in \\"Shooting Straight\\" for either gun control advocats or gun right advocates. This is nothing but a re-hash of old gun lobby arguements, i.e. that the founding fathers included the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights specifically to guarantee each American an absolute right to any kind of firearm without any legislative constraints much the same and exactly the same as are guaranteeded by the right of free speach so that we would be able to defend ourself from our government if it became tyrannical, that the 240 million firearms in circulation have actually made this country safer and that more guns in circulatuon will make us even safer, that any efforts to prevent guns from falling into the wrong is nothing but a scheme to take all guns away and other variations on this theme.Unfortunately the historical record just does not support the gun lobbies reading of the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment makes no reference to the private ownership of firearms and if it did as the gun lobby claims it means our founding fathers were do dumb they wanted to conduct government with guns pointed at their heads and would have had no legal or constitutional right to protect their fledgling democracy from crackpots, saboteurs, traitors or armed mobs (Citizens militia) and no right to call out their only armed instrument of state, their \\"Well regulated Militia\\" to put down the Shay, Whisky and other armed rebellion we have had throughout our history.Mr. LaPierre simply cannot explain, and doesn't even try, how one can on one hand can claim a constitutional right to start shooting at ones own overnment if it, as Mr. LaPierre so often points out, has become tyrannical, and at the same time claim protection from within that very same government!! No democracy anywhere in the world has such statements written into their constitution. If the did they would have perished long ago, including this county. And Mr. LaPierre claims our founding fathers put such a right our constitution and or Bill Of Rights? Absolute nonsense!"},{"Title":"A Streak of Luck: The life & legend of Thomas Alva Edison","review":"\\"A Streak Of Luck\\" by Robert Conot is about the life and times of Thomas Alva Edison. This marvelous book has it all: pathos, humor, science, invention, discovery, art, and money... No other time has had the volume of life-changing revolutionary invention as in the years 1878 to 1908. That era was astounding for the ingenuity coming from every direction. And the money coming from every direction, too. Edison would sign a piece of paper stating he would experiment in some field (electromotive transportation) and the backers would give him, say, $50,000- in 1889! Then he would get absorbed in some other venture and when nothing was forthcoming the backers would sell the promissory contract to other backers and Edison would get even more money.He nearly went bankrupt around that time tearing-up the east coast, strip mining, in search of cheap, abundant iron ore and residual metals with gigantic, monstrous electro-magnets separating the iron from the huge piano-sized boulders that were crushed in his stories-high contraption with rotating steel drums the size of semi-trailers. The resounding debacle could be heard for miles. He was bent on becoming even wealthier than Andrew Carnegie but the iron on that part of the mud ball was of pitifully poor quality. Then they discovered the massive iron deposits in Duluth and it did him in. We don't move half as fast as the people did back then with our trite little \\"discoveries\\". Anyway, it's breath-taking reading because everyday something was being discovered that would change our lives forever.Some anecdotes about this technological superstar!When Edison had boasted in the newspapers in 1880 (to the outrage of the world's \\"Top Electrical Scientists\\" who didn't like the uneducated upstart) that he had solved the electric light puzzle that had been going on for 40 years (he didn't come up with the idea) people flocked in droves to the little railway station in Menlo Park, New Jersey and when they scaled the steps up to the path leading to his buildings they were met (just days before Christmas) with dozens of little blue-glowing bulbs swinging from wires suspended from telegraph poles in the frosty night air stretching to his lit-up buildings. People were mesmerized by the strange glow that illuminated everything around them as they walked toward the main building. Once inside Edison operated his phonograph and other inventions for everyone. Around this time he gave a private showing of his inventions to the illustrious Sarah Bernhardt to her rapturous glee!Before the light bulb Edison invented a chalk cylinder receiver attached to a Bell telephone (even though Bell invented the rudiments of a telephone you could hear only indiscernible squeaks coming out of the receiver.) The down side was that Edison's chalk receiver was so loud it could be heard for a quarter mile. One day while sitting and pondering this problem he began playing with a globule of soot he scraped out of the chimney of a kerosene lamp and rolling the putty-like carbon in his fingers it suddenly struck him to put a positive and negative wire to a compressed button of this material. This is what all telephone receivers were made of up until a few years ago. It drove Bell crazy to have to share royalties with Edison. That carbon button was also the first microphone. While working on the light bulb he stuck a thin square plate of platinum inside of a light bulb next to the filament and he and others witnessed a fuzzy blue smoke-like glow coming off of it which was the first radio vacuum tube. He called it the \\"Edison Effect', threw it to one side and moved on.In 1886 Edison was invited to be the guest of honor at the Paris World's Fair. Masses of people thronged the docks in France to catch a glimpse of the \\"Wizard Of Menlo Park\\" as he disembarked. He was seated on the podium with Europe's Royalty and crowds as far as the eye could see when the Grand Marshall threw the switch that lit-up a huge glass castle constructed for the event. The structure's blinding brightness made the crowds hysterical and they rushed the stage and Edison and his wife had to flee for their lives. From there he toured by invitation to all of Europe's capitols. The newspapers around the world made great play at his Royal receptions. There is a book I inter-library loaned a few years back that was over an inch thick with photographs of all of the gifts and awards given to him by all the presidents, kings and queens from around the world. The Czar of Russia gave him a solid gold cigar case. He was made an honorary citizen of every civilized country on earth.A Streak of Luck: The life & legend of Thomas Alva Edison"},{"Title":"A Streak of Luck: The life & legend of Thomas Alva Edison","review":"Robert Conot's A STREAK OF LUCK about the life of Thomas Edison should be required reading for every American student.

Not understood, also, is that Thomas Edison with his diode vacuum tube (Edison Effect) led to Lee de Forest's triode and the electronics industry. That is, Thomas Edison in many different ways invented our modern civilization.Today, however, with emphasis on budgets and VC's getting control, Edison would have been out the door in minutes.

In his attempt to include a multitude of countries and customs, nothing gets decent coverage. Though it's doubtful anyone would expect a book about using English to serve as a foreign-language phrasebook, the brief appendix tries to do just that, contributing to the book's scattershot feel.The Church Lady seems to have ghostwritten five pages of Chapter 5, where we are informed of the Canadians' &quot;special heritage,&quot; Quebecers' &quot;special pride in their ethnic heritage,&quot; and Australians' &quot;special brand of coined and abbreviated words,&quot; not to mention their &quot;special brand of lingo.&quot;This book is for you if you're an after-dinner speaker who needs cute anecdotes about language and cultural snafus, or if lists of misstatements like &quot;Our Father who art in heaven, Howard be thy name,&quot; send you into convulsions of laughter. But it's not essential travel reading."},{"Title":"Do's and Taboos of Using English Around the World","review":"Do's and Taboos of Using English Around the World is primarily written with the international business traveler in mind, but it is also useful for teachers and students of English as a foreign language. Indeed, the book is written in such a simple and entertaining style as to make it appealing to just about anyone remotely interested in language or travel. It is divided into three sections. The first part deals with the idiosyncrasies of American English, the second part with English varieties around the world, and the last part, which makes up over half of the book, with helpful advice on becoming a global communicator. If you are a native English speaker, then the first two sections of this book may not be that interesting, as much of what is said may already be known to you. As an English teacher, I found the latter part of the book to be the most useful because of its coverage of the subtle differences in English communication throughout the world. Of course, this book is not serious reading if you are a linguist or a scholar, but Axtell does a fine job of offering good advice to any newcomer to Japan, my home for the past ten years. If I were to complain about this book, I would say that some of his anecdotes are a little bit contrived and others rather dull. Also, the grocer's apostrophe in the book's title; are we going to get rid of it or quote it in a later edition in the series?"},{"Title":"Do's and Taboos of Using English Around the World","review":"This book has little value except as a very elementary introduction to intercultural encounter. As the cover illustration suggests, Axtell points out some of the large number idioms that flavor the speech (and writing) of Americans. For someone who has never tried to bridge a cultural gap, such awareness is an important first step. For everyone else, the book is only a light read, good for stretches of an international flight when the movie isn't interesting and you can't fall asleep. The entire third chapter is devoted to amusing errors made by Americans when speaking English.The only serious analysis comes near the end of the last chapter when Axtell outlines four levels of language proficiency: 100-word level, courtesy level, survival level, and near fluency (which he sagely suggests requires six months of living in a foreign culture in addition to classroom study).As several reviewers have stated, this book is far too superficial in its description of other cultures. But there is a bigger problem: the very notion of \\"taboos\\" is a holdover from the 19th century attitude that foreign cultures are inherently dangerous -- a misstep might get you eaten by a cannibal, for example. However, TV has made people around the globe aware of other cultures, even if the viewers live in areas so remote that Americans and other foreigners (from their viewpoint) rarely if ever set foot there. This means most of humanity already knows that differences exist and therefore everyone has some degree of tolerance for unfamiliar behaviors.Even books that focus on a single culture (in contrast to Axtell's scattered attempt to introduce many cultures) usually fail to go deeper that listing a bunch of warnings. Perhaps intercultural communication guides sell better by scaring readers into thinking that a single misstep could blow a billion dollar deal that was about to be clinched. Nevertheless, diplomats, entrepreneurs, and long-time expatriates generally recognize that finding common ground between cultures is at least as essential as respecting differences. Common sense is important, too: don't get angry, listen attentively, etc."},{"Title":"Friedl Dicker-Brandeis, Vienna 1898-Auschwitz 1944","review":"At first I thought the book, Friedl Dicker-Brandeis by Elena Makarova and Regina Seidman Miller, was just a beautiful exhihibition catalogue.There are hundreds of color plates of paintings so rich in imagination and expressive beauty, and there are designs for theater and costumes as well as plans for houses and rooms. She brought her unique inspirational creativity to every aspect of her life--creating order out of chaos. This was wonderful in itself,but as I read it I realized it was an inspirational biography, the life story of a creative, artistic spirit who despite the most impossible circumstances, which grew more and more intolerable, continued to work creatively and what's more, to teach others--children whose lives had been devastated. For those who managed to survive-- their memories of her are recorded here too. They were forever changed by having been influenced by her and the invaluable medicine she provided. The book offers insight into the influences on her own art education and the development of her approach to inspiring the creativity of children, a wonderful guide for anyone working in an artistic capacity with children. There are so many revealing letters and photographs of hers, and her friends, and from the children she taught which capture so much about this mysterious, irrepressible woman. The book is a treasure, a reassurance. I feel I must hold it close to remind myself that despite the evil in the world there are human beings have wonderful spirit and creative talent, and it will endure despite everything."},{"Title":"Friedl Dicker-Brandeis, Vienna 1898-Auschwitz 1944","review":"It is hard to believe that this woman, artist, inventor, and heroine is not better known in the eyes and hearts of the world.

However, having read \\"I Never Saw Another Butterfly\\" and other books on life (if you can call it that) in the Terezin Ghetto, I knew this was a volume I had to have. Yes, it's a hefty book, but it is worth every ounce.How can one do justice to writing about someone who was not only a phenomenal artist, but also an outstanding person? That is a daunting task, to say the least; again, this book meets the challenge. Elena Marakova has done an outstanding job in covering the life and art of Friedl Dicker-Brandeis, selecting works of art and original quotations from people who know Friedl personally to \\"illustrate\\" her biography.The book starts out offering a fine introduction to what the Bauhaus movement was about, the cities in which Friedl lived, and the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. This is followed by beautifully reproduced examples of Friedl's work; these examples show not only what an amazingly versatile artist Friedl was, but also convey the artist's moods; for example, the somber tones of Friedl's paintings from Prague convey the sadness of her mood. The third section, the main reason I purchased this book, covers Friedl's years in Terezin. This section is both sad and inspiring. Ms. Marakova discusses Friedl's teaching methods (art teachers, take note!), accompanied by much first-hand information from people who knew her and lived to tell about it - most notably Georg Eisler and Edith Kramer, both of whom clearly convey their debt and admiration for Friedl. It is also remarkable to see the photos of artists as adults juxtaposed with their drawings from Terezin. Of course, there are also drawings from artists, to use a phrase that appears all too often in \\"I Never Saw Another Butterfly,\\" perished at Auschwitz.This book is much more than something to place on a coffee table - it is a book to read, savor, and treasure."},{"Title":"Friedl Dicker-Brandeis, Vienna 1898-Auschwitz 1944","review":"This is a book I intended to glance over just to look at the art, but ended up reading it cover to cover until 3 in the morning. It is a in depth look at this amazing woman's life, as well as the beautiful art she created. This is a must read for anyone wanting to learn about history, and how people cope with major events in their lives."},{"Title":"Friedl Dicker-Brandeis, Vienna 1898-Auschwitz 1944","review":"This book is truely a remarkable insight into the life and commitment of a very special woman. Faced with the most devasting of conditions and pure enough in heart and soul to put her own personal fears aside, Friedl found ways to inspire the most innocent during a time when humanity was nowhere to be found. This book allows the reader to get a glimpse of a remarkable spirit and witness the amazing difference that one person can make. Thank you Ms. Makarova and Ms. Seidman Miller, for bringing this lesson to life and helping us all to keep our own lives in the right perspective."},{"Title":"Friedl Dicker-Brandeis, Vienna 1898-Auschwitz 1944","review":"A number of years ago, I ran across a book entitled, &quot;I Never Saw Another Butterfly&quot; which was a compilation of children's art and poetry from the Terezin Concentration Camp during the WW2 years. Most of these child artists perished at Auschwitz. That book became one of my favorites, and I must have given away 50 copies as I found so inspiring the ability of children to create beauty in even these circumstances. This new book about Friedl completes the story for me as it tells the life of the woman who instructed these children at Terezin. Friedl was a teacher of these children, and stayed with them even to death, and used her art instruction as a means of spiritual survival in the face of certain and inevitable death. This is a book worthy of its subject and one of my new favorites. Highest recommendation!"},{"Title":"Friedl Dicker-Brandeis, Vienna 1898-Auschwitz 1944","review":"After I first learned about Dicker-Brandeis, I was under the impression that most of her work had been destroyed. So when I bought this book I was concerned that there wouldn't be many of the Bauhaus designs or personal works of art of which she was so prolific in creating during her lifetime. So when the book arrived, a heavy volume with glossy pages and much of it image after image of her work across various periods, I was thrilled. The text is just enough to give one a solid understanding of Friedl and her life, too. Although persecution and her work with children in Terezin concentration camp are deeply inspiring and a reason for her enduring fame, her original artistic genious and unique approach to art and life before the Holocost, I think after reading this book, are even more inspiring. It is a great read, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Friedl Dicker-Brandeis, Vienna 1898-Auschwitz 1944","review":"This book is a piece of art and one of the most comprehensive on this amazing woman. It was an inspiring read!

Prof. Moore gives a good overview or pulling together various sources on how this phenonemon reared its ugly head again, and especially toward what were deemed new heretical movements in Europe from the 11/12th century onward, after relative calm son that front since the 7th century or so.Although he does not really offer altogether new insights or sources, which he himself freely admits, this is nevertheless an interesting and useful overview of the creation and treatment of various considered 'marginal' groups in society, such as heretics, lepers, Jews, homosexuals and prostitutes. He tries to explain why in this particular period heretical movements made their comeback, and why persecution started to become much more vigourous and vicious. It is an interesting question and he links it to a number of reasons such as the rise of the money economy that greatly upset existing social arrangements in that time. His main point however, and an interesting one, is that persecution did not necessarily reflect popular sentiment at all, but that to find cogent reasons one needs to look more to the persecutors rather than the persecuted. He states that persecution was the decision of princes and prelates for their own political reasons. This much reflects or coincides with Misha Glenny's observation on the persecutions in Balkan history that nearly each genocide has had the more or less active support of local governments. Also, the political use of disease is well documented elsewhere and so this did not add much new, but it was still good to read it here again.The author does elaborate on this interesting conclusion, and it is indeed central to Moores' book, but I did miss a more specific or detailed discussion or explanation of why these princes and prelates indeed did think it to their political advantage to start perscution and build the elaborate machinery for this in these particular times. Another point that i would have liked to see discussed a bit more is whether these developments are uniquely European or could be found with as much roots in other societes in that time as well. For this the book is too short and leaves one wondering. Nevertheless, i do recommend the book as it deals succinctly with a very important subject that has obvious links with present Europe and elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Formation Of A Persecuting Society: Power And Deviance In Western Europe, 950-1250","review":"This book is an insightful, if brief, examination of the how and why behind the rise of intolerance and persution in the mid to late middle ages. Lots of books are written about one of the specific topics or groups Moore analyzes (lepers, Jews, homosexuals, people considered religious heretics, etc.) but Moore connects these various expressions of persecution to the historical context and the factors encouraging intolerance at particular times of European culture. Unlike many authors, Moore unpacks and questions assumptions about the inevitability of religious persecution and the creation and persecution of so-called heretical religious beliefs and behavior."},{"Title":"The Formation Of A Persecuting Society: Power And Deviance In Western Europe, 950-1250","review":"\\"In the early middle ages as in the later,\\" writes R. I. Moore, Professor of Medieval History at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, \\"persecution began as a weapon in the competition for political influence, and was turned by the victors into an instrument for consolidating their power over society at large.\\" Victims like heretics and Jews, he argues, \\"owed their persecution in the first place not to the hatred of the people but to the decision of princes or prelates.\\" Accusations of witchcraft, for instance, first appear in the royal and ecclesiastical courts during political intrigues. Ambitious nobles and clerics charged their rivals as Satan worshippers. When confession under torture or trial by ordeal confirmed these charges, authorities executed the guilty and often transferred the titles, powers, and estates of the guilty to their accusers. In later centuries, authorities applied the legal precedents and institutions that developed from these proceedings against increasingly independent townsmen and restive peasants.Moore makes important contributions to understanding medieval history and the rise of the national state in Europe. Violent power wielded against a \\"dangerous\\" few is legitimized and institutionalized, ready for later use against the many. Although Moore doesn't apply his historical thesis to later history or current times, his book should be of interest to political scientists, legal scholars, criminologists, sociologists, and historians, especially those studying the tragedies of the past century--or speculating on future events.A caveat: I'm no expert on medieval history, but I am uncomfortable with the author's de-emphasis of the role of popular prejudice in these persecutions, particularly of European Jews. Contemporary history and social research indicate that popular hatred and inter-group rivalry facilitate official persecutions of minority and outcast groups. Spontaneous persecutions by the masses occur and have occurred without official sanction or support."},{"Title":"The Formation Of A Persecuting Society: Power And Deviance In Western Europe, 950-1250","review":"R.I. Moore has done a great disservice to historians and historiography with this volume. He has made several broad assumptions regarding persecution, marginalizing of groups, and even the nature of illness. On top of this he places late 20th century nurban expectations upon an earlier society.Moore is on fairly safe ground when he speaks of the marginalization of Jews during the Middle Ages -- this is well documented -- but he overstates his case. His assertation that this practice only started in the Middle Ages is, however, rather off the mark. Certainly we can read Roman authors (and edicts) which show active persecution of Jews. But Moore tells us that it was only during the Middle Ages that organized persecution be minorities truly began; I am sure this is a great comfort of Christians persecuted since the 1st century A.D. within the confines of the Roman Empire.When he turns to lepers he is on terribly dangerous ground and, indeed, utterly misinterprets evidence laid before his eyes. As Moore points out there have been many studies that show that what was called \\"leprosy\\" during the Middle Ages was probably a wide range of both related and non-related illnesses, so we cannot equate it exactly with the modern disease; however it must also be remembered that germ theory did not exists until the 19th century. What Moore tells us is that the creation of leper colonies during the Middle Ages is the moral equivalent to concentration camps in the 20th century. Here are nobles, particularly noble women, who are forcing these \\"lepers\\" to live apart from society. Thus nobles decide who is a leper and segregate them from society. QED, a persecuting society. Instead, from a medieval point of view, these nobles were providing a chance at life for individuals who were likely to die on their own because they had been shunned by their own families, due to some horrible, disfiguring disease. What was in actuallity an example of good works and aid to one's fellow man is twisted by Moore into proto-Nazism.Moore is a man who wants to answer a question -- why is their racism and when did it begin? The problem is that by overstating his case and trying to suggest that only one area (Europe) at only one time (the 9th-12th centuries) are responsible for this phenomenon worldwide. This, sadly, is not true. People have been marginalized for their skin colour, their faith, their way of dress, or any of a host of other reasons practically since human beings emerged and certainly it is, again sadly, a world-wide phenomenon. It would have been comforting to stick this label, but in doing so Moore is, in effect, guilty of exactly the same crime that he wishes to place on others -- marginaliztion of a group of people because they do not fit to his personal beliefs and standards. Much as there was evil in medieval Europe, it is far from responsible for all the sins of the world."},{"Title":"From Abacus to Zeus: A Handbook of Art History","review":"I recently purchased this text along with Janson's History of Art (5th ed.).

It has been quite a while since I've read such a compulsively readable medical thriller. This book kept me guessing &quot;whodunnit&quot; right until the very end. If you like Robin Cook and Michael Palmer, you'll really enjoy Leonard Goldberg."},{"Title":"Deadly Medicine","review":"I have read several medical thrillers written by Dr. Goldberg. All of them featuring Joanna Blalock as a forensic pathologist and her on again off again lover Detective Jake Sinclair as a pair of super sleuths. Dr. Blalock doesn't miss any clues left behind by the murderers, and try as they may, there is no stumping her. I was finally fortunate to find the book that started it all and I must say the first is as good as the rest.Dr. Goldberg creates believable characters, realistic bad guys and uses just enough medical jargon to make the story interesting but not enough to confuse or bore a reader unfamiliar with the world of medicine.Women are dying at the medical center Dr. Blalock works at and one of the victims is a friend of hers. She proceeds to work tirelessly and meticulously to find the killer, leaving no stone unturned. She is up against hospital administration who is worried more about public opinion and reputation than doing what needs to be done to find the killer. Dr. Blalock will have none of that, her only concern is to assist Detective Jake Sinclair in bringing the murderer to justice, and in the process, finds herself falling for him.This is a great story, filled with suspense and mystery. You will feel as though you are riding a roller coaster through twists and turns until the book comes to an end. This is a good one and well worth your time."},{"Title":"Deadly Medicine","review":"It keeps you on your toes from the start. Its tales of unthinkable hospital occurances keep you thinking that they could really happen! Page after page, you wonder if you'll ever feel safe in a hospital again! Goldberg writes so eloquently that you feel as if you have jumped right into the shoes of Joanna or Jake...or even those of a murderous nurse!"},{"Title":"Deadly Medicine","review":"OK, I enjoyed reading this novel. The plot is well constructed at first, and there is a lot of action and suspense. But I was also disappointed. Unlike in the other novels the main characters - above all Joanna Blalock - are not really consistent or believable in their presentation, with the exception of Sinclair. The ending is a real surprise - but too many questions remain open. Some lines of the plot just stop or fade away without a logical explanation. I prefer the other Blalock novels."},{"Title":"Deadly Medicine","review":"Deadly Medicine is one of many books in the science/medical thriller genre that I have reviewed for my website ScienceThrillers. This book follows the standard hospital thriller format, with a smart, strong-willed female pathologist who is the only person with the guts and brains to solve the case. The story is part thriller, part mystery, but the mystery aspect of the plot is only weakly mysterious. Characters are likable but shallow. I recommend this book to hard-core fans of medical thrillers, but it isn't one of the best. Visit my website to find better choices, in particular, books by Michael Palmer, Robin Cook, CJ Lyons."},{"Title":"Deadly Medicine","review":"Leonard Goldberg surely knows how to instill fear into the minds of all who read his fictional medical horrors.

It's made up of bits and pieces from Isobel Kuhn's own books (plural!) about her experiences. This book reads more like a summary than a book in its own right, if that makes sense.I have read Isobel Kuhn's own book,By Searching: My Journey Through Doubt Into Faith.

For many of these children, these excerpts represent their final plea to the surviving world, fully understanding that they will not be a part of that world. Writing became their last and sometimes ONLY form of resistance. I found the very last entry of the unknown brother and sister in the Lodz ghetto to be especially moving. Without access to any other paper, the boy scrawled his diary entries into the margins of an old French novel. After the war was over, a next door neighbor returned to the wreckage of the house, and found the book with the boy's notes in it. If any one of us actually knew any one of those who wrote these diaries... if any one of them were a member of our own families, we would naturally value even one of their retrieved pages far above all of the other books we own, would we not? Well, as I read this book I realized many times that just because I did not know one of these children personally does not really diminish the inherent importance of any one of their pages... these children were all known and loved by their own families and friends. They should have been loved by those who were then acting as their mortal enemies, but sadly, they were not.Some of these entries depict deprivations and describe atrocities that are near impossible for most of us today to imagine. Some would avoid the book on account of this, and that is understandable. We can go to horror novels to be deliberately horrified in a fictional sense, but it seems morbid to turn to non-fiction for the same results. But we must remember that we do not read non-fiction for the same reasons that we read fiction. We read non-fiction, not to dwell on or glory in horror, but to LEARN something about ourselves and others. There is an old saying &quot;To dwell on history is to lose an eye; to ignore it is to lose both of them.&quot; Laurel Holliday has here edited a book which should not be ignored."},{"Title":"CHILDREN IN THE HOLOCAUST AND WORLD WAR II - Their Secret Diaries","review":"As a teacher I found this book to be an excellent way to personalize the experiences of the many child victims of the Holocaust for my students. They could see that these children had families, hopes, and dreams just like any other child although some were shattered by the Holocaust. My students could read about someone their own age and identify with them. I was disappointed with the inclusion of the Joan Wyndham diary for my own school setting. I teach eighth graders in a Catholic school and some of the discussion of her sexuality is inapproriate for my students. That is the only blemish on this wonderful book from my particular situation. It requires that I take extra caution when I use the book."},{"Title":"CHILDREN IN THE HOLOCAUST AND WORLD WAR II - Their Secret Diaries","review":"This book will touch you.

The problem with real diaries of any kind (as opposed to fictional diaries) is that, with a few exceptions, people's daily lives are simply not interesting to read about. That applies even if they were living during the Nazi era.But this book did two things that made it interesting. First, it showed many many people's diaries, achieving a wide perspective, from a Danish Christian evacuee to a Russian partisan to an ordinary London teenager to the usual assortment of Jews suffering horribly. The second thing was that only small portions of these people's diaries were included -- that is, the interesting bits. This is why I found it much more pleasant to read than, say, the entire diaries ofThe Diary of Petr GinzorAnne FrankorDawid Sierakowiak.I would highly recommend this book for school libraries and Holocaust study.

Part of the \\"In Classical Mood\\" Series which also includes other titles like \\"Air of Spring.\\"CD contains some pieces related to a theme. The music is performed by people like Swiss Chamber Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Trevor Pinnock and \\"the English Concert\\", Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Vienna Symphony Orchestra. They may be older recordings - no way to know.Small hard cover book explains a little about each composer - like one paragraph on the composer, one paragraph about the topic of one of the pieces, one paragraph about maybe the city the composer was from, one paragraph about another famous piece by the composer, and one definition of a classical music term. All parts relate to the one piece, and there are four or five parts for each of 12 musical selections. With pictures.Great for an introduction. A nice gift for a young classical music enthusiast, or an older neophyte with mild attention deficit like me! The substance of the text is lacking and the music is not the newest recording, but it is designed to wet your appetite without throwing too much \\"learning\\" at you, I think."},{"Title":"Buyers, Renters & Freeloaders: Turning Revolving-Door Romance Into Lasting Love","review":"Anyone with baggage, emotional and/or (romantic) relationship conflict should read this book.

The author explains the three approaches, and how they interact, and which one works for a solid, lifelong commitment. What he says rings true to me, and it's backed up by the author's own experience as a marriage counselor and as a married man himself.Along the way, Harley also provides soem other useful insights, including a list of personal characteristics that should match in order for a couple to be compatible; why sacrificing your own happiness for each other's benefit is NOT a good strategy for a long-term relationship; how we all have an inner Giver and a Taker; a description of what he calls the Electric Fence Personality, why it makes relationships particularly difficult, and what can be done; and a compelling explanation of why marriages are much more likely to fail when couples live together beforehand.Anyone contemplating marriage (or for that matter, anyone NOT contemplating marriage because they're afraid it wouldn't work out) would profit from reading this book."},{"Title":"Buyers, Renters & Freeloaders: Turning Revolving-Door Romance Into Lasting Love","review":"Provides a great analogy to study romance and to understand why some relationships last and others are, well, hopeless and not worth pursuing. While reading, I was genuinely intrigued by my own review of past relationships and found myself analyzing each with a fresh perspective. In recent years, I've alternately played the 'buyer' the 'renter' and the 'freeloader.' Had I read this book I might've been a bit more savvy on where each relationship was headed or how I might possibly salvage it.Extremely interesting is the Electric Fence Personality (EFP) type and the whacked out behaviors afflicting such people. I had the miserable experience of dating an EFP, but at the time I couldn't understand the person's behavior. I now realize that EFPs are severely challenged and present a low probability for long-term success as a partner for someone like myself. Had I studied this book beforehand, I could've dumped the woman and moved on with my life.I'm currently in a buyer-renter relationship, and because I've read this book, I understand that I must evaluate whether I can also become a buyer or perhaps end the relationship entirely. These types of insights are enough to make the book well worth the price. Highly recommend this title for its originality, succinct writing, brevity, and applicability.

It condenses in a few hundred pages what whole libraries of non-fiction are not able to convey. Two other books that must also be recommended on this score are \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" by Ernest Hemingway, and \\"The Blue of Noon\\" by Georges Bataille.But I don't want to give the impression that \\"Gilles\\" is a completely political novel, since its goal is to recreate the mixture of politics, ambition, ego, despair, illicit love, and breathless escape, that characterized European cities in the 1920s.The author compares himself to Celine in that he was an outspoken critic of the decadence of his generation. But in style he is closer to Stendhal or Flaubert, or even the underappreciated Benjamin Constant: a concise, at times almost vitriolic chronicler of worldly lusts and ambitions. Like these others too, his harsh style is offset by rich psychological insights."},{"Title":"The three ways of the spiritual life;","review":"This is a summary of his 2 volume work, \\"The Three Ages of the Spiritual life\\".

It does center itself around the author's father's murder when she was 10, but from there, it goes on to tell very well how this event affected both her life and the life of her family and extended family. I got a strong feel for the parts of California she was writing about, and for her father's large family and how they dealt with his death in their own ways.The book also examines the issue of memory---how memory is not a set-in-stone thing---how different people remember things differently, and we can feel very sure we know how something happened, and another person is very sure it happened differently.Some might feel unsatisfied that the murder is not solved in these pages, but I was not. That was never really the point here. This is an examination of how murder affects a family, and of the time and place and people that set up the scene. The author leaves us free to form our own opinion as to what happened, and she also is amazingly free with writing about her own changes of perspective and doubts about her feelings about the past. She is a skilled writer and sounds like a strong, caring person. I thank her for this book."},{"Title":"The Lost Night: A Daughter's Search for the Truth of Her Father's Murder","review":"I couldn't agree more with Mr. Donovan's review..ditto for me. Best book I've read in a long time. I stood at the table from which I picked the book up to browse and was hooked by the third page and stood there reading for a half hour oblivious to my surroundings. There was no way I was leaving the book store without purchasing this gem of a book. I didn't know about the novel-I will most certainly keep a keen eye out for that. She's awesome.

After I had picked the book up I found Rachel Howard's website and saw where she was planning/writing a novel. I have already subscribed to the RSS feed of her site so I can read her postings and find out when this novel is published. Why so excited about an unwritten novel? Read this memoir - her first book - and you'll know why. It reads like fiction and kept me glued to the pages - I read it through in two nights. To recount such a painful time in her life (her father was murdered when she was 10) with such range of emotions, and Rachel's path to putting her era of tragedy behind her makes for powerful reading. I laughed, I was moved, I was kept in suspense, I marveled at the descriptions of those involved and was brought into her world with an ease that defies the fact that this is her first book. She is quite a talent. I look forward to her work in the future as much as any new author in years. This is a can't miss memoir and an easy five-star pick."},{"Title":"The Lost Night: A Daughter's Search for the Truth of Her Father's Murder","review":"Lost and Found - a past reclaimedI finished Rachel Howard's \\"the lost night\\" at 3 this morning. From the minute I cracked its spine, the pages turned themselves, inviting me to ignore every routine chore of mine: dirty dishes, daily exercise, even meals (though I did manage to go to work and feed the cat).Masterfully written, the book tells a riveting story of the murder of Rachel's father when she was only 10 years old. How she handled the loss of this beloved man, her protector and playpal, is a glimpse into how children cope with tragedy of this magnitude. The experience retrospectively defined Rachel, her relationship with her family and also with her stepmother Sherry, her father's third wife when he was murdered. Rachel, the product of divorce, was spending a few summer weeks at her father's home during this time. She was witness to his last waking minutes and remembered details that would replay themselves with increasing vividness as time went by.But memory is elusive...and selective. The author comes to realize that her memories were circumscribed by the limited frame-of-reference of a young life.What I found so compelling here is the child's perspective. I have read (and probably own!) just about every true-crime/courtroom/forensic book that exists, yet I never read such an account from a 10-year-old point-of-view. Rachel illustrates the sometimes graphic, sometimes muted terror-of-the-night children of murdered parents are heir to, their wispy and unexpressed--indeed unconscious--suspicion of significant-others, and their necessary dependencies on adults who, often not comprehending the nuances involved, believe that by trotting the kid to therapy, they absolve themselves of the pain of revisiting the circumstances themselves. In Rachel's case, her father's family remained largely silent with her about that night. They may have felt that openly speaking about the murder with someone so young would somehow legitimize it for her. In fact, their passivity had the opposite, and quite damaging, effect on a young mind hungry for assurance and validation.Palpable throughout Rachel's memoir is its raw honesty. The writing is often brutally introspective, devoid of the self-pity and lachrymose language which the author might easily --and justifiably-have indulged. She is seeking information and answers, and by the last page, I realize she has found those things, and some peace along the way.Therese Hercher"},{"Title":"The Lost Night: A Daughter's Search for the Truth of Her Father's Murder","review":"One staple of murder mysteries is the decade old murder being solved through brilliant detective work. This is a book about a real life ten year old murder. The victim was the authors father.As she had progressed through life, the murder had left her with ghosts in her path and as she was preparing to marry she decided to go investigate the murder. The book reads almost like a fictional murder mystery. She interviewed the detectives who investigated the case. She talked with every relative (and there were a lot between the several marriages) she could find. Everyone had a story, no one had any idea who did it.By the end she had no better idea of the killer than when she started, but she had resolved some of the questions and puzzlements in her own life, and reestablished a relationship with her family.

The descriptions of the messed-up Central Valley(to put it delicately)were terrific. With some sex, drugs, and even some 80s Rod Stewart in the mix, for good measure, it was a joy to read."},{"Title":"The Lost Night: A Daughter's Search for the Truth of Her Father's Murder","review":"Rachel Howard tells a compelling story in \\"The Lost Night,\\" a memoir that reads like an extended episode of crime documentary shows like \\"48 Hours Mystery.\\" A pre-teen when her father was stabbed to death in what seemed like a botched break-in, the loss haunts Howard until she can find a way to make sense of it. Suspicion surrounds Howard's step-mother, whose brother is questioned by police, but it is eventually cold cased. As an adult, Howard investigates further, a decision which brings her back in contact with both her father's family and her dreaded step-mother (who has since married again and moved away.)The book effectively sets the scene in California's Central Valley, and Howard successfully plumbs the psychological effects of growing up without a murdered parent. She is candid about many of her struggles with men as a result of the loss, although she is slightly dreamy about her wedding and happy relationship with her husband. (This aspect of the memoir seemed overly one-sided and idealistic.) Her father's murder is never solved, but Howard does find a way to come to peace with it, including an acknowledgment of her own biases against her former step-mother, who makes a memorable reappearance in some of the book's best latter moments.What we end up learning about in \\"The Lost Night\\" is the effect of crime on those left behind, and the mysteries that remain when crimes aren't solved.

Then I went home and read the book. Wow. I had the same experience as the other readers. This is an excellent and poignant memoir.One feels the you-are-there quality of a little girl awakening in the middle of the night to see her father covered with blood on the floor. The people in her book are like characters in a Dickens novel, yet they are (were) all very real. Howard captures the cultural milieu of Merced California in the mid '80's. Her father loved Rod Stewart with a passion and the lyrics of his songs weave through the true story of a child trying to make sense of what is going on around her.The child matures into an adult and becomes a writer! What an awesome contribution to the memoir genre.

This book is a sort of experiment where all three authors try their hands at the romantic fantasy genre.Mercedes Lackey's &quot;Counting Crows&quot; is the first story in the book. In it, Gwynn is wedded to a man she has never seen before, in order to ensure the safety of her father's lands. She goes to her husband hoping that he will be a man she can learn to love and finds instead that he is a brutal man who rapes her and beats her. While Gwynn brings order to her new household and decides whether to use her magic against her husband, she falls in love with one of her husband's knights, Sir Atremus. The story was an okay fantasy story, but a miserable romantic fantasy story. Gwynn was the most fleshed out of the characters, but she was too perfect to be truly interesting. I found myself more interested in Robin. Gwynn's husband was Bad, with only the hint of a backstory, not enough to make him more than a cardboard Bad Guy. Atremus was useless, which actually wasn't too bad, since I kept forgetting he existed. Gwynn may have fallen in love with him, but I didn't know enough about him to feel anything for him. Gwynn and Atremus apparently had long conversations that led to deepening feelings for each other, but Lackey just glossed over most of them. Since I know that in Lackey is capable of creating great romantic plots, this story was really disappointing and not good enough to be a keeper no matter what genre it's labeled as.Rachel Lee's &quot;Drusilla's Dream&quot; was the second story in the book. I enjoyed the characters, and this story could have been very good, but the way Lee chose to write it made it, in my opinion, the worst story in the book. Technically, most of the story takes place during Drusilla's night shift job, while she's typing data into her computer. As she types, she's on autopilot, daydreaming about a world where she is a princess on a quest to find the Key of Morgania. Details from her job work her way into her daydream, such as the janitor, who becomes a powerful wizard, and Miles, her supervisor at work and the Behemoth tamer in her dreams. Although reality and dreams get really mixed up, and there's evidence that Miles is aware of Drusilla's dreams, I had a hard time seeing her dreams as evidence that she and Miles were falling in love. Unlike Lackey's story, which didn't feel like a romance, this did, but, unfortunately, it was a badly written one. If the entire story had been set in Drusilla's world, without any hint that there was a real world, it would have been a good, but very odd, story. I don't mind odd, though.Catherine Asaro's &quot;Moonglow&quot; was the best of the three. Jarid is the heir to the throne until his parents are killed in an ambush. The entire kingdom believes he is dead, but he in reality he is still alive, deaf, mute, and blind. Iris, who believes she has no real magic, finds him. It's decided that Iris must marry Jarid, and much of the story covers how Jarid and Iris get to know one another. My explanation sounds ver cheesy, but I'm trying not to reveal too much. It's an excellent fantasy and romance, and I'm looking forward to the first book in this series. Asaro writes better romantic short fiction than many romance authors. I may keep the book just for this story. It's fascinating reading how Iris and Jarid fall in love even though Jarid can barely communicate and can't see or hear anything around him.Overall, it's a weak book, but, if you can get it cheap, I would recommend it just for the last story."},{"Title":"Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1","review":"&quot;Charmed Destinies&quot; is an interesting, but flawed, experiment. The three authors in question, Mercedes Lackey, Rachel Lee, and Catherine Asaro, do a workmanlike job exploring various aspects of the romantic fantasy genre.The &quot;lesser light&quot; of the group, Rachel Lee, was the most interesting author. Her story, &quot;Drusilla's Dream,&quot; was the best of the three by a wide margin. This was an unusual take on an urban fantasy, and I liked it very much. It was funny, interesting, and moving. There were a few very minor plotholes; for example, if Miles, her hero, had his eyes on Drusilla the whole time, the first time he sees her outside the shared daydream/computer storyline should be explained differently. Which is why this story doesn't get five stars; instead, it gets four. But a very strong four. And I'll be looking for more stuff from Ms. Lee.I'm already a regular reader of Ms. Lackey, and I enjoyed her story, &quot;Counting Crows.&quot; This was a period romance based in the medieval era of our Earth, and was nicely executed, even though in some respects, this was more a story about a brother and sister avoiding disaster than a romance; the romantic element was definitely secondary. But I liked Sir Atremus, and I enjoyed Gwynhwyfar's attraction to him. And the &quot;spin,&quot; where it took a long time for the two of them to hook up, was an interesting one. Three and a half stars for this story.I liked Ms. Asaro's premise for &quot;Moonglow.&quot; This was an altogether new fantasy world, and the idea was very good. I liked the shape-magic. However, the execution of this story left a lot to be desired. The dialect used for Iris was not consistently applied, and I thought the story's ending a bit rushed. In addition, the fact that major mages could be out in the open where no one could pick up how powerful they are doesn't make any sense; the other, lesser mages should be able to pick up the power, even if it's never used.That was a major plothole.In addition, Ms. Asaro has some very unusual and offputting word choices. For example, she uses the word &quot;coronate&quot; in the following fashion: &quot;We cannot coronate him tomorrow.&quot; Considering the rest is more or less in American idiomatic English, this threw me right out of the reader's trance.So, despite the very strong and engaging plot premise, the story fell flat because the characters didn't engage me very much, and the execution of the writing was flawed. Two stars at best for this story, only because I liked the character of the foster father, Stone.Overall: three and a half stars. Not bad at all, worth the money, and if the new Harlequin Luna line is much like this stuff, it should sell quite nicely.Barb Caffrey"},{"Title":"Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1","review":"I really liked this book, despite the fact that I normally can't stand anthologies. All three stories were well fleshed-out, and I found the world-building enthralling.Counting Crows: I actually bought the book for this story, since Lackey is the only author I knew. If you're reading it for the romance, it fails. On the other hand, the character development is wonderful (aside from the interaction in the &quot;romance&quot;), and the surroundings are vivid and compelling. Overall, I loved it.Drusilla's Dream: This is the only one that I disliked. Most of that is probably personal. I found it a bit too silly, and cliched (which it made fun of itself for). I also found it choppy, and it was occasionally hard to tell whether the characters were in the &quot;real&quot; world or in Drusilla's fantasy.Moonglow: I adored this story. Despite how short it was, I felt I really got to know the characters, even the secondary ones. The world building was very intricate, with great attention to detail. I found it occasionally frustrating when things were hinted-at, but never elaborated, but the world and the character's circumstances did a great job of backing up the romance. I'm looking forward to the sequel."},{"Title":"Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1","review":"I've been extremely excited for months about the new \\"Luna\\" series being put out by Harlequin Books starting in next year (luna-books.com which will be up January 2004) . Female fronted fantasy crossed with romance! Yes!The three short \\"romantic fantasy\\" novels offered here vary widely in tone and story and each has its own appeal:\\"Counting Crows\\" by Mercedes Lackey... If you love other fantasy works by this author, you won't be disappointed here. As an avid romance reader, however, this story fell far short for me. The story and characters are wonderfully and beautifully developed but I can't call a story truly romantic when we get to read about the heroine being raped (and passive or not, it's still rape) and beaten throughout the story but we never get any truly romantic scenes between our heroine and the man she loves. The interplay between the heroine and her knight is sweet and gentle but honestly, his passivity left me wanting to wring his neck. There doesn't need to be an overt sexual element for a love story to work but the way their relationship was developed left me feeling that they were quite platonic. Still, despite that it failed for me as a romance, the story is a deftly and intricately created work of fantasy that delivers as a magical medieval tale.\\"Drusilla's Dream\\" by Rachel Lee... A decidely humorous and quirky story of two characters who interact in real life and in their dreams. I'm unfamiliar with this author's other works so I don't know how comparable it is --but reading this definetly makes me want to check her out further. A light but very romantic and sweet read that will please romance lovers.\\"Moonglow\\" by Catherine Asaro... As a favorite author of mine, I couldn't wait to read this story. This work of fantasy is a change of pace from the more sci-fi flavor of her other books and I didn't know what to expect. But I was very pleased with the story and found it my favorite of three. I only wish it had been longer! The world she creates is vivid and beautiful but she doesn't scrimp on character development or relationship building between our two protagonists. She has always had a certain romance crossover appeal in her sci-fi books and it was nice to see that she could bring romance to the forefront of the story without losing any of the depth in the world she created for them to blossom in. I felt as this story truly exemplified what i believe \\"romantic fantasy\\" should be and can't wait to read the full length novel she has written for the Luna line in February 2004."},{"Title":"Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1","review":"Each of these three short stories were very good, and I had a hard time putting the book down! The first story in the book, &quot;Counting Crows&quot; by Mercedes Lackey, was the darkest of the three romances. Lady Gwynnhwyfar and her maid, Robin, travel to the borderlands to meet Gwynn's new husband - a man she has never met before in her life. Once Gwynn arrives, however, she discovers that Duke Bretagne is hardly the ideal husband - he is brutal, vicious, and disgusting. After cruelly raping her on their wedding night, Gwynn is determined to use her magical powers to better her situation. Meanwhile, her old childhood crush, Sir Atremus, lives in Clawcrag Keep as well, a knight who is now crippled thanks to Bretagne's blas&eacute; treatment of his knights. Lady Gwynn and Sir Atremus establish a quick friendship, but nothing can ever come of it - unless Gwynn's magical powers can truly change her life.I loved &quot;Counting Crows,&quot; even though it was a rather dark romance, not of the light and fluffy variety. Bretagne's treatment of Lady Gwynn is disgraceful, and more than once I almost set the book aside because I could no longer bear to see the heroine treated in such a way, while her love is in the same castle with her, knowing what she is going through, yet pretty much powerless to do anything about it. Whoever typed the descriptions on the back of the book did a horrible job - not only did they butcher Gwynnhwyfar's name (it was spelled Gwynhefar), but Sir Artemus is called &quot;Sir Elloran.&quot; There is no Sir Elloran in the book, and I kept wondering when Sir Elloran was going to make his appearance, meanwhile wondering why Sir Artemus was getting closer to Gwynn when she was supposed to fall in love with Elloran! It took me a while to figure this out, because I'm slow like that :) An excellent story, though, and probably quite true to life - I am sure there were a great many loveless marriages in medieval times.The next story is &quot;Drusilla's Dream&quot; by Rachel Lee. Every night Drusilla goes to the same boring job and secretly daydreams while she enters in boring data. This particular night, however, cute Miles Kennedy, her boss, keeps popping into her fantasy. Things aren't going the way Drusilla wants them to go in her fantasy, either - the hero in her story (Miles, of course!) never reacts quite in the way she would expect him to. What's really going on in Drusilla's dream? This story was a fun little story and definitely lightened the mood after reading the &quot;Counting Crows&quot; story. The characters were funny, realistic, and quite clever. This is a light, quirky romance, something that makes you feel good when you read it, but something you don't rememeber the details of once you've completed the story.The final story is &quot;Moonglow&quot; by Catherine Asaro. I loved this story as well! Iris Larkspur feels out of place learning how to use the magic her teacher believes is deep inside of her, but Iris seems to be unable to harness. It doesn't help matters that Chime, her classmate, is just about perfect, from her golden hair to her feet. Iris, in an amazing moment, however, discovers her power - and also discovers that the prince of her land, long thought dead, is actually alive. Once Prince Jarid is found, he must return to assume power of the kingdom, but he is blind, deaf, and mute. And since Iris is now the most powerful mage in the land, she must marry the Prince - and at the same time, try to heal his broken spirit.I really liked Iris and Jarid - both of them were outsiders, and yet there was such a bond between them, almost instantly. &quot;Moonglow&quot; was an interesting story, and I'm really looking forward to the next book by Catherine Asaro. Altogether, I liked all three of the stories, just in a different way. Each story appealed to me on a different level, and it's rare to find that in a book. I'll definitely be reading this book again!"},{"Title":"Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1","review":"others have detailed the gist of the three stories very well. My main thing I want to get across is that in the first story, Counting Crows by Mercedes Lackey, the heroine, is brutally RAPED by her husband, in shocking detail.I was not expecting that in a romance, and it ruined the entire book for me. If reading disturbing scenes like that would bother you, then I highly suggest you either skip this book or at least skip Miss Lackey's story."},{"Title":"Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1","review":"Counting Crows-Mercedes Lackey's first foray into the official romance genre is not up to her previous works' standard. The plot drags, I had difficulty connecting to the characters, and the romance reminded me more of one of the old 'courtly love' tales, with less oomph. Not her best work by any stretch of the imagination.Drusilla's Dream-Rachel Lee's premise is a good one but the novella's length did not allow for enough plot and character development. It was choppy and very hard to follow. Not up to her usual standards.Moon Glow-This is my first contact with Catherine Asaro's work but I am very impressed. The plot twists delightfully, I can relate with the characters, and no one is perfect. I will definetly be on the look out for more of her work."},{"Title":"Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1","review":"Charmed Destinies brings together three talented authors telling stories of romance set in rich, vibrant fantasy worlds. Okay, so two of the authors do this.The novel begins with \\"Counting Crows\\" a story by Mercedes Lackey. My absolute favorite author, Ms. Lackey doesn't disappoint with this unique tale of a magically talented heroine betrothed to a neighboring lord. I loved the heroine's resourcefulness, which turned what could be a fairly run of the mill plot into an engaging page-turning read. The hero of the tale, not the foreign lord by the way, comes across as a soft, engaging gentleman, and the twist which brings them together is masterful storytelling.Rachel Lee's story \\"Drusilla's Dream\\" takes place in a real life cube farm during the graveyard shift. While the story of a woman working at a drudgery job in order to support her dream (heck, I do this), is admirable, the actual story lacked imagination and skill. A shared daydream between her and a systems engineer a few floors above puts them both in a trite fantasy world, and although the heroine seemed quite well-rounded as a character, the hero fell flat. This story is by far the clunker of the three; however, the other two stories more than make up for this one's failings.The final story, \\"Moonglow\\" by Catherine Asaro, is so sweet and tender that it's an awesome story. I found my breath taken away by the relationship between Iris and Jarid. His disabilities are played with thoughtful insight. I found the characters, and their relationship to be most powerful, and the geometric based magic intriguing. This novella makes a stunning finale for this collection, and introduces us to a most wonderful world.All in all, this anthology makes an excellent introduction to the world of Luna fantasy novels, and is well worth the read, especially for fans of Asaro and Lackey."},{"Title":"Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1","review":"The three stories in this book are not very good. The starting point of the all three stories is good,but somehow never reach a point where you as the reader really care what's happening. The stories are supossed to be a mix of romance and fantasy. Mercedes Lackey's story never really makes it's self felt as either a romance or a fantasy story. The other two authors Rachel Lee and Catherine Asaro are new to me,I liked Asaro's story Moonglow best. It was more indepth and had characters you could really care about. All in all I would say read the book but do not get your hopes up to high.."},{"Title":"Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1","review":"I have to say that I liked the stories, but I've read far better by all of the authors. Counting Crows was indeed grim and the plot points were a bit too rough--I often found myself wondering about the backstory. I found myself skipping over most of the Rachel Lee story--the ending was very predictable. Of the three I liked the Catherine Asano story the best, and I would like to see more stories in this universe."},{"Title":"Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1","review":"I did enjoy Lackey's attention to detail and her story was very good, with a nice surprising twist tucked away. &quot;Drusilla's Gift&quot; irritated me - too much shifting around, although I did like both main characters. I was also never really clear on what was going on. I normally enjoy Catherine Asaro's writing, but found this story totally predictable and Iris' dialect more than a bit annoying. Another annoyance goes to the publisher - please make sure that the names are RIGHT on the book jacket - that is an apprentice editor's mistake!Three stars for the interesting Mercedes Lackey, with some credit given to interesting world-building from Catherine Asaro."},{"Title":"Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1","review":"I actually really liked this collection. I think my least favorite was Drusilla's Dream, with Counting Crows after, but all the stories were great, engaging, and a really nice length. Each was original and touching with good characters."},{"Title":"Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1","review":"As a Mercedes Lackey fan (who's never read any of her series works), I picked up this book with the hope of finding some new author to read.The Lackey story is quite good - an Arthurian-type tale which has a stronger Gwen than most.The Asaro story is also quite good, though I wished that it could be longer. The plot and characters needed more time to be fully developed.The Lee story is wasted space. I had to brush my teeth after reading it; it was such tripe that it left a bad taste in my mouth. The story is completely implausible, even given my proclivity for alternative fiction. The characters are almost one-dimensional, though there is one twist that was unexpected. Mostly, it was a waste of my valuable reading time.That story pulled down the collection, for me. But the other two are worth reading. From the library.(*)>"},{"Title":"Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1","review":"The first story, \\"counting crows' was a rather poor romance. I couldn't feel any chemistry and saw plenty of chances for the author to build the tension. Also, the main character, Gwynn was too accepting of her harsh treatment. I couldn't believe she would be so placid. So that really brought down the realism of this story. I hated that actually, Lackey failed miserably in this respect.yet overall I like counting crows, and the rhymn behind it.'Drusilla's dream' fell short of what it could have been. The fantasy was too symplistic and childlike for me to truly be mesmerised by the tale. Though I love the technique of having the tale a 'daydream' of Druse, it reminded me of myself when someone disturbs me when I am daydreaming or reading... i tend to get bitchy like Drusie here, so I could relate to that.The creatures and wizard seemed like some ridiculous kid's tv show, though i did see the real life connections the kolkoul(sp?) was a vending machione and the bohemoth was rather like a computer. the characters were simplistic and without the depth i would've liked.Overall, the romance needed fleshing out and the fantasy is pleading for less cliche and more originality. I did enjoy the real life romance much more than the fantasy, though I would imagine Druse blushing due to the fact of what happened IN the fantasy... I would've.Far the best was Asaro's \\"moonglow\\" i LOVED this story, and I felt the frustration, hate, love, vulnerability and tenderness along with the characters. Though I would have liked more on Jarid's guilt and what that felt like.I was left with a sense of incompleteness, the characters were amazing and I really hope the Charmed Sphere had more on Jarid and Iris- as I really hated Mullen and Chime.This book is worth buying for the last story, Asaro has outdone herself here. it would be hard to write a story with a man without sight, hearing and a voice and her work here added another dimension.Overall, I luvvvved it! Get it, if you are anything like me(a romance/fantasy buff) you will enjoy all, even if the first two have deep flaws in the story line and characters."},{"Title":"Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1","review":"Mercedes Lackey wrote a good story with a strong female lead. Although times were tough for the heroine, she prevails in the end (even if the ending seemed a bit rushed).I had never read anything by Rachel Lee before. The story idea was good, but I really didn't like her writing style...it seemed very simplistic. I found myself laughing out loud at some parts, but not because of the humor...because of the absurdity.Catherine Asaro's tale was very good. It was a nice, fluffy fantasy with good characters. If you like this tale, read The Charmed Sphere which takes the story even further.Overall, a good read. I wouldn't spend $20 on the book, but for $5.85 its not a bad deal."},{"Title":"Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1","review":"In this foray into fantasy-romance, I was mostly disappointed. Counting Crows by Mercedes Lackey is marginally good but more a tale of spousal abuse than romance. The second story, \\"Drusilla's Dream\\", by Rachel Lee isn't even worth reading. Too convoluted to make any sense and too boring to make you care enough to overlook it.But the last story by Catherine Asaro (Moonglow) is compelling and captivating. The only detractor is that it felt like it should have been a novel of it's own. I was left feeling the incompleteness. I almost didn't get through Lee's story to get to read Asaro's, but I'm glad I plunged through since the third story definitely makes the book."},{"Title":"Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1","review":"I'm a real Mercedes Lackey fan, but I was really disappointed in her medieval-like short story here. What I hated the most was that the heroine was continually abused/raped/submitted to her disgusting husband's attentions, for a long time, before deciding to fix the problem with magic. For a romance, having your heroine sleeping with/being raped/abused by her boor of a husband, over and over again, while the hero lives in the same castle, is terrible.Catherine Asaro's story is interesting, especially since the prince is so powerful that he's right off the rainbow chart. However, I'm a bit disappointed by the simplicity of the magic system, which is based on shapes and colours. The characters focus their magic by using 3D shapes. The more sides on the shape, the more advanced the magic. So spheres, with their infinite sides are the most advanced. The colours are based on the rainbow, with the darker colours for more advanced magic levels. The magic system just seemed too much like a kid's book of shapes and colours to be mysterious or complicated. I hear she's releasing the sequel to this story, &quot;The Charmed Sphere&quot; next month through Harlequin's new fanatasy line, LUNA.Rachel Lee's story was rather boring. An office worker is sucked into a fantasy world, where a co-worker is also using. The way it was written was too confusing, trying to keep track of where they were in each reality, and which reality they were interacting in. Also, the heroine was pretty silly.I won't be keeping this book. I'll be selling it to the used book store instead."},{"Title":"Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1","review":"\\"Counting Crows\\" by Mercedes Lackey. Lady Gwynhefar has to wed the King's choice abusive Lord Bretagne or her odious neighbor Baron Arghus though both are abominations.

When Bretagne accepts a seditious deal and Atremus is dying, Gwyn acts to save the kingdom and her beloved with a spell, but what will it cost the witch?\\"Drusilla's Dream\\" by Rachel Lee. Drusilla dreams of painting full time, but to eat she works in data entry at GalaxyCom.

In Aronsdale, the most powerful magic practitioners wed the royals. Iris knows she will marry Prince Jarid. Though a spell cast to save his life left him blind, deaf, and unable to speak, Jarid and Iris communicate through the heart. She risks all to perform a spell for her beloved to gain the senses he lost, but the price is that those who killed his mother will murder him and his beloved.These three great romantic fantasy novellas make their respective realms and key cast members seem authentic.

Readers will marvel at the talent whom provide a tremendous taste of what to expect from Silhouette's new imprint Luna.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1","review":"This is a collection of three stories, all of which are supposed to fall under the category romantic fantasy, which is only partly true. The quality of the stories varies strongly, which is why I wouldn't give it more stars combined.Mercedes Lackey: Counting CrowsLady Gwynhefar has to marry a man she doesn't even know because this alliance will protect her sick father and his lands from a power-hungry neighbour. But her husband is brutal and uncaring. He beats her and openly carries on with his mistress. The only way out and her only hope for a future with the knight she truly loves is Gwnyhefar's witchcraft - but if she is caught, she will be executed ...This is an intense story about the situation women were in during the Middle Ages. Due to its realism in this respect, the story is often highly unpleasant and painful to read (rapes, beatings, humiliation, ...), but also very well written. The witch solution took away from the strength of the realistic writing, the end result being 4 stars.Rachel Lee: Drusilla's DreamDrusilla works the nightshift typing meaningless data into a computer, all the while daydreaming about a fantasy world where she is a princess out to save her realm. What she doesn't know is that her fantasies mix with those of the computer genius upstairs who actually wants to be a writer of romantic fantasy. Will their romance continue into reality?This is the weakest of the three stories - and it didn't need to be! The story is so boring that even the heroine asks herself why she can't have more interesting fantasies (!), the computer, the softdrink machine etc. are too obviously turned into silly creatures of her fantasy world, and so on. The love scenes are beautiful and the one genuine fantasy scene, an extract from the novel the computer specialist is writing, is great. If Rachel Lee had written the whole story in that style, it would have been a really good story. As it is, I found it boring and often silly. Therefore 2 stars.Catherine Asaro: MoonglowIt should be mentioned that this story is the beginning of a series that continues with the novels 'The Charmed Sphere', 'The Misted Cliffs' and 'The Dawn Star'. It can be read on its own, but it's important for the rest of the series.In the fantasy kingdom where this story is set, the king is a military leader and he always marries the woman who is the most powerful mage in the land. She heals people and helps protect the kingdom with her magic. But things go terrible wrong one day when the carriage of the heir to the throne is attacked by robbers. He and his wife die and their little son becomes deaf, blind and mute due to a spell gone wrong. Nobody knows he survived and he grows up in the wilderness far away from court. Years later the king dies and a young mage, a girl who never expected to become a powerful magician, accidentally discovers that the prince still lives. Her difficult task now is to marry a young man she hardly knows, win his trust and heal him so that they can protect and rule the kingdom together...This was a really intensive story with well-written characters and a beautifully developed world in which mages work their magic through shapes and their life force. I really enjoyed it and would give it 4.5 stars. It's not perfect, but really good."},{"Title":"Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1","review":"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesCounting Crows by Mercedes Lackey starts out this collection of fantasy tales. Gwynnhwyfar has just been wed via a \\"glove\\" marriage to a man she doesn't want. Unfortunately, it is the only way to protect her father from a greedy neighboring landowner, and save herself from being forced to marry that same man. Upon arrival at the faraway land of her new husband, she finds her marriage to be far from a dream come true. With only her trusted maidservant and an old friend in service to her new husband, whom she loved with all the passion of her girlhood, she sets out to make the best of a bad situation, with a lot of magical help.This story is a look marriage in olden times and how little power women had but with the twist of powerful magic added to it. Gwynn is a proud young woman, brave and loving, who will do anything to protect those she loves, even if it means sacrificing herself. The twist at the end of the story will surprise readers, as it is quite unexpected. One especially interesting aspect of this story is that the beginning and ending of the story are told from the point of view of a crow that just happens to be there. Reading about the humans from the perspective of a scavenger bird, puts a different spin on the tale.Next up in this trio of stories is Drusilla's Dream by Rachel Lee. Drusilla Morgan is a data entry tech on graveyard shift at GalaxyCom who passes the monotony at work by spinning daydreams in her mind. In this particular fantasy she is a princess on a quest to find a magical key that will save her kingdom from destruction. Along the way she meets up with an animal tamer who surprisingly enough resembles Miles Kennedy, night time computer security, who is responsible for keeping all the computers running smoothly. What happens when these two get together, even if only in her imagination? Or is it only a dream?This reviewer feels this was the weakest story of the collection. The premise is interesting, having the entire story take place as a daydream, with occasional interruptions from real life. Unfortunately it fell flat. Some parts of the daydream came across as being clich&eacute;d, with a little bit of everything one would expect in a fantasy all just thrown in to add to the story. Some parts were quite original though, such as the master of the rivers, which add something extra to the novella. Also, the ending was unique, in how our hero and heroine are brought together. Yet it just didn't quite come together for this particular reader.The final story in this book is Moonglow by Catherine Asaro. Iris Larkspur is a young mountain girl who was born with powerful mage abilities. When Della No-Cozen, Head Mage to the Royal family, discovers her no one expected what was to come. Iris has not been able to grasp how to cast spells for her power comes from a different place than most mages. Once she finds the key to her magic, her life is irrevocably changed when she is betrothed to the heir to the throne of Aronsdale. However, Prince Jarid is a tortured young man, captured in a prison of his own making as a result of something he did as a young boy. Will Iris' magic... and their love... be enough to free him once and for all?This story takes place in the same world as Ms. Asaro's The Charmed Sphere. What is especially enjoyable is that this story actually takes place at the same time as some key parts of the full-length novel. Those who have read both stories will enjoy seeing some of the exact same scenes through different points of view. This story in itself is not especially deep. Had this reviewer not already read the other book, Moonglow would likely have left her feeling unfulfilled. Iris and Jarid are fascinating characters, flawed in many ways and having doubts in themselves. It was enjoyable to get a more in depth look at them. The magical land of Aronsdale is a wonderful place to visit, with an extremely distinctive kind of power.If readers are looking for a brief escape from reality and an adventure in another world, these stories will fit the bill quite nicely. Each one is different, written in different styles, but all sharing the common factor of magic in another land.Kelley A. Hartsell, August 2005.

THe Luna line will feature fantasy with women and romance as main themes.I enjoyed all 3 stories- I do agree that the Catherine Asaro tale was the best. The shape mages and their powers and the world they live in is one I wish to read more about.The Mercedes Lackey tale was brutal but I believe honest in its depiction of life for a mere woman in a loveless marriage of convenience. The mystical/magical happenings that changed the heroine's destiny were nicely written and unfolded in a satisfying manner.The psychic connection between our bored out of her gourd data entry clerk and her hunky sys admin in the Rachel Lee tale was great! This was the first romance I have ever read that described the utter mind numbing boredom of life in cube land---- think Dilbert's world and how a woman with a lot of imagination could let her mind wander and explore outside of her body into some psychic cosmic bandwith where she shares her fantasies with another......I look forward to more by all of these ladies!I also recommend this years Harlequin Halloween anthology- When Darkness Falls. It too has strong supernatural themed romance- with an intro of Fantasy great Tanith Lee to the romance genre!"},{"Title":"Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1","review":"Before this anthology, I'd never read any works by these authors. Catherine Asaro's Moonglow was my favorite of the three stories, with a hero and heroine I could truly root for, a gentle but sensual love story, and a world I enjoyed inhabiting for a short while. I look forward to reading more of Catherine Asaro's work, and will definitely be reading The Charmed Sphere when it is released by Luna."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"I have nearly ten anatomy books and this is the one I grab for most when I need to solve an anatomy problem while drawing or sketching.For the most part, Bridgman first simplifies complex anatomy problems into simple structures before exploring the muscle patterns into more complex detail. This allows the artist to see the particular anatomy problem as a proportional mass rather than a complex network of muscle fibers. For me, this makes the human anatomy much more accessible.For instance, he will take the torso and break it down into simple objects like cubes, triangles, and planes, illustrate them in their proper proportions, and then move forward into to more precise detail.I find this book not just educational but as a great reference as well."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"Mainly for intermediate-level artists- it's actually *GREAT* for enthusiastic beginners. It has a little bit of *everything* depicting anatomy construction from memory. It's also great for general improvement; a few tips & tricks- an *excellent* reference for all working artists.This is the book that really turned me on to the genius that is Bridgman. At first glance it may not be immediately impressive, but flip to page 167 for a quick look at his cubed-construction of the head. It's Bridgman's brief but effective treatment of cube-construction in this book that really, really impresses me. Many books *mention* cube-construction for heads; many books show a brief picture or two. But not many show it with the precision & detail that Bridgman conveys in just a few short pages. It deals with figure construction mainly in its parts- for full-figure movement, check out Bridgman's Complete Guide, or his less overwhelming Bridgman's Life Drawing. Constructive Anatomy begins with hands, which in my opinion is the weakest part of the book. (Bridgman's 100 Hands is much, much better.) Arms are next and they're easily among Bridgman's best, although not all the drawings are crystal clear. Many of the BEST drawings in Bridgman's Complete Guide are taken from this book, and his depiction of arms here is definitely among them. The shoulder & neck briefly follow, and are above average in their depiction. Then it's time for that excellent section: the cubed-construction of the head. It's only a FEW pages- I don't want to oversell it. But in my opinion at least, it's worth the price of the book. Individual features follow: eyes, nose, ears and mouth are simply & accurately treated. This is a more *in-depth* book than Heads, Features and Faces- which is mainly a simple introduction to the basics. Maybe the BEST section in Constructive Anatomy involves the Torso. He describes more in a few pages than most books ever do- and with a precision & beauty that few seem to match. The pelvis, legs, knees, feet & toes finish this truly excellent work. If anyone's overwhelmed by Bridgman's Complete Guide, Constructive Anatomy is a simple & effective choice to make- Highly Recommended!In short- Along with Book of a Hundred Hands and Bridgman's Complete Guide, Constructive Anatomy is currently in my Top 3 by Bridgman."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"One of the few books that I constantly refer to in figure drawing. Although the content was written way back in 1920, the concepts are still as valid then, as now.The simple pencilled illustrations provide easy guidelines as to where one muscle stops and another begins. This enables one to draw a muscly figure with a few lines and shapes to show bulk and depth, especially with comic book illustration.Finally, the price is perhaps as great a drawing factor as the content. Some comic book artists swear by Geoge Bridgman's books. You might also want to try some publications by Jack Hamm."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"Lemme tell you something right now. This is one sweet little book! It gets two stars right off the bat because it's really cheap(unlike Hogarth). For a student who doesn't have an income, this really helps out. When I bought this this book, I thought I knew a little about human anatomy. Well, put it this way, I was wrong! This book is PACKED with anatomy! Thanks to it, I've been getting alot better. Now I'm starting to do a real study of this book, and I don't think I'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"this book is by far the best on figure drawing that i've seen. bridgman is an absolute master of the human form, and he breaks everything down into simple shapes to help even the novice. his realistic and beautiful drawings are anatomically accurate, and quite nice to look at! buy any of bridgman's books, including the brilliant &quot;book of 100 hands&quot;, and you'll be treating yourself to an extremely inexpensive lesson from a true master."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"In fact, I can safely say that this really is the most important book on artistic anatomy one can learn from. Many seem put off at first glance (I know I was) and say one of or all of the following...1 - \\"the drawings look sketchy sometimes\\"2 - \\"the anatomy seems exaggerated\\"3 - \\"the look might \\"cramp\\" your style\\"4 - \\"will copying the drawings really teach me anatomy?\\"Well, after having gone through the book once, reading how others go through it, working on form & exercises, and since I'm going through it again, I'll address these points.----------1: The \\"sketchiness\\" isn't there for the sake of being rough. Those lines & curves are there to show the rhythm and flow of how this part leads into that part. Keep in mind that not every drawing in the book is like this.2: The anatomy isn't really exaggerated. Consider that Bridgman's approach is on how muscles wedge into one another. If you study form, can analyze it, and can combine verious forms with overlapping, and then look at the drawings, things will click. The forms of various muscles stand out to show how the wedging works and sometimes the muscles happen to look flexed, that's all.3: This was an odd comment I read at [...], and there's no way that going through this will \\"cramp your style.\\" If this is the first anatomy book you're considering, and if you've never gone through a drawing book at all, then you don't have a style. Don't worry about finding your style if you're just starting out - take the time to learn foundational principles & techniques, and make that your goal.4: I imagine that alot of people would think of copying like this: \\"Draw this line, put that curve right here, draw the line next to it, now move the pencil over here and draw this curve, repeat.\\" Don't do that. It wasn't until I had a better grasp on form & the \\"classical approach\\" when things began to click. Once you learn the fundamentals of rhythm & gesture, observing angles, form, and \\"sculpting in the paper,\\" use that understanding to analyze not only subjects for life drawing, but also drawings. As Glenn Vilppu says, \\"Don't copy the model, analyze it.\\"---With that said, this book will show you anatomy as a set of forms, how they look from different views & actions, and, overall, how everything fits together. It's the perfect book to pull out once you can draw those geometric skeletons. Take your time and understand the text as Bridgman will explain what you're looking at. Analyzing the drawings is one thing, but the text does mention a lot of aspects on how the anatomy works.There is one flaw in the book, and that is the layout. I found myself having to flip between a few pages to look at the right drawing with the appropriately labeled parts so I could flip back to the text and better understand the stuff. This got a little frustrating but if you're patient, you can pick up alot of things from this. Like I said, take your time."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"I have several Bridgman books, and I absolutely love him. I was very exited about this book, and as they say \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\" I did,because the cover is so nice,in fact it is the only good thing about this book, the jacket. I thought the reprint was going to be awesome, like the Dover publication books. When I got it, the reproductions are super faded, can't read the script either, I suggest getting Bridgman books from Dover publications."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"As an art student, I've perused quite a few instructive anatomy books. I was suggested Bridgman by a teacher who ranked him as simply the best. A lot of the reviews here seem to focus on quality of reproduction, so I'm going to focus on the original product. By the way, get Dover.Pros:As stated universally. Bridgman runs through the all the major body masses ranging from something as large as the trunk, to something as minuscule as the septum of the nose.He shows the human form in various stages of muscular undress, ranging from skeletal to fully skinned. There are often numerous angles and perspectives from which to study as well, and proportions are helpfully laid out in block form for the larger masses.Speaking plainly, I haven't found a book that does better than what Constructive Anatomy does.Cons:Formatting is a little awkward. Text that pertains to a whole section appears on the first page of the section, and the following pages are wordless. This makes it mildly frustrating to follow the words of wisdom that Bridgman is no doubt divulging. Which brings me to another drawback.The vocabulary matches the book's age. Expect a great deal of Latin nouns. Despite having a pretty firm grasp on bone and muscle names, I found myself lost on numerous occasions. Consider the following text, describing the armpit:\\"Its rear wall is deeper, since the latissimus attaches farther down the back; thicker because made of two muscles (latissimus and teres major), and rounder because its fibres turn on themselves before attaching to the arm bone.\\"This would be an extremely minor annoyance if not for the complaint mentioned above. Much of the text is disassociated with the illustrations, forcing you to either flip back and forth, or try to follow along in your head.My final con is what irked me the most. There is no female anatomy to speak of, and neither does Bridgman speak of it. For an anatomy book, this is a severe drawback. I understand the age of the book may have made such depictions taboo, but we're talking about half the population here. Bridgman's men are patently bony. Not as a synonym for thin, as they are exceedingly thick, but his bones have a tendency to protrude and take the shape of geometric objects. This is of course very beneficial to students, and his drawings are pure joy to duplicate, but you can imagine how hard it is to transfer this knowledge to the neglected sex. Anatomy books have a tendency to prioritize subjects approximately in the following order: the Male figure, the Female figure, the effects of age and finally, the child. Bridgman focuses solely on the first of the queue.My conclusion is thus: Bridgman's Constructive Anatomy is an excellent manual for building men of young to middle age. The description applied to it most often seems to be \\"it's a great starter book.\\" I would contend that the male and female figures are so different as that one cannot \\"start\\" with a male figure, and end up with a female figure. Consequently, Constructive Anatomy is not a great starter book for understanding the female structure.Despite the cons I have stated, I have given the book 4/5 stars. Why? Because I knew of these drawbacks before I purchased the books, and purchased it anyway. The score is not some form of self-punishment for making a mistake, but a rating of the material I knew and wanted. I only list the cons so that future purchasers may know them as well, and make a more evaluative judgment."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"this book is a tragedy. great book, but publication quality is zero.don't buy a reprint.get the original."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"This still remains as one of the top anatomy books I use the most. I actually like the fact the figures and illustrations are not super detailed and more loose sketches. A beginner might find this frustrating, but as a person that is trying to develop my own style I find it more important you get a loose interpretation and fill in your own details and personal touch. Otherwise you'll just have clone artists of these anatomy books.The other reason I love this book is the price. It's small size makes it very easy to carry around too.I feel I've improved tenfold since I've purchased this book on making my anatomy look more real."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"This book has been very useful as a reference for me personally and for the students that I teach. The subject matter is illustrated in a way that makes it possible to use for all levels without offending anyone"},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"Although a little too complicated for the real beginner artist, this book has a wealth of information for the intermediate to advanced artist. At times the text seems a little old fashioned and obscure and is difficult to understand what he is getting at but most of the drawings are self explanatory and excellent teaching illustrations. Recommended."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"If your a Bridgeman fan or just want to learn how to draw anatomy this book is worth the price. I have been drawing longer than I can remeber but just recently decided I wanted to improve my art skills mainly my ability to draw the human body. So I started buying art books on human anatomy and this by far is my favorite one and heres why, its at a comfortable size so you can easily take it with you, it has close to 500 illustrations, and his style is helpful to me most when I'm drawing from memory. For its price I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"This book is filled with pictures. George B. Bridgeman did a great job with this book. The reason I gave only 4 starts is beacuse it was kinda hard to understand. I mean I spent 20 min. figuring out the introduction and still dont full understantd it. But farther into the book it was easier to understand but still difficult. I am only 13 and this book may have been written for college students or adults so that may have been one reason I dont unerstand so well but once you start picking it up you learn a lot of stuff about the human anatomy. THIS IS GREAT FOR COMIC BOOK ARTISTS, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER ARTIST."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"I'm a Bridgman fan, but his complete guide to drawing from life is available used for $7.50. and sells new for $12.21. This is less than an introduction to the genius that is Bridgman, get the big book."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"&quot;Constructive Anatomy&quot; is unique in that George presents the viewer a 'real world' application of the muscles, by telling you what each muscle does.I'd be wrong in saying this book is a one-stop source for learning to draw people. Let's face it anatomy is tough and artists can use all the help they can get! What this book offers that other's don't is different views and applications of perceiving the limbs, muscles, bones, joints, etc., of the body. For the price it's listed out, ya can't go wrong!"},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"If you are learning anatomy, this is a great resource. Great explanations, illustrations and easy to follow suggestions for creating your own realistic drawings."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"Its a great beginner drawing book for the aspiring artist that need to work on the human figure and constructive movement"},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"This book has already helped me figure out how the body works when drawing, and I have a better understanding of the human anatomy"},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"This book is an incredibly helpful reference book. It totally helps art students to become better at the anatomical study and to understand the differences of each part of the body. I have owned so much many others anatomy books and this is by far the best one. I will always go back to Bridgman."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"I love George Bridgman works, so I decided that I should get a book just so I can look at it all the time in physical time instead of elsewhere. I did not expect it to be so small, but I think it was because all the paper copies my instructors give me is a large piece of paper. None the less, I think this book is a helpful anatomy book, since it explains what the artist needs to know and is good for the basic review of muscles. Bridgman does a good job of breaking things down and making it easy to see the underlying structure. What I like about Bridgman is the use of exaggerated muscle, it helps to see better and it is not complicated."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"Highly essential to any serious and commercial artist.I am a working comic artist who uses this all of the time as a learning and reference tool.If you aren't serious about improving your anatomy drawing skills then go buy something else."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"This is a good quick reference guide and is easy to read as is all of Bridgman's books. The Complete Guide to Drawing From Life is more indepth and might be better if you want a little more explaination."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"This book is a priceless reference for *anyone* who has to, or wants to, draw proper anatomy. G. Bridgman's methods are timeless. This guy taught many of the giants of the Golden Age of Illustration. If nothing else, having it in your office library will give you credibility."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"I was dissappointed in this product..it is not a copy of the original book..just a facsimile with less information..very incomplete..company didn't tell me..it was not worth the $20.00 it cost (including shipping).

No one mentioned that most of the pages are dedicated to the anatomy of men, however I am interested in the female anatomy, so, these books did not work for me."},{"Title":"Constructive Anatomy","review":"I expected more from this book based on the reviews that I read before buying it. Although it has some good information about what specific muscles jobs are, the illustrations are not clear enough for good understanding. As an artist specifically working with the human form I find this book very mickey mousey and incomplete. If you already have all the books ever created on human anatomy that are needed to put together the information that is required to have a comprehensive knowledge on how the human body is constructed and moves then get this to finish your collection, but if you are looking for a clear understanding and accurate information on human anatomy for the artist look elswhere."},{"Title":"The Unforsaken Hero","review":"I read Hiero's Journey a few years back, and just had the luck to find this book a few days ago. Now, I learn there's no third book. Not a good thing. I truly enjoyed the first two books. I became immersed in Hiero's world. The text was riveting and concise, and drew me in with ease. I'll recommend this book to lots of people, regardless of the lack of a sequel."},{"Title":"The Unforsaken Hero","review":"This book is the sequel to Hiero's Journey (Also a 10). I gave it a 10 because the author allows us to walk in Hiero's world and through his writing it seems the world is very realistic. I enjoy good solid works of the imagination that allow the reader to enjoy another view of how the future just might turn out. I have read well over 500 SF - Fantasy books and count these darn near the top. For years I too looked for a third in this series. I think the publishers are spending too much time pursuing authors who write books quickly and not enough time pursuing those quality authors who take their time creating a world for their characters to come to life."},{"Title":"The Unforsaken Hero","review":"Well, Im adding to the list of folks who are screaming &quot;Where is the third book? ARRGH!&quot; I have done some searching on the internet, and with some book publishers, to no avail. It seem that Mr. Lanier is still alive, but not writing, as near as I can tell. What to do? Run over him with a Morse? Just a thought."},{"Title":"The Unforsaken Hero","review":"Both Hiero novels are outstanding works, and, like everyone else here, I'd like to see #3.

Dozens of bookstores and libraries, and finally, through the wonders of the Web and amazon.com, I got an out of print copy of Hiero's Journey and the Unforsaken Hiero. I suspect that Mr. Lanier, unfortunately, is no longer with us, which will leave everyone who has enjoyed his wonderful works wondering what might have been. If I am wrong about Mr. Lanier, or the fact that there are no Hiero sequels, please do correct me."},{"Title":"The Unforsaken Hero","review":"I met Mr. Lanier in 1984 at a book signing in Frederick, Maryland. Shortly after meeting him I heard that he was working on the third Hiero book and had it written in his mind; however, he suffered something that may have bee a stroke, and the memory of this unwritten book was lost to him. I heard that he was trying to reconstruct the book, but I do not know if he was able to or even if he is still alive. Regardless, we owe Mr. Lanier a debt of gratitude, not only for Hiero, but more importantly, for a book we all know as a classic in the genre. Frank Herbert brought a manuscript to Sterling Lanier after being turned down by virtually every other publisher. By his own account (one that I have not verified, so there is your caveat), Mr. Lanier was, at the time, an editor for Chilton, and he had the intelligence and foresight to publish this book titled &quot;Dune&quot;. Thank you Mr. Lanier, wherever you are!"},{"Title":"The Unforsaken Hero","review":"Okay, I have read the first two books as well, and I would like to add my name to the list of people begging for Sterling Lanier to come out with more books in the series-- these are among my FAVORITE sci-fi books EVER, and going from the amount of it I read that probably says something. However, I do have one nagging suspicion; is Sterling Lanier dead or something? I would hate to think so, but how else could he have left this series where it currently is? Again, I love these books and I hope he is out there, writing more. Does anybody have any info?"},{"Title":"The Unforsaken Hero","review":"I originally read &quot;Hieros Journey&quot;, and &quot;The Unforsaken Hiero&quot; years ago and enjoyed them so much that I kept them safely tucked away to reread again.

LUCHARE!!"},{"Title":"The Unforsaken Hero","review":"Both Hiero novels have been favorites of mine since 1983, when their reprints magically appeared on my local bookstore shelf. I recently re-read both novels, and after 15 years, their intense post-apocalyptic world still fascinates me. I was disappointed to hear that there was never a third, since The Unforsaken Hiero closes on such a clifhanger. These novels are a fascinating blend of fantasy and science fiction, crafting a tense and fast-moving story that never disappoints. When I sat down with these two books last week, it took me a weekend to read through them both, and they were as exciting as I remember. I highly recommend these two books to anyone, assuming you can lay your hands on them!"},{"Title":"The Unforsaken Hero","review":"_The Unforsaken Hiero_ (1983) is the sequel to _Hiero's Journey_ (1973). Early in the novel, Hiero Desteen, now a prince by marriage, is kidnapped from the state of D'Alway and has his telepathic powers destroyed by drugs. He escapes assasination by a fluke of luck and begins another journey westward and then northward, without friends, weapons, or extrasensory powers.Many of the flaws in the ecological background of _Hiero's Journey_ that I complained about in another essay have been skillfully avoided in _The Unforsaken Hiero_. This is not to say that Lanier has planned a detailed ecology with rigorous care; but he avoids any glaring errors, which is all that is really required for an adventure novel. He does this in several ways. First, he gives attention to herbiverous animals in the story, particularly in an account of Hiero's fight for survival across a desert and a prairie. Second, he gives more attention to fauna of a non-monsterous nature in his setting, which makes the occasional fantastic creature seem more realistic. And third, he gives more attention to details concerning how his creatures survive. For example, _The Unforsaken Hiero_ features another gigantic underwater creature. But this time, Lanier takes care to show how the creature captures its prey and how it has survived for its long lifespan. These improvements in the background of the novel make it superior to _Hiero's Journey_.Perhaps the weakest aspect of the novel are the characters. They tend to be either bluff, hearty, courageous warriors on the side of good-- or foul, deceptive traitors on the side of evil. You can tell the latter by their eyes: \\"The face was no longer that of the harassed functionary, but something older and colder, the eyes gleaming with mockery and triumph\\" (24)... \\"It was the face of Amiable Aeo, and from the young eyes came the same blaze of pure evil\\" (ibid)... \\"At the sight of those faces, a child would have screamed in horror. The eyes were dead, gray pools of nothingness, in which there glowed a baleful fire\\" (62)... \\"Behind him, eyes glared in impotent rage from the narrow slit of a window\\" (166)... \\"The gelid eyes glowed with a light that came from the Ultimate Pit\\" (194). Other characteristics of the Unclean are voices that are cold and icy and mental patterns that are foul and filthy. One wonders how the villains could fool anyone enough to betray them or to achieve the power they wield.I confess to a sneaking fondness for this novel. It's a passable adventure tale competently told, and it is great fun straight through. But there is a simplicity in its theme and characterization that prevents me from rating it as a classic or of classical quality."},{"Title":"The Unforsaken Hero","review":"I first read &quot;Hiero's Journey&quot; back in '79. My parents gave each of us kids a reading project to finish prior to the end of summer vacation. Then in '83 my dad sent me the hard back &quot;Unforsaken Hiero&quot; to read after he finished it. I have been waiting since then for the third installment. Mr. Lanier, if you care one wit about the sanity of your fans, please, PLEASE, hurry and finish the story. You can't just leave us hanging like this!!The heroic Hiero; lovely and brave Luchare; placid Gorm; loyal Klootz; the aged and witty Brother Aldo; the fiery Abbot Demero; the seafaring Captain Gimp, and the curious and powerful Solitaire are all waiting for us in the wonderful world you created. Standing stalwartly by their sides are the fellow Per's, the hulking Edard Maluin and humble archer Cart Sagenay; the coldly efficient Mantan twins, Geor and Reyn; and the swift and proud Children of the Wind.&quot;Unforsaken Hiero&quot; is proof that a sequel can be as wonderful and original as the first story. Hiero is again put through his paces as he learns the Unclean has left him for dead, stranded out in the radiation blighted desert. Worse, they stripped him of the weapon they fear most: his hard won and powerful mental abilities. Now he must survive not only the harsh heat and deadly radiation, but he must also face the viscious and cunning creatures spawned by the nuclear holocaust 5,000 years past known as The Death. Little does he know that his trek of survival is really a subtle mental lure lain by a powerful mind.Whatta story, Mr. Lanier. Come back to us."},{"Title":"The Unforsaken Hero","review":"I first read this book about ten years ago and the MOST delightful Hiero's Journey a short time before that. There is no doubt we are all in agreement that a third book would be welcomed with open arms. Hiero's Journey and the just as wonderful Unforsaken Hiero rank in the top 3 of my favorite books of all time. My mother introduced me to these books and I would love to be able to share them with others but that's not an easy thing since they are so hard to find (I can't trust them with just anybody). I've never had any luck finding another copy of either, but I'm still looking. The ones I've read belong to my mother and I'd really like a copy of both for myself. Aside from that, hers are so old and well read that they are falling apart. So, if the people or persons with the publishing rights to these two books are listening, please republish these books ! These are the kind of books we want to be able to share with others and pass down to future generations. These books should never be forgotten and they are so hard to find now that in five years they will be all but extinct (they practically are now). How completely sad that would be. Mr. Lanier, if you are out there, we implore you to write number three. If you are not able to, maybe you could collaborate on the project with someone who can. I'm sure any of the top novelists in the sci-fi genre would be proud to be a part of such a timeless and amazing piece of literature.

She did not go without mentioning to me that her brother has passed, that she missed him very much, and that Hiero's adventures could not continue for this reason.

This is one of those works which I reread every year or so. There is something about the story that sort of keep drawing you back. I of course would like to see the series completed but am fearful that another author could not do it justice and would hate to see a wonderful work ruined. Would recommend this book to anyone wanting a page turner with some classic writing thrown in for good measure.

The good folks are really good, and the bad are totally evil - how can you beat a story in which the bad guys are \\"The Unclean\\"? This story has a similar appeal as Vance's \\"Exploration Team\\", in which a man and the animals he mentally communicates with explore new planets. Hiero maneuvers through his world, constantly exploring, and the reader gets to explore with him. As a consequence, adventures are just as much a surprise to the reader as they are to Hiero!

The one thing that attracted me to Hawaii 2003 was the fact that it was Let's Go's first Hawaii book, and that the Lonely Planet one was a year or so old already.I hesitate to consider this a comprehensive review of the LG book, given that I only travelled on Oahu and the Big Island, but my experience with those two islands has been wonderful with LG in my hand. All the information I came across was accurate presented, easily accessed and logically organized. The little sidebars provided interesting pieces of information, and I'd have to say that without the guide, I would have likely missed a lot of what Hawaii had to offer.That said, the one complaint I've always had about LG is the quality of their maps, which is to say they [are no good]. A month in South East Asia with LG left me frustrated, and this was no different. Of course, a perfect map probably shouldn't be the sole reason for buying a guide, so it's not too big a deal. Besides, there're plenty of very good maps to be had all over the islands, for little more than the effort it takes to pick one up. (On this note, I did flip through the LG USA 2003 book and it seemed as if the maps in there were a little more comprehensive and useful, at least for the major cities: less obvious destinations may very well leave something to be desiered there, as well.)One thing I'd have liked to see in LG are nice color map inserts like they do in some of the bigger guides, possibly even to include a basic layout of Oahu's TheBus system.Overall, I've got to recommend LG Hawaii 2003; the new look is fantastic. The books are smaller, and yet contain the same amount of information was previous years. They're down to Lonely Planet size now, in fact, and perhaps even a little more manageable than that: I easily fit my LG book, all folded up and bent back, in any pocket of any bag, so it was always at hand, but never prominent. And let's not forget the famous \\"Thumbs Up!\\" recommendations: if you're going to Oahu, read up on Waimanalo (pg 145) and be sure you eat as many meals as you can at Keneke's. The spot looks like a dive, and I would have undoubtedly missed it had LG not raved about it. Just that meal alone made up for the cost of the book. Now get out there and see what Hawaii's all about!"},{"Title":"LEAVES UPON THE RIVER","review":"As a Chinese American scholar, I like Wen's works. While he is a Professor Emeritus of Engineering at Michigan State University, he has exceptional cultural and social observational abilities and finely tuned humanistic insights, of which I myself, as a professor of literature and poetry, can only be envious.This is Wen's second novel that is largely autobiographical. Within its broad time and space reference, the book has no shortage of sensitive details and philosophical musings. Some parts of the novel are really quite moving.Further, during the time period of the novel there were not many Chinese scholars in America, and reading this novel can help people better to know the thoughts and experiences of those early scholars.I have also read the Chinese language version of this novel (that was published by the Shanghai Art and Literature Print House), which was translated by the author himself and fully demonstrates his linguistic ability.I strongly recommend this novel. Wen has finished and published his third novel, and I find that his descriptive talents and his skill at weaving a variety of intertwined plot lines together have only increased. I also strongly recommend that book."},{"Title":"LEAVES UPON THE RIVER","review":"The power of Robert Wen's story, &quot;Leaves Upon The River,&quot; is his intimate look into the pain he shares with the reader of what it is like to be the gifted son of an ultra demanding Chinese father. He survives the tortuous pressures of having to achieve unreasonable demands to succeed in whatever arena the father places him. Following the life struggles to triumph and freedom to a new land is exciting because you can see the larger national struggle of China's change under Communism.Very few male writers from China give us the inner feelings that we get from the details revealed through the eyes and voice of Jing Guoda. The wonderfully strong honest story of survival, courage and fears revealed would be appreciated by offsprings of Asian immigrants. The issues Robert Wen bring out in the open are too often not allowed to be discussed in the Chinese family! I congratulate him!Robert Wen has been able to transcend cultural taboos, and in his story I felt that healing has begun in being able to deal with the pain of the past injustices, and somehow make peace with the old and ailing parent, who admitted at least once that perhaps he had gone too far in pushing his son to be successful.Robert Wen's story of being thrown into deep waters to sink or swim shows that Jing Guoda not only did swim, but lived to tell a powerful story.I intend to give my daughter and son a chance to embrace this story in hopes that it will shed light on why their own father had similar traits of being a survivor since he also came out of a similar era and left Communist China to start a new life of freedom in the USA."},{"Title":"LEAVES UPON THE RIVER","review":"\\"Leaves Upon the River\\" is a fictional biography of a Chinese born in the 1920s. His first thirty years witnessed the Sino-Japanese War and the Nationalist-Communist conflict. His next thirty years took him to America, getting advanced education and working up the academic ladder to the chairman of civil engineering department of a major university. He retired to pursue interest in writing.He is seen as an industrious researcher and education, constantly improving his technical and teaching skills. Thanks to the tenure system, he had maintained his integrity amid academic politics.On the human side, the generation gap between him and his autocratic father created frictions. He was, however, able to grow out of the shadow of his father without hurting the feelings of the latter.The Chinese customs and recent history are precisely and concisely described. So is the experience of a new immigrant. The inside stories of academe remind us of the Cambridge saga by C. P. Snow. The author's facile handling of his adopted language is evidenced by his several beautiful poems in English.In short, the novel can be highly recommended."},{"Title":"LEAVES UPON THE RIVER","review":"This novel centers on the life and family of Jing Gouda, who comes of age in mainland China during and just after World War II, obtains his initial college education in China, then moves with his wife to America, where he enters upon graduate studies, followed by an academic career in American universities. One prominent theme of the story is the dissension that meanwhile continues between Gouda and his father, as the latter remains behind in China, although he moves from the mainland to Taiwan. The novel provides insights concerning Chinese family and social customs, many of which will be for American readers surprising and interesting. The story is especially timely in view of the significant number of Chineses students and scholars who in recent decades have become ever more prominent in American adademic life. A further major strength of the novel are the numerous astute observations made by the author concerning the subtleties and nuances of human emotional interactions, such observations having a relevance and a validity for people of all ethnic identities."},{"Title":"LEAVES UPON THE RIVER","review":"Exquisitely written on the relationship between a loving father and a talented son. Vividly casting of the father's characters. Very fascinating.While whether the high demanding father actually helped to cultivate the son and eventually had him become a successful scholar and live a content life, at the son's later age, could be controversial, the father did act like a steadfast captain with a grand plan, beginning at the son's early childhood, and steered, on behalf of the son, to his perceived correct direction.Besides the father's unique character, the conflict between the son and the father, after the son came to the States, mainly arose from the cultural and generational gap. And, it is not uncommon for elderly people to feel unsecured and isolated even though they don't really face much potential financial crisis down the road.The successive stories span over 70 years and illustrate how life and the world have dramatically changed."},{"Title":"Emmas War","review":"The best thing \\"Emma's War\\" by Deborah Scroggins accomplishes is to highlight the often overlooked tragedy and strife that grips Sudan in particular and Africa in general. That's it though, and is the only reason this book deserves more than one star.Emma herself, based on Scroggins' testimony, is an otherwise forgettable, if not pitiable, person. She had a lot of sex, did a lot of drugs, and reveled in the attention that her exploits attracted. She and her \\"safari companions\\" competed to outdo one another with their wild pursuits, and you get the sense that marrying a warlord was simply her ultimate one-upping of her friends. \\"Top that!\\" you can almost hear her say. As one prominent tribal chief put it, \\"If she were in a European setting, she would never even have been noticed.\\" Nevertheless, there is a good story in Emma's adventure, captured in the book's compelling subtitle: \\"An aid worker, a warlord, radical Islam, and the politics of oil - a true story of love and death in Sudan.\\" How could such a story not be a hit?The real problem with \\"Emma's War\\" is Scroggins' unbelievably poor writing. From what should have been a page-turning adventure, she rendered a laborious manuscript rife with typos, suffering from dreadful research and incoherent structure, and displaying a general misunderstanding of the English language. For example, she puts the date of Charles Gordon's death at both January 25th and January 26th in consecutive paragraphs (even if the details are murky, such inconsistency is inexcusable). She will use an opening parenthesis but have no corresponding closing parenthesis. She routinely jumbles several disconnected topics into a single, long paragraph. Meanwhile she jumps forward and backward in the story with no warning or explanation. And she repeatedly refers to the list of passengers on an airplane flight as the \\"airplane's manifesto.\\" Overall, \\"Emma's War\\" reads like a long, disjointed, carelessly written e-mail.Fortunately, there are alternatives to this book. For instance, there is the upcoming movie starring (possibly) Nicole Kidman as Emma. More seriously, \\"Mountains Beyond Mountains\\" by Tracy Kidder is an excellent story of true humanitarian activism."},{"Title":"Emmas War","review":"I couldn't put the book down, I ate it up. I can't get the mental images out of my head and was fascinated as I tried to put myself in Emma's extreme world of war and suffering, corruption and extremes. She was amazing, albeit oblivious and wreckless in ways...but amazing and led with her heart to the point of blindness. She didn't see foreigners living strangely, she saw their reality and wanted them to rise above it. She saw people she related to. I'd rather err as she did in love of a people rather than turn from such passionate feelings for a nation in strife. Fascinating."},{"Title":"Emmas War","review":"This book is about south Sudan's war with north Sudan. I lived in Kenya during much of it and followed the progress of the SPLA avidly. I also had some dealing with people in \\"Liberated Territory\\", that area under the control of the SPLA. I'm also very interested in the comping election to determine if southern Sudan seceds from the north."},{"Title":"Emmas War","review":"Scroggins uses the life of aid worker cum rebel-wife Emma McCune to characterize the Sudanese north-south civil war. The author folds a series of stories into one volume: the life of McCune (from aristocratic British child with pony and all to adventurer to aid worker to wife of a Sudanese rebel leader), the experience of the Scroggins herself (who spent many years as a journalist in Africa), and the history of Sudan (from colonial times to the present).[If you're going to read one readable (i.e., not terribly dense) book about Sudan, I recommend Dave Eggers'What Is the What, the fictionalized account of a Sudanese refugee boy in which Eggers discusses both the north-south civil war and the mass killings in Darfur.]This book's greatest value - and Scroggins recognizes this - is not so much in its insight into Sudan but rather in its insight into the West. We see Emma leaping into aid work as an escape from boredom, we see some aid workers water skiing back and forth in front of refugee camps while others work around the clock in feeding centers, and we see how Emma's marriage to a Sudanese rebel affects the politics of local aid provision.** Scroggins also gives a larger history of Western intervention in Sudan. Her exploration of the manifold and whimsical motivations of Western involvement is insightful and worthwhile.That said, I found the pre-Sudan life history of McCune (a chunk of the beginning of the book) tiresome, and occasionally Scroggins' judgment jumps the gun on her analysis.* But in general she seeks to apply an even hand. Scroggins' own observations from her time as a journalist provide a compelling illustration of the situation in southern Sudan (25 years ago, anyway). I also learned where anthropologists can get jobs (the UN, apparently).I wouldn't rush out to buy this book, but I'm not sorry I read it.I listened to the unabridged audiobook read by Kate Reading (an appropriate name for a narrator), published by Blackstone Audio. It comes in a bit long at 12 CDs, but Reading gives a fine...well, Reading.* For example, she comments that \\"the New World Order [i.e., peace in Africa] was desirable only if it could be achieved without cost to American lives\\" (326). Of course, this presumes that the West is capable of achieving this at some higher cost, which presumption is not obviously true.** When I read of Emma going as an aid worker and marrying a local person, I was reminded ofthe wildly different story of Kenneth Goode, the anthropologist who married a Yanamamo woman."},{"Title":"Emmas War","review":"\\"Sudan's 26 million people were 2 thirds Muslim, but only a little over 1 third Arab. Muslim or not, most Sudanese were dark skinned Africans. Yet the country's wealth was concentrated in the hands of the descendants of a handful of Arabs (...) Meanwhile, this Arab elite kept the black African majority divided and fighting among themselves.\\" The background in a nutshell.It's the brief comments out of the blue like this one that make the book well worth reading. In the first half of the book we have the settings, and a summary of Emma's life up to her final journey to Africa. The author's gift for synthesizing a lot of history regarding Emma and Sudan is truly laudable. But in the second part of the book, when it comes to the more day by day activities of the different tribes warfare and of Emma herself, it becomes boring, entangled and messy.The most interesting and revealing passages come unexpectedly. The conversations with Arab characters candidly reveal their racism towards blacks, and their intolerance towards other religions other than Muslim (see p.103 for a clear example).The issue of the European aid workers is always a intriguing psychological mystery: \\"It was against the unspoken rule of aid to admit that all one really wanted was to get away from home\\" (p.70) regarding Emma. You can make your own ideas about Emma and other aid workers, although intriguing, my own interest remained on the cultural issues at hand.There are more stories that are not dealt with here. We see African aristocracy, tribal high-class studying in nice English universities, going back to Africa to use their education to make war and impose their law on the rest of the people. This is a class worth taking a look at. The aid workers are also a class in itself, their motivations for being there, their personal stories, are all very interesting. All these peoples are interesting. The book should have continued to be like in the first part, more analyses, more summarizing, and less he-said-she-said and soap-opera."},{"Title":"Emmas War","review":"While portrayed as a a slightly disjointed account of adventuress and naive victem Emma McClune, the book takes a winding, history laden account of the conflict in Sudan, the power players who profit from keeping the country in flames, and the ineptness of the UN in all aspects. The author, Deborah Scroggins, spent quite a bit of time in Sudan as a reporter, logging eye-witness accounts of attrocities on both sides of the conflict, reports by other investigators about such things as government sanctioned genocide, and the seeming inability of western aid groups to understand the situation let alone help end it. This book has sent me on a much larger search for the UN's usefullness, the politics behind aid groups, and the indemic conflicts of Africa. A great starting point for anyone interested in why US troops are overseas, the politics of Islam and Osama bin Laden (who got a great start in Sudan), and the questions we should all be asking about why the situations are not getting better."},{"Title":"Emmas War","review":"Although the information regarding the history and civil war in Sudan were helpful, the author had me confused several times by inconsistancies in name usages (ie: using first name in one sentence then using the surname in the next sentence. Also I was turned off by Emmas selfish attitudes regarding herself and images of who she thought African men are. ie; her statement regarding the male physical organ. It just validates the old stereotype describing African/African American men.Her primary goal in going to Africa was not to be an Aid worker, she was selfish in even that motivation."},{"Title":"Emmas War","review":"My friend Roge asked me to get this book for him.

Though South Sudan became independent a year ago, the multi-sided fighting rages today. Americans only take note when the starvation gets bad enough to warrant TV coverage--if American Idol isn't on--but there is no reason to suspect the suffering and death has lessened. Scroggins, a journalist who reported on Africa first hand, builds her story around Emma McCune, a wild-child British aid worker who married the Sudanese warlord of one of the southern factions and became such a partisan in the internecine tribal feud that it was called \\"Emma's War\\" by the locals. Who should read this book? Anyone who thinks that slavery was an American phenomena that ended in 1965. (The Muslims contemptuously referred to all the southern blacks by the local word for \\"slave.\\") Anyone who thinks there is real hunger and poverty in America. Anyone who thinks that in the Sudan--or any conflict like this in the Third World, there are any good guys with clean hands--including the US, the UN and the NGO aid organizations. Anyone who thinks that Shari'a law is a benign cultural and religious expression. Anyone in a position to try to make policy for Africa, by the government or by a charitable organization.

The author brings Emma alive as the very best fiction would (in the 20's, she would have lived among the fast crowd in Paris, in the reality of the '80's she went from Oxfram to wife of a Sudanese warlord) and brings the sad history of Sudan in the 1980's alive at the same time.A fictional account of the same period, What is the What, would make an excellent companion to this book."},{"Title":"Emmas War","review":"Emma's War is the result of a tremendous effort of research into the history of Sudan and an \\"on the ground\\" experience of Sudan today. Having spent five years on and off in Sudan in the late 1980s, I was able to relate to much that was written, but also learned a great deal. Especially the way the author brought the history of tribal relationships, the long conflicts between North and South, Muslims vs Christians and Animists, the economy of oil, the state of women in Sudan, and the role of Sudan in Africa as well as the Middle East. Sudan has wonderful people and a large heart, it leaves a large mark on one's soul. All of this is more the better read because it is integrated into a violent, reckless, true story of a young woman seeking adventure and to save the world who fell in love with a rebel, crossing the line and leading herself and everyone around her into extremely difficult circumstances. If you know Africa and especially Sudan, get the book, it's worth the read."},{"Title":"Emmas War","review":"I'm an NGO worker in a post-conflict society, and was intrigued at reading this account of one woman's experience in the Sudanese aid community, and her subsequent marriage to a warlord. My fears of this being a book too bogged by history/biography were quickly tossed aside...Emma's War is so engaging because it is actually three stories in one: the story of an English woman who married a Sudanese rebel, the contentious history of southern Sudan, and a very delightful first-person narrative about the author herself and her experiences with the first two.What I like so much about this book is that it never takes sides; Scroggins is somewhat sympathetic towards Emma, but never apologetic over her (sometimes) inhumane actions. This book also really illuminates the situation in Darfur now, and how the conflict of the last 20 years has fueled the current crisis there. I'd call it a must-read for anyone interested in the region, and anyone struggling to understand the conflicts of interest between humanitarian aid and armed conflict."},{"Title":"Emmas War","review":"With yet another crisis in the Sudan (did it ever go away?) this book is a powerful source of information on the machievelian politics of the region, but also of the Aid, the aid workers and one in particular, Emma McCune.In the early 1990's Emma was an aid worker and idealist, working in the Sudan on programmes to provide young people with education (and assisting them in avoiding being drafted into the armies of the fighting factions of the region. Deborah Scroggins who met her once, unravels her life, and ties it in with the actions of the those around her - the warlords, the aid organisations, and the man she married, Northern Nile Warlord Riek.This is a fascinating and well written book, almost Shakesperian in its tragedy. From tragic childhood to idealist aid worker to blindly in love, to prime manipulator and finally tragic heroine - It seemed her life and made a complete circle.Scroggins clearly knows the area, its politics and history and is able to draw in immense amounts of background to situations which might otherwise be inexplicable - but she is an easy writer to read, it is eloquently put. I found myself unable to put this down until I was finished, and is easily one of the best reads of the year for me.I found myself by turns exasperated and annoyed with Emma - she seemed frivolous with everyone but herself and yet, she obviously achieved such a lot before she became enamoured with Reik. Even perhaps afterwards.I think reading this book will do more than explain the life of one woman, it will provide a background to one of those little understood regions - we are expected to give aid to the suffering masses without understanding why - and whether you actually give aid after you read this book will be interesting!"},{"Title":"Emmas War","review":"Scroggins' account of the Sudanese war is not for pleasure reading. Scroggins presents the horrors of the Sudanese civil war in their naked and atrocious form, without the embellishment or emotional pandering some writers may use. The author is incredibly insightful and offers a unique perspective on humanitarian aid efforts arround the world. She attempts to move humanitarians outside their comfort zones and uncovers the true effects of their help. Incredibly cynical but worth the read for anyone who looks for the causes behind the atrocities in Sudan."},{"Title":"Emmas War","review":"Welcome to Sudan. The ravaged country, its society torn apart by endless war, as if cursed with every possible curse - Ethnic strife, widespread corruption, religious warfare, famine - and that Modern curse, the one that makes powerful foreigners interested: oil.Deborah Scoggins uses the story of Emma McCune, a young Englishwoman who - obsessed with Sudan, its people, and its men, came to marry a Sudanese warlord, to shed light on the forsaken land, and of the people who populate it - not merely the Sudanese themselves, but also, perhaps especially, the Westerners who come to \\"save\\" them.Scoggins sees continuity between the present day Aid workers, Journalists and other do-gooders and the Western Imperialists of the 19th century. Their implicit model was Charles George Gordon, the Victorian soldier and adventurer who led African soldiers in a \\"campaign\\" against slavery, and whose mix - of idealism, thrill seeking, and utter ignorance of the country and the people he came to save - they share (This is also a theme of William Easterly'sThe White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good).Like their Imperialists forerunners, the white aid-workers become immediate elite, separated and elevated above the population by the color of their skin. Also like the Imperialists, they get powers above and beyond anything they might have had back in the West. 25 years old Emma McCune, for example, became a school coordinator, essentially an education Minister for the area under the Sudanese Rebels' control. Indeed, one of the most penetrating insights of Scoggins is that a certain nostalgic quality for the days of Imperialism may be a motivating factor for Africa's whites; McCune herself was born in India, where her father had continued his Imperial Era post as manager of a Tea estate up to the mid 1960s. In India, an Englishman was a marked aristocrat, and Mr. McCune could never adapt to the bourgeois England he was forced to return to as the British Indian world came to an end. By going to Sudan, wasn't Emma at least partially recovering something her father had had and had lost?And yet this is not quite fair, because for better or worse, Emma identified herself with the Sudanese as the Imperialists never had. She worked, apparently diligently, for them and with them. If she was guilty of Orientalism (a term popularized by Edward Said inOrientalism- and heavily criticized by other scholars; seeIvory Towers on Sand: The Failure of Middle Eastern Studies in America (Policy Papers (Washington Institute for Near East Policy), No. 58.)andDangerous Knowledge: Orientalism and Its Discontents) - her brand of romantic, even erotic attraction to Africa lacked the exploitive elements that made the \\"White Man's Burden\\" so repulsing. She may have had a fetish for Sudan - and Sudanese men; she may have had an idealized view of them - but I don't think she patronized them, lorded over them with the mystical power of her white skin (the Locals referred to Westerners as Khawajas - white).In Sudan, Emma met, fell in love with, and soon married Riek Machar, an already married, British educated, high-rank commander of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) - a rebel force of Sudan's Southern, Christian and Pagan people. As her relationship with Machar deepened, she came to see things from his perspective, putting her in conflict with her UN colleagues and supervisors. One of the best parts of Scoggins' book is her description of the problematics of the morality of hunger. Machar's men had been stealing food that was going to the camp's starving children. He exhibited the starving children in special camps, with \\"caretakers\\", who supposedly were watching after them, but in fact were taking their food. But as horrible as it seems, \\"it was not easy to tell right from wrong\\". How different were the rebels and the saviors?\\"It was not as if the aid workers themselves were going without meals... [the] discrepancy made some people uncomfortable, especially when grain stocks were low and aid workers had to put more than one hundred thousand refugees on half rations. But - face it - food tastes awfully good after a day that begins at five AM and continues until nightfall with all manners of frustrations in between. Who could blame the khawajas if they enjoyed an extra helping of canned fish? Think of what they could be eating if they were at home in Manhattan or Melbourne. True, children were dying. But if the aid-workers didn't keep up their strength, more would die.\\" (pp. 234-235).Her marriage cost Emma her job, and she became a propagandist and an apologist for Riek Machar, who was busy in a war against the SPLA leader, John Garang. As the war deteriorated to a tribal blood-fest, which benefited only the Islamic government in Khartoum, Emma's life became endangered. \\"There are some people out there who would gladly put a bullet through my head\\", she said. Machar gave her two bodyguards. And Emma did not believe any harm would come to her.That Emma's story would end tragically seems inevitable. Yet, astonishingly, Emma died in a mundane car accident; she was never important enough for anyone to kill. She had been five months pregnant. Her death was tragic but meaningless.Scroggins' book tells is really a triple narrative: a biography of Emma McCune; a brutal account of the sad history of Sudan and the nave Westerners who tried to help it; and a sketch of Scoggins's own experience reporting from Sudan. None of the narrative end very effectively - all fizzle out, like Emma, stopping before the tale is over. Scoggins's own reporting is the least satisfying element of it all - chapters upon chapters of her experiences in Sudan (and even, for some mysterious reason, Somalia), which don't add up to much.And yet Scroggins's prose is effective, and her insights, particularly of the mentality and problems of the white aid-workers, quite illuminating. If you're interested in Sudan's sad history, in the colorful life of Emma McCune, or especially in the complexities of aid-work in Africa, you are likely to find \`Emma's War' a useful and readable account."},{"Title":"Emmas War","review":"If a proposed movie of \\"Emma's War\\" starring Nicole Kidman is made, Emma McCune may well become the most famous aid worker of all time. That's a shame because, as this book makes clear, her accomplishments were modest. Emma had a flair for drama and publicity and a pair of long legs instead of a brain. One suspects that she would have tired of the hardships of life in the Sudanese bush and gone back to England to become a fashion designer or some such thing.The humanitarian aid workers are the modern day missionaries of Western civilization. All in all, they do more good than harm, although Emma may be the exception. Deborah Scroggins has written an excellent book about the brutal two decade long civil war in Sudan and the foreign aid workers who keep the innocent victims of the war alive. The politics are here in easily digestible chunks and so is a mini-history of Sudan since the time of the Victorian hero \\"Chinese\\" Gordon. The author includes some of her own experiences of witnessing starvation in Sudan.One insight of this book is that Western governments want not so much to do anything about African catastrophes as to be seen to do something. Their indifference to African suffering is more than matched by African leaders. Two million people are estimated to have died in the civil wars in Sudan during the last 20 years, the vast majority of them noncombatants.

I learned SO much about Sudan; I'm astounded at the amount of research and interviewing that went into this book. The author's personal reflections, especially how she thinks back to time she spent among the refugees as she's putting her own child to bed, are really poignant. Loved the book because it's so full of information, but feel really, really sad for the people of Sudan and their seemingly hopeless situation. A must-read for anyone going to Sudan."},{"Title":"Emmas War","review":"Most reviewers incorrectly see Scroggin's book as the story of Emma McCune, the \\"aid worker\\" who went to save the poor children of southern Sudan, fell madly in love with a warlord - a romantic tragedy of sorts.While Scroggins tells that story well, that's hardly the point. Scroggins's needle-sharp writing injects too much history, too much politics, too much moral ambiguity surrounding all the do-gooders, particularly Emma but including Scroggins herself, for it to work as yet another \\"Westerners in Africa\\" romance.Scroggins transforms Emma into a prism by which the varying shades of atrocity experienced by so many people in Sudan for so long may be separated and scrutinized. In so doing, she offers a truer testament than any bitter sweet memorial by contextualizing a woman who had \\"beauty, passion, a radiant spirit\\" into the realm that she loved, with all its horrifying, inescapable realities - the sort of painful truths so readily ignored and swept from the consciousness.Recommended only for readers prepared to burn away sentimentality while confronting a few of the oddities of \\"relief, tragedy, misery, sex, and personal extravagance\\" in one obscure corner of Africa. If looking for heroes or easy answers, run away."},{"Title":"Emmas War","review":"One of the best written book I have ever read about Africa -- it really captures the mood and the challenges. This book provides both a history of the Sudan and surrounding areas, as well as an interesting story of a young Englishwoman, initially involved in humanitarian aid, who became involved with and married an African warlord. A remarkable story and one that richly increases one's understanding of the complications of providing assistance in Africa.I spent several months in Zaire/Congo right out of college and I finally understand the situation better. A number of my friends have been on missions in Africa. We cannot just stand back; yet, we must be aware of the effects of what we do and how we do it.Excellent account! Kudos to Deborah Scroggins for trying to make sense of it all."},{"Title":"Emmas War","review":"I couldn't put this book down. I really enjoyed how the writer combined Emma's stories, her own experiences as a journalist, and history. It really makes a person ponder the West's efforts to do good in Africa. Strings are always attached. I wonder if Sudan would have been better or worse off without oil. After reading this book, I think that Europe and America would have been less interested in the country, but that meddling did create many devastating problems. Do aid workers hurt more than they help? Are the benefits of their efforts negligible? Perhaps some. I liked the author's metaphor of the mirror when she talked about the ways the West and the Sudan were entagled with each other.Emma was an adventuress, and she seemed to mainly be trying to escape a mundane life. She liked helping people, but she seemed more wrapped up in the IDEA of doing so. She seemed to care, but she seemed addicted to the electricity of living life on the razor's edge in Sudan. THere, she had access to movers and shakers. THat intoxicated her."},{"Title":"Emmas War","review":"Emma's War is a story of blind love in a tragic place. Emma's addition to Sudan and love for her people were spellbounding to read about. Deborah Scroggins' personal accounts made the story come to light.

Often, this book is so dumbed down that key shortcuts to certain mathematical concepts are completely OVERLOOKED. I'll admit, the practice problems and tests are helpful if one takes the time to do all of them (I didn't), but there is no excuse for such a lack of content. The book teaches the reader how to do everything the long way (often, there are much better methods). For example, in the polynomial division section, synthetic division was not even mentioned. Also, the fact that the permutation and combination functions are built into most calculators was not mentioned either. This can make testers take longer periods of time to complete their tests."},{"Title":"Cracking the SAT II: Math, 1999-2000 Edition (Cracking the Sat Math Subject Test)","review":"The SAT Math II tests both cover a wide range of topics. One cannot expect any one book to cover them all. This book tries its best to cover all topics but it should not be a replacement for a precalc / algebra II textbook - only a supplement. It gives you tips and tricks to master the SAT tests that one might forget such as trig methods for calculating areas for parallelogram and triangles.If you have a strong background in math or have taken a precalc course, this book should almost be a breeze. It covers all of the basics but only touches upon more complex subjects such as binomial combinations and polar coordinates. But the author does have a point - your chances of seeing those questions on an actual test are very slim.All in all, this book won't let you down"},{"Title":"Cracking the SAT II: Math, 1999-2000 Edition (Cracking the Sat Math Subject Test)","review":"This is not a bad book for those of us who have a solid background in trig and (pre)calculus. Unlike its Barrons counterpart, this book is a no nonsense guide to the SAT II math iic.It tells you the sort of topics and questions to expect on the test. It is true that the questions are considerably easier than the real deal, the questions and the practice tests depict the actual test a lot more accurately than the Barrons.Barrons manages to give you a screwed up impression of the real test, mentioning and giving inadequate explainations for many topics that AP level students haven't heard of (and that you certainly don't need to know for the SAT II). However, Barrons does train you harder and if you manage a score in the upper 30's on the Barrons, you should be OK on test day.The only flaw with the Princeton Review book is that it doen't give you any security as it doesn't have an in-depth coverage of the topics (but again it is adequate if you are just reiewing topics that you have mastered previously), nor does it have tough questions.Lastly, if you are willing to put in the effort, I would recommend you to buy this book and the Barrons just to freak you out and make you work harder in addition to the Real SAT IIs book just so you can see where you really stand."},{"Title":"Cracking the SAT II: Math, 1999-2000 Edition (Cracking the Sat Math Subject Test)","review":"You're nervous, you're sweaty. You see the person in front of the room talking but you can't quite understand what he is saying because you are too focused on the task before you. You know that this test could mean saving thousands of dollars and getting into the college of your choice. Welcome to the SAT II subject tests, a rite of passage for anyone who is applying to more competitive schools. Most students haven't even heard of SAT II's and are unfamiliar with the importance of these specialized tests. This book provides the reader with a guide to understanding the nature and format of the SAT II Math IC and IIC. Before I make any comments on the book I want to provide you with some details about my math background. I am an honors student who is currently enrolled in AP Math (Calculus) and scored a 680 on the math section of the SAT I. When I took the Math IIC for the first time (after having used this book to cram the night before and morning of the test) I scored a 780 out of 800, not bad. I feel that this book is effective only if you have a solid math background and if you are willing to do all of the exercises and practice in the book. Like anything the more you work at it the better you will get. This book is very good when it comes to providing the reader with quality content in an easy format to understand. It is also important to know that this book alone will not make you score well, but will raise your score.

As he explains, \\"This is a book about insights in business -- how we get them, how we recognize them, how we keep them coming....Ideas, valuable though they may be, are a dime-a-dozen in business....Insight is much rarer -- and therefore more precious...a good insight can fuel a thousand ideas....More than anything else, an insight states a truth that alters how we see the world.\\" The allure of a powerful insight: Once you experience one, \\"you can't see the world in any other way.\\" The most valuable insights are those which reveal and then guide and inform an appropriate course of action. Such insights initiate an chain reaction of ideas, some of which -- in turn -- generate other insights.This process can occur in any human enterprise and invariably requires effective communication, cooperation, and collaboration involving several different people. However, everything begins with a need to be filled, a question to be answered, or a problem to be solved. Then extensive research must be conducted, with the results rigorously analyzed. Hopefully, what Dusenberry calls a \\"salient fact\\" will be revealed which should lead to a compelling insight. Then there must be a strategy which will \\"drive\\" the insight during implementation. In advertising, Dusenberry claims, \\"if you have a great insight and strategy, great ads practically write themselves.\\" He would probably be the first to concede, however, that mass production of automobiles (e.g. Ford), creation of feature-length animation films (e.g. Disney), and splitting the atom (e.g. Manhattan Project) may involve the same process but are immensely more complicated than devising and then executing successful advertising campaigns for FedEx, Frito-Lay, GE, Gillette, HBO, Pepsi, Pizza Hut, and VISA.What I especially appreciate about this book is Dusenberry's personal, indeed conversational style as he allows his reader to accompany him \\"down memory lane\\" to re-visit many of the most significant \\"insights and accidents\\" during his career. For each, he carefully establishes a context: the situation, the objective, the challenge(s), the competition, the nature and extent of collaboration at BBDO, the relationship with the given client, the compelling insight, and its primary strategy; then its production, execution, and the eventual (if not always immediate) impact of the given campaign. I also appreciate Dusenberry's wit and, when appropriate, his self-deprecation. He may be in his industry's Hall of Fame but he is mercifully free of a Rushmorean self-image.Frankly, I have become allergic to book titles which are cute, catchy, clever, eye-catching, sticky, gooey, etc. The relevance of this book's title is best revealed within Dusenberry's narrative. However, I do reassure those who read this brief commentary that the title is eminently appropriate. More importantly, the situation to which it refers illustrates that when accidents occur during the production of television commercials featuring celebrities such as Michael Jackson, most of them respond to problems in a professional manner.This is a thoroughly entertaining and well as an unusually informative personal memoir about advertising and BBDO, of course, but also about certain basic business principles which are relevant to all other industries and to all other organizations. In Chapter 13, \\"Building a Foolproof Insight Creation Machine,\\" Dusenberry offers eighteen \\"guidelines\\" (not rules) to guide and inform anyone who is then inspired by his concluding remarks: \\"A strong insight can fuel a thousand reasons to act and make something happen. That, more than anything, should be your reason to fight and persevere for your own insight moment. When you are armed with a powerful insight, the ideas never stop flowing.\\" Dusenberry's memoir provides an abundance of such insights. Hopefully, at least one or two of them will help his readers and their associates to cause their own \\"insight moments\\" to occur."},{"Title":"Then We Set His Hair on Fire: Insights and Accidents from a Hall of Fame Career in Advertising","review":"First, to eliminate any confusion, this is the same, word-for-word book as One Great Insight Is Worth a Thousand Good Ideas: An Advertising Hall-of-Famer Reveals the Most Powerful Secret in Business. So buy one or the other, whichever is cheaper. Now THAT's an insight you can take to the bank.Having worked with Phil for 7 years as a client, it is refreshing to revisit his charm and wisdom. Of which he had plenty. I found the book to be mostly accurate. Two mistakes pop out: 1. The Jay Leno/Doritos theme line was Crunch (not munch, that's a Frito's term) All You Want, We'll Make More. That was penned by Tracey-Locke's top creative guy and he should have been mentioned for that insightful creativity. 2. A MAJOR creative force at BBDO, Harvey Hoffenberg, isn't mentioned once. Harvey was responsible for MANY of Pepsi's incredible TV spots in the 80s. He and Phil had a falling out and considering the sizeable ego involved, that's apparently the price of friendship lost. But it's unfair and inaccurate, as if US History had been written without mentioning Ben Franklin. There were other people suffering the same fate but Harvey's omission REALLY stands out.And for those of you who are interested in how advertising worked (note past tense: the heydays of great advertising are GONE in the US; just turn on your set to see the ample evidence) I believe Phil gives too little credit to the myriad of people who are involved (for better, and, sometimes, worse) in that complex dance. Think of it as the ultimate \\"telephone game\\" where one person tells the next a short message with the hope of getting it to the end intact. Great advertising people enhance that message at every step. And by \\"people\\" I mean the brand managers and their superiors; the advertising managers; the agency creatives, account people and producers; and then the production companies -- their producer(s) (including casting, set design, location scouts, props, wardrobe, etc) and the director; and the people in post: editor(s), effect, music, sound effects, etc. They all need to get aligned like so many planets.And if that alignment comes unglued, it gets ugly. There was one spot that BBDO produced for Pepsi called \\"Crack\\" that never saw the light of day. The idea was that the earth was incredibly parched and created a giant fissure that \\"ran\\" all over the place looking for refreshment and ultimately ran to a Pepsi machine where, when it was totally consumed by the crack, created a big refreshing AHHH heard around the world. When CEO Roger Enrico saw it he said \\"no.\\" It just didn't work. Pepsi paid the $1MM+ tab for it and we moved on to the next round. That was Enrico's genius. He knew the high-wire act of creating the world's best ads couldn't bat 1.000 and BBDO was never in the slightest dinged for that one. The old Sicilian saying -- A fish stinks from the head -- is true. In this case, Enrico's brilliance is what cascaded down over the company and the agency, to the benefit of both.So if Phil is guilty of anything in this book it is the oversimplification of that delicate, complex \\"dance.\\" And overuse of the words \\"I\\", \\"me\\", \\"my\\" and the like. There IS a lot of wisdom in this book -- notably that most companies/brands/products don't really understand how they are viewed by their customers. His wine shop metaphors are dead on. The consumer holds all the keys, you just have to reach out and touch them to see where the beef is if you absolutely, positively want to send the very best."},{"Title":"Then We Set His Hair on Fire: Insights and Accidents from a Hall of Fame Career in Advertising","review":"And I've read A LOT. This one, however, goes behind the scenes on how a product lets the consumer know it's here by a \\"memorable\\" campaign, not the the 24/7 onslaught of pop-ups or product placement or posters-in-public-bathrooms that we have been experiencing of late. It's enough to make a person wistful for the good ol' days of advertising. I'm NOT in the business, but I can still remember each and every ad Dusenberry mentioned. (And I can still recite: Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun! :-) ) At the same time, I can't remember a single ad that aired last night during \\"Desperate Housewives.\\" Newcomers may blow off the meanderings of a mere high-school graduate who \\"did good\\" in advertising, but from this consumer's viewpoint, Dusenberry GOT it, and that's an insight I'll cherish."},{"Title":"Then We Set His Hair on Fire: Insights and Accidents from a Hall of Fame Career in Advertising","review":"What an amazing book. I loved it! I'm in the advertising industry so I expected the book to be relevant to my career - but the book offers so much more to anyone from a small business owner to a CEO of a large corporation. Everyone would appreciate reading this book. The focus is on insight rather than clever ideas. The pages are full of witty stories of tried and true (and not so successful) experiences of a legendary ad man. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Then We Set His Hair on Fire: Insights and Accidents from a Hall of Fame Career in Advertising","review":"I was sent this book for free but I must admit that initially I didn't really feel too excited about either the author or the topic owing to my aversion to the Madison Ave advertising industry in general. When I did open it I was expecting to read about how great the advertising industry was and how Dusenberry was the cheerleader for it. Not so.Dusenberry actually steps back a level and talks about life managing the creative and marketing strategy behind some of the world's best-known brands such as Pepsi and Dupont. This book isn't so much about advertising and marketing as it is about the \\"ah hah!\\" moment that leads to insight into a product or service that then forms the platform upon which a successful campaign is built. In other words, years of marketing effort can be driven by a fleeting moment in time and Dusenberry talks about how these fleeting moments come to be.Dusenberry doesn't talk about Madison Avenue really nor does he pretend to be anything other than the creative filter for BBDO through which the good ideas get through. He tries to instill a sense of wonder and engagement in the reader to bring out the best and wildest ideas that might help to launch a new product or service. Although he didn't say as much, I suspect his ideas and insights are as valid for a 1-person startup company as for a 10,000-person conglomerate.If you're a marketer or advertiser, internet or not, you'll really enjoy this book. I would also recommend it to budding entrepreneurs who are looking for some enlightenment and guidance on trusting their instincts about launching their product or service."},{"Title":"Then We Set His Hair on Fire: Insights and Accidents from a Hall of Fame Career in Advertising","review":"I have always admired those in the advertising industry and thought I would give this book a shot.

Dusenberry has an interesting perspective that I haven't seen elsewhere. If you really want to learn from his book, though, you'll need to do your own work pulling the key ideas out as he chose to write more of a narrative.

I was skeptical because I couldn't find it nearly anywhere. However, after reading it it has changed the way I look at advertising. If you are looking for a book that lays out all of the rules in a simple formula, this isn't that book. However, it is the type of book that infuses you with the knowledge needed through short stories and small nuggets of information. By the end your frame of reference has shifted, and you are better off for it. It is a short read and has some funny parts as well (including where the title came from).The specific vendor was good. It came quickly and was it great condition."},{"Title":"Then We Set His Hair on Fire: Insights and Accidents from a Hall of Fame Career in Advertising","review":"In this book, the author talks about the importance of having business insights over having business ideas. Having a correct insight can generate a lot of ideas that can be turned into action. An insight expresses an \\"incontrovertible truth\\" that is relevant to consumers. An example is the insight that GE brings good things to life. Good and effective advertising has to be based on insights about a product/service/brand and what it can offer to its customers.Insights, in turn, are largely derived from the correct interpretation of objective research data. Moreover, negative data about the shortcomings of a product/service can contribute to the discovery of insights better than positive data.The author goes on to discuss the steps a company should take in order survive and grow. First, it has to shout to the world that it is here. Then it has to keep moving the correct needles - making small success in increasing sales, gaining market shares, etc. Sometimes, it is forced to take offense against competitors in a tactful manner. After a company has become the leader in its industry, the job remaining is staying number one through increasing its market share or growing the overall market. Lastly, the author discusses how to manage a group of people that are creative. He gives a few principles for nurturing and keeping high-quality creativity in an ad agency.One theme that is repeated in the book is the fact that, the success of a brand hinges on its ability to build an emotional bond with its customers. This emotional bond will translate to trust and loyalty.The writing style of this book is that of a memoir. The author conveys wisdom and authority without appearing to be conceited. He sounds like a good mentor to younger people.I have learned a lot about marketing and advertising through reading this book."},{"Title":"Then We Set His Hair on Fire: Insights and Accidents from a Hall of Fame Career in Advertising","review":"The book's content is easy going and refreshing in its tone and what I would classify as a good read which at times I found hard not to pick up and try to finish at any spare moment.

Human rights or any rights for that matter have no place in the hearts' of Communists. Humanism is an alien concept long rejected by Mao and his coterie. Chairman Mao was a cannibal, mass-murderer and a man who raped many girls. However, Indians should forgive him for 1962's debacle. When our apple is rotten to the core, there is no use blaming the opposing party. This book reveals it all. Nehru was nothing but a Nepotist, proud, disdainful of common folk fully aware of his aura of (imagined) invincibility, his expensive \\"paid\\" education and his lineage ( meaning that his father used to keep dancing girls). He, along with similarly educated Menon and his blued-eyed boy Kaul are wholly responsible for taking India many years back, crippling its army infrastructure through sheer incompetence bordering treachery, telling wholesome lies in the Lower/Upper houses, giving misinterpreted data that things were going well with Indian Air Force, ignoring requests from front-line Army personnel that food, equipment were in scarce supply and that poor soldiers were literally dying in their thin socks, overlooking promotions for those who complained against their decisions. I pity those long-dead army personnel who had to work under useless people like Kaul. It may be noted that Kaul, a Kashmiri Pundit, was close relative of Nehru. Also, Kashmiri Pundits are known for their dangerous jingoism. During my stint at Parliament of India, a highly positioned Kashmiri Pundit officer ( long retired) was known to go to the exam hall to \\"protect\\" his daughter and her pals, who cheated right under the nose of the invigilator from books hidden under their petticoats. This has been told to me by a Lady officer. When I was a kid in Moscow, another Kashmiri Pundit did help a Punjabi man, but only when his wife slept with him. This is their culture. They mistreated our Muslim brothers and hence deserved the big kick they got from Kashmir Valley.It has to be the WORST book I have ever read. The writer knows nothing about writing. All he does is raves and rants about the same things over and over again. There is no personal information about his life, wife etc. Editing is totally off the mark.

The Queen's Necklace begins ten years after the close ofMemoirs of a Physician, as France recovers from the grips of a deadly winter and Marie Antoinette takes pity on Jeanne de Valois who claims to be descended from the Valois side of the monarchy, albeit from the wrong side of the blanket. Jeanne soon takes up with Cardinal de Rohan who in an effort to ingratiate himself at court offers the stunning necklace originally intended as a gift for the infamous Madame du Barry to the Queen. Thus begins Dumas' take on the well known \\"Affair of the Diamond Necklace\\" which scandalized France and further degraded public opinion of the monarchy.Dumas brings characters from the first two books into this story, as the mysterious Balsamo reappears under the new name of Count Cagliostro, Andr&eacute;e resides at court in service to Marie and falls in love with the Count de Charny (who loves the Queen) and Philip (called Philippe in this book) returns from America and also finds himself madly in love with the Queen. Andr&eacute;e's former servant Nicole (who bears a striking resemblance to the Queen) now goes by the name of Oliva and is drawn into Jeane's schemes as she masquerades as the Queen setting off further scandals, and eventually Marie and de Charny are caught in a compromising position which leads to a drastic ploy by Marie to save both herself and de Charny. Will this ploy fulfill the secret desire of our heroine Andr&eacute;e, or does a twist of fate forever change her happiness to great sorrow? I'll never tell, but that was one heck of a plot twist!Unfortunately, what should have been a ripping good read was ruined by a dreadful translation. I've read many works of Dumas and his storylines always move quickly with plentiful action and sparkling dialogue and displays the foibles and machinations of the French Monarchy to perfection. This book was stilted, slow paced with some of the most un-Dumas like dialogue I've ever come across. Worse yet, since most chapters were 3-4 pages long (this from an author who was paid by the word!!??) and from comparing the page count of this version (329) to that of another (432) I'm guessing quite a bit of the story was left out, and frankly I would have bailed on the book except for the fact that I intend to read the rest of the series and didn't want to lose the story. The first two in the series of six I've read were much older publications, published in the early 1900's by P.F. Collier and Son. If you are interested in reading the entire series I recommend you check your library and/or shop the online used sellers for one of those copies. Next up in the series,Taking the Bastile.I do want to note that this review is for the Wildside Press edition and my comments about translation problems should not be reflected against other publishers of this book. I'm stating this as I notice that any reviews posted for one version of this book are showing up on others, and I suspect my review will show up on those editions as well."},{"Title":"The queen's necklace","review":"My bad.

Lonely, introspective poems that reveal the vast emptiness of the universe and the soul. I have a few volumes of Buk's stuff and can't afford to buy them all but when I flipped through the pages of Slouching ... I had to have it. You will not be disappointed if you are a fan of poems by Trakl, Rilke, Holderlin etc... Bukowski is one of the giants."},{"Title":"Slouching Toward Nirvana: New Poems","review":"This latest volume of Charles Bukowski's poetry was published posthumously and edited by John Martin. Almost all the poems are highly personal and often told through the voice of a first person narrator who is obviously Bukowski himself. He is nothing if not opinionated. He listens to Sibelius, Wagner and Brahms, reads Auden, Dostoevsky and Hamsun, does not care for visitors, (\\"sometimes I simply ask them to leave/and they do\\") abhors poetry readings and signings (\\"this is the ultimate sellout, Jack.\\") as well as most academic poets or academics of any kind. He doesn't care for Hemingway, (\\"he knew that what he was/killing was already/dead.\\") likes his cats, (\\"I think cats are better than we are\\") alcohol and women-- although he admits that he is not always successful in his affairs-- and detests reviewers, describing them as \\"a dink moralist, a failed young writer or most likely just nothing at all.\\" (I suppose I know what he would have to say about nothing Amazon reviewers.) He thinks about death but isn't obsesssed by it. (\\"death doesn't always come running.\\") After all, he is now past 70 and has beat the odds of not living a long life (\\"because Death after all these years/walks around in the room with me now and speaks softly\\"). He doesn't want a eulogy when he departs this world. \\"it would be nice/if one of my x-ladies was there/wearing too much makeup. . . and a tight green dress. . .\\" He is crazy about horse races, spends a lot of time and money attending them, and hates most movies, particularly those that win awards. (\\"Academy Award?\\", page 86.)Two or three character sketches of Richard Corey types are included here-- a Harry Keel person, \\"admired and feared\\" in school who years later turns up as a down-and-out salesman and Dale Thorpe (\\"golden boy\\"), envied from afar in high school but who has since disappeared-- and a moving poem about a kid who, after the bullies beat him up daily at school, must endure the wrath of his mother because his clothes are ruined (\\"clothes cost money\\").As do all good poets, Mr. Bukowski achieves much with little-- often with biting humor: \\"is what's good for the goose sometimes only good for the/goose?\\" he asks. And he beautifully contrasts youth and old age in \\"beach boys.\\"I watch the young boys on their surfboardsslim strong bodies glidingsome of them will end up in the madhousesome of them will gain 80 poundssome of them will commit suicidemost of them will eventually stop coming to thebeach.The poet, who says we are all \\"museums of fear,\\" eloquently describes his feelings in \\"with his awful teeth,\\" describing \\"this dog Sadness,\\" who is a \\"persistent mongrel.\\"There are literally dozens of similar passages in this collection that you will return to again and again."},{"Title":"Slouching Toward Nirvana: New Poems","review":"For a guy who's been dead since 1994, Charles Bukowski is an amazingly prolific sort. This is the 13th posthumous work to come from the Buk since his death and it's subtitled \\"new poems.\\"The Buk never claimed to be the best person, the best lover, the best writer, the best anything; although I'm sure that at different times and with plenty of beer in him he put forward some extravagant claims of other kinds. I love him, and many, many regular people who feel similarly do so because, I think, he was honest, unsentimental and a great lover of humanity in his poems--even when he is castigating humanity for its ugliness. It's precisely this breadth, which I would call Whitmanesque in its strange multiplicity, that continues to amaze.These are far from his best poems, but there are some gems in here. Bukowski was the kind of poet of which there were and are few to none--a populist who wanted to be left alone, a lonely man who wasn't alone, a craftsman of the finest stamp, somebody who, like Hemingway, got the true words down on paper and knew how to leave it there. There are poems here about the usual Buk concerns: Women, drinking, the track, love, impending death, other writers, fame, bars, working horrible jobs, starving, starving, drinking and writing in boardinghouses; his close and unforgiving (yet deeply sympathetic) portraits of other people trying to push the dharma wheel a few inches forward, usually failing.I won't attempt to do any lit crit pronouncements on this book. It's something to read alone and laugh with, to read openly with other people, to cherish, to keep the fire alive. There's an existential commitment to meaning here, the meaning one places on one's own actions, decisions, follies, joys, tears, life and death. We were fortunate to have him and now fortunate to have all these volumes to keep us warm."},{"Title":"Slouching Toward Nirvana: New Poems","review":"Slouching Toward Nirvana is my first foray into the strange nihilistic and unpretentious world of author Charles Bukowski. In his poem called, \\"the curse,\\" he writes of the unfortunate consequences of fame--the ultimate fragility of Tolstoy, Henry Miller, Hemingway, Celine, Ezra Pound, Hamsun, Ambrose Pierce and van Gogh. He ends with: \\"we are hardly ever / as strong / as that which we / create.\\" In a long poem called \\"The Tide,\\" he writes: \\"most of what we learn / in this crazy life is /what to avoid...like, say, / a fancy ending / to this poem.\\" A sense of humor here.What is most interesting is the man himself--his anti-lit reputation, his popularity, his easy narrative style, and his rage. A number of his books have been published since his death in 1994. And after tasting this one, I am spurred to read more. A review of Slouching Toward Nirvana by Matthew Firth , written in 2005, is illuminating. It gives a good account of the man.And I like his headstone: \\"Don't try.\\""},{"Title":"Slouching Toward Nirvana: New Poems","review":"I bought this last week and read it twice immediately. I'm surprised and pleased by how good Bukowski's unreleased material is. New angles, on classic themes fresh approaches to classic bukowski topics I love this. Definately worth reading especially if you like Buk to begin with, I do... I'll read it again after a few cold beers."},{"Title":"Slouching Toward Nirvana: New Poems","review":"Most poets are struggling to get anything published and can hardly afford to send out less than their best work; so I have to marvel at a poet who intentionally holds back his best for publication after his death. But that's apparently what Bukowski did. I'm curious how many more poems he marked for posthumous release, but I'm not aware if John Martin has said. At any rate, the current batch is topnotch Bukowski and essential to any collection of his work.In the past, one of my pleasures on finding a new Bukowski volume was to note the author photo, which changed from book to book. Now I get the impression that the official photo will be that of of the more avuncular-looking, white-haired Buk wearing his old-man windbreaker and gazing benignly at the camera."},{"Title":"Slouching Toward Nirvana: New Poems","review":"I hate writing reviews. I also hate the consumer as much as the producers of goods for the most part but right now I'm feeling sprendthrift towards humanity due to all the Yuletide cheer. This book is rubbish. Nearly all of the posthumous books released by Black Sparrow/Ecco of Buk's work are fifth-rate, fragments of his glory days of skid-row bum-dom. It's as if they scraped his cancerous boils and produced enough DNA to put his soul back to life in a maggot's body with a Frankenstein's aptitude for producing works of art. The result is echoes of echoes of a former greatness. The rawness of the famed writer is lost in complete drunkenness and scraps of poems that were never published in books because they were leftover material. Maybe that's why John Martin sold off the rights because he couldn't continue to publish a dead man's best of works for obscene sums of money. If they retitled it WORST OF THE WORST: AFTERMATHS OF GLORY Vol. 5 I might feel better about the whole thing. But as is this is vainglorious puke."},{"Title":"Comstar (Battletech)","review":"The ComStar field manual is a useful roleplaying resource, with the unit histories similar to those found in all of the field manuals. I find that it is somewhat less useful than the others, if only because it tries to do too much. The book wastes space explaining 4 different organizational systems (Com Star, Star League, Rasalhague, and Clan). The other manuals had more focus, whereas this apears to be an attempt to throw in every reamining non-great house faction. Can't really blame FASA for that though, as Rasalhague and the SLDF had to get something, and surely dont deserve their own manuals (yet).. overall a sold product, and worth getting eventually, although i recommend picking up some of the others first if you dont really need the ComStar info for a campaign."},{"Title":"Comstar (Battletech)","review":"I have enjoyed all of the Field Manuals to date.

It is about a huge mega-star actor who is up for an academy award. The struggle revolves around the question, can anyone live out the Sermon on the Mount? God says \\"yes\\" and satan says \\"no.\\" There is the \\"wager.\\" (indeed, shades of Job) The story is very descriptive of the inner workings in movie productions. The characters are quite realistic and face problems that do not have simple answers. (you will ponder the outcomes) This makes the story apply to our own real life situations. The bookprovides some fun twists and turns as well as an encouraging and illuminating self examination on how does onelive a righteous life. Included in the back are discussionquestions for each chapter. In my opinion, this book is every bit as good asBill Myers' previous work \\"Eli.\\" This maybe his best work yet."},{"Title":"The Wager","review":"Bill Myers did an amazing work putting this short novel together; a fast-paced yet easy flowing story with believable characters and a plot right out of today's headlines.The Sermon on the Mount has broken the backs of many well-meaning Christians. This book does such a good job of describing the struggle for most followers of Christ that I loved every paragraph, from beginning to end. If you love reading C.S. Lewis, Frank Peretti, or Randy Alcorn, you'll love reading this great story by Mr. Myers.This is now my favorite work by Bill Myers."},{"Title":"The Wager","review":"Few authors are capable of handling what Bill Myers has accomplished with extreme success. The Wager is both a gripping novella and a study in Christian living. Most Bible teachers are not good story tellers and most authors are not good teachers. Myers excels at both. Opening with an enticing page from a screenplay, casting believable characters within the compromising world of Hollywood, Myers forces the reader to consider extremes. If the protagonist Michael T. Steele can live out the teachings of Jesus Christ in corrupt Hollywood, than anyone can. The story is brilliant. The teaching is creative and challenging. The thought provoking questions and dialog compel readers to consider eternal ponderables in light of our confusing and often misguided culture. Undoubtedly, this is a five star book."},{"Title":"The Wager","review":"This combination of the Book of Job and the Sermon on the Mount worked surprisingly well. Myers doesn't fall into cliches or easy answers. It's a bit of an odd idea to combine a novel and a bible study, but if you're not interested in the Bible study, you don't have to do it. It might be interesting. But the book works well as a book without it.The only thing that I didn't care for was the ending, which seemed a bit unrealistic. I don't want to give away too much so I will only say that the career change didn't seem necessary. However, the character of Steele was well-done, the book was funny and the idea of trying to live by the Sermon on the Mount is certainly a good one. I would read more by this author."},{"Title":"The Wager","review":"Your on top of the world. Your a wealthy popular movie star...then the Devil bets God he can turn him from God when he takes away everything. A modern day biblacle story. This is a small book so its a very quick read.

I felt bad for the main character as he lost everything and was cheering through the end."},{"Title":"The Wager","review":"Bill meyers is one of my favorite fiction authors. His fiction is clean, inspiring, and action-packed. This is a parallel story to the struggle Job went through. A story of a man trying to live a section of scripture, something like applying the golden rule or What Would Jesus Do?, but more accurately, as many people think Jesus would do whatever they do. This wager is controlled by Scripture, not by personal whims,prejudices or feelings. Great story line."},{"Title":"The Wager","review":"Satan bets against God's followers one more time in \\"The Wager.\\" Much like in the Old Testament's Book of Job, author Bill Myers casts Hollywood star and Academy Award nominee Michael T. Steel in the starring role as God lets Satan twist the wheels of fate against a believer in order to test his faith and to see if he can live up to the standards set in Jesus' Sermon on the Mount.Steel is put through quite a lot in this story. He's a successful film star, but his marriage has fallen apart. He is accused of pedophilia. He's pushed morally in his latest film. A pesky preacher keeps popping up on the radio and television no matter what frequency or channel Steel picks. Heck, he even gets a nasty rash from poison oak while trying to clear his head.While the pressure mounts, Satan begins to believe that he'll finally get one over on the Big Guy. Does he? You'll have to read \\"The Wager\\" to find out.The message in this story is very good. Myers addresses each section of the Sermon on the Mount (and devotes an entire chapter to the Lord's prayer), but the fictional tale that surrounds the message is tepid at best. The story moves along quickly, too quickly to really drive home the points of the Sermon. Also, there's no real attachment to Steel as he takes on each challenge that he faces.Is this a bad book. Not at all. It's short length will probably attract a few folks who aren't willing to jump into larger stories. A Bible study and reflection guide is included with the story as well. I just wish that Myers had fleshed out the story a bit more."},{"Title":"The Wager","review":"Can't review this book ... still waiting to receive it.

There are examples of how things aren't always as they appear and people especially the media, twist events and words to ruin a person (for example, with Charlie; in the television interview; and regarding the poison oak episode).Michael thinks as a Christian he has to \\"do, do, do\\" and he tries to obey those things in the Sermon on the Mount, symbolically throwing up his hands in frustration knowing he can't live up to it. No way. No how. His sister explains what a relationship with God should look like in the wonderful example she uses of the apple tree. So when the author asks some of the questions at the end of the book such as regarding Chapters 6 and 9, I'm not sure I'm tracking with those (questions).

Find out what happens when a man who has everything accepts a challenge from God. Encouraging and inspiring!"},{"Title":"Close Shave: The Life and Times of Baseball's Sal Maglie","review":"Let's start with the good points about this book. The author's choice of a subject--pitcher Sal Maglie--is a fine one. His research was obviously exhaustive, as he seems to have documented every game Maglie ever pitched in the minor leagues, major leagues, Mexican League and winter leagues.Now for the faults. The writing is truly poor. There are spelling errors, grammar mistakes, sentence fragments, run-on-sentences and more. This, combined with a game-by-game approach to telling Maglie's story made the book a chore for me to wade through. I say that with a sense of sadness, because I can tell how much effort and devotion to the subject went into this book.Sal Maglie seemed to be on a sure track for a major league career, but the combination of World War II and a sojurn in the Mexican League (then an outlaw league in the eyes of organized ball) which led to his suspension for 2 1/2 seasons left him a marginal rookie prospect at age 33. Yet a combination of skill and determination allowed him to become one of the dominant pitchers in the National League during the 1950s. Even when age and injuries seemed to have caught up with the man known as \\"The Barber,\\" he managed more than one dramatic and heroic comeback. It's a great baseball story, and a great human story that deserves a better telling. I think there's still the core of a good book in this manuscript, crying to get out.--William C. Hall"},{"Title":"Close Shave: The Life and Times of Baseball's Sal Maglie","review":"As a lifelong baseball fan with vivid memories of Sal Maglie, this book was a terrible disappointment. I bought it with high hopes of learning more about exactly what this book promises in its sub-title: the \\"life and times\\" of one of my childhood heroes and one of Major League baseball's truly fascinating and enigmatic figures. Instead, the reader learns almost nothing about Maglie-the-man and is subjected to an endless stream of data concerning just about every game in which Maglie ever participated, from his early days in the minors through his last days with the St. Louis Cardinals. The eyes of even the most ardent fan of 1940s and 50s baseball are likely to glaze over after a few paragraphs--not to mention quite a few chapters--of this.Strike One: The author's prose isn't just dull and flatter than home plate; it frequently borders on illiterate. OK, not everyone who writes about baseball is an artist like Red Smith or Roger Kahn. But readers of even the most ordinary sports book have a right to prose that isn't full of awkward sentences littered with errors of grammar, punctuation, word usage and even spelling, and they shouldn't have to plow through long paragraphs where the sentences meander aimlessly, with no logical connection to one another, as if the writer were randomly transcribing note cards.Strike Two: There's an even more serious problem with this book than bad writing, which is that Mr. Szalontai presents and defends two contradictory claims. On one hand he wants us to believe that Sal Maglie was a true American hero, a man who overcame all sorts of obstacles--early failures, black-listing, injuries, old age--to forge a successful baseball career. On the other hand, he presents Maglie as a homicidal maniac. The author keeps insisting that Maglie not only threw at batters--which he definitely did--but that he threw at batters' HEADS, with the intention of HITTING them in the head. This is a debatable claim. If it were true, Maglie, with his pinpoint control, would have beaned a lot more batters than he did and it's very likely he would have severely injured if not actually killed a number of them, which of course did not happen. Szalontai uses the word \\"beaning\\" incorrectly, to refer to any hit batsman. He ought to know it's a specialized term that should be used only to describe a pitcher hitting a batter in the \\"bean,\\" or head, with a pitched ball, and not to describe the batter being bonked anywhere else on his body.Strike Three: A final complaint is that the author relied entirely on old newspaper files, books and a few magazine articles for his information. He never interviewed any sportswriters or team officials from Maglie's era, any of Maglie's numerous surviving teammates, or any members of the Maglie family. The players who knew Maglie are now in their 70s and 80s and are dying almost daily. To give just two examples of missed opportunities: Maglie's NY Giants teammate and fellow pitcher Hoyt Wilhelm died just a few weeks ago and Maglie's favorite and most frequent catcher, Wes Westrum, died in May of 2002. Surely Mr. Szalontai could have gleaned some new and interesting insights into Maglie from talking to these men.This could have been a terrific book about a colorful era and one of its most exciting players--a real literary home run. But sad to say, despite all the patient research that went into it, the book is dull, badly written and superficial. As a portrait of Sal Maglie it's strictly \\"three strikes and you're out!\\""},{"Title":"Close Shave: The Life and Times of Baseball's Sal Maglie","review":"Thorough look at the baseball career of Maglie. Sal was a casual acquaintance of mine when I lived in WNY years ago. He liked me because he thought I was a true baseball fan, especially my recollection of the no-hitter he hurled at Ebbets Field against the Phillies. That came during the final week of a very close three team race during the last week of the 1956 season in a \\"must win\\" game for the Dodgers. That's in this book, as are virtually all the games he pitched.

The book introductions, study notes, and commentaries are all first-rate. I am fortunate enough to own 2 copies of this now out-of-print Bible. I have owned a leather copy for the past 14 years and it is still in great shape. I also own a hard cover edition that I keep in my Christian book library.I understand that this Study Bible was later re-released as The Baptist Study Edition and is now also out-of-print. Although I am not a Baptist, I find this a wonderful Study Bible, and highly recommend it to any student of The Bible.I would hope that Thomas Nelson will once again put this Bible in print, as it is a shame that it is no longer available. I would also love to see it available in large print."},{"Title":"Fighting Rawhide","review":"\\"Fighting Rawhide\\" is a classic western novel pitting ranchers against farmers.

After all, his motive for killing was bizarre to say the least-- he wanted to keep the men he picked up from leaving him. Then a few years later I picked up Brian Masters' Killing for Company almost by chance-- It was shocking: here was Dahmer's mirror image in a quiet British civil servant named Dennis Nilson. For some reason his crimes had not been publicized in the US.Nilson's crimes had been discovered in 1983 when the plumbing in his apartment buildng started to back up. Workmen were called in and discovered what looked like human flesh was the problem. The police questioned Nilson who confessed to his crime. He had been actively killing young men for 4 years and using their bodies in bizarre tableaus of domesticity and no one had noticed--would probably not have noticed had it not been that his plumbing couldn't handle his method of body disposal.Masters' book does a very good job of laying out Nilson's life. It is definitely not a quickie books churned out to take advantage of a sensational crime. If you are at all interesed in the darkest, most tabu areas of the human soul this is a very interesting read."},{"Title":"Courts of Babylon: Tales of Greed and Glory in The Harsh New World of Professional Tennis","review":"This is the best book on this subject. The depth of the sociological analysis of the Open era is unprecedented. The strength of this book is due to Bodo's back and forth dual approach. In one chapter, he will paint a broad and often scathing analytical brush on one aspect of the Open era. He may even focus on the change in character of one Gran Slam tournament (Wimbledon, U.S. Open). But, the very next chapter he will likely focus on one single star and essentially write a biography about them based on his multitude of interviews he had with most of them.Prior to the Open era, Bodo explains how tennis stood for sportsmanship, ethics, and educated well-rounded personalities catering to a sophisticated public. As a case in point, he mentions the many members of the Australian dynasty in the 50s, 60s, and early 70s who were all models of sportsmanship, and humility. They also did well in their tennis after life. These included legendary names like Laver, Rosewall, Emerson, and Newcomb among many others. On the American side, you had a series of college-educated players with mature personalities, including Dennis Ralston, Arthur Ashe, Charlie Pasarell, Stan Smith, and Bob Lutz. Some of them crossed over the Open era. But, they came from an old guard when tennis and its stars stood for something different than after the Open era.The Open era officially started in 1968. But, per Bodo it kicked into gear in 1976 with the advent of Bjorn Borg, and Connors. All of a sudden, the game became corrupted by relentless commercialization. The money got so huge that it killed sportsmanship, humility, education, and well roundedness. The college game disappeared. If you are good enough for the pros at 18, forget college. All of a sudden tennis is manufactured as a sensational show that is becoming more like pro mud wrestling than gentlemanly tennis. The stars have become self-adulating, spoiled, uneducated, neurotic, unbalanced millionaire teenagers who will do anything to win a match. Their conduct is symmetrically opposite to the Australian heroes of yesteryears (Laver, Newcomb, etc...). But, the new stars are considered \\"colorful\\" and good for Nielsen ratings. The better-adjusted old guard sportsmanship is considered dull and unmarketable. Pete Sampras is a case in point. He was one of the greatest players of all times. He was also among the very few and ultimate sportsman in his era. But, instead of being adulated and emulated he was criticized by the public and ignored by the sponsors as being too dull.What is really interesting about the mini biographies Bodo writes about the super stars is how unexpected they are. Often, the villains come across so much better once you get to know them better. Connors, Lendl, McEnroe, and Seles all come across as much more balanced, and more interesting than you would expect. They seem much more likeable than their on court persona. Some of their rivalries also make for a fascinating read. On the other hand, everyone's good guy Borg is a pathological Greek tragedy. Of course Borg was an incredible sportsman much like the Australians were. But, he was a monolithic truly dysfunctional character who could not see his place anywhere in the world outside of being number one. Out of all former champions, retirement has been most cruel to Borg because he had nothing to fall back on. He had no side interest, and no life to speak off outside tennis. He made an embarrassing attempt to return to tennis playing with wood racquets in an era of carbon graphite and Teflon. He failed miserably loosing to journeymen.Bodo's book stops in the early 90s. He acknowledges at the end of the book that the Open era seemed to have turned the corner with a more sportsmanlike young emerging generation of American champions (Chang, Courier, Agassi, and Sampras). The great generation of emerging champions Bodo mentioned all have retired (except for Agassi, and as of this writing he may be months from doing so). They have been replaced by a group of interesting foreigners who may prove ultimately better for the game as the talent is more diversified.Bodo's book even outclasses a series of excellent books on the same subject, including: \\"Bad News for McEnroe\\" by Bill Scanlon, and \\"Tennis Confidential\\" by Paul Fein. \\"You Can't Be Serious\\" by John McEnroe is in a lesser league because as one can expect it is so much more self-centered than the others. Yet, it is still an excellent and very entertaining book. This tells you how much I have appreciated all these books, and Bodo's above all."},{"Title":"Courts of Babylon: Tales of Greed and Glory in The Harsh New World of Professional Tennis","review":"This book was so easy to read- the reader is swept into the intrigue invovlved in the women's professional tennis tour. Peter Bodo is not afraid to ask important questions: should players forgo high school and college to attempt to cash in? What sacrifices are called for to produce a champion? Who controls the money in the women's game?More importantly, Bodo interviews his subjects and lets the reader understand something of their personalities as well as their approach to tennis.An exciting, fun book that makes you think."},{"Title":"Courts of Babylon: Tales of Greed and Glory in The Harsh New World of Professional Tennis","review":"Bodo's look at the Open Era of tennis (1968-present) is the best in existence. This book is detailed, probing, funny, and has a historical perspective usually missing from books in this genre. I particularly like his psychological analysis of several famous players. Oh, and Bodo knows his tennis, too, and has interesting things to say about the strengths and weaknesses of many of the game's stars. This is really a cut above almost every other book written about the sport."},{"Title":"Courts of Babylon: Tales of Greed and Glory in The Harsh New World of Professional Tennis","review":"The author clearly is a knowledgeable insider of long standing and speaks with authority and personal acquaintance with the outstanding figures in the era of professional tennis.

No holds are barred and Peter Bodo offers his personal constructive suggestions to deal with what he views as the major problems on both the men's and women's circuits.A spellbinder and a must for any true tennis buff.I loved it"},{"Title":"Courts of Babylon: Tales of Greed and Glory in The Harsh New World of Professional Tennis","review":"I bought this book because it had excellent ratings and it does justice to its reputation. Bodo does a fantastic job of fleshing out the personality of each superstar, and the article on Religion in tennis is very different, to say the least...."},{"Title":"Courts of Babylon: Tales of Greed and Glory in The Harsh New World of Professional Tennis","review":"It is hard to remember just what a freak show professional tennis was in the 1970's and into the 80's. The original bad boy of tennis - Ilie Nastase would spit at his opponents. A former man wanted to play as a woman. Jimmy Conners firing tennis balls next to lines people he disagreed with.And this book documents it all - all the major players and many of the ones who had their moment in the sun and slipped away into relative obscurity. The train wreck that Martina Navratilova put herself through with all her different partners. The real humanity beneath the Ice Queen media image of Chris Evert. The money train that Bjorn Borg simply walked away from after finally losing Wimbledon.I certainly enjoyed going back over so much of this history that has faded into the mists of time as today's tennis tour presents it's very professional and controlled stars today."},{"Title":"Courts of Babylon: Tales of Greed and Glory in The Harsh New World of Professional Tennis","review":"This book is like re-living the 1980's end of the amateur & beginning of the professional tennis eras in technicolor, the heroes, the villains and everyday life.

Conrady). Granted, it is not easy going. Boyle offers extensive contextualisation of his subject and thereby provides something of an introduction to such figures as Herder for the uninitiated. If you want the latest word on Goethe, this is it."},{"Title":"Goethe: The Poet and the Age: Volume I: The Poetry of Desire (1749-1790) (Goethe, the Poet of the Age)","review":"There are two points of interest here, one being the life of Goethe, the second being the job that Boyle has done in presenting it. As to Boyle's work, I would be hard pressed to reconstruct the details of my own life with anything approaching the thoroughness provided here by Boyle. This is virtually a day to day account from birth to age 40, multidimensionally presented as Boyle meticulously places Goethe in the total context of his environment and provides us with the background to judge the development of the young Goethe as both artist and man. The faults of this biography, some of them existing by sheer volume and weight of content, are many and obvious. But, the imperfections are also in my view irrelevant to the tremendous accomplishment of the work as a whole. First, be informed that Boyle is a first rate intellect who is almost as able as his subject to a clarity of expression and penetrating insight that one finds only in the best minds. Boyle is possessed of the intellectual talent to provide a synthesis of man, history, environment, religious and philosophical ideas as well as standard universal human values and emotions, which makes this biography unique in its all encompassing presentation of its subject. It is apparent from the beginning that Boyle is attempting to provide to the reader the development in all phases as Goethe passes through age 40, which is when this book ends. Secondly, Boyle provides thorough scholarship and obvious effort. It seems that Boyle has read every published word written by Goethe and much that has been written about him, and in addition to the mere reading has studied and logically glued together and digested the life in all its dimensions. While many biographies purport the same, the extent taken here appears to me to be unmatched. The results of this highly energetic undertaking is basically to subsume whatever imperfections exist in the work to give us what undoubtedly is the best biography of Goethe,and, I suspect, also the best biography, period. This review would be incomplete without a word about my reaction to Goethe himself, for this is an author who sparks an unusual amount of attention on the other side of the Atlantic, and after reading of the first 40 years of his life I would say the stage had been set by then as to how Goethe would subsequently be called the German Shakespeare. One of the first to write a biography of Goethe in English was George Henry Lewes, better known as the husband of George Eliot of Middlemarch and Silas Marner fame. And, I must add, after reading Boyle's work that this is an entertaining and fascinating life backgrounded by a spectacular but little understood German culture of the time, as we witness Goethe, the determined agnostic attempt to find a meaning for his life without religion. How this is done in the first 40 years provides for the reader a rewarding, entertaining experience, and also much food for thought."},{"Title":"Goethe: The Poet and the Age: Volume I: The Poetry of Desire (1749-1790) (Goethe, the Poet of the Age)","review":"This is the first of three volumes (the third is still being written); it should go without saying that it is a scholarly biography, but based on some reviews, apparently it does need to be said. At some level, it is a reference book, but one can also enjoy it by reading selected sections. I am not a literature scholar by any means, and at first, this book intimidated me. The first chapter was excellent, but then I got bogged down in the next chapter due to deep discussion of literary theory and religious arguments. But I slogged on, and then was mesmerized by the half dozen pages describing the relationship between Goethe and Charlotte von Stein. Now I realize that one can enjoy this book by reading quickly those portions that are not so interesting and then read leisurely those portions that excite you. This 3-volume biography is clearly not for those who only enjoy drive-through fast-food restaurants, but for those who enjoy long drawn out multi-course banquets. One last thought: there are so many good things to say about this book, that to list any one thing is inadequate, but the fact that Nicholas Boyle includes the translation to every entry in German is wonderful. For those who say the book doesn't give a good picture of what Goethe was really like, or what his home life was like, after reading the section concerning 1775 - 1786, I come away feeling I know Goethe pretty well: his expertise in government made me think of Kissinger; his poetry, of course, rivals Shakespeare; his passion for women makes me think of any number of Romantics; and, his interest in science makes me think of Darwin. Maybe by the time I finish all three volumes I will realize I am completely wrong, but it's a good starting point."},{"Title":"Goethe: The Poet and the Age: Volume I: The Poetry of Desire (1749-1790) (Goethe, the Poet of the Age)","review":"This is a magnificent biography. Nicholas Boyle, the Schr&ouml;der Professor of German at Cambridge University, brilliantly portrays Goethe's first forty years, setting him in his social, political and cultural contexts.Boyle is also superbly perceptive about Goethe's work and about his relationship to the intellectual and aesthetic currents in late 18th-century German and European culture. For example, he notes, \\"For absolute individualism belongs only in a theatre of inner conflict, not in a theatre of external conflict between worldly forces, and so is in the end the hand-maid of state absolutism.\\"Boyle also observes that Goethe had no religion: \\"There is no room for the fancies of reincarnation.\\" Goethe simply acknowledges our mortality: \\"we are together like this only once.\\""},{"Title":"Goethe: The Poet and the Age: Volume I: The Poetry of Desire (1749-1790) (Goethe, the Poet of the Age)","review":"When I started Vol. One, I realized I would need adjust to Boyle's prose style, and wanted to be sure it would be worth it (I am not an academic). I googled the work and found a review that said the same thing, and that also insisted it was well worth it. It was. I'm about to finish the second volumne and will be anxiously awaiting the third. The work is aptly named -- The Poet and the Age -- keep reading..."},{"Title":"Goethe: The Poet and the Age: Volume I: The Poetry of Desire (1749-1790) (Goethe, the Poet of the Age)","review":"One would be hard pressed to find a better subject for a literary biography than Goethe. Not only is he a major literary figure, one of those few who could be said to have truly shaped their national culture, not only is his enormous oeuvre is little read outside his home country, not only is he so marginal in the minds of English readers that his name is perpetually mispronounced and his most significant work, Faust, is continually assumed to be identical to other works of the same name, but--perhaps not so incredibly considering all else I have mentioned--there is absolutely no competition in the market for biographies of this amazing man. Which makes Nicholas Boyle's work all the more unfortunate, I'm afraid.There can be no question that Boyle is well-familiar with Goethe's work, and the context of his long life. However, he communicates neither very well. A few bright moments poke through in the text, such as the fine description of the household in which Goethe grew up, but the reader generally finds himself at a loss when attempting to picture the type of life which Goethe lived. Esoteric religious concerns and theories about the effect of the German political situation on the souls of its people cloud what could have been a fascinating look at another time and place with distracting, and ultimately useless, complexities. Even worse is Boyle's approach to Goethe's work. One should have perhaps been warned by the author's decision to regiment &quot;life&quot; and &quot;work&quot; into alternate chapters that the work would be subjected to, and ultimately consumed by, a light but continual barrage of literary theory which, while it does not reach the absurd heights of which academia is often capable, manages to render the power of Goethe's poetry and fiction effectively lifeless. That is a formidable achievement indeed, and one which literary biographers, as a whole, should strive to avoid.I am still waiting for a biography of Goethe worthy of him, a man whose literary relevance is unquestionable--Pushkin, Hugo and Shakespeare, perhaps, are the only others who can match him, and whoever writes the story of his life should attempt to show this truth, rather than obscure it unnecessarily, as Boyle has done.Two stars, one for the minimum, and one for what it might have been."},{"Title":"Goethe: The Poet and the Age: Volume I: The Poetry of Desire (1749-1790) (Goethe, the Poet of the Age)","review":"If a person enjoys a scholarly biography with a lot of esoteric detail, this is a biography for him.

A good editor could do something with this material to produce a fabulous biography."},{"Title":"Film As Social Practice","review":"This book makes a good text for beginning film students who need an understanding of film history as well as a picture of the ways media affect our lives. It presents film as interactive, not only in terms of the immediate experience, but in the ways audiences affect the daily decisions made in the business and in the ways today's educated film goers affect the uses directors and writers can make of the medium. Readers gain insight into the mysterious ways movies are born, into the major film theories, and into the way film-makers see their movies as part of a larger social context.The lay reader with a general interest in film will find the chapter on Westerns interesting because it explores a genre in depth and reveals how the movies see genre as a symbolic language. Although the word &quot;genre&quot; itself appears frequently in film reviews, readers generally do not seem to fully understand its importance to the movie business.The book summarizes creative, economic, and historical issues regarding film as a pervasive influence in our lives as more and more movies extend themselves into markets beyond the entity of the celluloid itself. All the peripherals such as action toys, books, music, videos, cereal, clothing, etc. are explored to help us realize the global impact movies have throughout our daily existence.If you like the movies and want to understand more about them as a world wide phenomenon, this is a good overview."},{"Title":"Handmaid's Tale (Bloom's Guides)","review":"This is a useful study guide to help better understand the text.

She knows a lot of the things they do are not quite right, but she follows them anyway. Once she gets to her homeland, she meets a man who is very different from her, but seems to know more about her culture than she does. The romance in this book is almost treated secondary to the good versus evil story that is threaded throughout the book.

It's still a good book, and worth the time to read."},{"Title":"The Sorceress & the Savage","review":"Don't get me wrong. Saranne Dawson has written some good books in the Romance/Fantasy sub-genre. The ideas are mostly original and intriguing. I've bought some of her books on the promise of the idea alone. This book though, just does not appeal to me. I'm 50% done and slugging through the rest. I'm a huge fan of the Romance and Fantasy genre, but for the romance to work, the reader has to care for the hero and heroine. To put it bluntly, if the enemy did them both in, I won't shed a tear. I give it a 3, because it did hold my interest for a while and the great cover. Ms Dawson can do much better than this."},{"Title":"The Sorceress & the Savage","review":"I found this to be a tough read. I normally enjoy reading about primitive heros, but normally a romance author will portray them as somehow more civilized and honorable than the outwardly civilized villains. Gar, the hero in this story, was boring, and the character epiphany I kept expecting never materialized. He never seemed like a fully fleshed-out human being to me. The heroine annoyed me as well. All in all, it was a struggle to finish. I skim-read the last third of the book and heaved a sigh of relief when I was done."},{"Title":"The Sorceress & the Savage","review":"It's not often that I come across a romance that is actually unique. This author did a wonderful job blending together fantasy and romance. The story is original and the characters are likeable... The heroine is strong yet retains her femininity. The hero is sweet without compromising is alpha male status.I am so tired of the typical romance heros and heroines that bicker through 90% of the novel and keep themselves apart for no reason other than pure stubborness. These two are honest with themselves from the beginning, their reasons for having to be apart are understandable and realistic.There were only three things that I did not like about this novel:1.The hero was annoyingly dense at some parts, I just wanted to reach into the book and smack him upside the head. :)2. The action scenes weren't exciting enough, but that has been a problem with every romance I've read that has action. 3. There weren't enough love scenes. This author did a great job writing the initial love scene, it was erotic and romantic. I got the impression while reading this that she was afraid of overdoing the lovemaking scene descriptions, far too many romance writers do this. But aren't these scenes the main reason for reading this genre? (Unless of course you are a fan of the Regency subgenre, which I am not)Still, this book deserves 5 stars. I highly recommend it if you are looking for something a little bit different."},{"Title":"The Sorceress & the Savage","review":"I've read just about everything by this author and this is another great story. I read between 1,500 to 4,000 pages a month so sometimes it seems like I'm reading the same book over and over and can predict what will happen. That's one problem I've never had with any of Ms Dawson's books. In this book the melding of reality with fantasy kept me on the edge of my seat and I read it in less than 24 hours. The growth of both main characters warmed my heart, since that's what all of us want in real life. Some may be offended by the seeming infidelity. I'd recommend it for anyone tired of the same old plots in romance novels."},{"Title":"The Sorceress & the Savage","review":"Great fantasy read.

Ernest Best points out that the Thessalonians have experienced some rough times, and that Paul is praising them for holding on to their faith and sharing it with others. He stresses that they they should keep this up, because the Lord is coming soon.Best believes that Paul was responsible for both 1 and 2 Thessalonians and that the end times positions of the two epistles are not as different as critical scholars have suggested.The commentary itself has the footnotes buried within the text of the commentary, which makes for tougher and choppier reading. Moreover, not everyone will be convinced that Best's interpretations are always best. For example, some will disagree with interpreting skenos in 1 Thessalonians 4:3 as a reference to the believer's \\"wife\\" rather than to the believer's own body.Moreover, some will feel Best is chastising Paul too hard for his statement about the reference to the Jews killing Jesus in 1 Thessalonians 2:14. Best sees it as an example of Paul spouting anti-semitic rhetoric. But since Paul is Jewish and he elsewhere expresses his great love for his people (Romans 9-11), it would be better to see this as a bitter disagreement among family members. Paul is upset that many of his Jewish brothers have not only rejected the idea of Jesus' messiahship, but try to hinder others from coming to Christ. He castigates his Jewish brothers for their role in the death of Christ, just as the prophets of the Old Testament often castigated their own people for their role in rejecting God's will (Isaiah 1:4, 5:24, Jeremiah 2:11.Best also discusses the teaching in 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, rightfully noting that the final destination of the living and deceased believers in Christ is left \\"hanging in the air.\\"In 2 Thessalonians, he points out that Paul is not denying the suddenness of the Lord's return, but that he is qualifying it by teaching that it will come suddenly after the revelation of the man of lawlessness. This interpretation can be questioned.Another questionable call is that Best sees the katechon holding back the man of lawlessness (2 Thess 2:6-7) as a reference to an evil person or force. But why would evil hold back evil? It's possible, but it makes better sense to say that good holds back evil.It's not always easy to read, but you will learn a lot from this commentary. Read it along with Leon Morris' Eerdmans commentary on these epistles."},{"Title":"First and Second Epistles to the Thessalonians","review":"He is very thoughtful.

(Which I think is out of print ... a bloody shame, since this is a really great book!!)The author carefully goes through the chess tournaments, (10 great and classic events, London, 1851 &amp; 1883; through San Antonio, 1972); and carefully tells you all about the event. You often get many of the best games, a crosstable, MANY fascinating and entertaining stories ... it IS the next best thing to being there.There are DOZENS of games in here, carefully and well-annotated, in the style Andy is famous for. The mistakes are made clear, as well as many of the inside stories of the games themselves. (Where he got all this great stuff, I haven't a clue!!)I have owned this book since 1975 or '76, I practically know it by heart. It is now a great resource, I refer to it often to annotate games.Can I say anything bad about this book? Not really. The only valid knocks on this book are: A.) It is out of print, and B.) It is in descriptive notation. (Hint to the publisher!)IF you love chess, and don't have a big library, you will enjoy this book.

Read her comments after you read the story. Otherwise, great work."},{"Title":"The Oxford Book of American Short Stories","review":"&quot;The Oxford Book of American Short Stories,&quot; edited by Joyce Carol Oates, is an impressive anthology. The editor herself is well-known as a master writer of short stories, so you know that she has insights into the genre.This is a truly sweeping anthology. The authors (56 altogether) range chronologically from Washington Irving (1783-1859) to Pinckney Benedict (b. 1964). Many of the &quot;giants&quot; of U.S. literature, among them a number of Nobel and Pulitzer recipients, are included: Herman Melville (&quot;The Paradise of Bachelors...&quot;), Edgar Allan Poe (&quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;), Edith Wharton (&quot;A Journey&quot;), Saul Bellow (Something to Remember Me By&quot;), etc.In her introduction, Oates notes that one of her goals in this anthology was to present &quot;[f]amiliar names, unfamiliar titles.&quot; Thus, it is rewarding to see stories like &quot;Cannibalism in the Cars,&quot; by Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain). But she does, in some cases, include an author's best-known story (like Charlotte Perkins Gilman's &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot;). A good balance overall.Oates also includes many authors who represent ethnic currents in U.S. literature: African-American, Jewish, Native American, Latina, and Asian-American. There are also a number of &quot;regional&quot; writers.There is a wide variety of themes and stylistic approaches represented in this book. I was particularly interested in those stories that represent various forms of American vernacular speech: Jean Toomer's &quot;Blood-Burning Moon,&quot; Eudora Welty's &quot;Where Is That Voice Coming From?&quot;, etc. I was also pleased at the inclusion of one of Ray Bradbury's masterful science fiction tales (the haunting &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot;).Obviously, an anthology of this nature will not please everybody perfectly; I'm sure many readers will name favorite stories and authors whom they would have liked to have seen included in this collection. Personally, I would have added a story each by Alice Walker, Hisaye Yamamoto, Samuel Delany, H.P. Lovecraft, and Octavia Butler. But overall, this is a fine anthology, good both for classroom use and individual recreational reading."},{"Title":"The Oxford Book of American Short Stories","review":"When I went to graduate school for a course of study that involved primarily reading, I did not want to spend too much free time reading. Because I find it hard to put down a book that I enjoy, it was hard to commit to a novel. So I became a devoted reader of short stories, including many anthologies and collections.This collection by Joyce Carol Oates was, hands down, the best that I ever encountered.

Still, most collections have not only the same authors but the same stories, over and over. Oates self-consciously set out to be a little different: she chooses many stories and a few authors who often do not get much \\"air time.\\" Still, the selections are first rate even if not first run. Her introductions are good but a tad personal and very short so do not expect much biographic or historical context.

Dennis was a talented, Atlanta-based writer who lived a short, hard-luck life and never received his proper due. From 1974-1977, Dennis penned twelve novels about an unlicensed Atlanta private-eye named Hardman.I tracked down an old copy of the second Hardman novel, The Charleston Knife's Back in Town. The plot of the book is simple - a group of gamblers are robbed of their cash. The gamblers then hire The Charleston Knife - a sadistic killer - to get revenge against the robbers. Hardman - and his trusty partner, Hump Evans - end up in the middle of the case.Dennis' plotting is decent, but it's not the reason to read the Hardman books. The books excel at bringing the seedy side of 1970s Atlanta to life. Dennis knows the city well. Also, the Hardman books really are hard-boiled - there isn't a lot of preaching or moralizing. Instead, Dennis keeps the books moving with action and interesting plot twists. Finally, Hardman is a likable, well-drawn character. The relationship between the white, ex-cop Hardman and the black, ex-football player Hump adds a layer of interest to the novels.At first glance, the Hardman novels don't look like much. They are numbered and the packaging is \\"lame.\\" The look reminds the reader of the awful, \\"series\\" men's adventure novels. However, these books are much better than that. Fans of hard-boiled fiction will want to track down The Charleston Knife's Back in Town and the other Hardman novels."},{"Title":"1000 Best Casino Gambling Secrets","review":"for an absolute beginner or for a seasoned gambler, this book is easy to understand and is full of useful tips. the book is written in a numbered order 1 - 1000, with the tips broken down into chapters or sections pertaining to each facet of the gaming industry.

Each story is titled after a woman's name, and the plots are clever and very tightly written. My favorite Saint stories are the short stories from this era, and Saint Errant is the first such collection. This new Black Dagger edition is very nice, and features a nicely designed green dustjacket."},{"Title":"Saint Errant","review":"Leslie Charteris, a dynamic young Englishman, created one of crime fiction's most memorable characters - the mocking, ruthless, amoral Simon Templar aka \\"Sebastian Tombs\\" aka \\"The Saint\\"in the late 20s. The early Saint was indeed a \\"modern Robin Hood,\\" robbing the criminal underworld for his own personal gain. In novels like \\"The Last Hero\\" and \\"The Saint In New York\\" (two amazing fictions filled with violence, humor and tragedy - Simon's character developed by leaps and bounds. When WW2 broke out, Charteris had Simon emigrate to America where he worked against the Naziis. As the 50s loomed on the horizon, Charteris - perhaps mirroring elements in his own wanderlust life - fashioned Templar a well-known \\"citizen of the world\\" - always on the move, with no fixed location or love. The stories in SAINT ERRANT are from this latter period and are among the best (including the last one in the book, where Simon is killed).Read and your own risk: like popcorn or shrimp or M&Ms;, you can't stop with just one."},{"Title":"Saint Errant","review":"This, the last Saint book to feature Patricia Holm, consists of nine short stories, each bearing a lady's name.

On the plus side of this easy reading book is that the characters seem to be at least reasonably believable and likeable. On the negative side is the unlikely employment of the protagonist as a labor union organizer and the leader of the Americans attempting to establish a new style of government in Thuringia during the 30 years war!I rated this book &quot;4 stars&quot; on the basis of a fairly good concept for a AH/Sci Fi novel but a very spotty job in execution. If the author were able to avoid some of the &quot;politically correct&quot; drivel it would have been alot better."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"The premise of the story intrigued me, and I bit. A modern day city is inexplicably cast into the past (guess what year?) and must contend with one 17th Century catastrophe after another. Alternate history books are great, but the greatest of all is when the present and past are mixed together like this. The action is nonstop, and the characterization is superb. I couldn't read it fast enough, and after about 50 pages, I ran to the computer to order its sequel, 1633. I am not an expert in history, so I'm not saddled with the need to pick apart whether there were any errors or not. I just simply enjoyed every page of this fantastic escape."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Eric Flint's 1632 is one of the spate of Alternative History books stranding modern Americans in some remote past. Like S.M. Stirling's Island in the Sea of Time, Flint's Americans are a mix, but not as natural a mix as Stirling creates. I got the feeling I was reading the script to an old WW2 movie with all the requiste types sometimes. This notwithstanding, Flint creates a dilemma and like the best of the alternative historians, plays it out to its inevitable conclusion.Written painlessly, Flint's book celebrates the virtues of the disappearing American Union Worker, who according to the world Flint portrays is the last bastion of true American values, while the middle-class is not willing to extend the franchise to all who desire it.What makes this book so good is that it's basis in the 30 years war is so well done. The mercenary armies of Tilly and Wallenstein ravage the countryside in the name of the Pope, while King Gustavus Augustus leads Protestant Sweden against them. The injection of modern American materialism, expectations of political freedom, and willingness to use massive force is dynamic, compelling, and alternatively stirring, horrifying, and amusing.A good read, a good lesson. Well worth your time &amp; money."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I will freely admit that I haven't read science fiction in over a decade. And I suppose this book doesn't qualify as true SF... it is, instead, alternative history that is written in a plain-spoken, yet truly enlightening style.Set in the year 1632, near the epicenter of the bloody Thirty Years War in Germany, a tiny West Virginia coal town mysteriously appears. Its population, infrastructure, vehicles and dwellings are intact. Most importantly for the citizens - some of whom witness a bloody war crime - their modern weapons are functional.The scope of 1632 is daunting - it deals with issues of religion, warfare, nation-building, politics and citizenship - but it does so in an engaging and entirely non-threatening way. The book is truly exciting and inspirational - not to mention instructive in its explanation of the Thirty Years War and the cast of historical characters that played roles in it.The only minor issue I would take with it are that some of the West Virginian characters come off as too righteous to ever exist in real life. The author's afterword, in fact, attempts to address this topic - and does so effectively.It's my belief that Robert A. Heinlein would be quite a fan of Flint. His _Farnham's Freehold_, _Moon is a Harsh Mistress_ and _Starship Troopers_ all are siblings to 1632. Very well done, Mr. Flint!"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"As the title of my review indicates, I didn't really expect to enjoy this book all that much. I like hard science fiction, but, outside of Harry Turtledove, I have never been very interested in alternat history sci-fi.I bought the book solely by dint of the fact that it was published by Baen books. Baen is the major publisher of military sci-fi, and my experience has been that most Baen books are worth reading, and that Jim Baen, the publisher, has a very good eye for entertaining writing. 1632 grabbed my interest from the beginning and justified my trust in the Baen imprimature.In addition to the standard scenes of combat, Flint has done a wonderful job of telling a story that contrasts the liberal, western democratic ideals of today with the brutal practices of the 17th century. In addition, he comments on a variety of important social issues, by forcing his characters to reevaluate deeply held personal beliefs about discrimination, the moral use of deadly force, and the nature of democratic rule.By transposing an idealized community of small-town Americans into a world whose practices are utterly oppsed to their beleifs, Flint also forces us to examine the delicate nature of our civilation and the thinness of its veneer, as well as the fact that many of our cherished beleifs and practices are workable only because we are civilized.Wow, that was deep.But if you really aren't interested in all that, then just get the book because its terrifically exciting, well writted, and will keep you turning pages as fast as you can. This is the type of book that is so well paced, and tells such a fascinating story, that you will want to finish it all in one sitting."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Meticulously researched, 1632 is an alternate history novel that really looks at the concept of castaways in time. In many ways better than Steve Sterling's Nantucket series, 1632 disguises a serious and thoughtful message about what makes Americans different, and why. &quot;Millions for defense, not one cent for tribute!&quot; The rallying cry of a set of normal West Virginia mountain people, mostly coal miners, whose first reaction when they get plunked down in Thuringia in the midst of the 30 Years' War is to go to the aid of the country folk who are being ridden over, pillaged and raped by the mercenary armies who rampaged through Germany. It is obvious why Flint picked 1632...because of the Battle of Lutzen, which, in the real time line, was the death of Gustavus Adolphus, and the last chance to unify Germany until the 1870's. Yet Gustavus, King of Sweden, had already done what made the United States possible. At Breitenfeld, by beating Tilly and the Empire, he had enshrined the principle of religious freedom such that the American Founders were able to write it into the Constitution with little or no dissent. Women's Lib, democracy, and the American Revolution 150 years early, and in the middle of Germany...the ideas come fast and furious, and so does the action. The attack of the Croats on the Grantsville High School is one of the best single pieces of action writing I've ever read. Hurry up, Eric, and get 1633 and 1634 written."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Every now and then I come across a book that's so original--and so beautifully written--that it makes me, as a fellow author, wish... that I'd written it! 1632 is such a book. Indeed, I don't know when I've had the pleasure of reading a more thoughtful and, at the same time, thoroughly entertaining novel. Yes, Flint's premise--that a small town in the coal country of northern West Virginia could somehow be transported without any warning whatsoever to 17th-century Thuringia--is a shade flimsy. But, once the good citizens of Grantville find themselves thrust into the hellish maelstrom that was Germany during the Thirty-Years War, the story rapidly comes together, and the characters, minor as well as major, Germans, Scots, Swedes, and Sephardic Jews, as well as Applachian-bred Americans, behave in a fashion thoroughly consistent with the circumstances in which they find themselves. In fact, one of the strong points of this marvelous novel is its depth of characterization, something all too rare in this genre. To be sure, the juxtapositions between Flint's well-drawn characters are sometimes hilarious, such as that between a small-town high school cheerleader-cum-expert markswoman and King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. But these people are never cartoonish; on the contrary, they're totally believable, from the charismatic King of Sweden and the feisty cheerleader to the likable United Mine Workers leader who eventually becomes president of this transplanted American republic.I might add here that, as an anthopologist who is concerned with culture contacts, especially those between cultures with widely divergent technologies, I take my hat off to Flint for working out the logic of what would happen if a small segment of 21st-century rural America suddenly came face-to-face with a pre-industrial culture such as obtained in 17th-century Europe. And the idea that the Americans cannot long resupply the high-tech culture they've heretofore taken for granted and must \\"gear down\\" in order to survive is also worked out extremely well.In short, it's obvious that Eric Flint had a great deal of fun writing this book, even though the amount of research he needed to do to pull it off was necessarily prodigious. I eagerly await a sequel (or a series of sequels), as I'm dying to know what happens to this 17th-century \\"United States of Thuringia\\" and its founders in the following decades (and centuries!)."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I first noticed 1632 in Baen's publishing schedule. Usually, this kind of genre involves one person being moved to a alternate universe or another time. Moving an entire town, and it's surrounding environs made things much nicer. Now the hero, (even though he still married a local), has people from his own time and place to connect with. I thought it was a well-done book; with few noticeable historical boo-boo's. I look forward to reading more of Eric Flint's works."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"The premise of &quot;1632&quot; has potential. In this work of alternative history by Eric Flint, a circular area of West Virginia six miles in diameter, and including the town of Grantville (pop. 3,000 or so), is suddenly transported from its place in the 20th century to a parallel universe in the year 1632 AD, and dropped intact into an identically shaped hole in the landscape of the German principality of Thuringia - right in the middle of that then-ongoing carnage called the Thirty Years War. Since the Americans are now left to their own resources without the ability to \\"call home\\" for help, this could've been an off-beat and gripping survival story had it been developed properly. Unfortunately, it wasn't, and it just came out being ridiculous.In an Author's Afterword, Flint says that &quot;1632&quot; is a \\"sunny book\\". That's the problem. For our castaways, there are no clouds in the sky, no matter what the situation. First of all, the collective consternation of the citizens over losing their place in the modern present was no greater than if they'd been stranded in Newark after having missed a plane. I mean, where were the cries of outrage as the trips to see the grandkids in California, the vacations to DisneyWorld, the opportunity to see \\"I Love Lucy\\" reruns, and the 401k retirement plans, are all lost forever? Rather, our square-jawed and unrelentingly self-righteous American heroes spend their time rescuing damsels-in-distress from the marauding mercenary bands of the period, and otherwise imposing civil order and the U.S. federal political structure on a world in serious disarray. Teddy Roosevelt couldn't have done it better with his Big Stick approach. (Modern hunting rifles, plus the M-60 machine gun good ol' Frank has stashed in his backyard, don't hinder the clean-up, either, as lines of armored men with pikes are mowed down. Yee-haw, boys, I guess we showed them varmints a thing or two!) And then, of course, there are all the True Loves conveniently discovered as the Grantville singles fraternize with the natives. Indeed, the principal American strongman in this fun, Mike, finds his (on page 43 already) in a wooden stagecoach lurching down a local cart track pursued by thugs. I mean, it's just all so sugary sweet that I was tempted to send out for Kleenex, insulin and an air-sickness bag, not really sure which I'd need first.And how about those unwashed local yokels, huh? As various elements become socially and militarily allied with those amazing Americans, does any individual among the former ever ask who won the Thirty Years War according to 20th century history books? (If 22nd century Wall Street suddenly dropped onto your back patio, wouldn't you at least want to know the future of that new gene technology IPO?) And are they particularly in awe of 20th century technological advances? Yawn. Without spilling too much of the plot, I can safely reveal that, at one point, our 17th century cousins, without having given it too much thought, are cozily sitting around the TVs chortling as Grantville's local programming is miraculously brought back on the air. (Hey, does anybody want to order out for some KFC before the game show starts?) All the comforts of a futuristic home.There's only one element amidst this silliness that justified my finishing the book. It's the part describing the Thirty Years War and its greatest warrior-hero, King Gustav II Adolf of Sweden. A cursory examination of the war's history on an on-line encyclopedia was enough to show that the background material supplied in &quot;1632&quot; was at least superficially accurate, so I may have learned something of value while reading this oversized comic book. From beginning to end, the plot is just too pat and too shallow. Thus, if you're not interested in the historical bit, don't bother with the whole."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I love alternate histories, have a great interest in the 30 Years War and all things German. Modern man displaced in time is also an engaging theme to me. This book, however, that promises these things and engages with all of these topicss, fell unfortunately short of the mark.Perhaps it is the readiness of the transported Americans to pick sides in their very first encounters with local violence, and the feeble rationale ofered for why their side is \\"right\\" and the other wrong. It chances that they catch one faction's militia brutalizing innocent civilians, and thus leap to the side of the innocent. But what about the same brutalization by the opposing side, which (historically, we know) was also going on at the same time? Such actions are out of sight and out of mind, in this book. They are not portrayed or considered. It is a convenient if clumsy literary device that creates polarization, sides and \\"conflict' from early on in the book. Effective for that purpose, but jarring from the pov of an historically knowledgeable reader.Perhaps it is the lack of more significant social and personal shock on the part of the transportees. The crisis of being transposed elsewhere in time seems a bit too readily resolved; there is no collapse of the social fabric, nor does it seem to threaten under the super-manly Leadership presented by our modest Hero/s who step to the fore.There is also the eery readiness of the 17th century locals to accept clothes, mores, and technology three centuries apart from their own. And of course there is the gun-toting, marshal-on-the-frontiers \\"cowboy\\" mentality transported out of place and time that strikes a dissonant note. I am actually rather fond of the cowboy mentality in its appropriate place; in the last decade in particular, however, this hallmark of American thinking has become iconic for American brashness in the world at large. It is a cultural attitude echoed in this book.Perversely, Flint does a good enough job of pure storytelling that in spite of all the drawbacks I was curious enough to keep turning the page to find out what happened next.

If you want good alternate history, try Harry Turtledove instead."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"True History fans may cringe, but this was totally unexpected and enjoyable. I got this book as an e-book for my Palm Pilot. I will be reading more by this author. The story line is enjoyable and characters are well developed if somewhat stereotyped. Books like this always make me want to go back and look at the actual history of an era. Too many of us romanticize history, and we always picture ourselves as lords of the manor."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I was a little hesitant to pick up this book because I wasn't sure how West Virginians would be portrayed. I have been listening to &quot;West Virginia, redneck, inbred, hillbilly&quot; jokes since I moved to Virginia 8 years ago. I was very happy to find that the author treated us with respect.My knowledge of the Thirty Years War is very limited. For that reason, I felt the historical events were a little hard to follow. However, the 2 maps at the beginning of the book were quite helpful.I also feel there were a few too many characters in the book. There were many occasions when I found myself flipping back, trying to remember who someone was. I also feel the author could have done more with the Simpsons. He would bring them up, but then let the topic drop and go on to something else. (Maybe they play a larger role in the next book.)On the overall, however, this is a wonderful book and I look forward to reading the next one."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"This is a really enjoyable and fun alternative history book. It doesn't bog down with technical explanations of how the relocation of a portion of modern-day West Virginia into medieval Germany occurred. It just happens, and the story moves on from there. There is no &quot;trying to get back&quot;. The focus instead is on the people involved and how they learn to cope and function in their new world, how the people of the Old World adjust to technologically superior people in their midst, and just how a new nation is created.Another reviewer was of the opinion that there wasn't enough tension. I don't know about that. There was tension, there just wasn't a lot of heartbreak, which was truly a nice change of pace. In many books, there is a lot of specious tragedy, just to exemplify the difficulties encountered. I liked the fact that in this book, confrontations didn't always go as expected, and people didn't always live up to their sterotype.This was a great book to while away a lazy day, and at 597 pages, a good book for travelling."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"30,000 residents of Grantville West Virginia, suddenly experience a brilliant, white flash of light and ground shaking. Mike Stearns, while attending his sister's wedding reception along with his coal miner buddies and family members, thinks there has been an explosion. Noticing smoke on the horizon he and his buddies jump in their pickups with their rifle racks to investigate. They quickly experience the brutality of that era and they soon realize they're not in West Virginia anymore. Apparently a 6-mile sphere (6-miles across, 3-miles deep and 3-miles high) piece of land, including the people property and belongings, has been transported back to 1632 Germany. Now Grantville's residents must come to grips with how to survive during this most violent period of civilized history (This is the period of the inquisition when Catholics were trying to exterminate Protestants). Though out numbered, modern day technology (sniper rifles and other weapons) makes for some interesting reading. The people in town work together to leverage their respective skills and they collectively find a way to maintain their standard of living. There are some twists to the ending that caught me off guard, but put a smile on my face. I found the characters easy to like and believable. For those who enjoy time travel type books, this is a must read."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"A very fun read, perhaps a little eager at times, but this makes it all the more entertaining. He develops characters nicely, and while there are a few cliche moments, at the same time there's a nice sense of realism to the 20th century characters' responses to the 17th century's residents and lives. Contrary to a previous reviewer, I thought he did a good job explaining the historical environment (though of Germanic heritage, I knew virtually nothing about the virtually pan-European nature of the 100 Years War before reading this book, for example), as well as capturing the true Mountaineer viewpoint (both proud of their state and their way of life, yet open to new experiences)."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"The only problem I have with this book, is that is has been done before. And fairly recently. The obvious connections between this book and S. M. Stirlings &quot;Island In The Sea Of Time&quot; series is more then obvious. A section of modern America is thrown backwards in time. They then use (or recreate) more modern technology to help fight the local bad guys. There are some things that are interesting in this book though. They actually give a cause for the time displacement (a kind of silly one, but it is fun to read). While it is very obviously influenced by S.M. Stirling, the story does have it's own feel. It is different enough that I still enjoyed it. And I will probably read any sequels that might follow. While not up to the level of Harry Turtledove and S.M. Stirling, Mr. Flint does have a lot of promise. I hope that his future books work more on originality, because he very obviously has it."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"1632 is a particular subgenre within the \\"Alternative History\\" fiction genre that I like to call \\"Time Displacement\\" fiction. What this means is that authors basically take a (usually modern)person (or in Flint's case, a whole town in West Virginia), and dump them into a setting in (usually) the past. The archetypal example of this is Mark Twain's \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\", but another major example is \\"Lest Darkness Fall\\" from L'Sprague de Camp. In the case of \\"1632\\", Flint basically dumps an entire small town from West Virginia right in the middle of the Holy Roman Empire (Germany before 1800) during the 1630s - in the midst of the raging Thirty Years War that devastated Germany and re-shaped politics in Europe to this day.I made it about 50-60 pages into the novel \\"1632\\" before giving up. It was not because of bad exposition on Flint's part - Flint clearly knows a lot of his stuff. His knowledge of the Thirty Years' War is fairly solid, and he manages to touch on an issue that most \\"Time Displacement\\" writers don't, namely, the difficulty in adapting modern technology in a setting where it has been cut off from the supporting modern economic, political, and physical infrastructure that supports it. For example, one of the issues that arises on is the issue of electrical power; there is a coal plant, but they don't have the precision parts necessary to keep it running more than a year, and they can't duplicate them. So they adapt by building down, and building a crude steam engine instead.So what turned me off? First and foremost, it was the characterization. None of Flint's characters really seemed more than sketches of characters, and they adapted rather quickly to their surroundings. Flint was seeming to rush a prospective romance between a character from the 1630s with the main character Mike, and the female character in question adapted much too quickly to the -weirdness- that would be the encounter in question. His historical characterization suffers as well; the author is clearly quite fond of Swedish King and military leader Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, and there seemed to be an attempt on Flint's part to \\"white-wash\\" the more negative aspects of Adolphus' military leadership (such as the fact that his army, like any European army of that area, lived heavily \\"off the land\\", meaning that they stole and pillaged whatever they needed from the unfortunate German peasantry that happened to cross their paths.).In addition, there were the \\"niggling\\" issues that were apparent to me from reading better \\"Time Displacement\\" novels and stories like the aforementioned \\"Lest Darkness Fall\\" and \\"Doomsday Book\\" by Connie Willie. Biggest of all is the language issue - the colloquial-english speaking characters from the town in question seem to have no trouble speaking to english-speaking characters. While 17th century english was closer to modern english than, say, 14th century english, this should be a much bigger issue than Flint allows it to be.It's not a terrible book, but as someone who has read extensively in the \\"Time Displacement\\" subgenre, it just couldn't capture my interest for the reasons above. I would strongly suggest borrowing \\"1632\\" from a local library and reading it first, then (assuming you like it) buying it and the sequels."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"A wonderful romp through the 1600's with deep characters, excellent descriptions of history with added pickup trucks, high powered rifles and rediscoverd sword skills. Delighful."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Sheesh! The previous reviewer and I must have read different books: Marxist? Anti-Catholic? With reference to the latter epithet, I suppose he is referring to some bad villains, such as Tilly or Richelieu, who are Catholic. On the other hand, the Grantville parish priest, soon to be a cardinal in his new universe, is a wonderful man. When writing about the Thirty Years' War, it's pretty hard not to find really some evil men of all faiths among the main characters. That said, some of us like to do relaxation reading to allow us to live for a few hours in a universe that is totally different from the one that is currently stressing us out. This novel and its sequels allow us to do that. History buffs will like the pains-taking research; adventure fans will have plenty to keep them riveted. It is a mistake to judge such a fun read primarily on its political or religious slant--it isn't a polemic. If reviewers want to use a book they have read as a launching pad to slam feminists, or liberals, or the unions, pick one of the works of fiction by Ann Coulter."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I'm a big fan of alternate history novels, and this is one of the first I read.It's an upbeat what-if tale that explores what could happen if a town in West Virginia suddenly appeared in Germany in, of course, 1632 AD.The characters are diverse. The heros are earthy types that I can personally relate to. From Swedish king Gustav Adolf to Jewish refugee Rebecca Abrabanel to expert markswoman and high school cheerleader Julie Sims, I really related.The central idea of a blue collar American town in war-ravaged Germany four centuries back was intriguing. I am writing this after reading the book for the second time, and I have to say that sitting here in Baghdad, I was struck by what author Eric Flint had to say near the novel's climax regarding the foolishness of building a fortress America and exporting our ideas militarily.What makes America great is freedom. Our ideas about freedom are ever changing, and they change for the characters in this book as the plot unfolds. You owe it to yourself to read this delightful and ultimately optimistic tale of American greatness and bringing hope into a hopeless world, despite often daunting odds."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Basically, this book is about a coal-mining town in West Virginia which is mysteriously transported to Germany at the time of the Thirty Years War. This theme has been developed before, going back to Mark Twain (or maybe further). To my knowledge, S.M. Stirling was the first major writer to move a whole community back to another time, with his Nantucket Series, and now Eric Flint seeks to get his version in. I am a fan of this genre, so I expected to enjoy this book, and I did. One way that it is different from most of these stories is that it focuses on the &quot;little people&quot;--The movers and shakers of this book are not professors or military officers or big-time politicians. The hero is a failed boxer who is a minor union official. On the other hand, the book is filled with affectionate praise for King Gustavus Adolphus. Gustavus Adolphus was a real historical figure, and if you don't know who he is, don't worry, you will know when you finish the book! I enjoyed the book, think most who are interested by this idea will enjoy it. Only criticism I have are that too much time is spent with the time travellers offstage, describing the Battle of Breitenfield, a real historical battle. Some may be disappointed that a minimum of time is spent describing clever technological improvisations--These seem to be a staple of this genre, but there isn't much of it here. If you enjoyed this book, I'd look up H. Beam Piper's LORD KALVAN OF OTHERWHEN, S.M. Stirling's ISLAND IN THE SEA OF TIME, and L. Sprague deCamp's LEST DARKNESS FALL."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Time travel stories have been a staple of Science Fiction essentially forever. The plot device of a modern man displaced into a historical era is a popular one, and traces its immediate lineage to Mark Twain's A CONNETICUTT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT. While always great fun these stories tend to push the bounds of credulity when it come to the introduction of modern technology, and they frequently fall apart toward the end for that reason. 1632 manages to remain faintly plausable throughout. Just how historically reasonable its plot may be is open to question, but it manages not to jar the reader too badly while he is engrossed in the tale. The characters are mostly well drawn, with the exception of one cardboard cut-out whose presence does not materially detract from the book. the action is brisk and (at least to my non-military eye) believable in context. Most importantly the book is just plain fun to read. The author has a good command of human emotion and motives, as well as seeming to know his history.If this sub-genera is one that you like I heartily recommend this example. If you are unfamilliar with the whole time-traveler gig you could do much worse than this book as an introduction."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I love time-travel stories... particularly when they're done well.

He makes his people -- both 21st-century West Virginians and 17th-century Germans -- live and breathe. The plight of the castaways will keep you glued to the page, and the action will bring you to the edge of your seat. Bravo! Buy this book!"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"This is not traditional alternate history (how did things develop on a different line?) so much as it is transposed history--analyzing the impact of a transplanted culture. The time/place of both were shrewdly chosen. As a Ph.D in early modern Europe, I like it; as someone who works in coal mine workers' compensation programs (and wanted to name our oldest son Gustavus Adolphus!), my husband liked it after I insisted that he read it; as a man who stayed home to keep a rural community running, my brother liked it also, after I insisted that he read it.

That's what happens in this well-written, well plotted book by Eric Flint.Eric Flint has taken well-drawn characters, an excellent plot, and a good understanding of human nature to create what is going to be one of my all-time favorite books. He is now on my &quot;automatic buy everything he writes&quot; list.I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"In this novel, a town in West Virginia suddenly gets picked up by a cosmic &quot;Ring of Fire,&quot; and is suddenly transported back in time to the middle of the Thirty Years' War in Germany, in the Seventeenth Century. The scientific aspects of this event are mostly glossed over in a brief prologue -- it's supposed to be the doing of a band of irresponsible aliens. That hardly figures into the story at all, however. The main point of reading this book is to get your face rubbed in a certain robust brand of populist political philosophy, with a lot of military action thrown in for good measure. If you like Robert Heinlein's more militaristic writings, you will love &quot;1632.&quot;The little town of West Virginians must survive in an incredibly hostile environment, as refugees flood into their territory. Outside, one of the bloodiest wars of the past millenium rages, as the forces of feudalism clash with the emerging forces of freedom of religion, and nationalism. Eric Flint has astutely recognized that the time was ripe in the 1630s for many concepts fundamental to American democracy, and out of these concepts he has fashioned a terrific tale. The Americans adrift in a strange land must not only survive, but try to ensure that the world they have landed in might become a better place for their having been there... The militaristic component of this story can get to be a bit much at times. There are a LOT of rousing cheers, and high-spirited charges... Probably my favorite character is the daughter of a Sephardic Jewish family, whose incredibly cultivated mind comes to be a major asset to the little town of lost Americans.A few reviewers here have noted that Flint's writing style isn't overly sophisticated. Lighten up. Many people in this country haven't been preposterously overeducated enough to have opinions about things like that, and many of the characters in his story are of that very background. If you want your ideas to meet with a wide audience, maybe it isn't so wrong to keep your writing style simple enough that regular folks can understand what you're saying.If you enjoy this kind of story, let me quickly recommend &quot;An Island in the Sea of Time,&quot; by... I cannot recall the author's name, but if you can find the book, you should remember his name, because he's really good. Michael Crichton's &quot;Timeline&quot; is another great read, in a very similar way, as is L. Sprague de Camp's &quot;Lest Darkness Fall.&quot; If you are excited by the kind of IDEAS in Eric Flint's book, as opposed to the story per se, you should think about reading &quot;A People's History of the United States,&quot; by Howard Zinn, or &quot;The Federalist Papers,&quot; edited by James Madison."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"This is an unusual book, particularly in the time-travel/alternate history field, which is littered with winning Confederate States and the like, reflecting attitudes which would have suited Adolf Hitler. Many of the reviews have pointed out the one superb feature of this book: it's told from the point of view of the ordinary citizen. And it is relatively free of gratuitous violence. Unfortunately, it is not quite free of gratuitous sex, but at least the sort of abuse you come across in this sub-genre is absent. Still, the author was obviously attempting something very difficult: This is not just the usual \`we Americans can beat them' sort of book. It's a book about why the Americans, who are outnumbered, can win. It is a book about what is valuable in Western Democracy. Essentially this is a book about politics behind history, made pleasant and easy to read, by giving it a good story-line. It's one of the few sf books you'll buy this year that will give you a good read and give some uplift and some insights. A few reviewers have complained about the short sentences and simple vocabulary. I can't say I find this a fault: if anything one of the problems with \`new wave' Science Fiction was that authors tried to show it was \`literature' with Dickensian sentences. This just highlights these authors' ignorance about the trend in great literature since Conrad: the more difficult the concept, the simpler the English. The length of the sentence has been getting shorter for the all of the twentieth century. Try Dickens compared to Henry James if you don't believe me! Flint is trying to write about something complex and dry as dust: the politics behind history. He succeeds remarkably well in a very readable story. He does have a very annoying habit of using the same phrases again and again, and his Battle of Breitenfeld chapter was the one time he let his \`history professor' persona out of the closet. Fortunately it is a very short chapter or I'd take a star away from him. But, on the whole: definitely a \`Buy'. You won't find a book on the effects of socio-political evolution in a more attractive package."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Although I read a LOT of science fiction of all types (fantasy, military, and alternate history), I somehow had never read anything by Eric Flint before, but the idea of a whole town from modern-day West Virginia being transplanted into 1632 Germany -- in the middle of the 30 Years War -- intrigued me. I was afraid that this book was going to be yet another of those that trash West Virginia and her citizens, but I was happy to find I was wrong as well as vastly entertained for several hours.Mike Stearns, along with most of the residents of Grantville, WV, was attending his sister's wedding reception in the cafeteria of the local high school when suddenly a brilliant, white light flashed through all the windows, the ground shook, and the power went off. Mike, his family members, friends, and colleagues naturally think there has been an explosion, but when they start looking around they are shocked to find they aren't in West Virginia -- or even the United States -- anymore; in fact, they aren't even in the same century! What happened? No one knows. Can they get back &quot;home&quot;? Probably not. What can they do? Survive.Seventeenth-century Germany is a bloody battlefield where kings, princes, mercenaries, and peasants die by the thousands; unfortunately, though, it's the richest (not the best or even bravest) leaders who usually win. Murder, rape, religious persecution, rule by a hereditary nobility, and army induction at swordpoint are the way of life for the average person. (You've got to admit that &quot;Join or die&quot; is a VERY effective recruiting slogan.) The right to do as they are told is about the only right common people have -- much to the shock and dismay of their new neighbors from the future, who consider themselves &quot;common people&quot; as well. The term &quot;culture shock&quot; really doesn't cover the American's attitudes when exposed to the lifestyle the German peasants take for granted; it certainly doesn't even begin to cover the German's reactions when they are faced with the behavior and attitudes of these hard-working, stubborn, opinionated, patriotric, Bill-of-Rights-loving, coal miners from a small town in central West Virginia -- especially the behavior (and dress!) of the modern-day females. When these new neighbors -- with their &quot;revolutionary&quot; ideas of equality and tolerance and their modern weapons and medicine -- proceed to help the beleagured cities around them, well . . . history will never be the same again.Although I wish the author had spent more time on the struggles of the citizens of Grantville to come to terms with their new situation and the formation of the &quot;new&quot; United States (with only the State of Grantville) and its government, I enjoyed this book so much that I went out and bought four more books by Eric Flint. By blending authentic historical figures with the fictional characters in this book, he makes the actions of ALL the people in this story -- improbable plot and all -- come alive with tales of bravery and cowardace, strategy and warfare, honor and dishonor, as well as romance and adventure. The fact that he does it with humor and WITHOUT continuing the sterotype of West Virginians as poor, ignorant, bigoted, narrow-minded, incestuous hillbillies makes it even better.

I ate the whole thing in one sitting!Some reviewers have panned 1632 for &quot;suspends disbelief&quot; and &quot;too pat&quot;. I fully agree, but what are they reading fantasy for if it must be fully believable? The beauty of Fantasy-SF is that it allows us to examine important values or principles isolated from the environment where they developed.Had I been the author, I would have spent more time with logistics. If an army fights on its stomach, as Napoleon said, then it is also true that a society survives on its supply chain. I would worry about Latex for the pick-up tires, brass for the rifle reloads, petroleum for automotive technologies and a plastics/chemical industry. I would look at copper, vacuum technology, smelting, glass, gunpowder, paper, textiles, machine tools, etc.; all the fundamentals on which our civilization relies.But I didn't write it, and I have had several days to deliciously fill in the details for myself. To me, the real test of a good read is how long it takes you to get involved and how long it lingers after you close the book. On both fronts, 1632 comes out first rate, I was hooked about the time the Union Boss cut his fists on a pikeman's jaw, and I have put myself to sleep for several nights doing my own what-ifs on its story line.I have been so moved that I can't look at another of my favorite authors until I read 1633, fearing, at the same time, that it will degenerate into formula prose and disappoint.I gave 1632 four stars because the good guys are too good and the bad guys, while bad enough, are incompetent.

I thought at first that this was a well-disguised romance novel set in a small town in crisis. But I've been reading it over (and over) and I've come to a different conclusion. 1632 is a novel about humanity at its worst and at its best.

There were several &quot;sub-plots&quot; that should have either been dropped, or given more attention for example some out of town wedding guests &quot;imported&quot; to be advarsies almost dismissed for the rest of the book, they are a problem, but a very minor one. Which leads me to the bigest problem I had with the book none of their problems were &quot;major&quot;. Every battle they fought was very one sided.

With good leadership and a technological edge the town not only remains intact but starts to organize a chaotic Germany into a new United States, upsetting the balance of power in Europe and attracting such allies and enemies as Sweden's King Gustavus Adolphus and France's Cardinal Richelieu.It's good, old-fashioned sci-fi. Not too technical and easy to read but also serious with its historical background and it makes you think. The action scenes are the best, as crude mercenaries face the might of modern weaponry. Things can get a little cheesy at times. And the book comes close to being too self-righteous. But overall it's a good book and I give it high marks just for making European history more accessible. You learn that the horror of war is not a modern invention. Which is worse? Being incenerated at sleep in your home by a bomb...or being dragged out of your house to be tortured, raped, enslaved and then killed by monsters?"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"This is light reading. The key protagonists never really seem to be in danger. The plot advances slowly, but inevitably in favor of &quot;the good guys.&quot; The volume would be right at home in the &quot;young adult&quot; section of the library.Still, the premise is lots of fun, and the historical parts are quite educational, yet compelling to read. I'm not ashamed to state that I really enjoyed this book, although I am beyond the &quot;young adult&quot; reading level.Never a history buff, my knowledge of 17th century Europe has been greatly expanded. If 1632 offers nothing else, it serves as a very palatable reminder of the precious value of the democracy and civilization that we enjoy.Read this book, and, along with me, you will be casting your vote for the &quot;4th of July Party&quot;."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Alternate-History is a tricky genre. Juggling past and present while trying to invent a new (and plausable) future ... well, I can't imagine the headaches that this would cause the writer. But Eric Flint gets it right--for the most part. There were some obvious flaws, such as the constant praising of Unions (what is this, a novel or a labor rally?), the over-use of the word \\"rueful\\" (eg. \\"He gave a rueful nod.\\" \\"She smiled ruefully.\\" \\"There was ruefulness in her eyes.\\" Sheesh! At one point, \\"rueful\\" was used three times in the same page!), and then there's the almost infuriating way the characters accept their situation. There's no mourning for the world they left behind, no tears, no regret. Just casual indifference and eager acceptance. \\"What, we ain't in West Virginia no more? Well, whatever (belch!). Let's go kill us some Germans!\\" That's an exaggeration, but not by much.All this might sound like I was disappointed by 1632--I wasn't. I enjoyed it very much, gobbling up its 500-plus pages in less than a week. But come on, Mr. Flint! You could tell a more polished story than this."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"The concept of a modern city transplanted into the past has been done before, and Flint's story is goofy in the extreme even should such a thing happen. The behavior of the characters, both of the past and present, is nothing sort of ridiculous. The idea of such a group of people being accepted into that renaissance society without local religious leaders launching all sorts of crusades against them is ludicrous, as is the rapid and unquestioning acceptance by 17th century people of a city filled with such unheard-of ideas and miraculous equipment and gadgets. The entire thing is nothing short of laughableHaving said that, I must state that I have seldom enjoyed reading a book as much as I have 1632. As unlikely and silly as the whole thing is, it has a flair of SUPERMAN or CAPTAIN MARVEL about it, and there's enough of the child still in me to enjoy reading that genre. People who read fantasy must realize that what they read isn't happening, has never happened, nor is likely to....and this is as unnlikely as anything they will ever read -- and just as fascinating."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Eric Flint has done a wonderful job of working through the issues of transporting a rural West Virginia village from the 20th century to Germany in the middle of the 30 years war.

The popularity of this sub-genre proves that the temptation is endlessly fascinating. From L.

Who would have the necessary knowledge and skills to turn the tide of history? Eric Flint's book offers a workable answer. It takes a village! Not only a village, but a village full of working men and women possessing practical skills, the kind of skills fewer and fewer of us possess in the Information Age. I found the characterizations moderately successful, but the real strength of this book was the portrayal of the process."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"The book is very good mind candy. The plot is simple, how would a largely blue-collar modern American small town deal with being plunked into the middle of the Thirty years war? Answer, because of the overwhelming military superiority afforded by modern firearms, vehicle, and communications; they'd romp all over the locals, impose their values on the objectioning ones (the higher ups), find grateful solidarity with the downtrodden, and be forced sheerly out of a need for strategic depth to come to an accomodation with some part of the local power structure in the person of, conveniently to 1632, Gustavus Adolphus, possibly the least objectionable monarch to have ever claimed a throne. The USN ought to name a CCG after Breitenfeld. Upon considering the matter, Adolphus winning Breitenfeld did plausibly make Saratoga...plausible. Thank you, Adolphus, for my country.

I enjoyed reading it, if for any other reason than the concept of trying to acclimatize to a world over four hundred years in the past. True, some of the characterizations were pretty stereotypical (evil CEO), and the dialog became cumbersome when the characters would chatter back and forth in complete understanding, only to clue the reader in at the end as to what is going on.However I did like the concept of trade partnerships being the foundation of prosperity. That struck me as being quite innovative, from a fiction/novel perspective. That aspect is often overlooked.And although the explanation as to how our intrepid West Virginians get to The Past, it should not be a point of contention. It is easier to digest (or ignore) than some of the other alternate-history stories' manner of introducing current technology into the past, the sort that use a deus ex machina to a much greater degree in the beginning.Probably the best thing I got out of this book was learning about the 30 Years War. It provoked me to do a little research to see if any of this historical information was true. So, I learned something. Who would have thought?"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I have read this book 4 times and stay up until the wee hours just like I did the first time. Eric Flint made me a part of the story. It became real and I wanted to be there. His central characters were amazing but human. They exhibited strong beliefs and acted on them. The masses were understandable. The history was so good that I found myself wanting to know more. I became friends with the King of Sweden. I laughed with Alex as he was pursued by Julie. I was so very proud of Gretchen. But most of all I was proud to be an American. Of the 1000's of books I own this one has moved into first place and I'll read it again and again."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"If the basic idea sounds somewhat Island in the Sea of Time-ish to you, it did to me too. Flint doesn't do nearly as well with it as Stirling does, though. Oh, he knows his history of the period real well, but his characters come off a lot more wooden and cartoonish than I really like.And while I understand a coal-mining town is very likely to be a lot more unified of mind than, say, Pasadena, no group of people is as unified of purpose & action as Flint describes. I mean, they're there about five minutes and they immediately decide (with few dissenting voices) that they're going to \\"rebuild America in Germany.\\"I don't buy it, I don't buy it at all.Still, I've just recently reread this book and had some time to think about it some more.It comes across to me as a bit rushed - and that \\"they're there about five minutes and they immediately decide that they're going to 'rebuild America in Germany.'\\" still bugs the heck out of me - but in retrospect it's a better written and plotted book than I originally said.Problem was, I'd just finished reading the then-latest book in the Sea of Time series and was a) so impressed by it that everything else looked pale and b) was mildly annoyed at what looked to be just a \\"knock-off clone\\" of that book.\\"a)\\" as a problem, vanished on the second reading. 1632 stands alone as a pretty darn good book.\\"b)\\" vanished when I \\"calmed down\\" and realized that it wasn't really some cheap clone of Stirling's work (helped by the fact that Stirling himself said that he knew Flint was working on it before his book ever came out) and that, IAE, this whole \\"Sea of Time\\" genre is hardly original to Stirling. Heck, the idea's been around for years (I even used it for a - bad - timeline I did back in 1972!) and it's been used in stories for just as long.Quick example: the comicbook Cavewoman - where the whole town of Marshville gets sent back to the Cretaceous. Of course, they don't spend so much time trying to fight Mycenaean Greece or 17th century Germans as they do trying not to get eaten, but the basic \\"Sea of Time\\" idea is there.Anywho, I'm now stating that you can set your standards pretty high and still enjoy this book. And, theoretically, there's a sequel planned - 1633 (okay, so Flint isn't too creative with titles - he's better than I am)."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Alternative history can be a treat, if you like the genre. If you like it here is an interesting and suspenseful novel - with two minor flaws in it. The setting of 17th century Europe is seen from a very American angle. Although the major historical facts are quite correct, their evaluation is sometimes too modern and slightly distorts the historical reality and characters. For example: a Swedish officer uses a comparison between a chipmunk and a bear when he watches two other characters. He certainly was not able to use this image as there are no chipmunks at all in Europe. And exactly this mistake leads to another one. All the characters seem very credible as individual personalities. But the natives become less credible when they so readily and quickly accept modern political, technical, and economical concepts that are so alien to them that they must create strong conflicts in this mixed society. Modern western democracy is a political concept that nobody - even the poor and suppressed people of that era - would have accepted then. Something like that developed in centuries, not in days.But this novel is fiction after all, and, of course, the author is free to use his imagination as freely as he may find it suitable. It is the result that counts, and the result is a very good and exiting novel."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"When a small West Virginia town is translated into the middle of the 30 years war in Germany, its residents know they'll have a struggle to survive. The war destroyed much of Germany and was a definite low point in human misconduct. Still, survival isn't enough for Mike Stearn and some of the other West Virginians (especially not the militant unionists). They want to start the American Revolution a century and a half early. For a while, at least, they have access to modern technology--but how long that can last against the disciplined opposition of most of Europe remains to be seen.Fortunately, a labor shortage is the least of Stearn's problems. Starving peasants flock to anyone willing to protect them and, after a brief internal battle with the isolationists, they are admitted into a new United States. Still, this new republic can only ally with the Swedish King and the history books report that he doesn't survive the onslaught of the great mercenary general Wallenstein.Author Eric Flint delivers a fast-paced and convincing account of a new nation, conceived in liberty and in the fields of battle. I liked Flint's decision to make the ordinary people the heros of the story. Preserving the real values of America shouldn't be something for the elite only and Flint delivers more 'everyman' heros than you can shake a stick at.Although Flint isn't quite the master of military fiction as, for example his sometimes writing partner David Drake he delivers some fine battles in this novel including a historic battle between King Gustav Adolf and Tilly.1632 makes a compelling and fascinating read."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Not much I can add to previous reviews, except that &quot;1632&quot; is my kind of book for a fun read. It has the feel of an old-fashioned space opera, with a large cast of heroic characters who, when flung into the past, bring modern American ideals to the 17th Century. OK, it's not too realistic. These people behave as we wish people would behave. They're the kind of people we'd like to be. And merely the introduction of democracy causes bigotry to disappear (sadly, we all know that doesn't happen). But you can read the news if you want a realistic portrayal of religious fanaticism. This is just pure entertainment, with an optimistic and idealized outlook. If you're looking for grim realism, pass it by. And it's not great literature.

Too bad Eric Flint had it, rather than someone who is capable of writing. Your first indication that the book may not be worthwhile is the cover, which informs you that the author was a longtime union organizer. But then you rationalize that the author could not infuse much of his tired ideology into a novel about seventeenth century Germany. So you open to the first page and see a map of the Old Reich, with Bohemia outside the border and identified as the Ottoman Empire! OK, so the author knows about as much history as you would expect of a union organizer. Maybe he can at least tell a story. Wrong again! He writes like a sixth grader. Not only short, choppy sentences but also one-dimensional fictional characters and pathetically unrealistic portrayals of historical figures are encountered by the reader.

I bailed out."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I know you should never judge a book by its cover, and 1632 in no exception. The cover illustration suggests an absurdly riproaring exploration of the interactions between peoples from two different times and places -- 1632 Germany and 2001(?) West Virginia -- when they are thrust through some sort of space-time disturbance into each other's proximity.Oh, were that it were so!Such an infantile plot plan would at least promise some interesting human exchanges, misunderstandings, and so forth, and perhaps provide a vehicle for comparing and contrasting the psychologies and world-views of people from respective eras.No such luck. The cover looks bad, but fails utterly to portray how bad this book really is.As many others have commented on the lack of a dramatic plot-arc and the complete non-existence of characterization, I'll simply add my thoughts on style, romantic relationships, and political tripe.1. Style. A few examples will suffice, but rest assured that every page is full of similar issues:a) ruefully: an adverb that can modify any and all verbs, preferably several times per chapterb) the use of motifs: if you made it this far in the book before bailing out, let me just paraphrase \\"green eyes...blue eyes\\" to remind you of a few chapters that should have given you a(n unintended) laughc) when I got to the end of the Captain Gars subplot, I was astounded by the \\"big reveal\\", as I was surprised to discover that the author actually beleived he had been deceiving the reader. It didn't look like he was even attempting to do that.2. Romantic Relationships. Written for 13-year D&D; players, and seemingly by onea) each of the many cross-cultural pairings are, as others have mentioned, love at first sight. What I haven't seen mentioned is that it is actually worse than that: the individuals fall in love with the first available member of the other culture they meet; that is, not just at the first sight of the individual, but coincidentally at the first sight of an oppositely-gendered \\"Other.\\"b) only two types of \\"romantic\\" conflict are employed, and they are in fact at least referenced with respect to EVERY couple. The first is the notion that relationships are secured against would-be interlopers by the threat of duels (and the menancing prospect presented by the American male in the couple, or his shotgun), and that couples already planning on marriage get pregnant a month or two before the wedding, leading to fears of \\"month-counting scandals.\\" I kid you not, at least two and maybe three couples have this \\"problem,\\" which would hardly be a problem in either 2001 WV or 1632 Germany. This seems like the kind of problem a 13-yrear old virgin D&D; player would put a lot of dramatic weight on were he writing a story like this...but I repeat myself.3. Political Infantilisma) the author's characters keep saying they are rebuilding an American Republic (150 years early) and the main character (main cardboard cut-out, actually) voices that he views himself to be much like George Washington, not only in circumstance but also in philosophy, style, etc. The author claims a masters degree in history. Clearly, his focus could not have been on English/American political history of the 17th and 18th centuries. Actually, this character is much more like Hugo Chavez than he is like any child of the Enlightenment or Founding Father.b) the author's only strong suit is his treatment of historical battles. How nice it would have been to explain the actual political backgound that brought Germany to his 1632. Don't look for that here.c) there is no resemblance to a fair, open and free political process. Bullying, constitutional manipulation, and monopolization of the media are how the \\"Good Guys\\" maintain the upperhand. The Great Man (and Adored Woman) model leads to frequent ad-hoc \\"plebescites by acclamation\\" -- enforced by the brooding menance of the United Mine Workers of America local against any who might object.I forced myself to finish this so I could see how bad this book could really be.

I'd just like to appeal to prospective readers to save yourself money and several precious hours of your life, which you'll never get back - and just avoid this book like the plague.I'm a fan of fantasy fiction and am quite happy to 'suspend disbelief' in order to enjoy a story, but there are limits, good grief. I'm also a socialist, so I have no problems with the aim to write a story about the 'ordinary man' rather than focusing on princes and generals. However, I agree with other reviewers about the poor quality of writing and character development, and the way in which both the Americans and the 17th Century people adapt so rapidly is utterly unbelievable. A better writer would have been able to explore more profoundly the clash of cultures, attitudes and ethics between the two groups - this is a huge missed opportunity. In particular, this was a time of high passions and fanatically held religious beliefs - I find it utterly incredible that the Germans would have looked at the Americans and thought 'they don't seem to be worried about religious differences and they have Catholics, Protestants and Jews living together happily - good idea, I'll follow along'. They'd have been at each others throats in no time. They also seem to make light of language barriers in a way which does little to add to the credibility of the story.A particularly jarring element for me was the jingoistic patriotism of the viewpoint - I sense from the reviews that this is at least irritating for American readers and for non-Americans it's unbearable.Put it all together and it's just a bad, silly, shallow, irritating waste of time.

However when I began reading it, I discovered that the story struggles from the beginning. As has been mentioned earlier, the author definetly has a political agenda. I found it quite difficult to read the book at times, and found myself putting it down every few minutes because I had big issues with the left-slanted politics of the author and main characters. Unions are praised as the saviors of the common man, while all of the right wing characters are portrayed as narrow minded idiots. The book is plagued by unbelievable situations in regards to the townspeople and their decisions and unity. If you can look past the authors bias, you may find some solace in the fact that the historical accuracy is excellent. If this book is indicative of the rest of the series, Im not sure that I'll give them a shot or not. Bottom line, this book is sabotaged by the authors bias, flimsy characters, and completely unbelievable dialogue."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I read in fits and starts.

The premise of the book sounded interesting I like the cover art by Larry Elmore I live in western PA and sort of pro union so I should like this book. It is awful. The characters have no real identity and I can't enjoy remorseless characters who kill in cold blood. That coupled with the fact that the characters there have so little depth that one runs into the other and it becomes difficult to tell who is doing what. The one thing that is always clear is what caliber gun is used to do the killing which may be good for those whom masturbate over gun magazines but anyone else it seems superfluous. To me it seems odd that a comic book like Iron man has ten times the character depth and purpose of the characters in this putrid tome.

Like other offerings by Flint, the social interactions and events are painfully unbelieveable, the characters flatter than saturday morning cartoons. You may cringe or groan at other moments when you read, and wonder \\"how could someone willingly write this and put their name on it?\\". As the pages go by (I myself am proud to say I was able to endure a full 200), the cringes soon outnumber the giggles, until you may weep for the state of a world that would allow for this wretched thing to spawn into a series.Others have compared Flint to S.M. Stirling, which is fair though Stirling spins a far far better tale, seek his stuff out. Also, I'll add that Flint's more recent books are better.That said, don't waste your money on this book.

There is something cringeworthy (and, yes, I know that's a terrible word) on every page, but when it got to every paragraph, I had to put it down. Please do not even attempt to start this book, it is the worst use of the english language I have ever read, and that includes you, Mr Terry Goodkind, so you have gone up one slot. Mr Flint must have some pretty serious connections to get this puerile drivel published, because not only did he get this done, but he followed it with several others, which I will be sure to steer far, far clear of. He's put me off the entire E to G section in the bookstore. If you pick it up, don't say I didn't warn you.

Catholics on the whole are portrayed as either pig-ignorant or vicious. Protestants fair somewhat better. (Jews and Moslems are actually portrayed in a better light than modern man in some respects.) Its obvious Mr. Flint learned his history from a Marxist persepctive. His disdain for organized religion fairly oozes out of each page.Of course there are explicit sex scenes in this book. Try to find a novel these days without them. Flint's narrative of the thoughts going through the mind of a 17th century newlywed as she engages in the marital act for the first time is more laughably absurd than anything else.He buys into the feminist myth that the pleasures of the marital bed were unknown before the 20th century. A fairly typical conceit I suppose, but it would be nice for once to read characters of the past written as real persons as opposed to ideological caricatures.If you are a labor unionist, ACLU lawyer, non-practicing Jew, lapsed Catholic or communist you will like this book. It will confirm your bottle-fed prejudices for you very nicely. If you are a true historian, you may get a good laugh out it. If you hope to learn any real history by reading it, don't bother. If you want a good time travel yarn, there are any number of works that are far superior to this tripe."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"...and got well and truly stuck in again, with Eric Flint's usual style and ingenuity. The *Connecticut Yankee* subgenre of speculative fiction has been around for a long, long time, and I confess that I'm a sucker for every sort of change that's been rung on this set of bells. It's not just the notion of good storytelling predicated upon a clash of cultures but on the impossible-in-mundania juxtaposition of cultures in collisions that simply couldn't happen without time travel and/or alternate probabilities (see *Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen* and *Lest Darkness Fall* and *At the Earth's Core* and suchlike).I confess that I'm also a sucker for stories with a subtext extolling not only the ownership and carriage of firearms but also the willingness of the private citizen to use such weaponry to protect and defend the rights of those around him, \\"gun control laws\\" be damned for the authoritarian bastardliness they've always been. Flint takes a wonderfully American attitude toward such matters:(1) Armed conflict is neither glorious and grand nor so utterly horrifying that decent, humane people must be reduced to the status of passive victims;(2) Like bowel surgery, the use of violent force in the defense of human rights is something to be gotten through as swiftly, skillfully, and with as little secondary injury as possible;(3) When paying the butcher's bill, the objective is to end the aggressor's existence, either by sending him to perdition or by making him your friend and ally.I'll not go into much further detail. As other reviewers have observed, there is a plenitude of discussion about the nature of government and the role of the citizen in a society where respect for individual rights is the first and foremost value. We'd be a helluva lot better country right now, in fact, if people like the senior Senator from West Virginia were to embody the values of Flint's fictional West Virginia mining town*1632* is a fine, readable bit of work, and people who aren't fond of novels like this one are the sort of folks you shouldn't leave unwatched in the presence of your valuables."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I picked up this book from the Baen Free Library on the web (a *great* service, by the way). It's a good thing I did it that way, because I don't think I would have been as pleasantly disposed to it if I had paid for it. There are some books that you enjoy for what they are, but you might feel you wasted your money if you had bought them, and this is one of them.The book is an exciting read, for the most part. The characters, while not drawn very 3-dimensionally, are kind of fun. There is no real stand-out, though. All of them are of a type, rather than fleshed out. However, the action is fast and furious, with not a lot of let-up.My main problem with this book is that everything is too easy. There really isn't a whole lot of tension involved. There is a little bit in the climactic battle, but even that has a foregone conclusion that doesn't surprise the reader. The characters go through the motions for the most part. They are very intense in their feelings and speech, but they appear almost to know that they're in a book and not much will happen to them.The intensity mentioned above adds to another problem. The characters almost seem to be mouthpieces for Flint's opinions. Yes, Eric, we get the picture that unions are wonderful and the &quot;bosses&quot; are scum. Thank you. We don't need it drilled into our heads. Because of things like this, the dialogue (and sometimes the narration) seems stilted at times.The historical detail is very good, but some of it comes in huge infodumps that aren't that interesting. I don't know enough about the time period to know whether Flint's off on his history or not, but it certainly doesn't appear so.I like alternate history novels, even more so when it's something coming from the future to affect the history (Turtledove's &quot;Guns of the South&quot; is a masterpiece of the genre). I think that's why I enjoyed this novel more than my review says. It's a page-turner, that's for sure. Just turn your brain off before starting it."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"A town of West Virginians gets dropped right into the most vicious war Europe had ever seen until our own century. Naturally, they want to protect themselves and bring the best of America to the Old World. The resultant clashes of cultures, military traditions, and attitudes are well written and exciting, and done with as much attention to realism and historical accuracy as is possible. I loved this book, and it has served me as a powerful lesson: Bullies, whether their names are Tilly and Wallenstein, or Valenti and Eisner, don't really *LIKE* it when the peasants rise up and say &quot;Enough!

Thank God that wasn't the case.This is a very well thought out and written book. The characters are extremely realistic and likeable and the plot outline very intriguing. The many directions possible from a story arc as this make it even more appealing as the characters grow and develop throughout this series.As a fan of alternate history or time travel type books I found this incredibly enjoyable.

Funny at times, not a lot of blood and gore. The auther seems to have reseached his subject matter very well. The story holds together real well."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"1632 is possibly Eric Flint's most overtly American work.Pro-unionisation, pro-\`The American Way' and casting a variety of historical characters as convenient baddies, this book is also surprisingly readable.I must admit, as a non-American myself sometimes I was lost about what the characters were talking about, but the general premise is that an all-American mining town is transported back in time to the time period of the thirty-year war, where they proceed to build an American style utopia amongst universal human suffering. Yeah, you can probably tell I'm a bit cynical. However, The Plot is there (if tenuously for a while), and the minor sub-plots are really cool (Esp the one with the slightly amoral German girl who marries some sort of punk biker.) Overall I don't rate its chances of being a big-seller outside the US.Some of the relationships seem a litte... 'love at first sight, lets get them married and get on with the story'. In fact all of of the relationships are like that. But whatever, it's a legitimate tactic.I did like the book however - mostly for its female characters. The guys all blurred into one blond American mass after a while, but the girls were all as different as apples and oranges. Possibly not being American was a big downside for me, because a lot of the talk is political, and about what it means to be an American."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"In my opinion this is a great science fiction novel.The best science fiction, for me, has always had a point of view, a political or sociological picture of another world. Flint's political views come across loud and clear, and are, in this context, attractive.The characters, with the exception of several of their male-female relationships, are complex and attractuve, worthy of the reader's sympathy and understanding.I picked up this book because, paging through it, the name Lennart Torstensson caught my eye. I was not disappointed that Flint carefully wove Torstensson's innovations into the story line, and took care to accurately describe the tactics of the period, and why Torstensson is remembered.I do not agree with those who assert that Flint has a rather naive, even anachronistic, view of the attractiveness of democracy to the lower classes of the period. In fact, from my readings over the years, almost nothing is known in this area, all that has survived are comments from the educated elite who profited greatly from the existing sytem. Flint's speculations in this book, are, therefore, in my opinion, as valid as any other. That is one of the treats of the story.Unfortunately, from my perspective, the other books in the popular series (all co-written with Flint, or by other authors) are not as entertaining, though the Grantville Gazettes I have read have some charming, interesting, stories, and the novels he co-wrote with David Weber in this series are quite good and tell a rousing, if less challenging to the reader, tale.When an author has written a book at this level, it is difficult, if not impossible, to follow up with anything nearly as good. Not nearly as good though, when compared to 1632, may be quite good indeed."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"This is a very good book for fans of alternate history. The idea is simple if a bit derivative, smalltown transported from 1990s rural America to early modern Europe. They land right in the middle of one of the many dynastic wars, when Gustav Adolf is running rampant over Europe.This book is good for a number of reasons, which to me show how good alternate history should work. Firstly, people are faced with practical problems and deal with them in a practical way. They have to organise themselves to survive in a hostile environment, with limited resources albeit a higher technology. Secondly they are faced with political problems stemming from the situation in Europe and their own destabilising presence, which is interesting in itself. No messing around here, they decide to be a democracy. Thirdly, the characters involved are not billionaires or geniuses. Just ordinary people, members of a trade union mostly, although miners so presumably they are used to relying on each other in a crisis. The only lords and ladies in this book are the European aristocracy, and you can't really get away from them in this time period. They are also often actual historical characters, which helps. Lastly the politics of the period, although important, are explained reasonably simply and don't get in the way of the story.Action scenes, which are reasonably important in this type of book are well done, Flint obviously knows something about early modern warfare. The characters, particularly the Europeans are cardboard cutouts but what the hey? They're good enough for government work. The story never drags, and we get a reasonably satisfactory conclusion.

Love how the townsfolk eventually overcome the hardships and eventually begin to spread the best of 20th century America to 17th century Germany and beyond.

(Basically, after this initial novel, the author threw the future progression of the series open to fans and a multitude of collaborative writers. Interesting concept, and I'm all for fan involvement or consumers participating in the development of products, but unfortunately, not every Tom Dick and Harry [and occasional Mary] can write [or at least write alternative history that appeals to a base of hardcore history buffs], and the series ends up increasingly meandering and going off in inane tangents with each new addition).But enough about what comes next - \\"1632\\", Eric Flint's initial (and solo) part of the series, has all the good stuff you'd expect from a decent alternative history story. An interesting concept (West Virginia mining town transported back in the middle of Thirty Years War Germany), good theme (how a UMWA-dominated community ends up dealing - will the WV hillbilly or UMWA borderline socialist mentality prevail?), and gripping action (20th century hunting rifles, shotguns, and an M60 versus the push of pike, with Gustavus Adolphus thrown in the mix), and some interesting socio-economic undercurrent (Eric Flint is a hardline, far left, labor activist - would that the rest of the left hadn't lost sight of the fundamental labor-versus-capitol/mgt. basis for its existence in the first place).Basically, Eric Flint, when he's on, knows his stuff, and knows how to draw the reader into a story - and in \\"1632\\", he's definitely on."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I read this book in 2001 and I still remember the amazing characterizations of the principal players in the book.

Wackiness ensues.The characters don't spend a lot of time figuring out the why, but are confronted with the realities of living in the middle of a nasty and confused war in central Europe.They have books, TV, and guns - but they are surrounded by enemies from all sides.Sure, I will say it is silly.

Could not put the book down once started. A start to a fun new series. I have already gone out and purchased the rest of the series."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"1632 is worth reading, but don't expect a masterpiece: it's a good enough treatment of a very old science-fiction idea: Modern men get transported into the past, and, thanks to superior technology, soon gain the upper hand. I only remember a short story (by Poul Anderson, but I don't remeber the title), in which the modern man tranported to the past couldn't get a handle on ancient technolgy and ended up dead. The same theme has been developed (often better), by others: S.M. Stirling (Island in the Sea of Time), Leo Frankowski (his Cross-Time Engineer series), H. Beam Piper (Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen), L. Spreague De Camp (Lest Darkness Fall), and, of course, originally by Mark Twain (A Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur's Court)."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Many years ago, I went through a phase where alternate history fiction intrigued me and I read stuff like Harry Turtledove'sMisplaced Legionseries and William Fortschen's \\"Lost Regiment\\" series. Since then my tastes have more or less moved on. However, I kept seeing books from the 1632 series at the library and finally decided to pick this first one up and give it a whirl. It took me a while to plow though its almost 600 pages (I'd forgotten what doorstoppers these kind of fantasy/sci-fi books were), and at the end I concluded that while it's a decent book for a long airplane ride or day at the beach, it's rather too simple and sweet to take very seriously on the whole, and certainly not something I'd recommend to anyone not already a fan of the subgenre.The premise is that some kind of cosmic incident transposes a 6-mile sphere of contemporary West Virginia with a similar sphere from Germany circa 1632. The portion of West Virginia includes a town of several thousand people (based onMannington, WV) along with a high school, power plant, coal mine, and a cast of all-American \\"regular\\" folks. (Many reviewers have noted that the premise is very similar to S.M Stirling's Island in the Sea of Time trilogy, which I have not read.) With nary a pause to bemoan their plight, the West Virginians elect an emergency committee and go about the business of reestablishing the democratic republic of the United States (complete with aBill of Rights) in the middle of the 30 Years War. Indeed, the book is filled to the brim with classic American optimism and go-getting attitude that it often smacks of something from the 1950s (or the 1890s for that matter).That's all well and fine (if somewhat ironic, given America's current nation-building misadventures in Iraq), but to enjoy the book, the reader has to be on board with the \\"we can roll up our sleeves and just do it\\" tone that pervades the story (and presumably the series). This tone is something Flint addresses in his Afterword, and is worth quoting at length, since many readers may find it annoying: \\"Part of the reason I chose to write this novel is because I am more than a little sick and tired of two characteristics of most modern fiction, including science fiction. The first is that the common folk who built this country and keep it running...hardly ever appear.... That is especially true of people from rural areas....The second is the pervasive cynicism which seems to be the accepted wisdom of so many of today's writers.\\" to be sure, there' nothing inherently wrong in taking that approach (although those \\"cynics\\" might point out that the building of this country was done at the expense of those already living here, using genocidal techniques, and that many of those who built were slaves...and that many of those who \\"keep it running\\" today are illegal immigrants), but the result of Flint's decision is a story without many setbacks for the plucky Americans, and thus far less drama than many would like.As one would expect, the West Virginian's technological prowess enables them to immediately start influencing the world around them, and they are soon drawn into taking sides in the 30 Years War. One of the book's great flaws is that it never really pauses to explain what that war was about, or even who the key players are. For example,what is the Swedish king doing with his army in Germany, and why is the reader clearly supposed to assume he's on the side of \\"good\\"? Another large flaw is the cast of cardboard characters, a number of whom fall in love at first sight in a manner most convenient to the plotting. More minor flaws include the utter lack of psychological trauma to the displaced people, the lack of social collapse, the ease at which the American and Germans get along, the readiness with which the Germans abandon their social beliefs and codes for that of the Americans, and the rapid pace at which event unfurl in general -- all of which speak to the cheery tone noted above. It's hard to get too involved in the story because the villains, while nasty, never seem particularly menacing or dangerous. But if you're not put off by this (or the rather laughable explicit sex scene), the book is a relatively entertaining diversion -- and I might even pick up the following book in the series the next time I'm looking for an easy read."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"With a fine twist on the alternative history genre, 1632 asks, \\"What would happen if an entire town of stalwart, red-white-and-blue Americans were transported back in time to central Europe during the Thirty Years War?\\" The answer, of course, is that they would kick the collective butts of the kings, dukes, and earls they encountered, and establish a Jeffersonian, non-politically correct democracy in the heart of Europe. 1632 is a rollicking good read from cover to cover, and its unabashed promotion of good old American values and right of center political philosophy is refreshing after decades of America-bashing by the literary elite.

To prevent Gretchen from being forced to return to prostitution to support her family, Jeff marries her. Chapters 18 to 31 alone are worth the price of the novel!This is not so much a story of time travel and alternate history as it is a story of good triumphing over evil, of love triumphing over brutality and violence and of citizens from two very different worlds learning to work, live and laugh with each other in the face of one of the most brutal periods in history.

Flint sets the stage realistically as the towns people respond to their new circumstance, set up an emergency government, set up a security force and begin preparing for feeding and sheltering 3,000 souls but the situation soon deteriorates--refugees from the war begins swelling the population rapidly taxing the towns resources and complicating their interaction with the environment. Soon they volunteer to defend a neighboring German town in Thuringia (part of that odd entity of a thousand years--the Holy Roman Empire) and form a strategic plan to recruit other regions into a New United States.Along the way, the author interjects a lot of humor and good feelings, draws out tears and generates American pride. Not least among the wonders, the historical forces of the time (and thus of our current world) are exposed and laid bare, made comprehensible or characterized believably at the least. Amongst the plot elements, we meet historical figures as characters on their home turf as they react to this strange town of dangerous ideas (Work of the devil or devine miracle?) such as Cardinal Richelieu, prime minister of Louis XIII's France, and the man some credit with inventing the modern army, the Golden Lion of the North, Gustavus Adolphus II (Vasa), King of Sweden and founder of the burgeoning Swedish Empire as it ascended it's new prominence, as well as a host of more minor historical figures in the land of petty nobles taken to insane extents.How the author mixes in these and many other elements (Jews, the Inquisition, relations between Catholics and protestants, etc.) makes for an informative and thought provoking work with much humor scattered in the mix. In fact, it spawned a movement of sorts, a widespread demand for a sequel, and the series has burgeoned since 2004 swelling to over a dozen book length works includingmanyanthologies(example product links: Ring of Fire and Grantville Gazette III).The success is warranted and makes for a fun re-read as well as a wonderful first experience. Successor novels have hit the NY Times best seller lists for good reason, and several websites service a large and growing base of fans and would-be writers.

Great characters and an awesome concept make for a book that will suck you in and keep you interested throughout.The concept of a middle-American town being transported to medieval Germany in the middle of a civil war is quite bizzare, but is presented nicely by Flint (even if he didn't make an effort to explain the how-did-it-happen of the remarkable event). It turns out that an American town (complete with its own operational power plant, coal mine, and municipal facilities) would be well-suited to survive and thrive in old Germany. Flint does an excellent job of making the story seem realistic (except for the ring of fire), and the descriptions of both present day West Virginia and 17th century Germany sounding authentic. A good portion of the story relates actual events of the 17th century.

It earned four stars on the basis of the humor, but it didn't get five stars because Eric Flynn just isn't that great of a writer."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"This is an extremely good book that is a lot of fun to read. Very hard to put down. The premise of a West Virginia town being sent back to the year 1632 in the middle of Germany and the 30 years war is just TOO good! Mr. Flint develops fine, rich characters and great plot twists. The book has now become a series with 1633 and others... the canvas created by this first work is so broad that there could potentially be dozens of follow-on books.One word of caution - there is one single sex scene in the book that may be a bit strong for younger readers. Too bad, I always look for good books for my kids, but that one scene precludes this one from the list. Especially too bad since a much softer scene could have accomplished the same plot objectives."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"This is my best find of the year (so far at least).A small West Virginia mining town has been transported to 1632 Germany in the middle of the 30 Year War. The Americans are shocked by the situation but quickly adapt. They realize that their original six square miles of territory is both in the path of the marauding armies and is too small to support them. The decision is made to establish a bit of America in the chaos that now surrounds them, to start the American Revolution a century and a half early. They began taking in refugees, German peasants escaping the brutalities of the merceneries, Jews fleeing persecution, and even some of the armies.The characters are well written - the Americans who step into leadership roles to help their town adapt, the refugees who see their chance to for survival, the generals and nobles who are carrying on the war are made real.The background on the 30 Years War is explained in a way that makes the conflict come alive. The choices that the town makes, the technologies they decide to keep or downsize are both plausible and logical. The quirky characters of the small town are familiar to anyone who has ever lived in one.I could barely pull myself away from this book and I'll be getting the second one, 1633, as soon as possible. BUY THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Well, not so much science really. The deus ex machina that pulls the characters into the past is weird, and from then on it reads as alternative history. But this is one of the best alternative history reads I've had. Flint writes far better than Turtledove, the alleged master of this genre. The characters are real, they develop, and I'm gripped at nearly every moment. The text isn't bogged down with historical details and trying to be accurate. The author is rather more interested in telling a story. The one drawback to the story is that there is *a lot* of violence. Arguably, violence is necessary to fully show the awfulness of conditions in 17th Century Europe. But some of the details could be avoided, and more time could be spent on non-violent life- or even non-violent action as possibilities. That said, I was still really drawn in to the text, found it difficult to put the book down (finishing it in 2 days), had no idea what would happen next, and can't wait to get to the next book in the series. Flint stays very true to their premise, and historical possibilities- if part of America showed up in 17th Century Europe, what would happen?"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Especially for those of us who were getting a bit fed up with the alternate history branch of Science Fiction that has been so heavily trodden in recent years, Flint has wrought a miracle! A fresh idea which opens new horizons, and a follow through that is making good on reaching those horizons. This is no &quot;Connecticut Yankee&quot; rip off. This is no &quot;What would have happened if Grant's horse had stumbled at Appatomatox?&quot; This is a whole new world opened right in the middle of fairly familiar world history by the transfer (how is completely immaterial) of a chunk of modern USA large enough to literally change the world in one of its darker moments (er, centuries). By throwing the concept out to other authors in a controlled way Flint has assured us all of a continuing flow of fresh ideas. The book and its sequals are all page turners. Flint has also wisely chosen to dwell on all the human and cultural aspects of the event and that should prove a revelation to most of us who don't appreciate how much &quot;ordinary people&quot; have changed in these few centuries, while staying the same at heart. It is a cliche to say that if you want to appreciate the USA, travel abroad. Well, this series hammers you into appreciating how much most of our whole world (bad as it is) has improved. Once more Science Fiction has demonstrated its ability to open new vistas of understanding for us residents of planet Earth."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"This is one of those books I did not want to end. The author has created an incredible setting and strong developing charaters. He blends gripping military action, international politics, and romance into one of the best time displacement stories I have ever read. I am pleading with Mr. Flint for a sequel and hope for a long series of books from him."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"This book was great! I couldn't put it down and I'm not normally much of a sci fi reader. It has been a while since I have read a book that I could get this excited about. My brother and I talked about it so much the rest of the family is waiting in line to read it."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Except for its unimpressive cover, there's hardly a bad word to say about this book. The very beginning is a bit rough, but Flint quickly hits his stride and produces an alternate history work worthy of Turtledove or Stirling. In fact, the closest parallel is to Stirling's Island in the Sea of Time series, but although that parallel is obvious, it is also not as great as it first appears. Despite the structural parallels (mining an old science-fiction style), this is a very different story from Stirling's. That said, if you enjoy Stirling's work, you'll probably enjoy this one. I've taken great pleasure in Flint's earlier work, especially the coauthored Belisarius series, and I'm happy to see him produce such an excellent tale on his own. I assume there's a sequel?"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Little modern West Virginia coal-mining town gets transported back to Germany in the middle of the Thirty Years War, and jingoistic alternate history ensues. First of a series.I first picked this up when I had a couple hours to wait for a medical procedure, and had forgotten to come prepared. I'd heard of the series, so figured I'd give it a try. It was bad going--I got almost 20 pages in before my procedure was done, and that was all he read. Then it got mentioned at Readercon 2008, in the \\"Under-represented Historical Periods\\" panel; the gist was: yes the writing is terrible, but some people find the history cool and interesting. So, okay, I gave it another try.The writing *is* terrible: the characters aren't even fully one-dimensional, the plot holes and credibility gaps are yawning, and it's poorly constructed in plain story-telling. It reads a lot like Tom Clancy, but with clunkier technology (in a couple senses). But I find the history interesting--then again, I'm already interested in the Thirty Years War and know the situation and the characters (I don't think he's fair to Bernard of Saxe-Weimar, btw); I'm not sure how cool people would find it who come to it cold.You know what it mostly reminds me of? The big SCA-goes-back-a-thousand-years thought experiment that dominated the Rialto back in the mid-90s? Most of those same tropes are here (a couple conspicuously missing), but done a little more optimistically: a whole town, with the infrastructure that implies, and arriving in a time technologically closer, so they can apply their tech knowledge (which couldn't really have been done in 995).Oh, and although the title is 1632, they go back to the year 1631. Just sayin'."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"What a very fun book to read! And what a great way to get someone interested in a period of history. Sure, there's the jingoistic \\"Americuh, **** yeah!\\" aspect to it, but it's often played for laughs.The premise of the book is that about a 6 mile radius sphere of a modern day West Virginian small mining town is suddenly scooped out due to an advanced species' temporal negligence and dropped down in the middle of Germany in 1631, about 10 years into the ferociously vicious and bloody Thirty Years War.They were lucky enough to have brought along their power plant and enough doctors and folks who had multiple guns and other knowhow to make them an increasingly important economic and social force of the time.There are lots of hilarious parts, like the Scots' reactions to the \\"spirited girls\\" - American style cheerleaders in their cheerleader outfits. And there are also parts that are true to the times: filth, starvation, illness, rape and a deep lack of freedom and rights for the majority of the population.This kept me up long past my bedtime and now I am going to hunt down at least the next sequel to see if it's still as interesting, educational and entertaining as the first."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"1632, a story about a small W Virginia town transported/transplanted to Germany in the year 1632 shows quite a large amount of imagination from the author but it is overly simplified and underdeveloped. The characters seem to be a bit shallow and there is very little depth to their personalities. In my opinion, the book suffers from over simplification and unbelievable historical tie-ins. One would wonder why people from 1632 so readily accept contemporary American practices and culture. I would have believed more readily that each American would have been burned at the stake far faster than they would have been welcomed into Europe of that time. Another gripe would be the author's attempt to make the story balanced and politically correct when it comes to race. Europe of the time WAS racist and women were NOT given freedoms as the type the author gives them. I tend to be a realist and the book lets me down.But if you take away all pretense of \\"what REALLY would have happened\\" the book is enjoyable. In my opinion there are not enough writers of the alternate history genre and I applaud Mr. Flint for his efforts. Yes, some aspects of the book irk me... but beggars aren't choosers."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"This is the first of Flint's \\"shared universe\\" series; followed by 1633, 1634: the Baltic War and more. It's not as good as the others in the series, especially those written by/with Weber but it's still a pretty damn good book.Several reviewers of Flint's books accuse him of political/religous bias in his works; this appears, to me, to be mainly in the mind of the reviewers. Otherwise Flint manages the impressive task of being simultanously a Marxist, a Libertarian, a Liberal and a pro-NRA gun nut who writes to show off his knowledge of C17 European politics and making basic factual mistakes.......all the time spewing politically correct platitudes that are also jingoistic garbage.Judge for yourself; it's availabe free for download from Baen (http://www.baen.com/library/defaultTitles.htm)"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I've been aware of this book's existence for a bit now, and there is at least one follow-up book out there somewhere.The premise is pretty straight-forward: What if an American town got transplanted into the middle of Europe during the 30 Years War? In this case, a West Virginian town. I expect that has something to do with the fact that a West Virginian town had a much higher chance of survival than a similarly sized town in upstate New York.I will admit that I spent the first couple of chapters trying to get a firm grasp on who was who. The cast is fairly large and a lot of them get thrown at you very quickly. Also, characters I expected to be important at first turned out not to be. I hope they are more important in the second book.But once it got going, it was a quick read and a lot of fun. I would definitely read 1633 if it fell in my lap.The characters were a lot of fun, and I have to give Mr. Flint bonus points for giving me people I believed in. These are not the ignorant rednecks you think they might be: They may not have gone to college, but a lot of these folks are smart and resourceful.I say not filling because it did have a few lacks. I felt okay about the portrayal of both the modern West Virginians and the historical Germans. But I finished the book with the feeling that I had been promised something more and I hadn't received it. This is not the feeling I get when I read a book and discover that it is entirely a device to get me to read the next book, just a feeling like I wanted something from the book that isn't there. Probably because I'm a literature snob.So, I'd definitely recommend it if you're looking for something light and fun to read. (And hopefully if Mr. Flint ever sees this he'll accept that as pretty high praise.)"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Overall, this was a good book. Not great, but good enough to make me want to get the next book - called, appropriately enough, 1633.What I liked:I liked that I learned a little bit about history without having to read a history book. : ) I liked how he pulled certain historical figures into the story. I liked the author's writing style, and the characters and premise were very interesting. This book has a lot of action, and is well paced and suspensful.What I thought could be improved upon:I didn't feel that the author showed enough anguish and mental trauma that these people would have gone through after having been ripped out of the world they knew and thrown into a much more hostile one. I would have liked more discussion about everyday things they needed to change to give me more of a sense of them adjusting to life there. The author also went into WAY more detail about battles than I ever wanted to know and then didn't fully explain some of the terms he was using that related to combat in that era. He also had an annoying tendency to end a chapter with repeating phrases. I can only assume that he thought (mistakenly) he was being poetic.The good far outweighs the few complaints I have, and I recommend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction or time travel fiction or just anyone who enjoys a a good, entertaining novel."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"ok, i can accept that a west virginia town gets miraculously transported to 1632 and the technological adjustments the transportees make are interesting, even clever.

I can tell that the author did his research regarding the 30 years war, and while the struggles the \\"settlers\\" face are fleshed out quite believably the characters themselves are cliches. Maybe that was what Flint was trying to do, test our way of life against cultures of the past to see how they would react against each other, using stereotypical blue-collar workers as his lab rats, but if that's then this reader still can't help but find the book (and it's characters) unattractive.

In this story, a small mining town of current day West Virginians is thrown back in time into the middle of the Thirty Years War, a destructive conflict between Catholics and Protestants. In their struggle to survive amid the harsh new reality they find themselves in, the inhabitants of Grantville must use every edge their technology gives them, and make common cause with the people they find in their new home. Along the way they meet such characters as the legendary Swedish king, Gustavus Adolphus.The story is filled with believable people and believable happenings. the Grantvillers, old and new, are a delightful group of characters ranging from the old mine supervisor and the union leader Mike Stearns, the doctor from Chicago's ghettos, the Jewish doctor/spy Balthazar Arabanel and his brilliant daughter Rebecca, the leftover '60s radical schoolteacher, the geek turned hero, the peasent camp follower turned revolutionary, the scottish cavalry commander, and the cheerleader who's the best sharpshooter in town.

Flint delivers some real history in colorful fashion. Most of his characters have some depth to their personalities. (A notable exception is the CEO character, a cartoonish stereotype that reflects the author&#65533;s biases &#65533; Flint is a proud union organizer and socialist.) The manner in which 17th Century Europeans react to American technology and culture almost makes the book worth recommending. Almost, but not quite.Unfortunately, Flint has an annoying habit of hinting at events in great meandering detail before he finally zeroes in on the heart of each matter. Other passages have so many characters speaking to one another, it&#65533;s nearly impossible to decipher who's referring to what.Despite those major weaknesses, I can&#65533;t say the book was boring or consistently difficult to read. But as hard as Flint tries, he's not in the same league as Michael Crichton, Robert Sawyer, or even Ben Bova. 1632 is a fun way to pass the time while you wait for the latest book from your favorite sci-fi novelist."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Just finished reading 1632 last night and, out of curiosity, decided to check and see how it fared on Amazon. I'm shocked for a number of reasons: first, that there were sequels, second, that there are so many people who have obviously read the book and still feel compelled to recommend it to others.In defense of the author, the concept of the story is great. Implementation unfortunately falls far short of potential.Other reviewers have elucidated the various issues of 1632 far better than I can, but to reiterate some of the book's more glaring shortcomings:- The characters are more like caricatures, shallow, one-sided, with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Does every heroine have to be the embodiment of a goddess?- I've experienced more sexual tension in a Disney animated movie. A talented author may be able to pull off one \\"love-at-first-sight\\" coupling without it coming off as sappy or maudlin; Flint does not pull off any of the (numerous) pairings believably.- The voices of the native Europeans are terribly inconsistent. The not-insignificant language barrier issues aside, differences in the manner of speech between European nobility and coal-mining West Virginians would (and should) have presented more of an obstacle.- Does the author not understand that training for a biathlon does not mentally prepare a teenager for the psychological impact of sniper warfare? The lack of an emotional response from Julie does not make her seem courageous to me, she comes across as a sociopath.I could do this all day, but I won't. I made myself finish the book, but don't let my sacrifice be in vain - pass 1632 by."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Take one small West Virginia coal town, a \\"best pistol shot in town\\" Chief of Police, one \\"Not quite ready for Prime Time\\" Boxing (light/heavy weight) ex army miner.

Mix in Europe (in this case Germany) in 1632 AD add a friendly (not war mongering, even though he was invading) King Gustavus Adolphus, mix in a few good battles and what seems to be reasonable research in to European history. Then for seasoning, blend it all with a dash of anti Catholicism and the required bigotry towards Germans, and you have Eric Flint's 1632.All in all not the worst read I have ever read. Twains \\"Yankee\\" is the earliest version of this that I have ever read. It may be as good, but then I think that Twain tends to be overrated. Others have tried this scenario. In the 70's someone wrote a book called \\"The ship who sailed the time stream\\", 1632 is better. Just lately S.M Stirling has written a series of novels about the Island of Nantucket being sent back to the Bronze Age, they are better. And my favorite of all H. Beam Pipers \\"Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen\\". Frankly I would go out and buy Pipers \\"Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen\\" and read it, but then I like Piper's writing.

This has now become one of the greatest books that I have ever read (#2, sorry, but Ender's Game is still #1). It's not necessarily the actual storyline that makes this book great (although it does have a wonderful storyline), but rather the characters and character interaction that makes this book truly stand out. Take for instance my favorite character, the Scotsman Alex Mackay. When he's first introduced, he's a pretty good character, but Eric Flint makes him great by the simple fact that he get's a crush on another excellent character, Julie. Now, most author's would simply put a little into this, but in this book, Flint draws it out in a really exciting and funny way, without impeding the story at all, and he does this over and over agin in the book. It's absolutely incredible (I'm also biased a little seeing that I'm Jewish). He also doesn't put any real stupid sub-stories in it like many other Alternative History author's do, nor are there any terrible and idiotic righteous characters who are able to do the impossible and interfere with a good book, the characters in this book are fallable, which makes them seem real. Furthermore, Flint uses actual historical characters and real historical events, which make this a great book for history buffs as well. I do so hope that there is not a sequal to this, but rather a non-stop epic (Like the Conrad Stargard Series by Leo Frankowski, another great story)."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"This is a fun story about a West Virginia mining town transported to the middle of Germany during the 30 years war. Not only the entire town, but also the coal mines under the town are transported. This creates an instant source of power for the modern industrial base their local machine shops introduce to medieval Europe. The plot, such as it is, is that the Americans are going to introduce the concept of democracy to war ravaged Germany. There are a number of fun scenes where the hillbillies use modern weapons, vehicles, or tactics ... against the primitives.The story is not as much fun as it could be though. The first and most glaring problem is that the writing style is only one or two steps up from a \\"Dick and Jane\\" story. (See Spot run. See Jane run.) One of the other reviewers called it comic book writing, with which I would have to agree. The words are short and simple. The sentences are short and simple. The characters are, mostly, two dimensional stereotypes. Sometimes the author tries to be creative and blends two stereotypes together into a single character. My favorite of these is the cold blooded sniper who feels no remorse when killing the enemy from ambush, who is also the captain of her High School cheerleading squad because she's just SO full of spirit. After a while, you just get used to his style though, and maybe it's great for kids.Another thing that really bothered me personally, is that they are in the middle of an historical event, the 30 years war. They have a school library. They know what happens. They should pick a side (the author is very partial to the Protestants and Gustavus Adolphus, which is fine), take advantage of their knowledge of the future and their superior weaponry to win a decisive victory, then march on the enemy capitol and end the war. In other words, fight to win. The Battle of Breitenfield would have been a great place to turn a Protestant victory into a complete Catholic rout. The Americans should have known all about Breitenfield in advance, the same as the author did, yet they didn't even show up at the battle. Instead they think it makes sense to try and mind their own business, despite a Monroe Doctrine type policy of protecting themselves and their neighbors from invasion. This is just an invitation for the enemy to scout out their capabilities and defenses, and take their time to mount a well planned out attack against them.Finally, modern weapons are great and all, but if the good guys lost a round or two occasionally, it would be much more dramatic when they finally won in the end."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I loved Flint's books about Belisarius with David Drake, so I rushed out and bought 1632 in hardcover. Don't. Wait for the paperback. 1632 is good, but not in the same league as the Belisarius books.

After Westphalia, the Swedes had a reputation for being nasty to the civilian population even by the standards of the era, but there is not a word of that in this book. (We also see plenty of the evil of the Austrians' Croat light cavalry, but the Hackapells are depicted as if they were angels of the battlefield, when in reality they were as bad as the Croats or worse.)Nor is there a single word of the fact that Gustavus Adolphus was fighting for Sweden, not for Protestantism; or that Richelieu was fighting for France and to hurt the Habsburgs -- not for Catholicism. (He is utterly out-of-character in this novel.) The author even has the audacity to say that had Gustavus Adolphus won, Adolf Hitler would never have come to power -- but it was Adolphus, the French, and the Protestants in general who were responsible for the Westphalian system of sovereign states, in which, to use the term of a French jurist of the era, \\"the king can do no wrong.\\" Which of these sounds more Hitler-friendly: a system in which the king is responsible to no man (and his subjects are taught to do his will unconditionally), or a system in which he has superiors (the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope) who can and will depose him if he gets out of control, and in which his subordinate know that if the king orders them to do something evil, they are to resist him to the death?The Second World War is excessively on this author's mind; so perhaps it shouldn't be surprising that his style of propaganda is familiar from it. Summarize it this way: Gustavus Adolphus gets the Josef Stalin treatment in this book, depicted as a hero because he's working on the main character's side -- after all, whoever's on the main character's side is a good guy, and good guys are not capable of doing anything wrong, by definition.This is without even bothering to point out that the Black Legend is a flat-out lie, invented by a woman who tortured more people for death for religious reasons in her reign alone than the Spanish Inquisition did over the course of its 350-year existence.If you want a plausible novel set in the Thirty Years' War, which doesn't arbitrarily designate villains and warp the historical record until they fit, readThe Adventures of Simplicius Simplicissimus, a novel by an actual veteran of the war (and which, unlike most works of its era, is still eminently readable). Avoid this piece of dreck: it starts out plausible, entertaining, even gripping, then proceeds to go insane."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I say it's hard to find and it's what I was looking for because even though this isn't the first alternative history type book I've read(i.e I've read Turtledove, S.M. Stirling, and Forstchein) it's still the most balanced...in a political sense.I've just read the other reviews where somebody called Flint \\"a socialist\\". Speaking as a leftist radical myself---(I'm not afraid to admit it),(Not a \\"liberal\\" if you ever studied the use of that word),-- Flint does a little bit if sometimes not a lot more than the other authors I mentioned above to more accurately potray the modern industrial/technological United States, and the people that go with it, i.e. White Trash, Hillbillies, a Black Man that made it out of the ghetto, a lefty schoolteacher, and a CEO type.Compare him to Harry Turtledove, Guns of the South, and World War Series where Blacks and anyone darker than Asian is just a two dimensional character to be pitied or seen from the outside and not the inside. Compare him to William R. Forstchein and his Lost Regiment Series where Capitalism, neo-liberalism(free trade), and the motives for the Civil War were all just shining stars of the Great White American past. Compare him and Mr. Flint is a breath of fresh air.If you just looked at the cover you might think 1632 is just Manifest Destiny only centuries later and a continent away, but that tells you \\"Don't judge a book.\\"\\"\\" You know the rest. So far overall I like it because I know that a CEO who makes literally 100 times the salary that his average laborer makes(and that's on this side of the border), and will downsize, or cut jobs, and lives without blinking an eye can't be somebody I can comfortably sit at the table with. John Simpson the CEO is actually treated pretty good as that goes, because he's given a chance to be human even if he is 21st century North American Nobleman.I read Flint's statement at the end where he asserts that rural people in the United States aren't necessarily ignorant and racists, and I agree with it. I've come across white people from places like Texas, and Montana, and I've found them easier to talk to and more open minded than some of the \\"cosmopolitans\\" that live around me in Southern California. I remember the family( I don't remember where exactly they were from but somewhere in the South), and they were eating the ice cream in Tijuana Mexico, something most white Southern Californians will never know the pleasure of but they're afraid of it because of their prejudice while they trust McDonald's and Carl's Jr. like it was their mother's cooking.I also compare him to one S.M. Stirling and his Island in the Sea of Time who tries to make me believe that 20th Century dojo martial artists are going to beat ancient warriors of Europe and America in hand to hand combat. That's just not reality. We don't know what those ancient warriors could do if we put them amongst us today and it doesn't matter if they came from Japan, China, or not. Somebody whose combat tested with swords, or his hands is not somebody to take lightly by somebody whose done it for a hobby in our own time.I like the concept of the book. It's always fascinating to entertain the fantasy of changing history with what we know today. My only criticism so far would be that the book is too optimistic. Victories are just too easily taken by the new American Army. I can't believe that almost anything that goes wrong rebounds to favor the new American Republic. Aside from that though it's great reading because of the detail and authenticity. When you read these books you get a feel for what 17th century life, nobility, and squalor was like, and what would happen if it collided with 21st century idealists(and not everybody in this century is an idealists, i.e CEOs). You're also getting very good basic introductions into people, places, and events should you for some reason want to do research on them for school or some other reason.Read these books both 1632, and 1633. It's worth your while"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Mr. Flint took a great idea and didn't run with it. It seemed to me that this book would have been better if it was stretched out into a trilogy, or more, along the lines of Forstchen's &quot;Lost Regiment&quot; series. Every thing in 1632 seemed to happen way to fast. The UMWA conquered army after army, won the girl and created a society faster then anything Superman could have done. Within a matter of months or even days these W. Virginians &quot;conqured&quot; almost all of Europe. It would have been a more interesting book if there was more overall danger and the town didn't seem to overcome every disaster in a blink of an eye."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Reading Eric Flint's \\"1632\\" reminded me of two science fiction works. The first is L. Sprague de Camp's classicLest Darkness Fall, which is predicated on a similar premise: a man from the present finds himself suddenly transported to the collapsing Roman Empire, where he uses his knowledge of modern ways to change history. In this novel, however, it is not a solitary historian who is dropped into the past, but an entire West Virginia town. This gives them a significant advantage over de Camp's character, as they have tools, weapons, even a functioning power plant to provide electricity in a pre-steam engine age. The circumstances may not be quite as challenging, but the similar goals lead to a lot of fun, as the residents of Grantville find themselves bringing American values and know-how to the tumultuous struggle of the Thirty Years War.This transformation of 17th century Germany brought to mind another science fiction tale, theJanissariesseries by Jerry Pournelle. In it, a group of American mercenaries are plucked off of a hill in Africa and taken to a planet to supervise the harvesting of a narcotic plant. Like Eric Flint's West Virginians, they encounter humans from earlier ages who had been deposited there previously. Yet whereas Pournelle used this scenario to depict very human fragmentation and conflict between the mercenaries, Flint's Grantvillians present a virtuous front adhering to idealized values - a front that is perhaps a little TOO virtuous. Such an approach constricts the novel, as well as creating lopsided clashes between the united Americans and their outmatched opponents. It would have been far more interesting to depict a divided community with opportunists allying themselves with Grantville's enemies.It all adds up to a series that is entertaining but largely predictable. Hopefully Flint and his subsequent collaborators overcame these limitations in later volumes of this popular series, which makes for enjoyable reading but left me with the sense that it could have been so much better."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I really enjoy alternative histories, and generally I liked this book. However, Flint is a better researcher than he is a storyteller. The characterizations are a bit hackneyed, the dialogue is often stilted, and the point-of-views switch around confusingly. I'd give this book a mild recommendation."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"While the concept of plopping a bunch of hillbillies into 17th Century Thuringia is engaging, this story never quite lives up to its potential. Flint's writing style is simplistic, his characters are two dimensional, and the challenges they face aren't particularly challenging.For example, the locals give into the American way of doing things all too easily, throwing off social convention and prejudice with wild abandon. The political powers the Americans have to deal with show a similar lack of willpower. Flint doesn't seem to believe that anyone could hold religious or political convictions strong enough seriously oppose Americans and their winning ways. Never mind that the historical residents of the area in question had been happily slaughtering each other over minor points of doctrine for years. Yet it barely takes any time at all for Flint to have Catholics, Jews, and Protestants of all nationalities working together for no greater goal than television, while the authorities do nothing to crush a major threat to their power.A better fish-out-of-time story is Leo Frankowski's &quot;Cross-Time Engineer&quot; series. While Conrad Schwartz has some help from the same agency that accidentally sends him back to 13th Century Poland, Frankowski makes his main character face some truly daunting tasks, not least defending Poland from invading Mongols. Which makes for a much more exciting tale."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I've read Stirling's Island in the Sea of Time and as I really liked it I was looking for a book with a similar setting, 1632 seemed promising - until I actually tried to read it.To make it shortnegative:--- Reality is seldom black and white, not so in this book: protestant or jewish=good, catholic=bad; union member=good, capitalist=bad; swedish=best, dutch or english=good, the rest=suspect; gustav adolphus=godlike (oh he started wars with every single one of his neighbors but only for humanitarian reasons, really, and I'm sure the (catholic *and* protestant) cities pillaged to support his army were glad to have bathed in his unearthy glory -- perhaps he was actually better than most of his fellow kings at that time but he was definitely no peace-loving saint)--- 1-dimensional doesn't do the characterisations justice; 0-dim comes closer--- \\"Don't worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, you'll have to ram them down people's throats.\\"Eric Flint obviously never heard of this saying as every \\"good\\" character (don't worry you will know whether one person is good or bad the moment he/she is introduced) casts aside every believe or custom of his old life and accepts the superiority of the UMWA way--- I like unions, I really think they're a good thing; but I *don't* want to read every second sentence how the brave men of the UMWA saved the day and what good friends they are and how only unionists are true Americans... you get the idea--- Everything goes smooth, too smooth; noone goes mad after realizing that he'll never see the 20th century again, there's enough of everything and some smaller problems with keeping the modern stuff running appear more like an afterthought--- the writing is bad, really bad in fact that book would make an acceptable fanfic but it utterly fails as a serious book;positive:--- You really learn to appreciate the other alternate history/time travel books available - I already mentioned Island in the Sea of Time as it has a similar setting (small town is set back in time and its struggle for survival) but there are many more out there and I'd assume that most are better than this onesummary:Due to its patriotic tendencies perhaps a nice read for Independance Day (unless you're a businessman, government official, catholic, historian or have troubles accepting the general superiority of the industrious West Virginian mine worker) but please don't read that book and expect to know anything about the 30-years war afterwards."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Lord Kalvan managed to turn a whole world upside down all by his self.

MG."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"EDIT: update of prior reviewYou would think that a Science Fiction author writing a time-travel novel would know something about the history of the period he's using for his setting. If the author is Eric Flint,you would be wrong. This becomes more understandable once the reader realized that Flint (like Weber, White and others) is interested neither in Science nor in history but is rather writing a war-game thinly disguised as a novel. You could stick a pin on a page at random and find a serious error and several minor errors in science, history, dialogue, plotting or characterization but I'm going to choose one. Shakespeare as the Earl of Oxford. If you want good Science Fiction, Excellent writing and Shakespeare you have to look no further than \\"The Goblin Reservation\\" by Clifford D. Simak. There is an ugly undercurrent of bigotry, discrimination and ethnocentricism than runs through Flint's work, but it's especially clear with his sly dig at Shakespeare. There has been, since the Romantic era, a 'cult of genius' which, foaming at the mouth, spews forth that a 'common' man could not possibly have written with the genius of the man from the midands and therefore a 'gentleman' (Bacon, Oxford, etc) must have done so. Rubbish. Oxford is quickly dealt with. He was *dead* when Shakespeare was still writing. I'm sure that Flint finds more comfort in believing that a member of the upper crust could write better six feet under than a living man from a poor background. Class bigotry prefers a dead upper class writer than to believe in a living genius, albeit of humble origins. Flint might also have kept in mind that Ben Johnson (a friendly rival of Shakespeare) had a longer life than Shakespeare, was a 'cult' figure in his own right and if there had been even a rumor that Shakespeare had not written the plays attributed to him would have said so and said it loudly. Frankly, using the sort of 'evidence' that Flint and his fellow Oxfordian use to *prove* that Shakespeare wasn't Shakespeare Eric Flint couldn't prove he wrote \\"1632 (The Assiti Shards)\\". It would be more likely, using their own criteria, that Flint is a house pseudonym used by several authors. This is merely an example. Even a cursory glance at any Flint novel will show that his fiction has a paper backdrop, with characters cut from pasteboard and patchwork derivitive plots stitched together with pseudo-history and childish battle re-enactments.For some examples of good story telling try:The Goblin Reservationby Clifford D. Simak(A much better take on the Shakespeare/Oxford controversy since Simak has both wit and talent)The Devil in Velvetby John Dickson Carr(Again, better story telling, better history. A nice look at the period and a view of Cromwell from the point of view of the Royalists. )Any of the Paratime stories by H. Beam Piper of course.The Guns of the Southby Harry Turtledove(One of the better of the \`modern' alternate history stories.Give his WWII series concerning Japan/Hawaii a miss. Seems rushed. Very superficial)"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"There's few people who don't find the prospect of alternate history, in one form or another, fascinating in some way. It's a harmless but thoroughly enjoyable way to put together different historical (albeit impossible) scenarios and see how they play out. Imagine if Hannibal had cannon technology and laid seige to Rome? What if Darius had breach-loading rifles and was able to stop Alexander the Great dead in his tracks at the battle of Issus? What if the Confederate army had access to biplanes and engaged in days-long strafing runs of Union forces at Gettysburg? Admittedly a lot of the ideas (like the ones I put) are beyond comprehension, and perhaps a little silly, but it still draws a lot of people in, mostly to see how things would have turned out had history been nudged a little, or quite a lot, as with \\"1632\\".Through some intergalactic artsy accident, the town of Grantville, WV is blasted back in time to the 30 Years War in central Germany. The denizens of the town, largely miners, are initially oblivious to what has happened but quickly integrate themselves into the military/political situation of the day by liberating a slew of local peasants and townships and incorporating them into a new USA. All this is made possible by the incredible array of weapons that the citizens of Grantville have in their ownership, including a lone M-60 machine gun, which plays a pivotal part in the first \\"battle\\" of the book.The book is a real page-turner and you'll find yourself drawn into the story with surprising ease. The main characters are not stand-out heroes like you see in the movies, but rather just like you or I. This is a very pleasing aspect of the book as is the way the book precedes the reader's thoughts of what technological advancements can be made from what they have on hand. After all, there are only finite sources of ammunition and technology (such as computers, cars, etc) that will only last for so many years. As a result the citizens of Grantville are forced to create technology, which archaic by our standards today, would be wildly advanced for the time in which they find themselves; steam engines, rifled cannon, gatling guns, etc. As I read I kept thinking \\"you know, they can make zeppelins, submarines, battleships, rail-lines, penicillin, and things that would *still* blow the doors off of 17th century Europe\\". And that's a large part of where the genius and fun of this book comes from. It practically begs the imagination of the reader to use their noodle to involve itself in the creation process. I've no doubt at all that this is what forms the bedrock of the strength of the series.On the flipside, to echo some of the other reviewers, Mr. Flint does get a little heavy-handed at times with the bellicose union sentiment, such as when Mike leaves the wedding at the beginning of the book and sees all his union/miner cohorts in the parking lot and thinks, \\"UMWA. Solidarity forever\\". What??? I actually heard a groan escape my lips. The book has it's moments when dialogue becomes slightly clunky, but my only real complaint was the aforementioned excessive-at-times pro-union stance the author takes. Such is his right as the author, and truthfully it's only a very minor distraction in the overall scheme of things.Some have argued that the book takes a left of center approach, while others have stated a distinctly conservative bent from the book. The truth is that it's actually a unique combination of both. Union members tend to be a strange mix of \\"Live conservative, Vote liberal\\" types of people you're likely to come across in the country and before you bash the book too hard for any perceived political messages, think how God-awful it could have been had Mr. Flint blasted members of PETA, NOW, or MoveOn.org into the past. George Soros versus Cardinal Richlieu would have been a hoot, but c'mon!In summary, fantastic book. It's a great, addictive read that has me salivating to read the sequels. Thoroughly recommended!"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"This novel jumpstarts a series that has already produced 4 worthy sequels. This is truly only the beginning; Mr. Flint is ever-expanding the 1632 universe and a myriad of novels, short stories, and compilations should be expected in the years to come. 1632 introduces us to the town of Grantville - a small mining town in West Virginia that is hurled 370 years back in time and lands in Germany, namely in the year 1632, smack in the middle of The Thirty Years War. The technological advancements and different political/ethical mores of the Grantville inhabitants profoundly affect their surroundings and the entire continent trembles in awe, admiration, and fear. Grantville eventually becomes a powerful nation-state and the balance of power in 17th-century Europe is irrevocably changed.There is no denying that \\"1632\\" is a rousing and highly compelling read. When the mid 17th century and early 21st century clash, sparks fly in every direction. This book is best described as \\"unputdownable.\\" Once you start it, prepare to set aside other priorities, because \\"1632\\" simply draws you in an irresistible way.While I consider this book as a \\"5-star\\" novel, I have three minor qualms --1) Mr. Flint is a union leader/supporter who sometimes gets a little too preachy when praising blue-collar workers in general. Even though Mr. Flint's opinions are highly palatable, he gets on his soap-box a little too often...2) Grantville seems to have an unending supply of weapons and ammunition. Their stockpile of weapons, including heavy weaponry, would put most third world countries to shame. Why does a very small town in West Virginia harbor such a stunning arsenal?3) When faced with the radically different way-of-life of Grantville residents, 17th century inhabitants either whole-heartedly reject it or embrace it with great fervor and zeal. To my surprise, a very high percentage of them fall into the latter group. These people assimilate the very alien 20th or 21st century concepts with a tremendous amount of ease and speed. Would this really be possible? When comparing the stunningly different ethical and moral premises of mid 17-century Europe with early 21st century America, the differences are staggering. The culture shock would have been daunting. Such easy and joyful assimilation seems to be quite a stretch.Let me mention, however, that these three minor concerns do not considerably detract from the greatness of Mr. Flint's novel. \\"1632\\" is an exciting, creative, and very intriguing novel."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"It's hard to think of a genre book I've enjoyed as much as 1632 and its sequel 1633 of late. This is a &quot;what if&quot; history---what if a small American village, ordinary folks, no experts--were suddenly transplanted to Europe in the middle of the infamous 30 Years' War... The book wisely wastes no time on how or why it happens, but deals with the consequences from the outset. The first problem is survival, both in terms of defense from rampaging soldiers and material things in life. The second is acclimating. The third is finding allies. All are compelling, but it is with the story of King Gustav of Sweden, and the alliances undertaken against Richlieu and others, that the book really becomes special. The Americans are now forced to deal with the &quot;game of thrones,&quot; the political manipulations of the day. This carries through more strongly in fact, in the sequel. Entertaining, and written in a page turner style that makes it hard to put down. You always want to find out what happens next. And whether this little group will suceed in becoming a shining light to nations, or be swallowed up by the factions and brutalities of the time."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"The book has it's flaws, but it kept me up for a night with many hopeless attempts at &quot;just one more chapter.&quot;I'm not a big fan of Science Fiction, and thankfully the author paid no more than a few pages to the event which transports a small American mining town to 1632 Germany. From there, the action, the historical notes, and the plot work very well together. I was most impressed with the description of Breitenfeld, and the author has made a detailed study of the era, both military and social history. In fact, Flint does it so well that reading about automatic rifles and busses in the 17th century does not require too much imagination. He integrates the modern town so well with his historic descriptions so as the story moves along it's quite easy to pay no attention to 17th century peasants watching TV.The characters are a little one-dimensional, all good or all bad, but this is not Bronte; the story and the research drive the book, and the characters are just deep enough to grab your attachment.As for the historic characters who pop up; Flint demonizes Tilly and Wallenstein while practically raising Gustuvas Adolphus to sainthood. Though it was not enough to spoil the book, these characterizations required a greater suspension of disbelief than the mining town showing up in Germany.Overall, a great read, especially if you like history. I can't think of any other fiction set during this period; an era of brutality, carnage and events which is sadly ignored by most English speaking history curriculae."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Disclaimer first - I ordered this because somebody was selling the last hardcover CHEAP, then was put off by the rather obnoxious cover art. Luckily for me, I read it anyway. The history is well researched, and the battle sequences well done, but the reason I have read it now 6 times in three weeks is the characters. They are fascinating people, and act in a believable manner, given their personalities and eperiences. Some of the scenes are so well visualized that they burn themselves into your memory, or at least they did mine.Some of the complaints in other reviews are reasonable - Mr. Flint's admitted unionism sometimes gets the better of him, and some are not. One reviewer complains that 17th century Europeans are too eager to adopt advanced technology, when such has been the experience every time less advanced people have encountered it. Another complains of the &quot;intolerance&quot; of the West Virginians. Well, when suddenly confronted by torture and gang rape, they put a stop to it. Hooray for them - this multiculturalism can be taken too far.Mr. Flint introduces characters who are interesting and realistic, and you hate to see the book end. It practically screams the need for a sequel."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Give 1632 author Eric Flint points for working up an original and intriguing alt-history premise: Quiet West Virginia mining town, ca. 2000 AD, gathers together for a big wedding, but suddenly finds itself and everything within a 3 mile radius radius violently transported to central Germany during the height of the Thirty Years War, and forced to fend for itself. The idea of modern communities plopped lock-stock-and-barrel into the distant past is not a new idea, even to the modern alt-history genre; as other reviewers have noted, S.M. Stirling gave it a turn most notably in his Nantucket series (\\"Island in the Sea of Time\\"). Nonetheless, Flint presents a scenario rich for exploration, and one he's clearly done a great of homework on. For that alone he earns at least two stars.Unfortunately, the execution leaves much to be desired. 1632 might be able to survive the pedestrian writings, stilted dialogue and two dimensional characters - alternate history is after all too rarely known for its literary quality. Too often, however, Flint labors to squeeze his narrative into a tightly circumscribed worldview, and the result regularly does violence to the credibility of the story. Seventeenth century Europeans and twenty first century Americans adapt all too quickly and painlessly to an incredible set of circumstances, one which painfully cuts the latter off forever from almost everyone and almost everything they have ever known or loved and presents the former with assumptions and developments they would have found far more than just surprising or even momentarily shocking. Human nature is remarkably adaptive to be sure; but the speed and ease with which Flint's characters respond to it all piles on the anachronisms quickly. It also makes for a terribly predictable story. At no point are 1632's readers ever likely to doubt the eventual triumph of Grantville and its inevitable (re)creation of a United States a century and a half early and a half a world away.More to the point, it is a very particular United States that Flint has in mind: blue-collar, egalitarian, socially progressive, righteous - the latter permitting the West Virginian enthusiasm for firearms to fit in with the rest of Flint's ideal America. Flint's background as a left-wing political activist gives him an unusual and even unique perspective in the alt-history genre. However, his relentless determination to read America's present and Europe's past through that political prism makes for a too-preachy and too predictable story. For all his considerable research into the time period, the Thirty Years War ends up reduced to black (Catholics, the Empire) and white (most Protestants and Jews), and noble men and women of the United Mine Workers of America have no hesitation at all in choosing up sides, and even mates, accordingly. Tilly is a monster; Gustavus Adolfus is a Carlylian hero. The reader is never really ever in doubt how the characters will respond, or who the final denouement will favor.Readers intrigued by the idea of time-travelling communities are best advised to consider reading Stirling's Nantucket and Conquistador books or Harry Turtledove's Videssos series. And if you've read those - not to expect much from 1632. Or its several sequels."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"1632 is a &quot;Bootstrap&quot; story in the tradition of Lester Del Rey and Robert A. Heinlein. The story flows smoothly and the characters are three dimensional. After reading this story I put Flint in the same league as Bujold, Dickson, Del Rey, Heinlein, Stirling, and Turtledove.The town of Grantville, West Virginia is mysteriously transported to the year 1632. Yes, that particular gimick has been used before: S. M. Stirling's Island in the Sea of Time, Leo Frankowski's The Cross-Time Engineer, Harry Turtlesove's The Misplaced Legion, and William Forstchen's The Lost Regiment to name a few. But the story doesn't feel stale. The way Flint writes it the story still feels fresh and fun. The town finds themselves in the midst of Europe's &quot;40 Years War&quot; and reacts the way that we all hope we would. They pull themselves up by their own bootstraps and try to leave the world a better place than they found it. The story doesn't rely on super geniuses or spectacular achievements in science. It's about ordinary people taking what they have and doing their best.This is an enjoyable read that leaves you feeling like enough hard work really CAN make a difference."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I am a fan of the CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT type of books so I knew going in that I would like this book.

I don't care and would have preferred a one page summary, I am not a fan of strategic war games.2. At no time during the book does it refer to anyone going around and picking up the spent cartridges.

And yes, I enjoyed \\"War and Peace\\", though it was a little draggy. I've read the good and bad reviews on this book, and most naysayers never bothered to read the rest of the series, where much of their criticisms were addressed, intentionally or unintentionally. So what's my take on this series? I like it. I also like his 1812 series (relatively new). I didn't expect them to be 100% historically accurate or have some precognitive prognostications on what things should have been or would have been \\"if\\". It's a good yarn, and while not quite up to Plato's Republic, or Shakespeare's \\"Julius Caesar\\", IT'S A GOOD YARN. Reasonably logical, and yes, it has some biases like nearly EVERY author I've ever read. That's human. So I chose to enjoy a fun, escapist read with just a hint of connection to high school and adult history. And it has been a blast. And it had me looking up a number of people and events in online search engines just to see what the REAL one was (or was about). If you want a history book, your local community college has courses, or Amazon can get textbooks for you. If you want entertainment with just a bit of connection to real history, this is a good series. Hope \\"1636\\" comes out soon, and they (Flint and co-authors) will continue the 1812 series too.

It's the book I take with me on trips to read because I never get tired of it and every time I read it I find something new. I was at the bookstore the day 1633 was released and, sadly, it was not as good. The subsequent books have what I call \\"franchise-itis\\" because they have gotten caught up in the franchise, blown their focus and lost the wonderful character development of the original. However, the Grantville Gazette books do keep a character focus, most of the time, and I buy and read them regularly. WARNING! Stratfordians and history buffs beware, Eric Flint gave one of his characters an Oxfordian claim in 1632 to please his publisher. In a later book he recants, sorta, but it's still a jarring note in an otherwise outstanding alternative history."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Interesting: whenever Americans get lost in time they try to recreate the United States. No matter if it's the bronze age as with Stirling's Islanders or the Germany of the 30-years-war as in this book. But the if there ever was a place and age that required a beacon of light and the hope to exercise one's fundamental rights - life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness - it was Germany in 1632.The characters are colourful and the humour is rich. For example the story who really wrote Shakespeare's plays but did not pay his doctor's bills .... . Well, lets just say that the book likes to tell little tales about divine justice.The Grantville heroes have a blue-collar spirit and attitude, but then there is Gustavus Adolphus ... . IMHO Eric Flint makes him a bit too much of a saviour/hero - and at the same time Wallenstein and Richelieu villains, who were in many ways men ahead of their time and age.So the mix of not-quite-historical people with Flint's West Virginians and its results is colourful, but very much wishful thinking. But then so is all alternative fiction. Here we get it all: suspense and romance, history and scifi, politics and humor.With this book Eric Flint has established himself - ,together with S.M Stirling - as the master of colourful story-driven alternative history. The latest novels by that other master Harry Turtledove are much more like a reporter's account from a somewhat different history . History-driven instead of story-driven, which makes them somewhat less enjoyable to read because they almost beg to be taken seriously.However with this book it is the story, the eternal values that make it such an enjoyable read and make me to eagerly wait for the sequel. It will be interesting to see if Flint continues as in the Belisarius-series with endless battles and an almost super-human hero, or if he takes the approach of Stirling's Islander series with a bit of fast forward in time and new central heroes.It will be also be very interesting to see how Flint continued Stirling's Reformer\\" in the upcoming Tyrant\\".

Sharon's brother Mike is the local union president and very popular with the rank and file. The groom, the son of wealthy parents who object to this wedding, plays football at West Virginia. In spite of the elitist, scornful behavior of Tom's parents, the ceremony appears to be a success until a Ring of Fire erupts.When the air clears, Mike, the other guests, and much of the townsfolk realize they are no longer in West Virginia. They soon learn that somehow the Ring of Fire transported them to 1632 in the Northern Germanic States. The new world that Mike and his cohorts have entered is a devastated place filled with famine and the death of peasants caused by the unending religious wars. Yet, for the aristocrat, the world remains untouched until Mike and company form the local chapter of the UMWA.1632 is a clever time travel tale that should provide much acclaim to author Eric Flint for his imaginative and speculative story line. The entertaining tale is crisp and fun to read as the twentieth century union members clash with a class system outside anything they ever imagined. Science Fiction readers who enjoy novels like Crichton's Timeline and Hoyle's Professor Q books will fully relish the impact of this wild displacement book."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"1632 is not my favorite &quot;alternate history&quot; &quot;time travel&quot; novel but it is one of my top 10! Mr. Flint does an excellent job getting the feel of the age onto the pages and a more than passable job of dealing with the language issue. (Dropping a small town full of modern day West Virginians into 17th century Europe causes many Language barriers!) The introduction of the United Mine Workers and having the Main character as the local Union Leader is a nice twist. Moreover, the author's treatment of History is excellent and his integration of &quot;real world&quot; historical figures into the story a pleasure to read! His battle scenes are clean and engrossing and the pace of the book is excellent. If I could voice one gripe about this book, I would ask it to be longer. (I tend to like more background story and deeper character development!) I recommend this novel if you are at all entertained by this sub-genre for Mr. Flint definitely delivers the goods!If you enjoyed S.M. Stirling's &quot;Island in the Sea of Time,&quot; you will enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Every now and then, I come across a book that gives me all sorts of troubles. I like it so much that I find myself putting off vital tasks so that I can keep reading. This is one such book. I have had it for quite a while. It sat in my \\"to be read\\" pile but didn't particularly draw my interest to begin before some of the others. Now I find myself scrambling to begin the next one.The story involves a rural West Virginia town. Due to some meddling by an alien race (who remain blissfully ignorant of their deeds), a 6 mile diameter sphere gets transposed in time and distance. It is set down in Germany right in the middle of the 30 Years War. Germany is not a happy place. Armies are ravaging the countryside and the people are in dire straights. This American town has its own ideas of what is right and proper and, in self defense, they set about imposing it on all of the communities around them. The natives are delighted but the nobility is somewhat less enthralled.The Americans have an initial advantage. Their technology gives them the edge over everyone but that will not last. Some things will run out and others will break down. In order to survive, the town will have to adapt downwards and the surrounding country will have to adapt upwards. It is a situation ready for misunderstandings, tension, laughs and absurd situations.I suspect that making a story like this work is not easy. There is a fine balancing act to make it \\"believable\\" and enjoyable and still explore the possibilities inherent in the situation. Flint makes it work."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"My first thought when I read 1632 by Eric Flint was that his was an awfully optimistic view of what would happen if a slice of Middle America were suddenly transferred almost 400 years back in time to Thuringia. The residents of Grantville, the West Virginia mining town that is suddenly transported backward in time and place accept their plight with little concern, but instead quickly start using their vastly superior weapons to go out and make new friends by blasting the bad guys that run rampant in that part of the world.However, I realized that this was part of the book's point-- when the going gets tough, the tough get going. This community of miners is used to taking care of themselves and is also used to working in solidarity. They don't waste time worrying about things beyond their control, they get started on taking care of the things they CAN control.I enjoyed this book and can't wait to read the next one in the series. It is a fun read that brings out the best in human nature. If you are a fan of Gene Roddenberry's universe that depicts a future where people have learned to work through their differences, then you will understand the basis for the optimism in this book. 1632 is an enjoyable, fun book."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I read the first 21 chapters on the Baen web page, twice, and was hooked. When \\"1632&quot; arrived by mail, I couldn't put it down. The novel starts out like, \\"Island in the Sea of Time\\" by S.M. Stirling, but is developed very differently. Flint puts most of his character development into the nice characters, otherwise his writing style is a lot like Stirling. \\"1632&quot; ends well and leaves to your imagination how modern American technology and political thought will impact European social development in 1632. Dare we hope for a sequel?"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I like Eric Flint. He has some understanding of history and the fact that people in the past were as smart as we are. Better, he recognizes, and emphasizes, that just because someone is illiterate doesn't mean that person is stupid.Flint does tend to write in editorial voice, and I don't mind that. There's a feeling of &quot;summing up&quot; and it gives away who's going to make it and who isn't, which reduces plot tension. There are times when I get a little tired of his italicized remarks. I may notice it since I read 1632 at one gulp. Mind candy for me, and a chance to notice things that, had I read it with breaks I might not have cared about.Gustavus Adolphus is all too often overlooked by people who don't study military history, and he shouldn't be. My admiration for the man is a little more reserved that Flint's, but hey. This is a messy period and anyone who studies it is going to have different views of who was great and why.I can't, and won't, dispute Flint about Jewish history. I only have the outlines, there. But, and this is a serious complaint, he over-emphasizes the Inquisition in the Germanies during the 30 Years' War, and what they were looking for. Washing too much leading to suspicion of being a hidden Jew? Er...well, the fastest and easiest way to end up burned at the stake was to get caught in a witch-hunt, and there were lots of those. They were as much Protestant as Catholic, and just as gruesome. Curiously, two European countries got off rather lightly on the witchcraft hysteria -- Italy and Spain. I guess there's only room for one sort of hysteria at a time.I had fun with this; the grammar didn't drive me nuts; and the manuscript has been proofread. If Flint can find it in his heart to ease up on the editorial give-aways, I'd be pleased, but he's the writer. It won't prevent me from buying his books and giving them an ok."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"This is the story of a small town in 20th-Century West Virginia suddenly plucked out of time and placed in the heart of medieval Germany during the 30 Years' War. The inhabitants of the town slowly learn their plight and begin assimilating local medieval residents, on their way to creating a new incarnation of the \\"United States\\" in medieval Europe.This was an entertaining book. I thought the events were a little simplistic, the \\"good guys\\" win almost every battle by sheer automatic-weapons firepower, and are never really seriously in jeopardy. The medieval residents who assimilate all seem to \\"adapt\\" to modern technology and culture a bit too quickly and easily, in my opinion. And I think that between superstition and mutual threat, the contemporary rulers would soon ally together to march on the Americans en masse, and overwhelm them even despite the superior firepower. (Although the story is structured so that the Americans advantagously encounter their foes piecemeal.) It was also a little hard to swallow that some blue-collar mine workers, school teachers, and local civic leaders suddenly become perfectly adept at adapting American political philosophy to the nuances of socially engineering a new society - all their policy decisions and strategic plans occur without a single misstep. (Can even master diplomats claim such a record?)However, all that said, if you just suspend disbelief the story is very enjoyable, like a fantasy role-play that is intended for fun more than for realism. I plan to read the other books in the series. It will be interesting to see how the unfolding \\"alternative history\\" of these new \\"United States\\" has ever-widening impact on world history, to the point that history as the Americans remember it will become unrecognizable, and they will be in uncharted waters. (For example, on the actual discovery and development of North America.) Also, how will the modern techonology, without the underlying social structure that developed it, influence the unfolding interaction of nation-states? What will happen if, for example, the medieval peoples gain mastery of the American technology and weaponry, thereby eliminating their chief advantage? What if a rival faction or traitorous individual within their midst, lured by the enticements of power and privilege, defects to aid their opponents with equal modern knowledge? All sorts of possibilities suggest themselves.One also wonders what possibilities may have arisen if the town of Grantburg had happened to have a small municipal airport..."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Flint starts his story with a bit of deus ex machina to accomplish the implausible premise he wants to work from - an entire modern West Virginia small town is picked up and zapped to Germany in the midst of the Thirty Years War. Technological advantages allow the heroes some quick and easy victories over the villains, but the town is too small to maintain a modern industrial base, and the supply of modern rifles and ammunition is limited. It increasingly becomes clear to the key characters that they can't survive off technological wizardry forever, leading to a bold plan: they'll have to launch the American Revolution ahead of time, find allies, and build their alliance into a new United States of Europe.It's a fun story, but there are some faults. The good guys are probably a little too cuddly to be really credible. Love at first sight between the Americans and the Europeans they land among is employed too frequently. Some major problems, such as the fact that all the younger citizens of Grantville will be in extreme danger from smallpox, are ignored. It's mentioned several times that the town dentist quickly runs out of anasthesia - why not use nitrous oxide, relatively easy to manufacture anyplace there's air? There are some points that don't bear the closest examination, but that doesn't stop the story from being a terrific read.I was amused by the reviewer below who praised the book for its \\"right of center\\" philosophy. Apparently he failed to notice that the two principal heroes are a trade union official and a former 60s radical, while a major villain is a wealthy executive. Flint is himself a former union organizer, and the politics here are definitely on the left, although subtle enough that some readers can clearly miss them entirely."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I checked this book out of the library when it first came out, and then bought it. My paperback is much loved, by my husband, by my teens ... it's a favorite. Flint sets up the time travel element and then the story takes off. I imagine he sat down one day and said to himself, 'what would happen if a West Virginia town ended up in 17th century Germany?' 1632 is the result and it's a fun ride the whole way."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I read this book at the recommendation of my dad, who stated it would be a positive portrayal of fellow West Virginians. I really enjoyed the read, and for a lot more than references to places familiar to me. While the circumstances aren't a unique one in this type of fiction, I felt the character development was top notch and the action sequences were well written and very effectively drew your attention. Some of the more detailed portions describing the politics of Europe during the 30-years-war were dry, but they were short and in retrospect served a purpose. If you're interested in this type of speculative fiction, this is certainly a nice book to read."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I really wanted to dislike this book. Being from that area of West Virginia, I went into it expecting some stereotypical hootin' and hollerin' from some good ole boys screwing up world history, but after years of making fun of the premise I decided to check it out.I read it in two days. I couldn't put it down.Don't get me wrong: the dialogue is corny (though it usually admits it when it is) and the characters are nothing but archetypes. Despite all this, I was enthralled with most of it - aside from the loooooong description of Gustav's battle against Tilly - and am getting ready to read the first sequel. If you like alternate history, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Very good read. Characters are vivid and interesting. The story and sub-stories are compelling. There is humor, excitement, intrigue and battles; the writing keeps you reading. Definitely one to recommend to friends. The 1/2 star off is for the one part that describes a battle and history, which doesn't further the story. (only boring part of the book) The pertinent parts could have been explained in a 4 page narrative instead of 2 or 3 (albeit short) chapters."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"So, I've seen this book on the shelves for years at B&N;, and finally decided to read it. Glad I did. Book was very entertaining.I'm not a historian and cannot vouch for the accuracy, but I don't really care. All I care about is the entertainment factor and it has that in spades.Look forward to reading the next book in the series."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"While I think S.M. Stirling's 'Island in the Sea of Time' was a better example of a time traveling town, this one is not without it's charms. In this novel, the good people are very good and the bad guys are bad thru and thru. The people - both the Americans and the Germans - adjusted to their new reality very fast and they were able to get quite a few modern conveniences up and running a little too quickly. But, after saying all that, it's still an fun read.I don't think this was intended to be historically accurate or a literary treasure. It was supposed to be entertaining and it succeeded in that quite nicely. I have already gotten the sequel, 1633, and plan to start reading it soon.I got this book as a kindle version directly from the publisher. There were no formatting errors per se, but the spaces between paragraphs were a bit large."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"1632 succeeds in being an entertaining action-filled story. If you go into expecting nothing more than that you won't be disappointed. 1632 isn't a literary masterpiece, but it never tries to be, and in consequence the flaws this novel has if held up to a more literary standard can hardly be considered failures.What flaws are those? The biggest one I found is that the characters are all divided into several groups of good and evil. There are no shades of gray. On one side there are the Americans and the Protestant armies, who are completely virtuous and benevolent. On the other there are the Catholic armies, which are comprised totally of vicious thugs. There's also the division between classes. Officers and higher-ups, whether in business or the military, are generally portrayed as pompous buffoons, while the common blue-collar masses are invariably heroic and infinitely more capable than their social superiors. Finally there's the division between people of different political ideologies. The main protagonists all have democratic, left-leaning beliefs (as Flint does) and are shown to be correct and sound in them. While those with more right-wing beliefs, such as the uncharismatic and short-sighted John Simpson (who seems to be written into the novel solely for this purpose) are shown to be deluded fools. Every character is doomed to fall into one of these categories and then be totally defined by the absolute value judgment of good or evil which Flint assigns to them. Needless to say, this greatly limits the degree of realism and depth the novel is capable of. The characters weren't cardboard but they didn't they seem completely real because of this either.Another flaw I saw, which is the primary reason I deducted a star, was the ease of which everything worked out for the Americans. Yes, they have better guns and more advanced technology, but they're still fighting in one of the most devastating wars in Europe's history. They should be suffering fatalities too, even if theirs are much less than their opponents, but halfway into the book it became apparent to me that the Americans and their allies had been imbued with a Rambo-like invincibility. This is more than anything a revenge story. A depiction of the bad guys' misdeeds is given, then the superhero Americans come to give them their comeuppance. The antagonists don't exist to provide real conflict and suspense, but merely to be slaughtered in order to give the satisfaction of wrongs punished and illustrate American dominance.Despite these things 1632 managed to keep me interested because of the premise itself, the action, and Flint's talent for bringing history to life. Whether he was describing the famous personages from that time, conveying the horror the war inflicted on townspeople, explaining 17th century weapons and dress, or any of the several other things, it was in his historical recreation that I think Flint's writing shone brightest. I particularly enjoyed his chapters about The Battle of Breitenfeld and for me that was a major highlight of the novel. While one could by no means become an authority on the 30 Year's War by reading this book, it does offer a fascinating and tantalizing glimpse of this bloody, chaotic epoch and what it must have been like to live back then. What's better, it does this through the vehicle of an action-packed story, and for that 1632 deserves to be applauded."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Flint has done someshing amazing here: he's invented a really interesting story and rendered it boring, utterly boring. The man has a great imagination but his writing is just painful and his characters wooden and undifferentiated. Too bad really, because the premise of the book offers all the potential a writer could want."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"This period of history is not one I'm familar with, but I just readMother Courage and Her Children: Adapted By David Harewhich takes place at that time. This sci fi is an exciting and well written tale, but somewhat bloody. It takes a lot of technology to make an M16or a modern tank. The ebb and flow of Europe at this time was very bloodyand things were just about to change forever as science and mathematics combined for the start of new technology, but the guns were poorand the tactics pretty basic. I think an American town would have lasted about a week..."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"If you're like me, you like reading for the escape, and 1632 by Eric Flint, flaws notwithstanding, takes the reader on a strange story of timeshift and alternate history. The town of Grantville, Virginia falls victim to an Assiti Shard, aka the Ring of Fire, and is transported back to 1632, right in the middle of Germania and the 30 Years War. Eric Flint writes good characters, and although some of the logistical issues that would arise are never adequately addressed, he spins an interesting tale. I'd recommend this to anyone curious about reading alternate history and sci-fi in general."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I really enjoyed 1632. I read it in less than two days, because it was very easy to read and was so entertaining it was hard to put down. It was like reading a newer and larger Connetticut Yankee in King Aurthers Court. I then had to order my own copy, since I was reading someone else's book.It starts with a 3 mile radius hemisphere from present day West Virginia (as if picked up with an icecream scoop) replacing a similar section of land in Germany in 1632 during some bad war, aligning the river and most of the terrain. The author only states it was done as an item of art by some quirky advanced extraterrestial beings viewed as a &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; by story characters and goes into a well written story of the &quot;future&quot; common Americans adapting and interfacing with the Europeans of the 1600's. Both plot and character developement is well done and it is an upbeat book.Although it was mild and short and I did not find it the least bit offensive, I was a little surprised at what could be called &quot;gratuitous sex&quot; in the middle of the book describing two secondary characters wedding night (how could that be gratuitous?). This is very unusually for Science Fiction, particularily in a light upbeat story.I really am looking forward to a sequal, as I am sure times will get harder as more and more machines, equipment and modern things fail or are used up. Plus I would like to see more about his interesting characters."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"A small town in West Virginia somehow find themselves displaced, not merely through time, but through location as well and find themselves in the Germany of 1632, right in the middle of the Thirty Years War. The book is well paced and the author, Eric Flint, has done a thorough job of research on the historical aspects of this book. ( A slight case of hero worship for the Swedish king Gustav Adolphus is evident, but not to the point of hurting the book). Where the problem comes,in my opinion, is the way this small community rapidly becomes the domiant power in the area. Granted modern weapons would give a small &quot;army&quot; a tremendous advantage over a 17th century army, but one thing not considered is that modern weapons require, unlike the matchlocks and wheelocks of that period, modern powder, modern bullets,primers and occasional replacement of the cartridge cases. Even a small &quot;country&quot; town with well stocked gunshops could not keep even a tiny army actively campaining supplied long, but yet this does not seem to be a problem here. What is even more unbelivable, the whole process (including rescaling their 20th ,or 21st ,if you prefer, lifstyle) takes only a year or so...no struggle for survial here....a fast paced and basically well written book but one that stretches the bounds of crediability even for this genre..."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"First off, let me say that I enjoyed this novel. As an avid military history buff with a specific interest in the 17th century I was facinated by the concept of a 20th century town being transported into the middle of the 30 Years War. However the political views of the author intrude into what could have been a very enjoyable experiment in alternative history.It's amusing to see another reviewer of this book describe this aspect of the book as \\"subtle\\". In reality it's anything but. In fact Flint's \\"working class hero\\" brand of leftist politics are overt and \\"in your face\\" and get old pretty darn fast. In this novel all the unionized mine workers are depicted as good \\"salt of the earth\\" heros with no flaws to speak of, while the Mine owner and a corperate CEO are depicted as stupid, clueless, or down right evil. A theme of distrust of authority figures prevades the story and it seems that every third page or so the \\"solidarity\\" and noble nature of the Mine Workers Union is stressed yet again. This would all be well and good, but after the fourth or fith time that the noble virtues of the union are explained, the reader starts skimming over paragraphs.That all being said, the premise of the novel is fasinating, the history resonably accurate, and Flint is a fairly talented writer who tells his story well. 1632 is worth checking out, but if your politics are not left of center you are going to have to hold your nose and ignore the political agenda."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"This is getting to be the greatest cliche of alternate history fiction: Small US community from the 20th/21st century displaced in time. After suitably decimating their new neighbours by Superior American Weapons, Tactics and Morale, the astounded primitives joyfully embrace Free Trade and The American Way. And everybody live happily forever after. &quot;1632&quot; follows the formula from first to last page. The more lighthearted pulp fiction parts (the crusty old miner who just so happens to have kept a M60 and untold crates of ammunition from his Vietnam days lying around his backyard, the roleplaying nerds who effortlessly turn into shining knights on motorbikes) is actually fun at times. The &quot;serious&quot; bits where 17th century battlehardened mercenaries, haughty nobility and ignorant peasants alike renounce their entire belief system in days once introduced to ice-cream, cute cheerleaders and talkshows on TV --- that part rings so seriously untrue it completely destroyed my enjoyment of this novel. Flint is actually a good craftsman of the SF action novel. But the castaways in time formula is going so stale, this novel was mouldy before it left the printers."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I am most of the way through this book, and just wish it was over. It might actually BE over, since I might not finish it.I don't know enough about the history of the period or warfare to critique any of that, but just the totally unbelievable situation and the wooden reaction of the people involved is enough to make me laugh. Obviously, a novel about time-travel involves suspending reality -- that's expected and even desirable to a point.But these folks find themselves in medieval Germany and they just don't seem to really care much. Nobody gets in a wad about it. Nobody is in despair because he or she will never see the modern world again. So far, I've only seen one brief reference to anyone who lost his family because of the 'Ring of Fire' --- and I think that involved one sentence. Nobody even seems to wonder WHY it happened in the first place.\\"Oh, gee, here we are in 1632. What do you think about that? Where's my gun? I think I'll go blow somebody's brains out.

I read them together and found them to be an entertaining romp. The story touches on so many things I enjoy. The social, political and technological challenges of transplanting a modern American community into the distant past are compelling and entertaining subjects.The author's rich portfolio of characters includes people of diverse races, religions, ages, social classes and political philosophies. Strong female characters attack the question of feminism with delightful zeal. I'm a combat vet and a Naval aviator, so I greatly enjoyed the depiction of a nascent military finding its feet. Well done.On the whole, I found it to be an enjoyable adventure.Unfortunately, I can't invest time reading any more in the series just to find out if even one hapless gay person managed to make it through the Ring of Fire--or even appear amongst the natives who, like the Jewish people in the story, found refuge in a progressive society. I suppose gay people like myself should just count themselves lucky that, for once, we were not represented by a pedophile or serial killer.

One thing that is really important in this genre is plausibility and another is consistentsy on the tangent that you're developing, Flint does an admirable job of both in this book. one thing I particularly enjoy is that the up timers don't have an endless supply of everything, they realize that they will run out of mundane things like ice cream, toilet paper and light bulbs--details like those get overlooked often enough--things that are \\"the standard of living\\" we used to tout. Also, I enjoy that the up timers are as morally challenged as their down time cohorts--no smug superiority and no moral condescension either--these aren't Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock come to save the primatives from themselves.All-in-all a good yarn and a great start for the series."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"1632 Is a great story, my only negative comment is that there are a few unnecessary sex scenes and language that will definitely take this one out of the hands of children, otherwise this book could also have been used to inspire a younger generation into reading. Not only that but the one descriptive sex scene was not necessary and language also I think could have been refined a little between the main characters. One more thing although it does not take away from this novel, it makes the story more believable when a main character gets killed off... again another novel where the author is afraid to kill off a beloved and invested in character.Aside from that I look forward to reading the next one in series."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Although I've read a good bit of science fiction, I'm new to the time travel series that are so recently popular. A friend enthused about this book, and I read it in an afternoon. As others have said, it's very upbeat and sunny, and moves along well. It reads a bit like old-fashioned movies from the 1930s, in that about half-way through I realized that none of the heroes were going to take any but the most minimal of damage, and nearly everyone who rated a name was guaranteed to pull through in the end.As an introduction to the Thirty Years War and seventeenth century European history, it isn't bad. It definitely made me want to read a factual history and sort out Tilly, Wallenstein, and Gustavus Adolphus.Downsides? The characters are all very lightweight and I had trouble distinguishing between them. While the entire premise is, of course, science fiction (a small West Virginia town being transported whole into 17th century Germany), I was unable to completely accept the premise because there were so many, er, conveniences. The town, with about 3,000 inhabitants, just happens to have an Olympic level sharpshooter. It just happens to have its own powerplant and a ready supply of easily accessible energy (coal and natural gass) to power technologies. It just happens to land in such a way that the creek through town keeps running and the water supply wasn't disrupted. The Americans just happen to run into English-speaking diplomats right off, and are able to instantly understand each other without issues of accent or idiom. The good guys in the Thirty Years War just happen to be completely open-minded about American culture and mor&eacute;s. And so on. As far as the history, we get a whole lot of battles and not so much culture. I was especially interested in the repeated comments about the superiority of German horses over Swedish, but this was never elaborated on. A more thoughtful look at the century would have been welcome.That being said, it's a nice book for the beach or a long airplane ride."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"By some kind of explosion, the town of Grantville, West Virginia, is transferred from today into 17th century&#65533;s Thuringia, during the 30 Years&#65533; war.The inhabitants of the city have to deal with the new surroundings. First thing for them is to \\"elect\\" an emergency staff to rule the town during the first phase of adjustment. They soon have to use their superior arms in open combat against imperial mercenaries. Of course there&#65533;s no doubt as to the outcome of these skirmishes, and in consequence the small community is overrun by german refugees seeking protection.After the first year Grantville has expanded, forming the \\"United States\\" that include almost all cities of southern Thuringia from Eisenach to Gera. Now the young Union has to prove it can take a lead role in European politics, which it does.The main characters are the president of the Union, a sephardic Jewess, a black doctor, a liberal schoolteacher, a german prostitute and Gustav II. Adolph.It might have been interesting to learn how the former persons, thrown together through time and space, grow in experience and personality. Unfortunately, none of the characters is credibly depicted. Any exchange of ideas is down to \\"you ... won&#65533;t stop me\\" - like expressions that are sometimes funny but never really interesting.Even worse is the picture of the latter and all historical persons. Their language is basically swearing. They address each other with first names - in a time, where even husband and wife were using formal addresses in conversation. Their motives are depicted as utter egotisms - except those of Gustav Adolph, whose goal is to rid the german people of tyranny.Anybody only roughly familiar with history and literature of the age will easily find the flaws in this scheme.Worse than the characters is the author&#65533;s command of anything concerning knowledge of the part of Germany he describes.One of ten German words or phrases is correct, some German is just barely understandable.German geography and landscape are lost: for instance does N&uuml;rnberg lie at the Pegnitz, not the Rednitz river. The description of any German town is apparently fictitious. None of the several strong points of Thuringia at that time and place are mentioned besides the Wartburg, whose description lacks any reality.The highlight of the book is the description of the battle of Breitenfeld in September 1631. As with any battle depicted in the novel, one is wrapped into its excitement and for once not bored.On the other hand, the forming of the &#65533;United States&#65533; is vague and does not concede with the political systems of the communities involved. The cities who are supposed to join the Union were mostly residences with garrisons and therefore unlikely to join any republic without an armed struggle within their boundaries.Thus, the novel remains a nice, but not very convincing try at alternate history. If read as &#65533;fictitious&#65533; history, however, it may still be amusing reading."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"This is a pleasant idealistic book about the Thirty Years War. Yes \\"pleasant\\", \\"idealistic\\" and \\"thirty years war\\" don't go together for some reason. And so what?The plot is simple. Grantsville WV is plopped down by a time warp in the middle of Germany in the Thirty Years war. Whereupon they survive by righteous application of redneck orneriness and good American technology, thus proving that there are places in which people who \\"cling to guns and religion\\" have advantages. It is an unsophisticated book as many here have noted. At the same time many who make such criticisms confuse cynicism with sophistication.In a way the book is a laboratory experiment. It personalizes the problems in making a new nation. The author gave Grantsville considerable good fortune by putting Grantsville in a place where there was a power vacuum and the war had shifted it's focus elsewhere. And Grantsville showed intuitive wisdom in realizing that the natives could be made from a threat to an asset. At the same time the town showed the strength of Grantsville's institutions by being quickly able to adapt to governing themselves and having an instinctive knowledge of how to do so. That is not implausible; such ability does, I think still exist in America despite bureaucrats best attempts. Being able to have the skill at realpolitic to survive in such an area would be a different story; being able to do so while keeping their soul would require a new George Washington; but one could imagine one arising in a small town in West Virginia.Many posters have criticized the book for jingoism. While the book is certainly that, some of the criticism seems to be from the extreme antipatriotic view. The fact is, it is as well to be reminded what there is about our country that is good. The contrast with the generations of degradation in much of the world is brought out. In many ways it is a revenge fantasy; when one reads of what the real Thirty Years War was like, honestly one does wish that a town of rednecks with repeaters from West Virginia would plop down amid them and give all those thugs a taste of their own medicine. At the same time one gets an understanding of Europe by looking closer. One can be less self-righteous knowing that under the circumstances it would be impossible for a tyrannical warrior caste not to have grown up. In Europe for thousands of years every little state was in Grantsville's position-without repeating rifles and people would turn to any source for survival. And when we say \\"God bless America\\", part of what we are saying is \\"God, thank you for the Atlantic Ocean.\\"The love story between Jeff and Gretchen was exceedingly heartwarmming. The author in the afterword defends it from charges of overidealism by pointing out people who actually have done things like that. He doesn't need to do that to me; I have had a blessed life that perhaps I am not grateful enough for. But I too know people who could have done what Jeff did. The fact is there are still enough Jeffs even in our weary world, and that is worth thinking about."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"This is the first book I've read in a long time that I would compare favorably to Heinlein. It reminds me a bit of Farnham's Freehold, now that I think about it. A six mile diameter circle including a West Virginia coal mining town is inexplicably traded in time and space with a section of Germany of the early 1600s. The struggle of the small community to adapt and survive in the technologically and morally deficient time in which they find themselves is as interesting as a book gets, at least to my tastes. It absolutely reminds me of the classic Heinlein novels where a sci-fi event is used to kick off a fish out of water character study. More importantly, it is extremely well written in all the ways that matter.Not only are you introduced to a fascinating and likable segment of the time ported town, but to local figures who will win your heart and your respect. They literally come to life off of the page. You'll spend as much time thinking about them while you are not reading the book as you spend reading about them with the pages open. It will also be very satisfying that you won't find any large missteps of logic. Everything that happens is well thought out, both by the author and his actors in the story. You'll find yourself at times fearful, enraged, incensed, disgusted, heart warmed, appreciative, impressed, and even turned on.As a bonus, you'll get a bit of possibly previously unlearned history about the 30 Years War.A good read for anyone, a must read for historical or sci-fi fans."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"1632 is part of the \\"Alternative History\\" genre of Fantasy/Science Fiction.A flash of light kicks off the plot in this novel. In what is initially interpreted by everyone as a nuclear blast, light blinds the residents of Grantsville, West Virginia. When they realize they have not all been reduced to ash, they step outside and determine that something very wrong has happened, their town is no longer on the east coast of North America. Grantsville is now in the year 1632, residing in the Black Forest (what will later become Germany). They are smack dab in the middle of the 30 years war.As readers, we all have the same paradox questions. The characters also recognized these potential issues, and they are addressed very quickly (first or second chapter). They came to the conclusion early on that there are only two real theories to work with.- Time travel Paradox =\\"The world ends\\"- Time Travel Paradox = \\"Multiple time streams make paradox irrelevant\\"As they are all still breathing, they logically conclude that they are in a tangential stream. They have limited supplies, and no guarantee that they will ever return to normal, they could be screwed if they do not act fast. They have an unknown belief/system for the region/era. They do not know the local languages. If they are going to survive, they need to get moving asap.If they are not going to destroy the future and they will only affect their new time stream, there is no reason they should not fight for survival and the American way of life... Early in the book, it is decided with a vote that the best way to survive is to recreate something that has worked in the the past (the future). They will start the American Revolution early, in Europe instead of the Americas.Flint does not spoon feed you with information. There is some theory and some wavy inundation of \\"how are we going to survive\\" conversation, but overall, Flint recognizes that the reader doesn't need everything spelled out for them. The exception is when it comes to history. Most people are not fluent in the methodologies or details of key battles in the 30 years war. Neither are they familiar with the political flow and relationships of those in power. These are laid out fairly well for the layman.Most of the key characters are part of the West Virginian coal miners union, so theory and plans are things are broken down as they would be explained for the common man. Essentially, you do not get too little info, leaving you upset, but neither are you treated like a 5 year old.[...]"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I saw this book, with it's wretched cover art, on bookstore shelves for years before my spouse picked up a copy and I started reading it.I will admit that history was not a primary interest of mine in school, probably because I never had a teacher whom I felt cared enough to create any interest in anything other than memorizing dry facts - torture, at best. I have to admit that two books started wholesale research efforts on my part which ended up costing me a lot to obtain history books on their subjects: Sunne in Splendor by Sharon Kay Penman for histories of the Wars of the Roses and Richard the Third, and this one for histories of the hundred Years War and Gustavus Adolphus, Count Tilly, and Wallenstein.Loved this book. Ignore the cover art (which appears to be aimed an teenage gamers), and just read the darn thing."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"If you enjoy alternate universe or survivalist stories, you're going to love Eric Flint's Ring of Fire series. 1632 centers around a small West Virginia town (based on an actual town that Flint researched to make the story more accurate and plausible) that finds itself transported through time to Germany in year 1632 - right smack down in the middle of the Thirty Years war.Flint's treatment of the time change \\"event\\" is momentary, almost an aside, as it is not central to the theme of the series. Suspend your disbelief for a few moments, and then concentrate on the events that quickly unfold afterward. Just imagine what effect a well armed and modernly educated town full of spirited Americans could have on a time and place where the Spanish Inquisition is feared and the most advanced weapons are basically muskets and canons!A long time fan of science fiction, I read this book based on the recommendation of a friend and have since gobbled up the rest of the series. I even gave it to my father-in-law and had to work hard to stay ahead of him! You don't have to be a fan of SF to enjoy the fabulous writing and creative genius of Eric Flint."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"In the small town of Grantville West Virginia, people are having a pretty good time - Mike Stern's sister is getting married, and the local chapter of the miner's union is out in force for the celebration. But when a mysterious event known as the 'Ring of Fire' transports the town to 1632 Germany - and right into the middle of a major war - the resulting culture clash will change the lives of the people on both sides and re-write history.I had no idea the Thirty Year's War could be so much fun. Flint doesn't show the Americans conquering Germany with their superior firepower - the series is realistic about the impossibility of maintaining modern technology with 17th century infrastructure. Instead, 1632 concentrates on the effects of ordinary people whose world has been turned upside down, and shows the powerful influence of ideas."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"This is a science fiction novel - for about the first five pages. The setup is sci-fi, but the bulk of the book is a thoughtful consideration of how a small community of 21st century Americans would cope with being plunked down in Germany in 1632 during the bloody 30 Years War, and how the surrounding communities and governments cope with them. With a great deal of historical accuracy, and a sunshiny outlook with four brilliant female characters, it is a fun, exciting and thought-provoking read. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"First and foremost, Eric Flint is an upper. The man's writing is very positive with the good guys always good, the bad guys always bad, black and white. He is the literary equivalent of methamphetamine, a real feel good author. This is exactly what I was looking for so I picked up one of his books.1632 is the first in a series about the town of Grantville, West Virginia being picked up and moved through time and space to southern Germany in 1632, in the height of the Thirty Years war. They find two Jewish academics running from mercenary soldiers. After saving them and finding out the Inquisition is going strong and everyone still lives by near medieval morals, they people of the town, headed by their local union rep, decide to bring democracy, justice and apple pie to the backwards heathens. The town/time travel thing is not all that new, and we have seen it before, most notable in the Island In The Sea Of Time by S.M. Sterling. While I don't think this book lives up to Sterling's, its still a good read.As I have said before, I like lists, so here is my good/bad list. The book does have its good points, to be sure.1. The characters are all for the most part interesting, even if they are a bit cookie cutter. They have some since of personality, and you really do like them.2. The battles are well described, with action being clear an not overly confusing, as is sometimes the case in alt. history.3. The history is pretty good, and I buy the way it playes' out with the twist of modern interjection. Alt. history sometimes has a tendency to really take weird turns, and this one doesn't do that so much.4. I like the way they take a major figure the author clearly likes, Gustav Adolphus, the King of Sweden, and gives him a major role and a personality.There are however problems:1. the romance that springs between characters is for the most place really forced, with some of the couples falling for each other almost instantly.2. The flip side of the history being good is he sort of beats you with it. There are chapters where you get how events really took place in history, before you get chapters about how they took place in this reality. Really superfluous.3. There is to much jumping between groups. An occasional chapter here and there from the view of someone else is fine, but stay with your main characters, the town back in time. If every three chapters you move to someone else, it's harder to connect with the characters, and frankly, annoying.The problems aside, this is a good read. Flint remains to be a happy read, and I look forward to the next book in the series. If you like Alt. History or sci-fi of the ilk, I would suggest this."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Alternate history books can be a lot of fun because you can create practically any situation you want and change history to govern your every whim. For instance, let's say that you really liked the craziness of the 30 Year War in central Germany and wanted to play around with that historical period and characters. So, let's imagine that we take a town out of West Virginia in the late twentieth century America, a town that is full of coal miners and other Appalachians, and transpose it in both time and place, and then see what happens. Oh! Wait! That is the premise of this book!!!Unfortunately, Eric Flint's book has a hard time extracting all the good that could come out of this premise. I found several faulty areas in this book. Examples include:* Because the historical time period in question is not particularly well known to American readers, Flint spends many pages filling in the details on the personalities, locations, and military tactics of the time. Unfortunately the way it is done is in an almost dry, high school history text book kind of way and I found those segments torturous to get through.* All of the characters in this book are so sketchily pulled together that they become caricatures. We have the good union organizer against the evil corporate CEO; we have the heroic school teacher; we have the female school teacher who is really a 60's radical who finally finds that her heart really does belong to the people of this West Virginia coal mining town, and so on.* The transplanted Americans have a huge technological edge over the Europeans and they use it to their advantage. OK, that makes sense in the initial settings; but Flint has this advantage continue throughout a whole year and nothing seems to wear out or run out (with the exception of contraceptives). How is it that they always seem to have enough gasoline for all kinds of vehicles? Have enough to build a whole network of highways? And keep the town electricity, television, and radio networks going?* The characters have very little trouble with getting acclimated to the political and brutal tactics of the war that surrounds and attempts to engulf them. I was particularly struck by how quickly these Americans became nothing more than cold blooded murderers and had no second thoughts. Of particular not in this class is an eighteen year old girl who becomes a sharpshooter in the story and has no problems - or regrets - even as she kills hundreds of foes. Sorry, this smacks to me of the writer never having had to face the regrets that Americans have when killing people.* Love is very very fast in the seventeenth century. The main American leader takes one look at the face of a young Jewish woman and immediately falls in love; The Jewish woman does the same (Excuse me? Read the history of that time period and of how the Jews were persecuted and it is highly unlikely that the woman would have done anything except recoil in horror from the American); The Jewish father blesses the love affair and subsequent marriage; Another American saves a beautiful German woman (are there any other kinds in this story?) from his allies and proposes to her that evening! And so on.So, was there anything good in this story?Oh yes, plenty. This is a morality story. The good Americans get transplanted into this vicious and unforgiving world but they maintain their essential goodness and immediately start working to improve the lot of all those around them. From the first scene in Germany where they stop the torturing and raping of the poor farmers they find themselves near; to dealing with integration issues; to trying to change the political culture of the area they are in, they are invariably shown to be thoughtful and aware of the importance of what they are doing. As if it was not obvious enough, Flint has his main character (Mike Stearns) constantly thinking about how his role parallels that of George Washington.There are also lots of comedic moments. I think my favorite was the story told by Gretchen (A young German woman who has just been rescued by the Americans from a mob) of her feelings towards a woman who takes them into the showers. The Germans know that you are not supposed to be clean as that makes you look like a Jew! However, this Duchess (as Gretchen imagines the American woman to be) strips right down to nothing and leads a whole troop of German women through the showers and introduces them to towels and ... robes !!! What a hoot!This is clearly the first book in what is bound to become a series. Since this first book is already over 570 pages in length, it is clear to me that only a series can fully develop the themes that were begun in this volume. I certainly hope, and expect, that Flint will be able to get away from the scattershot and overly broad approach he took here and develop his characters and storyline more fully in the future volumes. If he does so, then I think this will be a fun series. If he maintains the pace and depth of this book, then this series will not go anywhere. Definitely worth looking for the next volume!"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"1632 is more than a great book, it is even more than a great start of a book series. This book, and its author, have created one of the most energetic and fascinating followings that I have ever seen. Eric Flint now has produced seven novels and two anthologies in addition he and an army of other writers are up to fifteen and counting anthologies via the web, and print, of the Grantville Gazette. There is a web site (1632.org) for the discussion of the book and its future.Parents, if you want to get your kids involved in science or history just get them to read the first couple of books in the series. Any of the novels will draw you in so that even some of the most boring subjects, who really can get excited about church politics outside of their own church after all! Many of the stories in the anthologies are simple every day stories from the common man/woman. The series also lends itself to beginning writers, it almost challenges them to come up with their own story. The 1632 web site has a list of all \\"up-timers\\" in the story and which ones have not been claimed by a writer such that you can writer your own story of their life in 1632 Germany.It's not all fiction either, it takes its history very seriously. The Grantville Gazettes have about as many non-fiction stories as fiction. All about how to mine minerals, make radios with 17th century available materials and best methods to grow crops or make clothes. The arguments over how to make machine-guns or mortars may get the most action addicted reader involved. But pretty soon you find yourself reading history books of the period to figure out just what commodity would make the most profit or what it would take to create the medicines that could defeat the plagues that ran rampant in that era.I have all the books in print for those days I want to just curl up and have a good read, but also in e-book format for when I want to focus on one character or story line and follow it through. Even the stories that don't make it to print get published on the web in the \\"Slush Pile\\".I look forward to the first time I can go to a Minicon, they have had them since 2003. They have even generated some tourist industry for West Virginia since the author has modeling the original town after a real town there. They had a bit of a catastrophe when it was discovered that one of the old houses there had a tremendous library that could have drastically affected occurrences in the series, as the library was not discovered until after the series was well under way during an estate sale.No matter what your interests (there is one story line about a teacher set on saving the birds that came with them from WV) this series has something for you. And if it doesn't, well then write one. It will be met with enthusiasm and plenty of input."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Flint starts his story with a bit of deus ex machina to accomplish the implausible premise he wants to work from - an entire modern West Virginia small town is picked up and zapped to Germany in the midst of the Thirty Years War. Technological advantages allow the heroes some quick and easy victories over the villains, but the town is too small to maintain a modern industrial base, and the supply of modern rifles and ammunition is limited. It increasingly becomes clear to the key characters that they can't survive off technological wizardry forever, leading to a bold plan: they'll have to launch the American Revolution ahead of time, find allies, and build their alliance into a new United States of Europe.It's a fun story, but there are some faults. The good guys are probably a little too cuddly to be really credible. Love at first sight between the Americans and the Europeans they land among is employed too frequently. Some major problems, such as the fact that all the younger citizens of Grantville will be in extreme danger from smallpox, are ignored. It's mentioned several times that the town dentist quickly runs out of anasthesia - why not use nitrous oxide, relatively easy to manufacture anyplace there's air? There are some points that don't bear the closest examination, but that doesn't stop the story from being a terrific read.I was amused by the reviewer below who praised the book for its \\"right of center\\" philosophy. Apparently he failed to notice that the two principal heroes are a trade union official and a former 60s radical, while a major villain is a wealthy executive. Flint is himself a former union organizer, and the politics here are definitely on the left, although subtle enough that some readers can clearly miss them entirely."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"This is an odd book. Its point of departure is the sudden transposition of town in modern West Virginia to Germany in 1632, right in the middle of the Thirty Years War. This type of book has become popular lately and is inspired by Murray Leinster's short story Sidewise in Time and the late L. Sprague De Camp's novel Lest Darkness Fall. S.M. Stirling's Island in the Sea of Time series is a notable recent exemplar of this subgenre. Essential features of this subgenre are that the interdimensional transfer generates a new path for human history and that the transferees are modern Americans whose advanced technology and political/moral values produce an actual improvement in the course of history. This book is no exception to these generalizations. The transferees prove themselves to be resourceful and humane. There are the usual adventure, combat, and romantic elements. The Americans establish a relatively modern republic in the middle of 17th century Germany and become allies of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, the greatest general and monarch of the time.Books like this can be judged to a large extent on the ability of the author to avoid really obvious anachronisms. In this respect, I am not sure that Flint does very well. He is certainly knowledgeable about the basics of 17th century history but his treatment of the attitudes of historical figures is suspect. At the heart of this problem is more than a strong hint of what used to be called the Whig Interpretation of History. This idea tends to see European history as a progression towards modern liberal values and Protestantism as a principal engine of that progression. Catholicism comes off badly, a source of intolerance and oppression. I don't disagree about the behavior of the Counter Reformation Church but there is no evidence that the Protestants were any better. The great English apostles of religous toleration, Milton and Locke, were unwilling, for example, to extend religous toleration to Catholics. The treatment of Gustavus Adolphus strikes me as very anachronistic. When Louis the XIVth said the state is me, he meant exactly that and those sentiments were shared by other 17th century monarchs. I can't see a man like Gustavus Adolphus, who treated Sweden as an instrument of his dynastic ambitions, behaving the way he is depicted in this book. This book is also an advertisement for trade unionism. In and of itself, this is not bad and I am sympathetic to Mr. Flint's belief that trade unions are an essential component of a decent society. In this book, however, this is an accretion and not an organic component of the plot. It was introduced, I suspect, to counter the individualistic bias of similar books like H. Beam Piper's Kalvan stories, which have a distinctly individualistic and conservative orientation.As commented by several other reviewers, the quality of writing in this book is amateurish."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"There may not be many novels written by Eric Flint, and even fewer where he's written without a partner but I've yet to find a dud. The novel I like best so far is his alternate history story, &quot;1632&quot;, the title relating to a year, of course. It may not be as complex as a Turtledove novel but it hit it's mark with a great deal of force none the less.Alternate history ideas can be as subtle as one man making a different decision, sometime in the past. &quot;1632&quot; is a little more dramatic. An entire mining town in West Virginia is sucked back in time and dropped in Northern Germany during a time of war, disease and starvation. There are similarities between this book and the Natucket series written by S M Stirling but &quot;1632&quot; is more in the adventure mold.The narrative tends to focus on Mike Stearns, the mine's union leader, who seems to have more of what their new situation needs than most. He reluctantly takes the reigns of a red-neck train that's on a collision course with the Holy Catholic Spanish Army, amongst other. But the town has to take a few steps back in time themselves, before they find a sustainable level of technology. In the mean time, some of their tricks are leaking to the enemy. Their survival hinges on making friends and allies as fast as possible.There is a strong theme of American pride in this book. I'm not American so it might have been irritating. In the end though, it comes across more as pride in modern man's culture, its achievements and the fibre of its people. Flint takes a long look at the moral differences that 450 years have made, just as much as he covers the technology gap. The locals take one look at these Americans, their confidence and their sense of freedom, and assume they are all aristocrats. For only princes could live a life without fear. It is this human element, that makes the novel so good. I was bitterly sorry to see it end and can only hope Eric decides to continue his extrapolation of a time that never was."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I found the basic story interesting enough to read both \\"1632\\" and the sequel, aptly titled \\"1633\\", but that's as far as I'm going to bother with the series.The concept, centered around a small West Virginian coal-mining town that is mysteriously zapped into 17th-century Germany, is quite interesting and open to wild speculation--could a few thousand present-day Americans introduce the concepts of free speech, religious freedom, basic modern medicine, science, and technology into a Europe suffering war after bloody war, plague after deadly plague, and monarch after insufferable, selfish monarch? Would their technology and modern weapons give them enough of an edge to protect, and even project, their way of life? Would their ideas of equality and representative government take hold among a European population tired of oppression yet wary of such radical change?I found such a setting to be incredibly full of potential, but after reading the first two titles, I just can't handle any more of the wooden characters and the stilted dialogue. The characters are two-dimensional at best, and instead of conducting anything resembling a conversation the characters emit diatribe after diatribe, history lesson after history lesson, and long-winded comeuppance after long-winded comeuppance. The characters wouldn't know a feeling or an emotion if they tripped over one.One of the worst examples: A teenaged cheerleader picks up a hunting rifle and calmly dispatches German mercenaries one after another as if she were plinking away at tin cans. No hesitation. No self-reflection. No guilt. No nightmares or nagging feeling of remorse. Sorry! Don't have time for any of that emotional, human-like stuff, but we do have a couple pages of unbelievable aw-shucks-I'm-just-a-hillbilly-tryin'-to-do-right-in-this-crazy-world tripe instead!And so it goes for the rest of the characters.

Stirling's recent &quot;Island in Time&quot; Nantucket trilogy. A little town from West Virginia is transported to mitteleuropa in 1631 (two maps are provided), where these good union folks (i.e., industrial workers and not government bureaucrats) introduce law, order and the American Way into a land very much missing any of these virtues or aspirations. This (too) fast-paced story is an excellent Fourth of July read. Don't let a few nagging questions bother you: where do all the bullets come from, what about the gasoline, or the paper they start to print a newspaper on? Hey, this is a fun examination of the political and military aspects of adaptation to a very strange and very deadly situation of historic unreason. Flint clearly likes the grisly war parts best, for which we get some pithy lectures on military history. He is a competent writer able to evoke comaraderie in the face of desperately cruel circumstances, and admiration for his characters in the reader, pounded out to the beat of Blake's poetry. Flint melds obscure religious doctrines of the period into the clash of confident, tough and diverse Americans and their allies against depraved enemies. This is a good uplifting read that will make you proud of rural American values, introducing desperately needed Love and The Bill of Rights into the marvelously intolerant 17th century world a few centuries before it really did happen!

'How?' you ask? Who cares? Flint gives some far-future science fiction explanation. Most of the town's residents conclude that the 'Ring of Fire' is simply an Act of God.But the question of how Grantville comes to seventeenth century Germany is not important. All that matters is what happens once the heavily armed town finds itself thirteen years into the Thirty Years' War, one of the most destructive religious conflicts in the history of Europe. Surrounded on all sides by hostile countries and marauding armies, mere survival is the town's chief concern. Grantville's modern weapons might be - barely - sufficient to hold off the ragtag bands of looters and mercenaries roaming the countryside. But if one of the major powers striving for supremacy over Central Europe decides to crush the town, Grantville will not be able to resist them on its own.So the residents of Grantville decide to fight fire with fire and kick off the American Revolution a century and a half ahead of schedule. Grantville's only hope of survival lies in finding allies willing to tolerate democracy and religious pluralism, while at the same time recruiting those of their new neighbors who are sick and tired of being slaughtered by their aristocrats or for their religion. The early seventeenth century, with (on the one hand) feudalism and religion discredited by bloody warfare, persecution and oppression and (on the other) modern theories of representative government and rule of law just beginning to rear their heads, offers the slim possibility that Grantville will be able to pull through.All this makes for a fast-paced and highly entertaining story. Flint, before this book best known for military science fiction, spends a lot of time on battle scenes, but still tries to focus on the power of ideas and ordinary people to change the world. Character development is better than normal for the genre, though still not great. Some characters, especially the sinister industrialist Tom Simpson, remain one-dimensional. Flint, who got a Master's Degree in African history before spurning the ivory tower to go into union organizing, often interrupts the narrative with brief history lessons, which I personally found interesting.Although &quot;1632&quot; was originally written as a stand-alone novel, it was so popular that Flint was convinced to expand the story into a full-blown alternate history series, which continues in &quot;1633&quot; (coauthored with David Weber) and the &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; anthology. This means that even though there are more volumes for those who enjoy &quot;1632,&quot; this book still comes to a satisfying conclusion and can be read on its own, without commitment to the larger series. Those who are still uncertain should know that Baen offers the book for free on its Web site, so the curious can check it out. There's really no reason not to."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Eric Flint's book had me turning pages long past my bedtime due its intriguing premise, frequent action, frequent humor, wonderful characterizations, and, again, the situation. The book could have been a disaster, but the writing was extremely fresh, and the homework Flint put in doing research for the book clearly paid off. I will eagerly read the next book in the series.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"A good book. I've read a lot of alternative history novels but not one that involved sending an entire modern community into the past.The premise of the book, that a West Virginia town is send lock, stock and barrel to a Germany in the grips of the 30 Years War is an interesting one and a plot device that would seem to explain how the community seems to have enough shotguns, hunting rifles and pistols to arm every man, woman and child for miles around. Oh well. It does allow the story to progress and it gives the displaced Americans a chance to survive long enough to begin rewriting the history of Europe and even creating a new United States... the United States of Europe.Lots of good history and good writing here. I look forward to reading more of these!"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Occasionally it is nice to stumble upon a feel-good novel like this one. Everything always turns out well due to the cleverness of the clearly superior heroes and heroines, (our side ... the good guys) constantly out-generaling the evil baddies and always overcoming the old prejudices to win the hearts of suitors.I couldn't take a steady diet of them. I think too much of a good thing rots the mind and soul, but if I happen to hit one occasionally, it's nice to know that, for the next 400 pages goodness will constantly prevail and I will not be troubled in my sleep by something I've read.This type of book must be organized into a series of vignettes. In a sense, nothing really happens, but lots of incidents must take place to fill out the pages. There really is no true dramatic tension ... more like a series of challenges and puzzles.On a technical note, there is a disorienting movement between a modern feel and a mideaval feel. For a few pages we are in an american head, then in a mideaval world feel. The author is much more interesting when he's in mideaval mode but, the process of the book seems to be one of turning everone in mideaval Europe into a grade C American novel mode of thought, so I expect that by the end we'll all be just one big enlightened American family. (I'm about half way through now.)"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I'm a big fan of alternative history, so I was naturally drawn to this book (and the series as a whole) by all the attention it's received. 1632 is definitely a fun read, and I'd recommend it to science fiction fans in search of a relatively light read.You're going to have to seriously exercise your suspension of disbelief when reading this book during a number of passages, but that's at least somewhat understandable. After all, it wouldn't be much fun if the protagonists all died off from diseases, couldn't communicate with the locals, or found that they couldn't support a modern level of technology using only the infrastructure of a small West Virginian town.Flint has a couple of bad habits as a writer that really come through in this book: first, it's very clear that a couple of his major characters are his favorites, and these characters are invariably going to make all the right decisions, always succeed at whatever they do, rapidly become accomplished statesmen and military strategists, and are, in fact, moral paragons - to an unbelievable degree - even in the face of extremely difficult and unfamiliar situations. And second, Flint's writing style could use some editorial polish. He uses too much exposition (admittedly, the Thirty Years' War is an extremely complex period and requires a great deal of explanation, but there's got to be a better way of pulling it off than this) and he has the bad tendency to reuse trite phrases, sometimes every few pages. This gets annoying at times. The characters (mostly modern day West Virginian coal miners) also use a level of vocabulary and sentence structure that real people just don't use. People just don't speak in half-page long paragraphs, nor do they use words like \\"pean\\" in ordinary conversations.All that aside, read this book, you'll likely enjoy it if you're at all interested in the \\"Baen Books\\" style of light, military-oriented science fiction adventure novels.I'd also recommend S. M. Stirling's Island in the Sea of Time series, which is probably a little more engaging than 1632."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"1632 was a true joy to read. While not as wildly inventive as some tales, such as LORD KALVAN, it was still quite fun. The author displays a fine knowledge of the chaotic period of the 30YRs War and presents wonderful character studies of some of the historical figures. The novel also celebrates the value and applicability of good old fashioned American values. Flint rightly shows that IDEAS have a much greater and long lasting impact than technology. Thus the most powerful tool the Americans weild in the 17th Century is the American ideal of freedom and justice for all people. A fun and thoughtful book."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Flint's background in unions, blue collar work, small town living, and hard core historical analysis make for a fresh and appealing approach to the idea of modern Americans assisting beleagured medieval folks. The characters are multi-faceted, complex real people as opposed to nouveau Napoleons and emerging Edisons as opposed to many novels in this genre that get too devoted to the military and technology aspects of the tale. There are plenty of surprises, good character development with engaging plot lines, and rich context so the actions matter for more than just entertainment. I think it would be a great starting point for discussions about the possibilities for any group who lived in a small town or small city, such as the folks around here in Montana. Let's hope this develops into a series of the same high caliber as Flint's work with David Drake on the Belisaurius series."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Alternate history novels have been around for quite awhile, but most of them focus on the difference a single individual or a single decision will make. This book instead looks at what would happen if an entire town is transported back to the middle of 17th century Germany, during the middle of the Thirty Years War.The town in question is a quiet West Virginia town of about 3,000 which at one point subsisted on proceeds of its coal mine, now shut down, but which has left the legacy of a great number of the town's adult men being UMWA union members. When plopped down in Germany, the union's leader, Mike Stearn, effectively takes charge and begins the process of not only turning the town into a self-sufficient entity but also melding it into a major player into the politics of day.The good things about this work are its intense descriptions of the battle techniques and weapons of the day and what a difference a little bit of modern firepower can make, its obviously well researched look at the politics and religious battles of the Europe of that age, an interesting look at the position of the Jews within this society, and its easy reading style.On the negative side, characterization, while adequate, is not very deep for anyone. The motif of 'love at first sight' is way overused. How the town makes the transition from 20th century technology to a stripped down mix of 18th and 19th century level is not covered in enough detail to make it convincing, which is a shame as this could have been one of the most interesting aspects of this novel. The ready acceptance by the German peasants of not only the technological marvels but also the concepts embodied by the Bill of Rights strained my suspension of disbelief mightily, even though it made an excellent theme for the novel. And finally the scene where the King of Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus, comes galloping on horseback to the rescue of the town's schoolchildren came across as both melodramatic and unnecessary.Still, like many novels that occupy this sub-genre, it all makes for a good, fun read, with an interesting look at the history and people of that time.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Sometimes you wonder what an author must have been thinking when he came up with the idea for a book. I mean come on, a town of West Virginians transported into the bloody 30-years war? What was he drinking? Having read the book I have decided I really don't care what the author was drinking, except that I'd like to buy him another round. This book was really fun. Some people have laughed at its premise and story line but one of the things I like about this book is that it concentrates on people - How do the ordinary people, both of the WV town and of 1632, respond to extra ordinary circumstances? How do they rise to the occasion? That's what this book is about - people. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I was checking out the forthcoming books section of Uchronia-the alternate history site, and discovered that Flint has projected three sequels: 1633, 1634, and 1783! Since I enjoyed this book more than most AH (Card's Pastwatch: the Redemption of Christopher Columbus is my favorite) I am pleased to see that this allo-history will be further explored. One of my reactions to this novel was to speculate which part of Ohio I would have chosen instead of WV. I think that New Philadelphia would be my choice: it posseses two things that make it superior to Flint's fictional town: a regional campus of Kent State and a community of German-speaking Amish. Imagine their moral dilemma--caught between their religious pacifism and the need to aid their neighbors."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"1632 is the best alternate history book I have read. The situation depicted is pretty realistic for what might happen if time travel were possible. The characters in 1632 are all three dimensional. It was easy for me to identify with most of them. In response to another critic's review that this book advocated vigilantism,I heartily dissagree. The main characters, especially Mike Stearns, did not start the fighting. They only fought in order to defend themselves. Mike avoided fights whenever possible. In conclusion, I recommend this book to anyone who likes alternate history."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"1632 is an alternative history novel and unfortunatley is suffers from the limitations of many of the genre. Its a good story and very entertaining for light or lite reading but Flint fails to take advantage of the opportunities presented to him by the teleportation of 20th century West Virginia to the middle of Germany during the 30 years war. This failure is common in alternative history books -with the exception of Fatherland by Robert Harris.The faults are this. The plot becomes overly simple, new technology always wins, ammunition and other aspects of technology appear to be inexhaustable, and the leaders from the future always seem to be right in the end. All of these happen in this book and issues of religous freedom, religous war, technology, culture and language are swept under the rug with the assumption that everyone living in the 17th century would jump at the chance to become an american living under 20th century rules.John Birmingham in his \\"Axis of Time\\" trilogy does a much better, but inccomplete job of handling these isseus. If you are a fan of alternative history books I would start with his Weapons of Choice.Flint, for all of these gaps, does create an entertaining if flat story that is good to read on the airplane, at the beach or at night before bed. I will be buying the next book in the series, used. Just do not get your hopes up that there will be any insight gained from the alterantive history, just a good tale the same as a Tom Coyle or other light military book"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"In &quot;1632&quot;, a six mile sphere of West Virginia is sent back roughly three and a half centuries to the middle of what will be Germany at some point, during some of the most brutal warfare ever waged in the preindustrial world. The interesting thing about this setup is that the brutality is kept to a bare minimum--with all the fighting and shooting and artillery and so forth this could have been a late medieval &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. Instead, it becomes a pleasant fantasy of accomodation and cultural assimilation, showing that the American ideals are stronger than hate, fear, and ignorance.Personally, I like stories that have morals like that. I also like that the event was barely explained; the author wanted to tell this story, so he did. End of discussion.The characters are reasonably easy to distinguish, although some of the dialogue gets clunky (Gretchen's Katzenjammer Kids accent really got on my nerves). I also liked the times that someone from the early 17th century would do something that wasn't the stereotype of how someone would act in that time, but rather something that seemed more human.All in all, a perfectly pleasant book. Just about the entire cast of protagonists makes it to the end of the book, and there's always a chance that the author would revisit this particular world to see how things go for the time-lost Americans.Also, they get an extra star for calling the event that sent the community back in time the Ring of Fire. Johnny Cash should be proud."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"IF you like time-travel/alternativish history more than you dislike reaaaaaaaaaaly bad writing, then buy this book. But do yourself a favor, buy it used. This book reads as if it was written by a high school senior, so cardboardish and predictable is everything about it. Stirling's &quot;Island in the Sea of Time,&quot; etc, are better reads since Stirling is generally a better writer than Flint.Frankly, after reading about 200 pages, I gave up on it and skipped to the end. Nicely set up for, guess what, 1633. I realize why I gave up on the Belisarius books by Flint and Drake: too much Flint and not enough Drake."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"While Mr. Flint obviously has done a considerable amount of research on 17th-century Europe, which at least makes the book informative, his style of writing is more suited for that used in comic books. The plot is shallow, controversy is minimal, and the protagonist characters are so much more superior than their &quot;evil&quot; enemies, the outcome of their struggle does not produce even a shadow of a doubt. The author attempted to pluck at the patriotic strings of his readers by having a small group of people from a coal-mining community strive to build the new United States inside war-ravaged Europe, and for some it obviously works - patriotism is a powerful driving force, just look at the success of the movie &quot;Independence Day.&quot; However, even this cannot compensate for sugary-plain romance between a number of couples in the story, one-sided battle scenes, and single-minded thought process of the book's characters."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Having read excellent examples of this genre (e.g. S.M Sterling's Ocean in the Sea of Time), I found this book to be very disappointing. The writing and plot construction is poor, especially in an author who has several novels under his belt. My main complaint is simply that everything is way too easy for the 'up-timers.' The main character faces little opposition personally, romantically, politically, or internationally. Every battle is won easily. There is no suspense and little interest.I read this book because one of my favorite authors, David Weber, co-authored the sequel. I am sad to say that even Weber can't save this series.Read S.M Stirling's work instead, you'll find it much more rewarding."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"This book is an easy read and has a reasonably interesting premise. My main problem with the book is that the characters aren't very interesting, especially the women. The heroine of the book, Rebecca or Becky, is especially dull and lifeless. She's supposed to be this brilliant Jewish woman from the 1600s but she has no real personality, other than being a smart, pretty, love interest for her lover/husband, Mike, the main character of the story. We also have the spunky ex-cheerleader, sharp-shooter, Julie, who becomes the love interest of another male character in the book. She is also portrayed fairly one-dimensionally: she's spunky, bouncy, cute, pert, etc. There's also a third female character, Melissa, who's a bit more interesting but she mostly gets forgotten halfway through the book. It's also troubling that she doesn't find true happiness until she gets a man (and some girls to treat as daughters)---reinforces the notion that women can only be fulfilled if they have a husband and family. Overall, this book is okay but I'll not be reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"A unique story premise. The characters are strong and well written. There were times I laughed out loud and found myself unable to put it down.

However within the first 100 pages and continuously throughout the storyline, I began to pick up on subtle hints at the moral outrage on the inquisitions, the bad christians, specifically catholics, and how the Jewish people propped up the highest levels of all governments with their kind and generous assistance. Introduction of the holocaust of WWII, and how they will stop Hitler 300 years in advance diminishes the intent of the story. This is no means an attempt to be prejudicial. It's that in the afterword, the author states his intentions to not be like other sci. fi. authors, yet can liberally sprinkle moral and political statement at will and lose his objectivity. I don't even want to go into the apparent necessity in glorifying the UMWA and labor unions in a leadership role as a model for democracy.Writers should stick to the facts and write around them to build a good story. My anticipation of reading this became very much cooled as I picked up on the message. I fear the next book will again be as bad."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"there are few books I have consigned to the bin, the day I purchased it, this is one of them.Sure is the author tried to create engaging characters, but form the beginning they are blemished by a strange aggressiveness. It is true the 30 years war is not a very charming period in german history, but the author on all these pages he wrote does not once deem it necessary to explain what this conflict is all about, and why the forces of the king of sweden are so deep within germany, and what the mercenary forces of mackay and his scots are doing there and with what justification.From the beginning communication of the americans transported across time and space is limited. Mainly by the fact, that they do not speak german.How fortitious it is then, that they find themselves accosted by the forces of General Mackay and his scottish troops.Furthermore it is clear that all the americans are protestants and they choose to side with the protestant side of the war.This is certainly permissible, were it not connected with moral and political judgement, excluding the possibility of moral justification an the catholic side.Early on the king of sweden, Gustav Adolf is introduced into the tale as a distinctivly positive character.Yet, unexplained remains, what the sovereign of a foreign country has to do in germany, in defyance of the law of the land and contrary to the lawful authority. To wit the imperial chancellor, The Archbishop Elector of Mainz or the direct imperial authority Emperor Ferdinand II .Yet those two are but indirectly named.I myself am not catholic, but the rabid protestant stance of the author makes it difficult to read the book.Also the author projects the foundation of a american republic in thuringia which is a ludicrous concept and very unelegantly put forward.It is a good thing that this book remains a single item. Other alternative histories are far more interesting, particularly those by s. m. stirling."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"Americans are a deeply religious people. And that includes all the atheists. Their common religion is America, the final revelation to mankind of The Almighty/evolutionary biology/the universe (delete whichever inapplicable). Basically, America is so right that, even though it gets things slightly wrong sometimes, everything will turn out well in the end. American-style democracy is the default condition of mankind; take away nasty, less well-intended other rulers and it will blossom automatically and successfully (throw out at once that person at the back who said \\"Iraq\\"!).This is the basic idea that underlies this odd novel of alternative history. Take one small US early 21st century town (Grantville, West Virginia) and transport it, locality, coal mine and all, to Thuringia, Germany in 1632 in the middle of the Thirty Years' War, one of Europe's more vicious bouts of bloodletting (the only European war, until the Second World War, in which civilian casualties outnumbered military ones). Those enterprising Americans promptly decide to start the Revolution 150 years early. And would you believe it? Freed of the yoke of dukes and princes, the locals take to the idea of America like ducks to water and are soon running around in a frenzy of entrepreneurial zeal.The improbabilities breed like rabbits. What are the chances of finding an English speaker (beautiful and beddable naturally) in the middle of 17th century Thuringia at precisely the right time? But they get one, and she not only becomes a community leader and thoroughly Americanised, but also obligingly falls in love with the handsome/strong/tough/thoughtful/perceptive/nearly-always-right leader of Grantville. And then there is a whole host of Scots cavalry who just happen along. Scots mercenaries did serve with the Swedish Army of Gustavus Adolphus, but it's rather convenient that they should be right there right then, and that they should join into the American enterprise, instead of raping and pillaging, like all the other mercenaries. (Did they all wear white hats? The novel doesn't say). Before long, everyone is speaking English and German interchangeably and the Americans are taking over Thuringia and starting to add stars to spangle their banner and using modern weapons and technology to beat the stuffing out of all-comers. (Mind you, the idea of someone in a small town with an M60 machine gun and a ton of ammo seems just slightly absurd, even in a place where the NRA is king).If you can overcome reservations to all these things, you are given what the English would call a rollicking good yarn. The author does admit in his afterword that it was the intention to write a \\"sunny\\" book, so everything is relentlessly cheery and works out wonderfully well in almost fairy tale fashion, what they even call in German \\"ein Happyend\\". However, the whole thing is quite entertaining, the perfect read for a long plane flight or train ride.The technology aspects are well handled - modern technology will not last forever, and there is a limited supply of spare parts (and fuel) to keep it going, not to mention bullets for those modern guns and the means of making them. (We tend to forget the prodigious technology and massive infrastructure behind even the simplest things we buy. It's good to be reminded of it sometimes).Another interesting aspect is the portrayal of the three great figures of the era, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden and his adversaries Tilly and Wallenstein. The description of Gustavus's great victory over Tilly at Breitenfeld (before he meets the Americans) is excellent. One also gets a glimpse of the political complexity of the Thirty Years' War - Cardinal Richelieu, France's devious Minister of State, machinating behind the scenes, using whoever he can, be they Protestant or Catholic, to advance his cause, the supremacy of France. The Thirty Years' War was a \\"war of religion\\" only in the loosest possible sense (for anyone interested, C.V. Wedgwood's classic account, written in the 1930s, remains, to the best of my knowledge, the best one-volume history in English).There is, of course, a giant-sized \\"grandfather\\" paradox in all this (if I go back in time and kill my grandfather, how can I have existed to kill my grandfather in the first place?). Gustavus was killed in a cavalry charge at L&uuml;tzen. Now he won't be (he's been told that he will, so he won't, if you see what I mean). So, would the world that would give rise to Grantville still give rise to Grantville (or even Grant for that matter), so that there would be a Grantville to go back and create the German Grantville? Perhaps it's better just to sit back and enjoy the book for what it is - and I confess I did. I suspect the formula will start to labour and wear out, the way these things tend to do, but I'll certainly buy the next one. But can I last long enough to see what happens with Cond&eacute; at Rocroi?"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"The premise of this book, while far-fetched, is intriguing. A town is mysteriously (magically?) thrust back in time and across the Atlantic Ocean into the Thirty Years' War; so far, so good. This, perhaps a dozen pages into the novel, is where things begin to falter. The story is told the way a 12-year old boy would want it told. All the characters are tough, gun-toting, and willing to kill. Relationships between the genders seem stuck solidly in 1955. Women, even those capable of protecting themselves, prefer the comfort of a strong male figure. Every character is a hero. There are no cowards and no traitors. The only \\"villain\\" even glimpsed in Grantville quickly disappears into the background of the story until the next time author needs to find a convenient point of conflict to unite his heroes. The action is about as realistic as a Rambo film. The American heroes and their allies crush their enemies. After all, as we all know, all people who live in small country towns are crack shots and keep enough weapons and ammunition stockpiled in their homes to fight a series of battles. Right...Perhaps the greatest flaw, for me, was the author's tendency to immediately solve any conflict he creates. Oh, no, someone's hurt. Good thing this new character just happens to be a doctor. We need someone who can shoot. Good thing our new doctor once trained to be a sniper and can help our one-time cheerleader to transfer her Olympic biathlon training to the battlefield. Every situation is magically solved. All the characters, even the ones I might expect of being expendable, turn out to have a unique set of skills or unique knowledge that helps the town.The action itself is, at least, somewhat entertaining. If you can turn your mind off for a moment, it is fun. But you have to slog through lengthy passages of what should be intense and interesting political wrangling. It isn't. As I said before, every problem solves itself.Flint, for me, is most like S.M. Stirling. Both have ridiculously one-dimensional characters. Both have a tendency to magically resolve problems. Stirling, at least, spends enough time describing the how and the why that you can sometimes forgive his lack of flair in other areas. Flint does not do that.Flint would do well to study G.R.R. Martin. Not every character needs to be a hero. Not all characters need to survive. If he had killed a main character or two, it might have gone a long way to make this more realistic."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"While this book was &quot;OK&quot;, it's not even in the league of S.M.

This is pathetic, some how Mr. Flint appears to believe that one small mining town of West Virginia can somehow conquer Europe, but wait! His town has a union! Of course they'll win now!And the West Virginians have the Socialist King Gustavus Adolfus II to help defend them from the evil Catholic menace! AND they have more bullets than a cowboy's six-shooter-that-shoots-seven. No matter how many times they whup the poor, backwards, 17th century Europeans they never run out of ammunition, they even have a high-school cheerleader sniper to help them!

I learned that is does have a history degree and that he was also a labor organizer while a member of the Socialist Workers Party.Suddenly, the terrible characterization and historical inaccuracies made sense. I finished it, but was even less happy at the end.The book is little more than a repetition of the Black Legend with a veneer of 'union good/rich man bad' and 'every smart person rejects religion' tossed into the mix. In reality a wealthy Sephardic Jew would A) already have his daughter's marriage arranged by the time she was 16, B) would marry her to another Jew, and C) would certainly NOT approve of her marrying a semi-literate (to him) non-practicing Protestant within a few weeks of meeting the landless, moneyless gentile vagabond! But, well, he's a good union man....The characterizations of the Catholic Church and the Inquisition are the stuff of Loraine Boettner and would do a Know-Nothing proud. From the idea that German Catholic commoners were afraid to bathe because 'The Inquisition thinks clean people are secretly Jews' to the image of thousands of Jews being tortured in cells, Flint seems to accept every anti-Catholic stereotype as historical fact. I get the impression the author doesn't even know a practicing Catholic!"},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"I am an alternate history/time travel fan, and being fascinated with the Thirty Years War era, eagerly picked this one off the shelf and rushed home to start reading. To my dissappointment 1632 pushes the envelope of horrible. It is as if somebody decided to write a parody of the alternate history genre with bad imitations of S.M. Stirling and a politically-correct Robert Heinlein thrown in. From cardboard characters spouting junior high platitudes to the unflappable march of Manifest Destiny across Germany, this book is a dumbed down stinker. Since I finished the book I considered giving it a two star rating, but then decided such a benchmark is far too generous."},{"Title":"1632 (The Assiti Shards)","review":"What a disappointment! Although the premise behind this book has a lot of potential, author Eric Flint failed to deliver on such a rich premise.Most of this book is devoted to extremely violent battles where the transplanted 20th century Americans (using an incredible arsenal -- complete with an endless supply of ammunition -- that was somehow transported with them) slaughter 17th century Europeans. Somehow, implausibly, the 20th century town transplanted to medieval Europe came complete with a power plant, coal mine, and enough 20th century conveniences and weapons to conquer central Europe. Give me a break, and respect my intelligence.The book goes on and on with really stupid concepts: high school girls become expert snipers overnight, high school boys become military experts the first time they engage in battle. The local chapter of the United Mine Workers is somehow transformed into a crack paramilitary/political organization. Somehow the 20th century small-town folks are able to use automatic weapons to kill hundreds of the Europeans without the slightest bit of regret or suffering any psychological trauma.On top of it all are Flint's long, boring, and interminable discussions of medieval politics. Flint comes across as an self-indulgent author who used this book to display his considerable knowledge of 17th century European politics, rather than write a straight-forward academic history book.Over all this book was a chore to complete. Its plot was so predictable and repetitive that I found very little that was interesting or exciting to read. I've thrown it away rather than pass on to a friend. I just can't believe anyone would enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"Randy Singer does a beautiful job developing his characters; both their strengths and weaknesses. I was spell bound by the turns and twists in this story; left hanging as to what was around the next corner.Singer shows shades of John Grisham and Randy Alcorn. Definitely an author to watch and read."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"Due to the fact that I've heard Randy Singer preach a time or two at my home church, I was more than happy to hear that he had written a book. With possible aspirations of becoming a lawyer in the future, I was very excited to read this book and see what this very neat guy had to offer in literature.I was not disappointed! Randy Singer spins a tale together that is so intriguing, you can't put it down. I've tried reading Grisham before. I thought it was okay. Other mysteries and legal books spark my interest somewhat. However, &quot;Directed Verdict&quot; captivated me (as well as several other people I know from church who have read the book), and I couldn't put it down until the end. There will be twists and turns all along the way that will make you wonder just what is coming next, who did what, and exactly how everything falls into place. If you are looking for a good story falling into the legal fiction category, I highly recommend &quot;Directed Verdict.&quot;"},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"When I finished my first book by Randy Singer, I knew I was hooked, and Directed Verdict confirmed that response. This was another legal page-turner with lots of twists and turns, keeping me unable to decide who were the \\"good guys\\" and who were the \\"bad guys\\" up to the very end.Attorney Brad Carson files a lawsuit against Saudi Arabia and the head of that nation's \\"religious police\\" and finds his team watched closely by individuals, organizations, and nations on opposite sides of the world. Sarah Reed experienced horrendous persecution, including the brutal murder of her husband, at the hands of the Muttawa while the couple served as underground missionaries in Saudi Arabia. She reluctantly enters the legal process as a means of clearing the trumped-up drug allegations against her husband and recovering the life insurance she needs to raise her two children.As Brad, Nikki Moreno (a paralegal with quesitonable ethics), Leslie Connors (an ambitious law student), and others on the team move forward with the case, it appears they might be in over their heads. Careers and even lives appear to be on the line as deception and danger pop up at every turn, leaving Brad unsure of who he can trust and what pieces he can salvage from his crumbling case and personal feelings.Lessons of love, faith, and trust are woven throughout this intriguing story. Randy Singer's personal faith and first-hand knowledge of the legal system bring a valuable authenticity to his writing. I'm anxious to see what he has to offer next."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"I don't usually read legal suspense novels - they never were my thing. But I gave this book a chance per the suggestion of a trusted booklover. And I was not disappointed. The pace of the book was fast, and the content, for the most part, compelling. But I still have a few gripes with the book. First, I am bothered by the simplistic portrayal of good and evil: in other words, the evil and oppressive Saudi Arabia Regime versus the upright and moral Christian church community. This depiction, while working in the context of this novel, is too cut and dry and borders on offensive generalization. Second, the love scenes between the two protagonists are truly gag-worthy, sappy and rather childish. I skipped those scenes entirely. Written by a Christian author, the scenes are understandably innocent-enough, but it's obvious the author is holding back in a way, so as to keep the material \\"clean.\\" And I don't blame him, but maybe he can take out those scenes entirely. The legal scenes, after all, make the book. But overall, this novel was enjoyable and has encouraged me to read his second book."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"If you asked me a few months ago who my favorite novelists were, my answer would be Allistair MacLean and Frank Peretti. After reading this novel, Randy Singer has joined the list. And this is the only novel I've read of his . . . for the time being.My wife and I are area representatives of Voice Of The Martyrs. Thus, when the book opens with religious persecution in Saudi Arabia, it had my attention. But this book is primarily a court-room drama, and it succeeds here.Singer has the credentials of being a member of the North American Mission Board (Southern Baptist), and being a former attorney with the American Center Of Law And Justice, founded by Jay Sekulow. (Sekulow wrote a promotional review for this book, and he makes a cameo early in the book, probably an inside joke.)Some of the plot is predictable. There were two characters that, when introduced, I knew would be major players in the book. I will forgive that. He makes up for it with a plot with twists and turns.The best part of the book for me, though, were the characters. They came across as believable, flesh and blood people, easy to either love or loathe. One thing that I like, as well, is that some of the antagonists are not true villains; they have a human side which shows through.Even though I've read a Grisham novel (and two movies based on his novels), and saw several Perry Mason episodes, this book has given me an idea of aspects of law I did not know before. The title itself is an example. For those who are as unfamiliar with law as I am may not know that a directed verdict is one made by the judge as opposed to the jury.This was Singer's first novel, as well as the first I've read. I will guarantee you, though, that this is not the last one I'll read."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"Sarah Reed, a longtime missionary in Saudi Arabia, is forced into an early return to the United States. Her husband's tortuous death at the hands of the muttawa, the Saudi Arabian religious police, provokes her untimely return. Allegations of cocaine abuse by her husband lead to a rejection of the life insurance claim, which in turn directs Sarah into the law office of Brad Carson and Associates. Rather than suing the life insurance company, Carson persuades Reed to take legal action against members of the muttawa and the nation of Saudi Arabia. Drawing from the testimony of Reed and other members of her underground church, Carson and his assistants attempt to bring attention to the corrupt ways of both the muttawa and the Saudi Arabian government. But the case is not so clear-cut. As the story develops, the already intricate plot thickens, leaving the reader wondering just how much more twisted and tumultuous things can get.Randy Singer has his finger squarely on the pulse of the federal justice system, as he leads the reader through the lives of several key characters at once. As a lawyer with a dozen years of experience, Singer shows remarkable accuracy in his descriptions of court proceedings. His portrayal of the persecuted church (in Saudi Arabia) will help North American readers to further appreciate their religious freedom. Action, suspense, drama, comedy, and even romance, place this book near the top of a legal thriller lover's lis"},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"I don't read a lot of novels (due to lack of time), and was a little skeptical about this one by a first-time author. Still, I ordered it here a few days ago after reading the other reviews, and now am sleep-deprived from my inability to put it down! The engaging story line, the numerous twists and turns, the characters, the (mostly) dead-on accuracy of the local flavor and legal context, and the very effective start-to-finish suspense, make this an outstanding read, not just as a \\"first effort\\" but by any standard. The powerful spiritual message isn't overdone, and shouldn't put off readers of any stripe, but still plays an important role in the book's story and purpose. I put this novel at the top of my Christmas-gift-giving list (and got great feedback from recipients), ordered extra copies, and recommended it to family and friends already. I join the other reviewers in eagerly anticipating Randy Singer's next novel, Irreparable Harm, this summer (and others after that)!"},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"Here's a book with perfect timing. It touches on many of the issues that are going on behind the scenes that the media is afraid to touch--but that are crucially important on the world scene.Randy Singer presents issues of religious persecution, judges run amok, modern day courtship, and so many other things so plausibly. A great &quot;Christian&quot; book because not all the characters are Christian, nor do they necessarily become Christian. It's a real book, showing how Christianity impacts people in all different ways, and showing how our understanding of the importance of faith has such world wide consequences.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"I really enjoyed this book - I am an avid reader w/ favorite authors such as Grisham, King, and Patterson. This book had a great little twist, was serious, funny, and entertaining all at the same time. I couldn't put it down. As a law student and a Christian - I would recommend this book to all who enjoy the fictional legal genre!"},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"This novel was more than I could have hoped for in a suspense/legal thriller. The characters and plot are so vivid that I felt that I knew each person and the role they played personally. The plot is realistic yet very intriguing.

Wanted more spiritual emphasis woven into the story."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"First of all, I don't agree with a few reviews that stated one needs to be Christian to like this book. That is absurd. I am not Jewish or Muslim but have read books steeped in those faiths. I also learned a great deal from those books. This book does cover the clash between Muslims and Christian missionaries. Singer's attempts at weaving intrigue become a bit heavy-handed with twists at times but the book in entertaining overall. It was not very believeable and while readers may want the little guy to come out on top, a single unseasoned lawyer going up against the money and experience of a tried and true law firm successfully was over the top. If that were not enough, the reader is expected to believe that said lawyer could take on an entire foreign nation. Such a case would never make it into a court room because the ramifications foreign affairs would be too great. I actually do recommend the book but the reader should approach it with knowledge that it is not realistic fiction."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"I just finished reading this book and could not wait to tell my friends about it. I am a big fan of mysteries and legal thrillers. This book could fit into either category. It's a real page turner with lots of suspense and twists and turns.Several people have given this book a one star rating because of the Christian content. I found that content pertinent to the story, I mean it is about a murdered missionary. Don't discount this book simply because of the \\"preaching\\" as some people called it. It is truly a great read."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"I got this free from Amazon for my Kindle. Although I felt a bit overwhelmed at the beginning with the introduction of all the characters, I quickly found this a terrific story. It was one of those books I didn't want to put down even in order to go to bed. Sometimes I did put it down-firmly...on the table...in disgust-when I got mad at the subversive tactics an unknown person played. Thank you, Randy, for a most enjoyable legal thriller."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"It was difficult to get into at first, but worth the perseverance because I got pulled into the story - action and all.

There were so many twists and turns, I was second guessing myself the entire time. The book was suspenseful, had vivid characters, and was well written. I didn't want to put it down. I will definitely be reading more of his novels. Thanks Mr. Singer."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"I started reading Randy Singer about 2 years ago when one of his titles caught my attention, I picked it up at the book store and liked the premise. He has been compared to John Grisham....and I agree which is a compliment. Early Grisham.This book has some great twists and turns all the way through. And even when I thought I figured it out....there were still some fresh twists proving me wrong. So much fun start to finish....hard to put down. I always kept saying, \\"just one more chapter\\".The characters are strong, relateable, and fleshed out well. A great read!"},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"Quite honestly, I have always been a big fan of non-fiction, specifically history. I read the reviews on Directed Verdict and decided to give it a shot; I was NOT disappointed! This story was filled with twists & turns and I found myself being excited about getting home from work every day so I could continue reading (I should have just taken a vacation day and skip the agony of the wait!).I would strongly recommend this book to anybody...even us non-fiction addicts."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"Our family is hooked on Randy Singer! Directed Verdict was one of the first books that we'd read by him, and we became instant fans."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"&quot;Directed Verdict&quot; is an incredible page-turner. Singer's writing is vivid and compelling. I was moved to tears at some points; to laughter at others. His suspense-filled story line is enjoyably full of twists that keep you guessing to the end. I won't rehash the details here since Publishers Weekly did that above.&quot;Directed Verdict&quot; is so good, it's hard to believe it's Singer's first novel! I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"I found this to be well-written, with only a few grammatical errors. The plot is clever and suspenseful and kept me guessing until near the end.My only complaint is that the religious slant was heavy-handed at times. I have no issue with the case being based on a missionary and the insight into her views, but the conversion of members of the legal team, prayer meetings, and protests didn't add anything to the plot. I felt it took away from the plot because it seemed that the author took a great story and inserted bits of Christianity as testament to his faith and a thinly veiled attempt to convert the reader. It interrupted the otherwise smooth flow of the story."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"This was my first Randy Singer book and I couldn't put it down. I don't usually like courtroom dramas, but this one was really well written. The characters were fabulous and the suspense keeps you glued. I highly recommend. I am on my second Randy Singer book and he will probably be one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"I've been a big fan of Robert Whitlow and Randy Alcorn for several years. I've read all their novels and was looking for a new author. I've also read many John Grisham books, some that I liked and some were just ok. My wife ran across Randy Singer and bought me \\"Directed Verdict\\". I just finished it and am now a huge Randy Singer fan. This book was among the most entertaining novels I've read. To find such a book filled with twists and turns and loaded with suspense has given me a few hours of absolute enjoyment. I could not put it down. I took it to work and read at lunchtime, read at bedtime, read when I woke up! Excellent work!!"},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"I have been reading John Grisham for some time and Randy Singer's Directed Verdict is right there with the same level of suspense for a legal thriller. The book keeps you guessing until the end. It adds a spiritual theme but allows the characters to be portrayed as real, which keeps you interested. I like the way Singer develops detail and pulls things together. This book was every much as good as Grisham, without some of the sex, lust and langauage our society has come to expect from books and movies like these. I highly recommend this book if you like good Christian writing and legal thrillers."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"Immediately I found myself rooting for Sarah Reed. I enjoy the way that Brad Carson stands up to &quot;Ichabod&quot; while in the courtroom, but keeps the case on the line as well.

This book is a real page turner, with a good twist or two, and a very good pace to go with it! Amen, Mr. Singer! Keep it up!"},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"This is a fantastic book. I certainly hope we see more books written by Randy Singer. Absolutely recommend it for 5 stars and more!"},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"I really enjoyed this book and had a hard time putting it down, I was so anxious to see what was going to happen. I agree it is like a Grisham novel, which I also enjoy. I certainly intend on reading his other books. Always great to find a good author!"},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"John Grisham has long been the king of legal thriller mountain. With his first book, \\"Directed Verdict\\", Randy Singer has climbed the heights with a quality suspense thriller not far behind some of Grisham's best. Like Grisham, Singer is a Christian, but the Christian content is far more explicit than one typically finds in a Grisham novel. Two American missionaries, Charles and Sarah Reed, suffer horrendous persecution at the hands of the religious police (the Muttawa) in Saudi Arabia. When Sarah returns to the US after the torture and death of her husband, she comes into contact with Brad Carson, a young lawyer who helps her file a civil rights suit against the Muttawa head (Ahmed Aberijan) and against the nation of Saudi Arabia. Helping Brad to fight for Sarah's cause are his long-term legal secretary Bella, his newly acquired helper Nikki, and a recently widowed law student, Leslie. But do they realize that they are seeking justice against powers that will stop at absolutely nothing to win this case?The novel is divided into four sections. Part I, \\"Persecution\\", very cleverly juxtaposes the persecution of the Reeds in Saudi Arabia with the persecution of Christians in America who speak out against abortion. Part II \\"The Law\\" and Part III \\"Discovery\\" set the stage for Part IV, \\"The Trial\\", which makes up half the novel, and recounts the court case itself. There are lots of surprising twists and turns, leading up to a fast moving and satisfying conclusion (though arguably optimistic). Will the head of the opposing legal team, Mack Strobel, be successful in seeking a directed verdict in favour of the defendants (an extraordinary verdict in which the judge makes a ruling on the grounds that no reasonable jury could decide otherwise)? Which of Carson's own legal team is giving inside information to the other side? And will justice prevail?Although the novel concerns the treatment of Christians, the Christian content itself is not overdone and does not dominate the novel or detract from the storyline as the case with some writers who become artificially \\"preachy\\". There is much reminiscent of the style of Grisham's most overtly \\"Christian\\" work, \\"The Testament\\", which also features a Christian protagonist. Singer's Arminian theology is evident in one place (p290-291) as part of a conversion story that seems somewhat artificial and forced, although it features some excellent application of courtroom imagery to salvation: \\"Sarah believed that her real accuser was Satan, that God was her Judge, and that Jesus Christ Himself was her Advocate. In the only courtroom that mattered, her Advocate had taken her place as the defendant and endured her punishment. As a result, the Judge of the universe had declared her not guilty.\\" (p290). But on the whole the Christian content is in the background, and the focus is on the story itself. The suspenseful plot is combined with realistic characterization, because even the \\"good guys\\" have weaknesses, and the lawyers defending the cause of evil do have some moral standards. My final verdict: \\"Directed Verdict\\" is a good courtroom drama that's hard to put down, so I'll definitely be wanting to read more from this author! - GODLY GADFLY"},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"I cannot say enough about this book.....if there were 10 stars I would give it a 10...I was spellbound all the way through the book.

A lawyer and his staff are dedicated to seeing that justice is done for their plaintiff, yet it would appear that a mole in the group is supplying damaging information to the defense lawyers.

The book was great, I had a hard time putting it down. I got bored with John Grisham books but not this one. I plan on reading more of Randy Singer's work.By Michael ErismanThis review is from: Directed Verdict (Paperback)Randy Singer has a style that is similar to John Grisham, with legal issues developed into in a novel. However, this book has more twists and turns, multiple plot lines, and tackles deeper issues than greed. The basic premise is about a woman who wants to sue the government of Saudi Arabia for the torture and death of her husband by their police. A lawyer and his new aid attempt to take on more than just a powerful government. This brings up international law issues, as well as issues of faith.I found it hard to put the book down, and was racing to the end. The characters are well defined, although the antagonists are perhaps a bit one-dimensional. The best aspect of the book is the compelling storyline, and the plot twists that are unexpected and keep the reader guessing.I recommend this book to anyone who likes legal thrillers and good novels that are fun escapes. Despite the fact that Randy Singer is not well known yet, with books as good as this one that deserves to change."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"This books captures your attention right away.

But it did not work for me at all. The Christian part was fine, the legal part not so good.First things first: if you are not a Christian (and preferably an evangelical), chances are good you will not like this book. It is not so much the lawyer or his staff who are Christians, it is the two clients whose cases are described in detail. The first is a minister charged with praying outside an abortion clinic (presumably under the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act). That case was included to show how much a particular judge was biased against the protagonist attorney Brad Carson specifically and also against Christians in general. The second client Sarah Reed is the one central to the plot. She was a missionary to Saudi Arabia who, with her late husband, was tortured by the religious police and then arrested on phony drug charges and deported to the U.S. She initially hires Brad because the insurance company denies payment on her husband's life insurance policy. From there, Brad convinces her to sue Saudi Arabia (and the individual torturers) for her torture and for causing her husband's death.The one thing that really did work for me in this book is the description of the persecution experienced by Christians in the Middle East, especially converts from Islam.I was much less impressed with the legal parts of the book. If you are a practicing lawyer, there is also a good chance you will not like this book. There were things that did not fit. One small example: the opposing firm disqualifies a judge they don't want to hear the case by offering his clerk a job. We are supposed to believe the clerk is so desperate for a job he jumps at an offer he gets over the phone without even an interview. In reality, a job offer to a clerk alone probably wouldn't disqualify a judge because they have 2 clerks, judges typically set out ground rules for their clerks about job hunting while clerking, and federal judicial clerks have their choice of good jobs and wouldn't need to talk to a firm handling a case that has already been in front of that judge. Also, if a law student has good enough grades to get a federal clerkship, he or she most likely will have no trouble getting a job for after the clerkship and may already have accepted an offer before starting the clerkship. There are more specific examples, but I don't want to give away too much of the plot.The description of \\"co-counsel\\" law student Leslie Connors and her work on the case stretched my credibility beyond my ability to suspend disbelief and the responsibility the attorney gave her and the paralegal seemed irresponsible if not malpractice. And I didn't believe the legal resolution of the case.If a reader doesn't have a legal background or has a greater ability to suspend disbelief, the book has lots of suspense and thrills."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"Do we really need another John Grisham? Lovers of great fiction, especially legal thrillers, will say a resounding YES!

The characters and dialog are so real I can hear them. And, the story line, although growing out of the very real religious persecution in Saudia Arabia, is uplifting and heartening.

Hey, Mr. Singer, when's book 2 coming out?"},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"It is unfortunate that Randy Singer is not more well known. He is an excellent writer.'Directed Verdict' is really a superb novel that is very difficult to put down. It begins with severe religious persecution in Saudi Arabia by the Muttawa - the Saudi religious police. They have targeted an American missionary couple with unspeakable brutality.Sarah Reed, who is the surviving wife of the couple, pushes for legal recourse in the States to expose their tactics and hopefully prevent more terror directed against Christians.She hires legal ace Brad Carson and his team who are rather unconventional, but very tenacious. The story contains numerous plot twists. Every time I thought I had the story figured out, it took another turn.This book is on a par with Grisham's best - his first few novels. Actually, this is even better than that as Singer addresses much more important issues - those with eternal significance.I highly recommend this book.

And when I did I could not get the story out of my head, I just had to know what was going to happen next. This was my first book by Randy Singer and I can say with conviction it will not be my last.

Sarah's husband, already weakened by heart trouble, died due to interrogation by the Saudia Arabian secret police, and now she calls those responsible to account in the American courts. (This idea is timely, in light of recent suits by Americans affected by Sept. 11.)The premise seems straightforward, but Singer introduces numerous complications, keeping our interest and keeping things racing along. Mixing the fast-paced, intricate plotting of original Grisham, the intriguing characters of Turow, and the humorous sprinkles of Meltzer, Singer creates a wonderful story. The courtroom maneuvers are masterful. The in-fighting and conniving are genuinely shrewd and nasty. The plot twists are believable. And, ultimately, the spiritual applications to our modern day world are noteworthy.I hope Singer has more books coming, because I had a blast reading this one."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"This is a christial legal Thriller that I really enjoyed. Why? The chracters are well rounded, and developed, and our sympathetic. The story line is relevant to our times: the persecution Of Christians. Some may say this is anti-Islamic, but I believe the author addressed an issue that is all to similar. Mr Singer is a new name on the block, and one who I look forward to reading more often in the future."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"Due to the fact that I've heard Randy Singer preach a time or two at my home church, I was more than happy to hear that he had written a book. With possible aspirations of becoming a lawyer in the future, I was very excited to read this book and see what this very neat guy had to offer in literature.I was not disappointed! Randy Singer spins a tale together that is so intriguing, you can't put it down. I've tried reading Grisham before. I thought it was okay. Other mysteries and legal books spark my interest somewhat. However, &quot;Directed Verdict&quot; captivated me (as well as several other people I know from church who have read the book), and I couldn't put it down until the end. There will be twists and turns all along the way that will make you wonder just what is coming next, who did what, and exactly how everything falls into place. If you are looking for a good story falling into the legal fiction category, I highly recommend &quot;Directed Verdict.&quot;"},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"All I can say is, \\"WOW!\\" Directed Verdict invites you into the life of the characters and leaves you intrigued with the work that God is doing in and through each of them. It combines the components of a best-selling legal thriller and a Christian novel about God's amazing grace and power across this earth! The only downside to the book is that I could not go to sleep, but only because I could not put the book down! You will grow to love the characters, hoping and praying for them as they go through the amazing trials during the book. The book is a must read! Go ahead and grab a cup of coffee, a comfortable seat and clear time in your schedule to read this book because you may have to do it all in one sitting!

Each word draws you in and envelopes you in the characters' lives. The last page will leave you wanting more. Lastly, I say, \\"Watch out John Grisham, Randy Singer is here to stay!!!\\"I want the next book from Randy singer ASAP!!!"},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"I began this book with a bit of skepticism because I just didn't see how a Christian legal novel could compare with the likes of John Grisham. Not only am I surprised at the quality of this novel, but I am surprised I have never heard of Randy Singer before now. Directed Verdict is right up there with anything Grisham has ever written, maybe even better.Great writers write what they know, and Randy Singer knows the law. This story takes you into the depths of international law, and Singer is thorough without ever being dry or boring. Your heart will go out to missionary Sarah Reed as her and her family face severe persecution for their unwavering faith. Lawyer Brad Carson takes Sarah's case and files an unprecedented civil rights suit against the nation of Saudi Arabia and her persecutors.Singer's novel is full of unexpected twists and turns and riveting courtroom scenes. There are themes of forgiveness and faith all throughout and even a love story. I was hooked from page one and I couldn't put it down. If you love legal thrillers you'll love Randy Singer."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"Incredible legal thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat! This was the first Randy Singer book that I've had the pleasure of reading and it certainly won't be the last. The characters were well developed and interesting and the story was thought provoking and clever with twists that made the book hard to put down. Singer does an excellent job of crafting a story that stirs the emotions of the reader. The diverse characters were memorable and easy to relate to."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"An exciting book...great courtroom strategy..out of courtroom skulldugery...a great read...and without foul language and sex. So real it could have been based on fact."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"This was a wonderful first-time foray from Randy Singer. I can hardly wait for his next project ...IRREPARABLE HARM that releases next summer. Yahoo!Singer is an excellent writer - keeps you on the edge of your seat with great story telling and action. He keeps chiropatrics in business with the onslaught of whiplash throughout his book. Thanks for a great read Randy!"},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"This could have been an amazing, fascinating, and believable book. It really could have been. As it is it was a page turner. Unfortunately the preaching ruined it for me. Every time the author started with this out of place and unbelievable rhetoric I couldn't help but cringe. The worst part is the morals and values the author seemed to want to put across to the reader would have done so, and likely much more successfully, without it. He managed to encompass all the vital components that a great crime/courtroom drama needs as well as a nice side of romance without the sleaze. If only he could have left out the preachy rubbish. Unfortunately for me that just tossed the baby out with the bath water."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"I'm sorry to be the first not to give 5 stars to this great work. I agree the plot was interesting, actually very interesting. I finished the book in a couple of days. My only small disappointment comes from some details in the finals scenes (car chasing typical of a b class action movie) and the Christian issue that becomes just an excuse to start the book but weakly attached to the plot at the end. Overall a very nice relaxed time."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"Really good legal thriller with a dash of mystery thrown in. Great characterization with both the ones you can love and then ones you want to reach into the. book (kindle) and scratch out their eyes. Christian aspect not too overdone . Witty! Will be looking for more from Singer."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"An interesting story line ... a bit too preachy for my normal tastes. I am not likely to seek out this author."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The current focus on the Middle East gave it a special significance, and the Christian characters were truly inspirational. It was fun trying to figure out who the traitor was."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"This is the first book I have read by Randy Singer, and I must say it was a great one! It had me guessing right up to the end. I am often a picky reader looking for complex plot lines and substance to a book to keep me engaged. This book did not disappoint on any of these fronts.In this day and age when persecution of Christians is hardly even thought of in the US, this book makes one sit up and notice...persecution is very real in the world and many countries make a person choose between death and or their faith in Jesus Christ as their Savior. This book focuses on the legal battle for justice for one woman and her family who encountered such persecution. What unfolds is certainly incredible. A great read and highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"this book is a very exciting book and i am not much of an excitement junkie. actually, i prefer reading books that just unfold without too much emotional burden on the reader. and i have to be honest, it took me quite some time to finish reading this book. not because it was a bore but because it was exciting. a few times, the plot becomes too exciting for me and i become scared the main characters would find themselves in a difficult situation that i'd stop reading and read another book.but in spite of my being crazy attitude with regard to reading this book, i must say i enjoyed it all throughout. and while i was reading this book, i'd partly blame it to my sleep problems. i can't sleep and i'd just keep on reading.i am not going to give plots anymore. lots of reviewers already did that. i suppose the five stars i gave would be enough (and probably this review itself) to say that i was impressed with how randy singer did a wonderful job.and must i say randy singer did a wonderful job in keeping the identity of his ace character until the end. that one was another reason i just needed to read this book until the very end.thanks randy and good job. to all you readers out there, enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"This is the first book I have read by Randy Singer. I could not put it down. The characters were well defined and it kept me in suspense until the end. I didn't want to put it down, but I didn't want the book to end, either. I love to read books that are Christian based and I don't have to worry about language and adult situations. Randy Singer proves that a person can enjoy a good, suspenseful, enjoyable book and not need everything else that the world seems to think is necessary for a good book.Can't wait to read more of Randy Singer."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"I must post a dissenting view to all the glowing 5-star reviews of Directed Verdict.If you do not like overtly Christian fiction, you will find this book exhibits the worst type of that writing. The characters are flat, cardboard cutouts of types and their characters never fully eaxmined. Description of places, and venues is either basic or lacking altogether.The plot is such that you do not have to resist temptation to peek at the last pages, nor in fact will it keep you up beyond your bedtime (in fact, you will more likely have your kindle slip out of your hand when you fall asleep.)Whatever action there is is interrupted by page long sermons, which if you are a believer, you do not need and if you are not will only cause irritation.I have read some good Christian fiction by writers who know how to weave a story, with real people, supported by their faith fighting their way through some tight spots.The reader actually cares. Directed Verdict is not one of those books and Randy Singer is not one of those writers who should quit his Sunday job. I hope his sermons are livelier than his books.This book would not be worth your time even if it were free; for any fee, save your money for something good."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"While this was a good story and had very entertaining scenes with the legal drama elements of the novel, I had trouble believing certain elements. First, the Saudis were portrayed as such deeply immoral people, even as they adhere to the strictures of their beliefs their religious police say they are upholding. Second, the protagonists were so goody-goody that I found them hard to believe. It was almost a morality play.Yet, good legal drama and awareness of the maneuverings in the courtroom and in the dealings between the lawyers. This is worthy but not the best out there."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"Don't I wish that judges were as un-clever as the clowns depicted in this story.Sorry to report that truly biased judges, which includes many but not most, are much better at hiding their biases otherwise they would be subject to disqualification and perhaps removal.I did like the idea of a civil trial to recover damages from a theocratic government like Saudi Arabia's - but it all could have been set out and developed so much better.To the reviewers who compare this author to Grisham - not hardly."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"I found this book to be, on the whole, very enjoyable and readable. The plot was exciting and carried me along, and was relatively believable (until the very end, more later). The characterization was very good; they felt like real people. It was, overall, well done.Now, as to why it's only 4-star. There were a few sections in the book where the writing felt rough, and it was enough to jar me out of the story. The adventure plot was relatively believable until a dramatic scene at the end that was just too over-the-top and melodramatic for my tastes. Finally, in a dramatic surprise plot twist, a mystery person is revealed near the end, and I can't buy it. The explanation given for the character's actions does not seem to come out of who the character was drawn to be.Also, there's a point at which a Christian very deliberately is a false witness and slanders another Christian's character in a very public way, with the intention of recanting later when it's safer for the witness to be truthful. I can believe someone would do that, and I don't necessarily have a problem with it being included. However, I see that behavior as contradicting very clearly a host of Scripture, so am bothered by the fact that it's just left untouched, giving the impression that it was a wise and appropriate way to act.Overall, the book was well-written, though it did sacrifice a bit to be melodramatic near the end. Still, I will definitely be checking out other books by this writer."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"This novel is described as a Christian Legal Thriller. As far as 'Christian' goes, it definitely fits the bill, but as for 'Legal Thriller' it really misses the mark. The premise for the story could've been great in a different setting and if the plot was more believable. The characters are stereotypical, inconsistent and their actions constantly contradict their personalities in order to create twists and turns that otherwise would be non existent. The author tries to create tension by inventing situations without any type of justification and by resolving them with the same lack of verisimility. The story climaxes in a conflict that is resolved in such an unbelievable, out of character, \\"rabbit pulled out of the hat\\" kind of way that it makes you wonder why you wasted the time reading a few hundred pages rather than jumping right to the end.If you like Christian fiction, then you are in for a treat. Preaching is abundant. In fact, the only thing worse than the terrible story is the constant hammering of religious principles and blatant evangelization attempts. I found it bothersome, and somewhat offensive, that all non Christian characters are corrupt, immoral and despicable.I'm not against religious novels or the incorporation of religious principles in a story (in fact, many of my favorite books center around this topic) but the concept is delivered here in such an arrogant, pretentious way that it often made me uncomfortable."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"This book was free, and,still, overpriced. It is nothing but proselytizing disguised as a novel. It is one long commercial for Christian Conservatism."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"No wonder it was free. IT IS ALL ABOUT THIS RIGHT WING RELIGIOUS AGENDA.I was in Saudi Arabia and it is nothing like they describe it. In fact, the Mormons in my company volunteer to go there because of the pure life style of the Arabs. The modesty, and safety of their families have never been in doubt as foreign workers.When I got to the abortion crap, I saw what this book was about... hate propaganda wrapped in christian double speak."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"I only got into this book a little. It grossed me out. The torture and then the court scene where the defending attorney was describing procedures; these things grossed me out and I had to put book down. Will not pick it up again."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"Fascinating and unpredictable. Excellent plot and character development. The only reason I give two stars is because of the theological errors it contains. Great to think of someone becoming a Christian, but it does not happen through a &#34;Sinner's Prayer.&#34; There is no such teaching or example in the New Testament. Rather, people are taught that they touch the cleansing blood of Jesus when they are immersed into him (Rom. 6:3-4). EVERY example of conversion in Acts shows the person rejoicing After this occurs. You can see this with Paul himself in Acts 22:16. A believing and penitent man, talking to and following the words of Jesus, still had his sins until they were washed away in his baptism into Christ. This humble submission to the gracious Gospel is how one calls upon the Lord. With accurate biblical teaching I would easily give this book five stars."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"This is one of the better written legal dramas. While the subject matter is pro Christian and about freedom of religion it will appeal to non-Christians as well. The writing is clean descriptive and engaging."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"This book was excellent. It was extremely well written, full of twists and turns throughout the plot. I never knew until the end how it would be resolved, and it did not disappoint in the end.

I'm at 53%, and I am not disappointed in it."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"This book was just wonderful and really held my interest throughout the story. I love trial books and this one really was exciting, etc. This was like a John Grisham book, exciting and had lots of action."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"I may be the world's pickiest reader. I know that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find books that have a good plot AND that are well-written. This book is one of those rare examples of contemporary fiction that is both interesting and intelligent. I loved every minute of it! In fact, I couldn't put it down and ended up reading the entire novel in less than 24 hours. I would definitely recommend \\"Directed Verdict\\" to anyone interested in a good read. (Also, for those worried about the religious content, don't be. The nature of the case has to do with a missionary's persecution, yes, but nothing about the book is religiously sappy or manipulative. It's very well-done and not obnoxious at all.)"},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"I think I have a new favorite author - Directed Verdict is \\"on the edge of your seat\\" good... with a bit of romance thrown in."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"As an avid reader, I've never been too interested in fiction works, but after reading previous reviews, my interest was piqued and I have to agree...this book was terrific! Exciting, to say the least. Initially, I was curious, as I'd read the 'free preview' available on Amazon...and that's what got me interested! I just finished 'Directed Verdict' and will now make every effort to read more books by Randy Singer. Once I started, I was hooked...and found myself picking up my Kindle several times a day to read more.

It was one of those books I couldn't put down, the suspense was believable. I'd recommend this book to my friends!"},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"I loved this book from the start. I couldn't put it down. First, there are so many twists and unexpected turns (and some expected turns that turn into unexpected turns) that it was practically impossible to determine what the outcome would be. I knew what I WANTED the outcome to be but honestly wasn't sure that was going to happen.I have always liked John Grisham novels (and Dan Brown) so when I saw this I was hoping for a good suspense novel and Mr. Singer definitely delivered. I loved Sarah's character from the start. To have that kind of peace in your heart even under extreme distress is amazing and having witnessed people like that in my own life I felt I could identify with her.I felt that the characters were well developed and although occasionally I did get confused with who was who, I blame that on my wanting to read faster vice any fault of the author. Would definitely recommend this to others (and already have) and would read it again."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"Directed Verdict\\" is yet another truly fine novel by attorney-turned-author Randy Singer. It is a multi-faceted work which succeeds on all levels--suspenseful, informative, a bit of romance...and it's underscored with compelling references to the grace of God, as exemplified through his son, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Hopefully, this should not be a turnoff for those who are prone to read only secular books, inasmuch as, overall (as other reviewers have suggested), Mr. Singer continues to \\"out-Grisham Grisham!\\" I own and continue to read all of best-selling author John Grisham's novels; but, with all due respect, I believe that Randy Singer has climbed to the top rung of the legal-thriller genre. This book, along with all of Mr. Singer's books, is highly recommended!--RON HOWE (a.k.a., Toby Martin II) ERSKINE, MINNESOTA."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"This is second book of Randy Singer that I have read and I loved both of them and can't wait to read more! I love his style of mystery and intrigue, and also love the courtroom drama. Some reviewers have compared him to John Grisham - I like Randy Singer better in mulitple ways, especially because of his christian perspective and more conservative viewpoints. He also keeps you trying to figure things out all the way, which I love, because I like to analyze."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"If you like suspenseful, complicated plots, this book is for you.Although much of the story is set in Tidewater, Virginia, Singer takes the reader into the closed society of Saudi Arabia. The diverse, colorful characters keep the story alive, while the tortuous plot keeps the reader riveted. I hope the author publishes again soon."},{"Title":"Directed Verdict","review":"This is a most enjoyable courtroom thriller, packed with (mostly) believeable characters and a plot which is complex but, in the end, satisfying. You kinda know how it's going to end but the author takes you on a fascinating route to get there. Singer is an excellent word-slinger, unafraid to go out on a limb with his plot and characters. At a few points you have to suspend disbelief, but not often. And, once or twice I thought the plot was going to get out of control and go wheels-off, like so many thrillers do when the author can't figure out how to believeably get the characters out of the jams he put them in. But Singer remains always in control and delivers a compelling book that is difficult to put down. A winner!"},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"As a longtime reader and reviewer [The New York Times, The Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, The Nation, The New Republic, etc.], I must say I am absolutely mesmerized by A Dance to the Music of Time. I am now in the process of reading, sometimes rereading, all twelve novels in this unique, absolutely remarkable work."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"Anthony Powell's decision to divide his twelve part opus into four separate parts, and to label each of these parts a movement, captures the spirit of this epic novel with one perfectly selected word. Evoking the spirit of classical music through his clever use of repetition, in both characters and themes, Powell creates a multi-layered masterpiece that cleverly evokes and then dissects the social scene of post World War One London.Over the course of the three short novels collected here, Powell details the early life of Nick Jenkins, following his maturity into a young adult as he- also the narrator- progresses through school, life in the London social scene, and his first success as an author. Without offering much by way of action or drama himself, Jenkins observations about people and society move the novel forward as he continually reconsiders and reshapes how he views the aspects of life he encounters- power, wealth, social status, love, and more.Like the classical music the title alludes to, each of the novels features the same lengthy cast of characters, put in similar situations, creating a near deja vu effect that lends both an absurdity and insight into the workings of the London social scene. Powell employs this conceit to its fullest, reintroducing characters, past scenes, direct quotes, and specific details that continually refer to previous passages yet move the action forward by themselves. By the time the third novel arrives, the characters which pack the biggest punch are withheld until the final acts, much in the way the better composers choose to repeat their strongest themes in the climax of a piece.A comedy of the driest wit, \\"A Dance to the Music of Time: First Movement\\" makes the London social scene in the post WWI years alive and ready to jump off the page. With little reference to the political machinations of the rest of the world, the insular society captured in these three novels comes across as shallow, self-serving, and so obsessed with itself the rest of the world might as well not exist. It makes for one enjoyable read.\\"A Dance to the Music of Time: First Movement\\" is one of the best English novels that is not really an English novel. An all around must read classic."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"If you ever wondered what England was like in the 20's &amp; 30's, this is the series that will answer most of your questions. Beautifully written, it may also engage your curiousity to see what next happens to the characters. After you've read the series, you can read Powell's memoirs and find out who the characters in the novel are modelled on. After Proust and Durrell, one of the great fictional series of the age."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"This very, very British novel is highly entertaining and quite amusing. I was so absorbed that I read it in it's entirety in just under two weeks. I must warn prospective readers, however, that the last three books in the series suffer from a sharp decline in quality. This is not enough, though, to effect the overall quality of the work, which is indeed outstanding.A must for Anglophiles everywhere."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"was to an REO Speedwagon song in 7th grade, but that is beside the point. This is an entertaining book: not half as good as Proust, which - if you have some time - will repay your investment tenfold. The difference, I think, is that in Proust the quest of the narrator was a unifying force across all the pages, and you felt that he was stumbling his way towards something worthwhile - which, after finishing the first volume, I still don't feel. Despite patches of excellent writing, it has an episodic feel that belongs neither to life nor art: he runs into people, things happen, generalizations are made about human behavior (sometimes the things seem to happen just so the generalization can be made) and the dance continues, but why isn't the music swelling, or at least changing tempo? And why don't I care when someone else gets divorced or married? I'll keep reading, certainly, but only for the little wonderful bits: for example, &quot;Being in love is a complicated matter; although anyone who is prepared to pretend that love is a simple, straightforward business is always in a strong position for making conquests. In general, things are apt to turn out unsatisfactorily for at least one of the parties concerned; and in due course only its most determined devotees remain unwilling to admit that an intimate and affectionate relationship is not necessarily a simple one . . . &quot; And it goes on.

In any event, this is my review of that volume; you can find my reviews of the other three volumes under their respective titles after I read them. ----Do I sound a bit too Widmerpool here?The comparisons with Proust: Proust is much better, more poetic and profound, than Powell. The narrator, Marcel, pulls you in to an almost solipsistic universe in which he, while outwardly passive, remains the main character throughout in his work, exposing the readers to the deep vicissitudes in his intense inner life. Our narrator here, Nick Jenkins, seems an almost completely empty vessel save for his detached reflections. That's how it seems to me....so far.It also seems to me that to really catch the wry humour here you have to have lived in England or among English people for a considerable amount of time. If one reads the exchanges herein in American accent, the delicious nuances fall flat. Such as in an exchange as this one where Eleanor and Sir Gavin are debating whether to attend the luncheon at the Donners castle:\\"I don't know what you call neighbours,\\" said Eleanor. \\"Stourwater is twenty-five miles at least.\\"\\"Nonsense,\\" said Sir Gavin. \\"I doubt if it is twenty-three.\\"That cadence that leads up to the stress on the final syllable, \\"three\\", is what makes the exchange so gorgeously droll. Yes, it is still somewhat funny in American English. But, well, you see what I mean.Despite these reservations, I find myself in profound disagreement with the reviewer who says that this volume is \\"literally about nothing.\\" The judgment holds water only if you believe that life is about nothing. As Nick reflects at one point, \\"Even in the quietest forms of life the untoward is rarely far from the surface.\\"And how this volume bears this out!"},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"The writing is undeniably good, although I found book II a bit dry (at one point I thought I was reading a Henry James novel. Not good!) The pace picks up again in book III. There are plenty of amusing comments about human nature, especially relationship between the sexes, in addition to \\"fine art\\" and the \\"literary world\\", etc, etc. Character development is an especially strong point. Reading volume I made me want to read volume II."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"VOLUME ONE IS OUTSTANDING! I chose to read the Dance series over the summer of 2003 for a graduate level course. The first volume was immediately enchanting, and despite criticism from others, I found it easily readable and accessible. The characters, though numerous, are further defined as the series progresses. However, even by the second book &quot;A Buyer's Market&quot; there is abundant humor from the juxtaposition of the varied participants. Powell's first volume is a gift which illuminates the value and ephemeral nature of people in our lives. It is also a treasure chest of practical if arcane vocabulary. I have now added the useful words &quot;adumbrate&quot;, &quot;demiurgic&quot;, and &quot;crepitation&quot; to memory. DON'T MISS OUT on the pleasure of this series."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"Anthony Powell's \\"A Dance to the Music of Time\\" runs from the early 1920s to the beginning of the 1970s and consists of 12 volumes in which around 400 characters appear. The first, \\"A Question of Upbringing\\", was published in 1951 and the last, \\"Hearing Secret Harmonies\\", in 1975.Quite a feat but was it worth it for the writer and reader? I've just read the first two novels in this trilogy and, although I found them lively and amusing, I am not sure I could face another 10 volumes.There is surely a limit to the amount of satire, sarcasm and japes about the English upper and middle classes Powell chronicled anyone can take.The humor is juvenile, rather than witty, and the characters, like the anti-hero, Widmerpool, are painted with strokes that are thickly applied, to say the least.It is not in the same league as some of Evelyn Waugh's books like \\"Scoop\\", \\"Black Mischief\\" and parts of the \\"Sword of Honour\\" trilogy.Guessing who the original was for certain of Powell's characters is part of the attraction although I feel this will fade among younger generations who have never heard of people like Lord Beaverbrook, Lord Mountbatten. C. P. Snow, F. R. Leavis, John Galsworthy, Diana Cooper etc.In conclusion, I would mention Powell's idiosyncratic style of writing in which colons, semi colons and dashes are given freedom to run around the page and break grammatical rules. How he got away with this is beyond me.I would like to give an example but the sentences are so long and rambling that the reader would never reach the end. Maybe that's why Powell needed 12 volumes when three or four might have sufficed."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"Anthony Powell's Dance to the music of time (first movement) is a triptych of novels that is truly superb. At once funny and poignant, the author does an exceptional job chronicling the interregnum between the world wars.A Question of Upbringing, the first novel, was by far my favorite of the three. Funny in the style of Mitford's Love in a Cold Climate, it introduces the reader to characters at Eton who continue on to university; our narrator Jenkins: the toff Stringham, the well-to-do Templar and the misfit Widmerpool are all very particular British type and wonderfully rendered. Their headmaster Le Bas is especially memorable and the friendships that burn bright but extinguish quickly are poignantly wrought.A Buyer's Market is nicely written but the action hinges entirely upon multiple coincidences too implausible to actually happen. Imagine being separated from four people for years and then bumping into them all in the same evening within a few hours. Hardly likely. Once past this deus ex machina set-up the action moves along nicely from a high society dance to a lower sort with social misfits and the raffine.Powell is quite marvelous at recording the perceptible shifts that can happen in an instant--a friend puts off another for a better invitation and nothing is quite the same again. Or the changes that can happen without quite understanding how they occur--Jenkins's schoolboy perception of Widmerpool challenged by those who see more substance in him--not just the awkward boy in the wrong coat.The Acceptance World is written ten years after first encounters at Eton and there has been a perceptible power shift among the four schoolmates. Stringham is adrift and divorced. Templar enormously successful though feeling \\"the slump\\" (i.e., Great Depression), Jenkins still unmarried and Widmerpool determinedly rising. While connections are tenuous they exist despite some rather profound changes.These changes are the reason why, for the life of me I can't understand how people can say nothing happens in these novels. When Templar, 10 years out of Eton announces \\"I really rather hate the well-born\\", you would have thought it something Widmerpool might have said. But as you come to get to know them, it isn't the one who clearly isn't good enough to rub elbows with the well-born, it's the one who was nearly good enough to do so that is most venomous.There is a great deal going on. It just isn't loud, vulgar or splashy. It is more quiet and if not always commonplace, it is very, very British."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"thoughts after completing the first volume...If this magnificently droll farce were played more broadly than it (is? \\"appears to be\\" might be a more suitable term given that I have only cracked the tip of this very dry iceberg)it would bear an even greater resemblance, in a certain very odd way, to the television series \\"Seinfeld\\"....that is,it appears to be an immense series featuring the same characters in manifold and perverse situations who keep turning up at the oddest moments,and further, most importantly, that it is about...NOTHING. In fact it appears to exceed the television series in this respect....it is REALLY about NOTHING. These characters appear to walk through their lives and we are witnesses to this unbelievably slow and prosaic process, with even the melodramatic situations,though inherently farcical, (and hilarious) somehow so unbelievably understated that one cannot imagine not being exposed, in equally droll fashion, to Nick Jenkins' morning toilet rituals at some distant point further down the road...the only salient feature giving the movements meaning are the magnificent interpretive pontifications of Nick, who appears to have gained a vast and intricate knowledge of the subtleties of the English language at some point vastly removed in time from the events of the first volume...this drollery is an art form that appears to have passed from the world entirely,and it makes me curious to explore Balzac's \\"Droll Stories\\"; somehow I don't think they will be this hysterical."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"Anthony Powell's Dance to the Music of Time, First Movement introduces us to Jenkins, the writer, Templer, the sex addict, Stringham, the rich man, and Widmerpool, the aspiring but inept businessman. The excitement of the 1920's gives us insight into a world of hope and idealism amidst rapidly changing dynamics of 20th century British society.Anthony Powell's Dance to the Music of Time, Second Movement continues the story at the eve of World War II. The idealism and hope of the 20's is muted amidst the growing fears of war, and the even greater fear of a loss of an empire.Anthony Powell's Dance to the Music of Time, Third Movement reminds us that there is no center to any war, especially World War II. Instead there are literally thousands of events which still present just a glimpse of the horrors of the war. The idealism of the 1920's is gone, replaced with uncertainty as to the post-war world on the horizon.Anthony Powell's Dance to the Music of Time, Fourth Movement introduces us to the notion of a social melancholy, a lost empire. Orhan Pamuk, author of Istanbul describes the state of huzun, translated as melancholy, as he describes the social emotions in Istanbul between the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the uncertainty of the embrace of western values. As Powell concludes his epic, \\"it might be much worse,\\" we wonder in the context of the 21st century, when the horizon suggests an even deeper huzun as the culture of the west and the east both face uncertainty.As we witness the encounter between the western culture, past its apex, and the new Islamic culture, on its ascendancy, one only wonders how Powell and Pamuk may be describing the same melancholy or huzun. While often compared to C.P. Snow's epic Strangers and Brothers, Powell's portrayal of the fall of the British Empire is sloppier and filled with a greater variety of social characters, more like Lawrence Durrell's Alexandria Quartet. In this it is more realistic and compelling in its presentation of a dynamics of social emotions."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"Powell should be read by anyone with a serious interest in modern fiction."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"gosh, why are you considering reading this book? personally, i chose this book because i had just finished proust, and i wanted something else to sink into. i love large books, books wherein i become invested in the characters, form relationships with them. in that sense, if you are looking for that, this is a good book. characters are well formed and identifiable. i agree with the reviewer who said that the narrator is nearly invisible and this can be annoying. we've seen it before in gatsby and proust even, but in proust the narrator is not only always there, dominating everything, but eventually he becomes not just felt but seen. i too found it annoying that the narrator was a nonentity, but it is a well-accepted novelistic device that i allowed.my main problem was the author showing his hand. it's difficult to describe this point, so i can only say that every single scene, almost without fail, was something along the lines of a phone call a bump-into a knock on the door. a string of deus ex machinas, one after the other. if you read this book, you will see what i mean. coincidence after coincidence. i found myself reading a scene, and when the scene was slowing down, i'd say, \\"oh, someone's about to knock on the door,\\" or, \\"widermerpool will show up now,\\" or something along those lines. it was not that i was guessing what would happen, i KNEW what would happen, and this drove me crazy.i think with any book (or movie) the key for the reader is to be able to suspend disbelief. it is possible for a reader to never be able to do this, to be unwilling to do this. i think probably most of us pass through a phase where we decide that no book is worthy of this suspension. it is no big revelation that a book needs our help. however, it is nice when an author helps us along, guides us into this illusory world. there can be no author that can withstand a blanket shunning of suspension, but there are many authors who provide a convincing argument. powell is not one of these authors."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"A Dance to the Music of Time is a twelve volume series of novels by Anthony Powell, published from 1951 to 1975--A Question of Upbringing (1951), A Buyer's Market (1952), The Acceptance World (1955), At Lady Molly's (1957), Casanova's Chinese Restaurant (1960), The Kindly Ones (1962), The Valley of Bones (1964), The Soldier's Art (1966), The Military Philosophers (1968), Books Do Furnish a Room (1971), Temporary Kings (1973), and Hearing Secret Harmonies (1975). Powell, mainly through the narration of Nicholas Jenkins, unfolds the stories of a group of upper class Brits from the 20's to the 70's as the England of Empire and Class and social form expires and yields to the new England. While not necessarily defending the older England, Powell clearly dislikes the society that replaced it and the series is basically an acerbic deconstruction of the modern world.I've read several of the novels and for purposes of this review read The Acceptance World. Set in the years 1931 to 1933, we follow Jenkins as he meets for tea, drinks, dinner or the weekend with a number of the recurring characters from the series. Finally as Kenneth Widmerpool, the social climbing mediocrity who represents Britain's New Man, is giving an interminable speech, Le Bas, their old Oxford don, collapses into his dinner plate with a stroke, perhaps brought on by the speech. This finale is one of the set pieces for which the series is best loved. The Acceptance World of the title refers specifically to the business of dealing in debt, but more generally it refers to the characters accepting that their lives are not following the ideal courses that they charted in youth and their acceptance of this disappointment.Frankly, the epic scope and understated plotting of these novels require more indulgence than this reader is prepared to offer. I have enjoyed the entries I've read, but in a very minor way. I'm afraid I share in all of the criticisms that one of the Websites below defends against. The books are too English, too class conscious, too nuanced, the characters are acid portraits based on actual people with whom I am totally unfamiliar and all of these factors combine to leave me feeling that I'm just barely missing the joke. Much of the humor lurks just beyond my ken. I admire the writing and understand the cult status that the work has achieved, but life is too short and reading time too precious to work my way through all 12 volumes.I suggest sampling the series, but warn you not to anticipate finishing it.GRADE: B-"},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"This edition of Volume I, aka the First Movement, of A Dance To The Music Of Time is in pristine condition and was delivered in timely fashion."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"I read the whole series of 12 beacause it was one of the New York Times list of 100 greatest novels of the 20th Century.I found the whole series to be unfunny and trivial considering they covered a very significant era of History. Over 3000 pages of narration by Nick Jenkins and by the end of the series the reader has little insight into who Nick really is. The characters are a bunch of odd-ball hanger-ons who,though intellectually stimulating, seem shallow and indiscreet."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"Once in a while you get the foolish idea to embark on a vast reading experience (Remembrance of Thing Past sits on my shelf unread and unreadable--by me, anyway). Well, recently I ordered the four-volume, twelve novel elegant U. of Chicago edition of this Powell classic and have spent the past five weeks luxuriating in the music wafting from its nearly 3,000 pages of polished prose, intricate and elaborate plotting and acute psychological appreciation of the human character. And what a cast of characters. Powell must rival Dickens in his capacity to invent delightfully eccentric and scene-stealing minor characters---Uncle Giles, Trewalney, Umfraville, Erridge and his besotted butler among so many others. My own favorites are Mrs. Erdleigh (&quot;hearing secret harmonies&quot; in both this life and the next), Teddy Jeavons, and the heartbreaking Gwatkin. And looming over all the megomaniacal Widmerpool (ably assisted by his horror of a wife in the latter novels), as morbidly fascinating as a car wreck, who gives the magnum opus its unity. And don't believe any nonsense about the epic losing its power in the post-WWII novels. Powell may have the conservative's disdain for the radicalism of the sixties, but Scorpio is delineated with fairness and vigor, and the Quiggen twins are a hoot. I did not think I would ever ever again encounter a serial reading experience as delightful as Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin novels but &quot;Dance&quot;-- for sheer enjoyment, delight, and intelligence---has been the reading pleasure of a lifetime. &quot;The Vision of visions heals the blindness of sight.&quot; Yes."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"First, although I adore this series, I would like to demur from the description of this series as a comedy. Certainly there are many comic situations and laughable characters, but Powell's (pronounced POE-UHL, not POW-UHL) comedy is intended less to make uslaugh than to make ussmile. I know many novels that are far funnier than this one, and if that were the book's only virtue, it would not enjoy the status that it does.Above all, this is a work that limns in almost tedious detail the interrelations and interworkings of a segment of English society in the 20th century. These first three books take you from the early twenties into the early thirties. Despite the series great length, there is nothing epic about the scale of the novels except for the overall length of of the series as a whole. The scenes are all horribly mundane. A party here, a dinner there, a chance meeting in a bar, more parties, more dinners. But as the parties and dinners multiply, and as one social encounter builds upon another, the series does indeed take on an epic quality.This new edition is far more attractive than the old mass market edition of the series, but I do wish that someone would have taken the effort to supply an appendix (perhaps to the final volume) that would (as in some editions of Trollope and Proust) explain who all the characters are and to whom they are related. By the sixth volume in the series, I began to find it extremely difficult to remember precisely where each character fit in the social world as a whole.The greatest virtues of Powell's series are his richly delineated characters (of which there are at least fifty to a hundred who are to some degree significant) and his marvelously elegant prose. I believe that anyone who loves novels would love this series, in particular those who have enjoyed Proust."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"_A Dance to the Music of Time_ is an extremely absorbing and well-crafted novel (composed of 12 smaller novels). Its subject is the decline of the English upper classes from the First World War to about 1970, a decline seen is inevitable and probably necessary, but somehow also regrettable.Such a description might make the novel seem stuffy, but it is not. _A Dance to the Music of Time_ is at times very funny indeed, and always interesting. always involving. It features an enormous cast of characters, and Powell has the remarkable ability to make his characters memorable with the briefest of descriptions. In addition, Powell's prose is addictive: very characteristic, idiosyncratic, and elegant.The long novel follows the life of the narrator, Nicholas Jenkins, from his time at Eton just after World War I to retirement in the English countryside in the late '60s. But Jenkins, though the narrator, is in many ways not the most important character. The comic villain Widmerpool, a creature of pure will, and awkward malevolence, is the other fulcrum around which the novel pivots.This first volume of the University of Chicago Press' beautiful four-volume Trade Paperback edition contains the first three books: _A Question of Upbringing_, which follows Nick Jenkins and his friends Charles Stringham and Peter Templer, along with Kenneth Widmerpool, through the last few terms at Eton, and summer spent in France, and then time at Oxford; _A Buyer's Market_, which covers Nick and his friends in their early 20s, attending dances and dinners, having love affairs, and beginning to make careers; and _The Acceptance World_, which shows the young men becoming settled in their careers, and beginning to marry and divorce and have more affairs as their &quot;dance&quot; continues.This is simply outstanding stuff."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"&quot;Dance&quot; is a monster of a project; 12 novels that feature a small core of characters that appear in each book and approximately 400 lessor characters that appear and disappear and sometimes reappear years (and books) later.The first movement consists of three social novels and tells the story of Nicholas (Nick) Jenkins' life from his last year at school in the early 1920s (probably Eaton) to his life as a writer living in London and working in the art publishing industry around 1930.Powell's style is very dated and ponderous, major world events get a sentence or two while a particular dinner or party might get three chapters. The really amazing thing is that if you stick with him, the series starts to work. The characters become very real, and despite the highly stratified nature of upper class English society he describes, you find them sympathetic and interesting.A major plus point here is the wonderful true-life ambiguity of everyone. There no black and white heroes or villains in these novels, even the dreaded Kennith Windmerpool emerges as a real human being, with real concerns and triumphs and failures. Nick starts disliking him, never really warms to him, but like us, grows to respect his drive and ambition. Nick, like many a narrator, emerges as a somewhat passive observant young man although not without resources and a strong sex drive!No way is this series of novels for everyone, but if you like good description, some very sly English humour, and believable developed characters in your books, then give it a shot. There are also some excellent resources on the Net that identify the &quot;real&quot; people the characters are based upon. Be warned, if you complete the first movement of the dance, you're committed to read the next three."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"Anthony Powell's twelve-volume sequence \\"A Dance to the Music of Time\\" tracks wealthy Englishman Nicholas Jenkins and his social circle from youth in 1921 to senescence in 1971 and features a cast of over four hundred characters. The title and concept behind the work are expressed through Jenkins' reminisces while watching constructionmen at work on a winter's day:\\"Something in the physical attitudes of the men themselves as they turned from the fire suddenly suggested Poussin's scene which the Seasons, hand in hand and facing outward, tread in rhythm to the notes of the lyre that the winged and naked greybeard places. The image of Time brought thoughts of mortality: of human beings, facing outward like the Seasons, moving hand in hand in intricate measure: stepping slowly, methodically, sometimes a trifle awkwardly, in evolutions that take recognisable shape: or breaking into seemingly meaningless gyrations, while partners disappear only to reappear again.\\"The grand theme of Powell's work is nothing less than life itself--specifically, how our lives are defined by our relation to other people. In A QUESTION OF UPBRINGING, we are introduced to Nicholas while he is in his final years at Eton, along with his roommates Templer (a young man desirious of women and money) and Stringham (a melancholy soul with a tumultuous family life). Widmerpool, who eventually becomes the villain of the cycle, is an awkward and little-liked boy who exists on the edges of this world. As the novel progresses, Jenkins finishes school, stays for a time with both of his former roommates, spends a summer in France, and experiences the first year at university. It may seem like there is little to it, but Powell's observations about life and growing up are more than substantial enough to make for a novel.In A BUYER'S MARKET we catch up with Jenkins three years or so later, when he's finished with university and working at a firm that publishes art books. Here he and his peers are entering society, attending numerous parties and balls meant to facilitate this process, and already having some taste of power. A large portion of the novel takes place in the course of a single night as Jenkins goes from dinner to ball to low house party, a homage to Joyce's ULYSSES. He runs into Widmerpool again, who starts to show something of his true nature, and a few other characters already known to the reader, as well as a host of new associates who play major roles here and in the future.The main topics of THE ACCEPTANCE WORLD, set at the end of the 1920s not long after the Great Depression, are the literary world and Marxist politics. Two men known to Jenkins at university have become writers and are vying for favour from the elder statesman of literary life, St. John Clarke. Quiggin, one of the promising writers, a fervent supporter of the Party (later dismayed that another character has become a Trotskyist). Jenkins begins his first serious relationship--while his friends are already married, some already divorced--and feels that he has finally come of age.My only real complaint about this thoroughly entertaining set of novels is that Powell is quite imprecise about chronology, favouring expressions like \\"a year or more earlier\\", \\"eighteen months or less\\", \\"ages ago\\", etc. to relate one event to another. I felt that with a little great effort he could have made the reader more certain of what happens when.\\"A Dance to the Music of Time\\" is not accessible to many readers simply because of the concentration and spare time required to get through it. Still, if you are taking a long sea voyage or boarding the Trans-Siberian, this is a good book to take along. Few writers have been capable of so massive a work with so grand a theme."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"I place this work among literary mammoths of our time, including Proust's &quot;Remembrance of Things Past,&quot; Durrell's &quot;The Alexandria Quartet&quot; and Henry Williamson's &quot;A Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight.&quot; My judgment results not merely from this work's great length, but rather in Powell's greatly detailed characters, sprawling plot development and sheer READABILITY. Despite its great length [about 3,000 pages] it still pales in length in comparison to the aforementioned &quot;Chronicle,&quot; which at times, plods along and tallies up to approximately 8,000 pages.

It is a joyful experience!"},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"This series--of which this is the first of four books--will appeal to readers who like carefully judged writing and feeling, an English saga, the British upper classes, the years between the world wars, a close but exterior study of changing relationships between young men, and English humor so reticent as to be easily missed by those not already steeped in the foregoing. The fact these are published by a universty press suggests the limited audience. IMO, the reader needs to be English or Anglophilic to really appreciate, let alone understand, the social structure, the character types, the allusive situations, and the literary-artistic allusions. I think I miss most of the entendres, let alone the doubles, and I was well into the second novel before I began to recognize the alleged &quot;comic&quot; (not &quot;funny&quot;) quality of this masterpiece, as distinguished from a slow story about a mob of wealthy and decadent young Englishmen with odd habits and quaint preoccupations.What happens in these novels? Not much in view, yet a very great deal in review, in scenes of meetings, planned or unexpected, over a meal or at a soir&eacute;e, with epigraphic discussions of people, present and absent, and insightful comments brilliantly expressed, in sentences full of commas--somewhat like this one. Characters are numerous and brilliantly developed over many decades, their lives intertwining in a seemingly accidental way as they float through the life of the marginal narrator, Nicholas Jenkins. Upon repeated readings an actual deep form like Bachian musical counterpoint might emerge, each character a melodic line; certainly many exquisite nuances must be missed by an American reader.Critics are right to describe Powell's writing as wonderfully apt, deft, verbally precise, delicate, subtle, and tasteful. While progressive in time, the novels are unconcerned with dates, wholly undidactic, and on occasion you won't know of momentous contemporary world events unless you understand overheard French, for such an interiorly self-referential world is created here. The cast of characters slowly builds, ever altering, in varied combinations. What I find really fascinating is the surprising re-entry of characters long absent, when we see them anew through the now more experienced eyes of other characters. Each novel (of the three in each book) is separately paginated, but this is definitely a series to read from the beginning or not at all."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"Don't make the mistake and think that you can read excerpts of Anthony Powell's epic and truly appreciate his vision. The entire novel (which consists of twelve separately titled novels) must be read in order and through to completion. The last two pages of the last novel provide a breathtaking conclusion that satisfactorily ties together everything that preceded it. Until then, I found the individual novels moderately entertaining; I loved them at first, but do admit that Powell's story gets tedious by the time you hit the 8th or 9th entry in the series. Overall, this book is much easier to admire as a whole than it is as individual parts."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"Holds your interest like a best-seller, yet there is a lot more here than just a good yarn. The completely realistic way all of the characters act as they advance from youth to old age, combined with Powell's understated ironic style (and a series of clever twists of novelistic fate that continually reinvent the main characters) make this a great, guilt-free, read.

I couldn't put the book down and when I finished it, couldn't wait to get the next volume.As the title probably suggests, a theme in the book is--I guess you could say-- the continual (random?) grouping and regrouping of people and events in life. At first, this can be a bit off-putting. You get interested in a certain set of characters, then suddenly, they're gone. Keep reading--they'll be back again in even more interesting/unlikely circumstances.Powell's characters are memorable, vivid, and eerily real--through the course of the books, they undergo various transformations which are fascinating to observe. The narrator always remains a bit mysterious which I found added to the book's interest.Powell creates a world of instability where relationships, morals, culture, even governments, are continually in flux. It's often sad, but very often hilarious, too.These books offer hours and hours of enjoyment you won't soon forget."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"It took me about a year to read the twelve novels that make up A Dance to the Music of Time.

The Dance kept calling me back.A Dance to the Music of time follows the lives of numerous upper-class English men and women as they emerge from college, get married, get divorced, establish careers, lose careers, grow old, and die. The narrator is Nick Jenkins, a keen observer and minor participant in the comings and goings of what must be by the end forty or fifty developed characters. The people in Powell's tome are educated, erudite, and mostly engaged in artistic and academic professions. These are not the kind of people I would ordinarily find interesting, but Powell hooked me and never let me go.It is hard, considering the similarities in length, in subject matter, and title not to compare Powell to Proust's, In Search of Lost Time. Both Proust and Powell can write pages describing conversations that took place at an afternoon tea, and, at the close of the scene, leave the reader saddened that it has come to an end so soon. Proust's long novel, however, was an epic dissection of the human need for love and belonging; a work of genius. The social interactions that delight us in his writing are lenses by which we examine our most inner selves. Nick Jenkins, Powell's narrator, is a distanced social observer--a wry, polite and ever forgiving chronicler of the human condition. Powell's heroes are flawed and his villains, are oddly likable. Even the ever-present Widmerpool--a Uriah Heep who gets squeezed by society into the upper realms of financial and political power by his sheer inability to assimilate anywhere else--is easier to pity than to hate.Characters in A Dance to the Music of Time come and go, disappear and reappear, die and live again through their progeny. You meet the neer-do-well Uncle Giles, the cult leading Dr. Trelawany, the alcoholic Stringham, the beautiful enchantress Pamela Flitton, the Marxist J.G. Quiggin, and so many more. Whenever the action--to the extent that there is any action in the traditional sense--flags, we hear a knock at the door or turn a street corner, and there stands a character from the past ready to fill us in on the remarkable turns of fate that have brought the person back to the fold. A Dance to the Music of Time is filled with happenstance meetings and homecomings. The motif is used so often that it becomes humorous and then delightfully comfortable.The books are funny and quotable. Powell's easy precise prose is always a comfort. I finished Proust and was ready for it to be over. I finished the last book in A Dance to the Music of Time and wished there was one more."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"Readers new to Powell should be forewarned that they will find no sympathetic characters in the first movement, not even the narrator, who is mainly known in this volume by his disquisitions on myriad topics and by his emotional distance from other characters until, near the end, he starts an affair that itself appears to lack emotional depth. The other characters are treated more like specimens than people. This characteristic is not unusual in a comedy of manners, especially a British one, in which even the sexual la ronde is not animated by passion. It's all rather mechanical. Even for readers who do not demand steamy bedroom antics, the \\"love affairs\\" in this volume will likely come across as dismal. Granted, that they are dismal may be Powell's point, but that treatment of \\"romance\\" is not to everyone's taste. Nor is fiction that repels identification with at least one character. The overall tone is rather chilly.That said, Powell does what he set out to do rather well on the whole. My point is that he's a specialized taste."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"Anthony Powell published twelve volumes of a wonderful novel from 1951 to 1975. He divided this continuing series into four musical movements depicted in a Nicolas Poussin 1639-40 painting. The painting and the novel are entitled, A Dance to the Music of Time. The first movement includes three volumes: A Question of Upbringing, A Buyer's Market, and The Acceptance World. These volumes introduce and describe four male characters as they progress through British schools and university, enter the professional world of work, and accept a loss of illusions as they interact with others in the real world.The first three parts of the story take place in the post World War I era of the 1920s and early 1930s. The characters are associated with British socioeconomic levels that include very wealthy (Templeton), wealthy (Stringham), upper middle class (Jenkins) and middle class (Widmerpool). After university, the characters go their separate ways determined by their economic classes but end up meeting in London while pursuing different individual goals.Nicolas Jenkins, the narrator of the novel, gets a job at a firm that publishes \\"art books\\" and uses free time offered by his relatively unstructured job to write novels. Like Robert Musil's character in A Man Without Qualities, Nick is a keen observer who seems to be continually on the edge of the social dance, jumping in on occasion but content to ruminate about the motives and behaviors of others. As he focuses on his three school acquaintances, Nick's commentary becomes increasingly reliable as he compares current incidents to reinterpret collective experiences of the past. He learns to abandon simplistic rules for understanding of the choices of his friends and others. He also learns his station in life and the limits of his ability as observer to discover immutable standards of acceptable social actions. Life is just too complex and changeable to maintain superficial and immature interpretations of the dance of life.Each volume of the first movement is self-contained as Powell gives readers descriptive reminders of characters and events that preceded the current action. The writing style is simple and direct and the pace is slow and deliberate. Powell presents many allusions to art, philosophy, and history like James Joyce in Ulysses with much less tangential writing. Using the Kindle dictionary and an iPhone, I enjoyed looking up each reference.The tone of the first three works is humorous and satirical without being overly cynical (except for the spoof of John Galsworthy). Readers can visualize Poussin's painting and observe the dance of the four main characters. Economic, political and social parallels can be seen with our own turn of the century culture.I highly recommend the first movement of Powell's omnibus work to readers who love to observe the dance of life. I have not encountered a contemporary writer who is such a good chronicler and analyst of the unfolding and interacting lives of realistic rather than stereotyped characters. I feel fortunate to have 9 more volumes in 3 more movements to read in the 4 paperback edition published by the University of Chicago press (1995). Though life is beautiful and upsetting, comical and tragic, expected and catastrophic, Powell shows readers the worst action they can take is to drop out of the dance. As in Proust's In Search of Lost Time, the social isolate is irrevocably self-centered forever missing the chances of a lifetime to listen to the music of time and in Powell's words move \\"hand in hand in intricate measure\\" with others."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"I usually dislike coming-of-age novels, but based on other reviews I decided to try this. It is not your normal angst ridden type of such. This is humorous. That raises it several notches in my estimation.If you appreciate British society, you will like this. If not, you probably won't. This isn't an everyman that could be set elsewhere (USA for instance). The very Britishness is what makes it work.Amazon's description is sufficient to explain where Powell is going with this series. I am looking forward to reading the 2nd Movement."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"\\"A Dance to the Music of Time,\\" an engrossing, highly-literate, highly comic 12-book series by British author Anthony Powell, had to have been one of the highlights of latter 20th century writing to those who appreciate a good, funny book. And it had to have been of riveting interest to some, those who can never get enough of Public Broadcasting Systems' \\"Masterpiece Theatre/Upstairs Downstairs\\" entertainments. In fact, it was of riveting interest to me: I remember, in real time, eagerly awaiting the appearance of each next book. I felt more or less like those 19th Century Dickens fans, so eager to learn what had become of Little Nell that they climbed the cliffs of Montauk, New York, to be the first to shout their inquiries to incoming British sailors. So, now that the series is complete, it has been collected into four movements, each including three of the original novels. The first starts with \\"A Question of Upbringing,\\" \\"A Buyer's Market,\\" and \\"The Acceptance World.\\"If you are reading this review, \\"A Question of Upbringing\\" may be as close as you'll ever get to Eton, the legendary English public school - for which, to us, read private school - experience. It is set shortly after World War I. We meet our narrator, Nick Jenkins, and his two closest friends. Peter Templer, already a ladies' man, whose unfortunate incident will hint at much to come. Charles Stringham, already rich and reckless. Then there is the headmaster, LeBas, a great comic creation. Also Kenneth Widmerpool, an even greater, more resonant comic creation, known at school for the wrong sort of overcoat, and his overwhelming desire to succeed. We will continue to meet him in future. We meet Templer's famously rich and beautiful mother, Mrs. Foxe, her latest husband, Buster, a navy man, and see Jenkins' first crush on Jean, Peter's sister. Then we go briefly to France, where Widmerpool pops up again, and onto Oxford and the great world of London.At Oxford we meet another great comic creation, one of the dons, Sillery, known as Sillers, who's busy giving Sunday afternoon teas, enabling him to keep a finger in every possible pie. We also meet Mark Members and J.G.Quiggin; who, according to Sillers, live quite near each other at home, and are possibly related, and who, like Jenkins our narrator, have literary ambitions.\\"A Buyer's Market\\" takes our characters to London, where those wishing to begin to establish literary careers. We see quite a lot of Deacon, an elderly, homosexual, not so talented artist, and of his tenant, Barnby, a more talented, third generation artist, with an eye for the ladies. And we meet quite a few ladies, several of them beautiful: Gypsy Jones, Baby Wentworth, Bijou Ardglass. Widmerpool pops up again. And, we see more of those famous debutante dances, and the dinners thrown before them, than you're likely to find anywhere else. Finally, we are introduced to one of the abiding passions of the thirties: Communism, in its Stalinist and Trotskyite embodiments.\\"The Acceptance World,\\" set as the world approaches the Great Depression, gives us an even larger gallery of entertaining, larger than life characters. Templer and Stringham have married, unsuccessfully, as has Jean Templer: Jenkins will find himself falling in love with her again, as a grown-up this time. We meet Dicky Umfraville, an older man who will take away Stringham's former sister-in-law, Ann Stepney, from Barnby, and marry her himself. Further, Peter Templer's wife Mona, whom we initially met as an artist's model, will suddenly find the literary/political worlds more interesting than that of the just plain rich.Mind you, Powell is no mere stenographer; he creates the rhythmic beat of \\"A Dance to the Music of Time,\\" with thought, care, philosophy, perception, irony and wit. If you always wished you could climb into \\"Masterpiece Theatre\\" and live there, this series is for you."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"I just finished reading the twelfth novel in the series, and feel rather sad that I won't have another several to read over the coming year. Some of the best writing I have ever read, with subtleties draped over every sentence. I was especially taken by the jokes which Powell would spend 100 pages setting up, then unleash with incredible wit and fury. After reading the first one or two novels, continue to read all of them- you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"Although I'd read most of the 12 novels before (not necessarily in the right order) at various times, I've been having an orgy of Powell reading though them all at once.It's still astoundingly good.Some bits of it you might want to appreciate for historical interest (eg, the formal relations between the sexes - was it only 50 years ago that people behaved like that?) but it's still human, intelligent and very, very funny."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"This is really a review of the University of Chicago Press' excellent paperback edition: the cover image is of the French painting that gives the sequence it's title, wittily spread over all four titles.Also well-printed and bound. Much better than the crass and tacky TV tie-in dustcover and cheap paper of the English reprint."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"For me, the most impressive aspect of Anthony Powell's *Danceto the Music of Time* series is not the hilarious comedy,not the dazzling style of writing, not even the epic scopeof this series of 12 novels covering upper class life inEngland from the 1920s to the '70s. For me it is theastounding *reality* of the characters, both major andminor, who populate these novels. They becomereal people that you actually know, and their triumphial,absurd or tragic progression through this seriesis the most compelling and moving reading that Ihave experiencened in modern literature. Anybody interestedin post-war fiction must read this magnificent series ofnovels."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"I have read this series several times since I first saw it by accident in the late 1970s on university library bookshelves. I was first struck by the serpentine sentences, the erudition of the protagonist, and his elite circle in society and acquaintance with the arts. It is a relatively light approach to the world in which characters intertwine to a comic degree over time, and the protagonist is mysterious and impassive, and never really in any physical, psychological or financial danger. These are novels in which it is very easy to become engrossed in the wonderful detail, the vivid characterizations of the arts and publishing demi-monde, the quirks of military life, the naifs of left-wing politics, and the amazing eccentricities of practically everyone with whom the unknowable protagonist and narrator meets.Anyone who loves these books would also cherish the eleven volume series, &quot;Strangers and Brothers&quot; by C.P. Snow - which covers the same period of time, is also told in the first person, but is a more serious series in which faux pas cause lost jobs or spouses, rather than pots of sugar dumped on one's head at a dinner party!"},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"These four novels aren't for everyone, obviously. I teach high school English, and most of my students would NOT appreciate them. But if you are a mature reader, and you love books, this set of 12 novels is a feast. The novels are delectable. I can't remember when I've enjoyed a reading experience this much- partly because there is so much to enjoy. My primary problem with good books is that they don't last long enough, so this is like an everlasting gobstopper (to steal from Willy Wonka). I love Proust, but this set of novels was a lot more fun. It's a set that is brilliant, and entertaining, and long lasting- I really don't think you could ask for anything more. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"Just as the taste of some \\"petites madeleines\\" with tea was the impetus that started Proust on his seven volumed A la Recherche du Temps Perdu, the sight of workmen gathered around a coke fire, served as a similar spark for Anthony Powell's own epic literay effort. Although the two works differ in the language used to write them and deal with different stratum of society, the similarities are obvious to anyone who has read the two works. Both are fairly obsessed with the concept of time and how it influences memory and imagination; both authors create elaborate universes, peopled with hundreds of characters and places, which are then minutely examined and described from a vantage point somewhere in the future (the examination and description themselves affected by the passing of time); both dealt obliquely with the idea of war and how it impacts the accepted social milieu, and both works are quintessentially passive in style.The \\"First Movment\\" of the Dance comprises the first three novels of the series and centers on the years immediately following Worl War I through the first part of the 1930s. Although these years would prove to be momentous in the history of Britain and, indeed, the rest of the world, Powell is less interested in history (compare this to Proust's detailed account of the Dreyfus case) than he is in the human condition. The four main characters of these three novels - Jenkins, the narrator; Templer and Stringham, school friends who find the adjustment to adulthood difficult; and Widmerpool, the ambitious outsider - seem to exist in a world of social functions and very rarely comment on the historical realities of their time such as the Germany's slide toward fascism or the depression affecting the economic foundation of Britain's world position. To Powell, the passage of time has more to do with the interaction between people than it does with political and economic machinations.Indeed, it is Powell's elaborate creation of believable characters that makes the work succeed as it does. The main characters become so well known to the reader that their actions are almost anticipated in advance, and the cast of supporting actors is brilliantly crafted - Jenkins' iconoclastic relative, Uncle Giles; the inimical literati, Members and Quiqqin; the womanizing artist, Barby; and the pathetic Mr. Deacon. However, Powell's women characters are not as impressive and, with the exception of Gypsy Jones, seem to be more mannequins (indeed a couple of the women characters are former models) than living, breathing humans. Predictably, the interrelations between the male characters have more life than those between the sexes. The sexual dynamics, such as exist, are as passive as the other action of the novel and described in such a way that would not cause even Jerry Falwell to blush.Powell's style takes a while to get use to, but soon the diligent reader becomes immersed in its languidnesss and, because of the sheer length of the work, begins to feel the various rhythms of one's own music of time."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"For people who like Jane Austen, yet set in more recent times, Anthony Powell's series is worth reading. The story lines are not gripping thrillers, yet one becomes interested in the characters as they drift in and out of the main protagonist's life. I picked up the first \`trilogy' in the reissue of Powell's work because I had watched and enjoyed the televisation made by one of the UK's networks. All the reviewers said that the series did not reflect the depth of the books. So I read the books to compare them. I found that the television series mirrored the books very well indeed. The producers had caught the wistfull and distant mood of Nicholas Jenkins well and the dissipation of the upper classes between the two world wars excellently. Do the stories go anywhere? Not in the accepted sense of the word. They exist in a time capsule, for us to observe - a measured dance to the music of time, as so aptly titled. If you are a fan of Evelyn Waugh and Nancy Mitford you will! enjoy Anthony Powell, and if you enjoy these novels yet have not read Waugh and Mitford, try them as well."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"I must confess that I write this review without the perspective of some of the other reviewers who have finished all twelve novels. But the first three novels each stand alone quite nicely. The first novel in this movement, A Question of Upbringing, is perhaps the most enjoyable of the lot, certainly the most humorous, and contains that sense of fun and nostalgia so prevalent in tales of schooldays. A Buyer's Market has its moments, particularly in the triumphant sequence involving Mrs. Andriadis' party, but somewhat pales in comparison to the novels that immediately precede and follow it. The third novel, The Acceptance World, is arguably the best of the three, certainly the richest in characterization and more interesting because of the first sense in the novels of the outside political world.I think it is fair to point out that Powell's narrator seems, to some degree, modeled upon the narrator of Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby, even sharing the same first name, Nick. One irritating but perhaps essential element of the novels is the large number of coincidences that take place (something perhaps borrowed from Dickens; see Great Expectations et al). But these minor faults are not outweighed by the richness of these three novels."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"Anthony Powell's 12-novel series is frequently compared to Proust's &quot;Rememberance of Things Past&quot;, but the similarity is purely superficial. The Dance is far lighter in tone, but manages to convey the sense of actually living another's life far better than any other novel (or series) I am aware of. The four main protagonists and scores of supporting characters bring to immediate life an England that now exists no more than that of Dickens, only here the change in social structure and personal lives is palpable as the old structures are brought down by the two world wars and the subsequent fall of empire. Powell's linguistic skill is unmatched - both imagery and characterization are faultless. At times ironic or satirical but far more often fondly understated, wistful but never maudlin, this is a series that will bear repeated readings over many years of one's own life. Most highly recommended for lovers of language, or for those who are attracted to the sense of passing years evoked in the best of Thomas Wolfe"},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"THE MUSIC OF TIME is a fascinating chronicle of English life between the wars. The first two movements remind one of Waugh orWodehouse(with a touch of the Puckish humour of John Mortimer) complete with a cast of characters that delight the Anglophile. The satire is delightful-so witty, in fact, that it is relaxing, not too challenging, gently leading the reader to the third movement. The last two movements are quite another matter. In Kenneth Widmerpool (who pops in and out of the first two movements) Powell has created a truly disturbing character-so disturbing that he reminds one of Michael Dobb&quot;s Francis Urquhart. True, Widmerpool is obvious, unsophisticated and not very intelligent,but despite limitations all the more dangerous and effective. We follow his career from school outcast-unathletic,unpopular,obese and unscholarly-until he claws his way to the top,marries the beautiful but sadistic Pamela, only to crash and burn in a fantastic cult. These last two movements remind one of Michael Dobb's or Anthony Burgess, in a word, frightening. In Pamela and Kenneth Widmerpool Powell has created two unforgetable characters that will enter the language. In fact, a former Conservative Prime Minister (Edward Heath) has been tagged with the odious, if not descriptive, title of &quot;Widmerpool&quot;."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"This volume contains the first three novels of Anthony Powell's masterpiece, A Dance to the Music of Time. Powell's work is social comedy in the tradition of Jane Austen and George Meredith. Contemporary writers with whom he is often compared include Marcel Proust and Evelyn Waugh. The 12 short novels of A Dance to the Music of Time give a panoramic picture of English upper-class social life from 1921 to 1971 that is both intensely realistic and amazingly funny. Readers either love Powell's work or can't understand what others see in it. My own opinion is that Dance is the best novel written in the twentieth century. Others share this view: A Dance to the Music of Time is #43 on the recently constructed Random House/Modern Library 100 Best Poll (of twentieth century fiction) and was made into a 4-part miniseries on British television just about a year ago."},{"Title":"Dance to the Music of Time (12 Books in 4 Volumes, complete)","review":"These are the first three books in Anthony Powell's twelve-novel sequence, A DANCE TO THE MUSIC OF TIME. I have already reviewed the first (A QUESTION OF UPBRINGING) separately, but will continue with the rest in the rather chunky groups of three in which the Chicago University Press publishes them; the elegance of calling each volume a musical \\"movement\\" would be more meaningful if they were easier to hold in the hand.In A QUESTION OF UPBRINGING, Powell (pronounced \\"Pole\\") traces the lives of several school friends and their widening net of acquaintances from the early 1920s to the postwar period in which he was writing, told through the eyes of the narrator Nick Jenkins. The first long chapter of the first book shows Nick at school with his roommates Charles Stringham and Peter Templer, while Kenneth Widmerpool, a slightly older boy and a decidedly odd duck, hovers in the background. Each of three subsequent chapters shows Nick with one of the other three, ending with his arrival at Oxford University. These four detailed pictures function well as exposition, but the book does not stand up well on its own.The second volume, A BUYER'S MARKET, has more momentum, though it still favors the pattern of static set pieces in four very long chapters. Two of these consist of parties: a debutante ball in Mayfair, and a more worldly affair given by the former Mistress of a Royal Personage in the pre-dawn hours of the same night. A day spent among guests at a country house follows, and the fourth chapter is more or less divided between a wedding and a funeral. Yet within these set pieces Powell manages to show a great deal of how Nick's view of his world has expanded, and how he and others change with time, especially in those crucial years in one's mid-twenties. Naturally at that age, his romantic life plays a large part; there is a subtle pulse through the book of attraction, disillusion, and sometimes reconnection. But a more important thread is how people develop socially, politically, and professionally; although as a writer, Nick himself is not part of the world of affairs, many of his contacts seem to be moving into positions of some influence.The third book (whose curious title THE ACCEPTANCE WORLD is explained in the text, but it still not easy to grasp) moves along much faster, with shorter chapters and a great deal more action, equally divided between the aesthetic, political, and romantic fronts. Nick is now a published author, as are two of his Oxford friends, Mark Members and JG Quiggin, who each serve in turn as secretary to a celebrated writer of a previous age, St John Clarke. Powell admitted that Clarke was based on Sir John Galsworthy, whoseFORSYTE SAGAis surely another influence on his own work -- though he clearly thinks his style and approach outmoded. Clarke (who remains offstage throughout) undergoes a fashionable but impotent conversion to modernism in art and Marxism in politics, and there is a strong undercurrent of social change throughout the book. Whereas in the second volume there was only one character clearly associated with left-wing politics -- Gypsy Jones, a middle-class social activist who is quite active in other ways too -- now there are numerous figures openly expressing socialist ideals, and there is even a short scene at a protest march. As a document of the intellectual turmoil of the interwar years, it seems almost a lighter version of Aldous Huxley's 1928 novel,POINT COUNTER POINT.While coming alive in his dialogue, and capable of touches of wit, Powell seems a stuffy writer, even for the 1950s. In the second volume, I had been bewildered by a scene involving Gypsy Jones that could be read as an oblique way of describing love-making, but I honestly have no idea whether it did or not, so oblique was Powell's way of indicating sexual activity or orientation. So I was pleased to see that THE ACCEPTANCE WORLD is a lot more open and easier to follow. Nick, for example, gets involved in a relationship that is unabashedly carnal -- though immediately followed by post-coital philosophizing on the unpredictable nature of women. But this is part of a whole texture of divorces and realignments that seem to affect just about everybody in what is now a surprisingly large group. As the book continues to move between dinners and parties, and old acquaintances drift in and out, generally paired with or broken from some other old acquaintance, I began to grow weary of the continual mode of \\"Whatever happened to old so-and-so?\\" Especially since this is applied to a cast of characters which, though large enough to really require a reader's concordance, is almost entirely drawn from Powell's own upper-crust world. While I am coming to know many of these people well, and certainly see the novels as a remarkable document of their period, I am not sure that I have sufficient taste for this kind of social incest to sustain my interest for nine more books."},{"Title":"Art and Life in Bangladesh","review":"The author has captured the essence of East Bengal in this marvelous book about art in Bangladesh. While the primary medium is pottery, the book also touches on rickshaw art, engraving, boat building, straw mat production and others.

In this manner, Glassie guides the reader to a great understanding of the incredible artistry of the people of Bangladesh. Reading this book forces one to reflect on a range of important issues -- the central one being a compassionate concern with what it means to be wealthy or poor in Bangladesh, and in America."},{"Title":"Art and Life in Bangladesh","review":"&quot;Art&quot; must be taken very broadly, not to misjudge this book by its title. Glassie is such an honest, humble writer, one would forgive him for staying with the high arts, but he brings us into the back yards of potters and other craftspeople who labor in mud and obscurity. What I appreciate the most is his exquisite sense of the moment. Glassie never generalizes or universalizes; he shows us how lives and art change (not constantly, but imperceptibly, and also in sudden surges), and at the end we know more about all people by knowing more about these few."},{"Title":"The great psychologists: from Aristotle to Freud","review":"The Great Psychologist: From Aristotle to Freud.

I have not read any other writer that has his patience and skill at building complex, realistic relationships through the accumulation of minute detail. While the characters and plot are only adequate, the relationships between the characters, and the poetic prose, drove the novel and managed to keep me engaged the whole way through. I was surprised that this novel, at least, showed no indication of the smuttiness of which Lawrence has often been accused. Overall, a good introduction to a literary author who will get another look later."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"I read this book for my English class and I found it to be ultimately unsatifying. I think Lawrence's prose is incredible but I just could not empathize with Paul Morel - he''s so childish and weak. Paul is only charming during his love scenes with Clara when he affects the Welsh accent of Walter Morel. I thought Gertrude Morel was a despicable woman who treated her husband with undeserved contempt and emotionally suffocated her sons. In the book, Gertrude's death leaves Paul in a world of darkness, he's a broken man. However, it's interesting to note that as much as D.H.Lawrence (the book is semi-autobiographical) came to view his mother as a negative influence in his mature years. As an adult, it is D.H. Lawrence's father who is personified as Walter Morel, for whom he exhibited admiration."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"I enjoy reading the works of D.H. Lawrence. I believe no other author of his time explored the complexities of human sexuality, behavior, intimacy, and depth as poignantly as him. By far I loved Lady Chatterley's Lover, his most famous and controversial novel. SONS AND LOVERS is the second Lawrence book I've read. I can't really say if I truly liked the book or not. I believe that what this book explores is deeply interesting and even haunting, seeing how controlling and possessive a mother could be on her sons, and how deeply attached sons could be towards their mother. It was also interesting seeing the complexities of the characters grow and develop with each chapter. I can definitely see why SONS AND LOVERS is considered a classic. The only flaw i found with this novel was how annoying Paul Morel is. I just found his behavior to be pathetic and ridiculous. But other than that, this is a great read, but not necessarily Lawrence's BEST work."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"This book renewed my belief in the power of love.

If you had to read it for some assignment in school and didn't like it, maybe you should keep your thoughts to yourself instead of disputing it. As Bob Dylan said, &quot;don't criticize what you can't understand&quot;. Sure, everybody has a right to their opinion. But being assigned a book means you have no choice, and therefore are maybe predisposed to not like it. Paul's agonies over Clara and Miriam could be happening to any guy, today. Lawrence cuts right to the bone of relationships, and anyone wanting to understand that immeasurable gulf between men and women would do well to read this book, not because I or anyone else tells you to, but because it's true and real."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"There are several subplots, but the main one the story ends up gravitating around is that when Mrs. Morel becomes pregnant with her son Paul, her marriage has pretty much dissolved thanks to her husband's alcoholic and abusive nature. She seems to have antenatal and postpartum depression; as a result, her infant becomes sensitized to her moods.He grows up and is too attached to her, and her to him. He cannot make heads or tails of his own emotions in relationships, partly because he over intellectualizes everything, and partly because he cannot see how his mother's hold on him is suffocating his ability to grow as an independent person. Worse, he emulates his father's disdainful attitude towards women, rendering him often a less-than-likeable character.His mom, in a matyristic fashion, begins to die of an ailment she never revealed to her main physician. He thus becomes mired in the process of helping and watching her die. He and his mother have a few moments that are more than just enmeshed (incestual in tone); his father seems to pick up on the inappropriateness of the relationship, but given his own alienation from the family can do very little in the way of anything, other than get out of the way.There are moments of poetry, but the constant exposition of internal struggles in philosophical and psychological terms tends to get a bit tiring, and thus diminishes the dramatic tension. It would be a good book for students just getting the hang of applying psychological theory to literature (the Oedipus complex particularly), but it is overdramatic in characterization, overlong, and rather depressing in its misogyny and hopelessness. Three stars from this reviewer."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"This was the first book that I have read of D.H. Lawrence.

The characters came alive with Lawrence's descriptions.I will definitely read more Lawrence."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"paul's character became too complex and annoying, a drama king whose personality concerning his mother ,(mommy's boy), frustrated me alot"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"Sons and Lovers is the first novel of D. H. Lawrence's that I have ever read and now, after I've finished it, many things begin to make more sense than before.The book is divided in two parts: part one includes six chapters and part two includes nine chapters.In the first part we meet the Morels and the narration revolves around Gertrude Morel. She lives a harsh and unsatisfayingy life because of her husband Walter, who gets drunk and abuses her and their children.In the second part, the main character is Paul, the third child of the family and probably the one who would have had potential to become a remarkable protagonist, due to his capacity to work hard and due to his creativity.However, Lawrence shows us an extreme case of Oedipus complex. Since Paul was a baby, Mrs. Morel treated him in a special way that had led in time to a pretty tight bondage between them. The mother-son love pushes the normal limit of familial affection, becoming almost erotic. The interesting fact is that both of them are jealous of each other's relationships: Paul hates his father - almost wanting to murder him - and Mrs. Morel hates Miriam and Clara, inoculating the idea that her son hadn't found the right woman, whom he ought to marry.As well as Gertrude's marriage with Walter, Paul fails in both his relationships, after swinging for several times (annoyingly for the reader) between Miriam and Clara. In truth, he doesn't want to marry neither of them, because he secretly loves his mother more than the two.The narration is a bit slow because of the descriptions and the characters' thoughts towards the others.Paul Morel is not a protagonist that I might like, because he is very confused, his thoughts are often contradictory and he doesn't know what he really wants from life. His love for his mother has devastating consequences for both of them in the end.I think that Lawrence exaggerates when he pictures Paul as a spiritually and mentally mutilated man. If the protagonist had had a strong personality, he would have avoided the deplorable situation in which the reader finds him in the last pages of the novel."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"This is my favorite d h lawrence novel a little rambling at parts but I still love this book and have read it many times"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"--Oh! Pardon me for that rather undignified opening. Although (yawn) when I get to reflecting back on this book it seems somehow an appropriate response. It is a book about selfish and spoiled people, about elitists imagining their ideas as somehow relevent to the larger world around them and about how a little bit of education can lead to a great deal of contempt for the society in which someone is raised.Now, of course, these are valid and even potentially interesting points, but the method Lawrence chose to tell this, what I gather is a deeply personal story, is basically condescention and self-absorbsion. After about 100 pages I started dreading what was to come, which was basically more of the same alongside some predictable, tacked on melodramatic tragedy.The complication comes from Lawrence's genuine ability as a writer. There are lines--sometimes, albiet rarely, pages of pure beauty. These words came from a powerful and passionate writer who was too personally involved with the story he was telling to make it universial. I can appreciate the venting, the often conflicted outrage of the elitist scholar and budding psychoanalyist that Lawrence was later to become, but if this is a modelled story of the man's life it will ultimately take away some of the respect my reading of The Rainbow, Women in Love and a handful of his short stories had previously inspired. I can forgive the late, great author for this childish and selfish book, a mama's boy trying as hard as he can to show off how clever people have always told him he was, but I have trouble comprehending the innumerable critics and casual readers alike who boast and gloat over this story as if the triumph of personal arrogance related within somehow validated their own wavering sense of intellectual accomplishment.Two and a half stars rounded up because of some pretty writing and the apparent lasting relevence of this mostly frivilous work--"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"DH Lawrence was born in Nottingham, England in 1885. He died at age 44 in Vence, France in 1930. In between those birth and death dates he created great fiction. His first big book and, probably, still his greatest is \\"Sons and Lovers.\\"The novel is highly autobiographical. Walter Morel is a crude, hard drinking miner who has no intellectual interests. He weds the etheral and lovely Gertrude. The couple have four children: William, Annie, Paul and Arthur. William, the eldest, is a good boy engaged to a flighty woman. He dies at an early age. The other children, with the noted exception of Paul, live mundane lives.Paul is the Lawrence figure in the book. He is a momma's boy tied to her tight apron strings. Paul loves books, learning and the beauties of flowering nature. He has long affairs with the beautiful but shy Miriam who lives on a nearby farm and Clara Dawes (resembling Lawrence's wife Frieda Weekly). He marries neither woman leaving his boyhood home for adventures elsewhere. As the novel ends, Paul will continue his artistic work and his spiritual questing.There is little action in this novel. It is, instead, a pyschological probing of such human affairs as familial and erotic love, death, suffering and the process of saying goodbye to childhood. It is a deeply moving book. One cannot refrain from crying at the death of Paul's saintly mother.\\"Sons and Lovers\\" was written before Lawrence was scorned by critics and damaged by life. It is an excellent book which everyone should read if they are interested in life within a family. This book is rich with descriptions of nature and is a joy to read. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"I know this review is going to sound markedly unintelligent, but I really can't help it in this case. I'm going to say what I need to say about this book, whether it makes a helpful review or not.Let me get one thing straight first: Sons and Lovers does not flow in the way Lawrence's other works flow. Each scene does not seem to bind itself to the next to make a perfect, seamless whole. The book does lag at times, in fact. It is beautifully written but not 'perfectly' written like Lawrence's other works. I am not rating this book on its composition, though. I'm rating it for something else.I'm wondering if anyone else felt the same way I felt when I read this novel. I have never before had to lay down a book in mid-paragraph and put my head in my hands for sheer emotional inability to read any further that day. I've read authors whose works hold up a mirror to an entire society, to a clique, to a cult, or a nation, but NEVER have I seen an author hold up a mirror to common individuals like myself. Quite honestly, I have never felt so horrible and so sickened with MYSELF simply because I read a book.What IS it about this story that makes me feel this way? I can only say that Lawrence must have been an expert at inner self-examination and observance of society. When I say society, I don't mean of 'the English,' or 'the Americans' or 'the-anything.' I mean of 'people.' There must be aspects of all human beings that will never change through time, age, gender, and economic status, because Lawrence captures each and every little thought, feeling, and nuance of human emotion and throws it as us in this book. The effect is a screaming recognition of yourself (at least, of myself.) 'Oh my God, that IS me!' I sympathize with Miriam, I sympathize with Paul, with Lily, with William, with Gertrude, and, God help me, with Walter Morel. I see myself in them.Lawrence may want us to feel negatively toward Miriam at times, but those are the times when I most identify with her. She may be a 'soul sucker,' but I know that I am, too. Mrs. Morel hates Miriam for this overbearing quality, but there's the clincher:I, too, hate the people who try to suck the souls of the people whose 'souls' I want.In less ridiculous language, Lawrence uses the relationship between Miriam and Paul to lay the inevitable facts about human jealousy and possessiveness in front of our eyes. We all have thoughts, desires, and jealousies so 'embarrassing' or so shameful that we won't even voice them in our mind's ear. These are the thoughts that will make us weak or despicable if we acknowledge or accept them. Lawrence makes these hidden thoughts and feelings a part of his writing style. When he describes his characters, you'd better BELIEVE he describes them. He leaves nothing out. They are weak, stupid, good, beautiful, and hopeless. I hate to seeing myself in his characters just as much as I hate being like them.Nearly all of Lawrence's works are like this, it is true, but this was the first of them that really slapped me in the face and made me see myself (and most likely everyone else) for what I really am.It's a good book. Very powerful, sad, embarrassing, and dangerous. Everyone should read it."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"Because this book deals with the timeless feelings of love, obsession, and vulnerablity, it doesn't feel outdated, even though it's set in a time period much different from the current one. Especially interesting is Paul's relationship with Miriam, and how he becomes angry that she is trying to consume his soul--but at the same time, he says that he is looking for a woman who can belong to him. It seems like a double standard, but Paul is so obviously dysfuctional that as a reader, I could easily excuse it. DH Lawrence did a great job of making the content of the book flow well. When I got to the end, I could just feel that he was going to have to work Miriam back into the story somehow--and sure enough he did. And I think that as a reader, when I am able to anticipate what the writer has left to say, that is really a great statement about the ability of the writer to bring his readers to the same line of thought about the characters and the plot that he has. And something that I especially enjoyed about this book is that it is almost entirely dialogue, and it doesn't spend pages describing the scenery and such. So if that's something you like too, then you will probably enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"Sons &amp; Lovers is by far one of the most insightful books I have read, following the story of a working-class family in early 19th century Nottinghamshire. It focuses on the second son of the aptly named Morel family, and his life and relationships within it. It is largely written from a psychological point of view, but it's lengthy description can drag on. An excellent book following the relationship between mother and son, the over-shadowing power of maternal influence, and although the chapters are hard work, the effect is strong and this book is definately a good read.It may be stuck in its time of writing, but a brilliant reflection of pre-World War One lower class life. An excellent read."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"D.H. Lawrence was a guy that came out of the womb knowing how to write. You read his prose and his innate genius quickly becomes self-evident--this is an artist for whom the creative act of literature is akin to a Mozart symphony--airtight, beautiful, logical, NATURAL. Floooooowing.Compare Lawrence with someone like Wallace Stegner--the latter being a writer with a fair amount of talent and a heckuva lot of dedication...but whose works seem...synthetic. Over-written, almost. As if he would look at a sentence and say, \\"This needs another adjective here--and a polysyllabic synonym for this word here.\\"With Lawrence, there is no sense of writerly straaaaaaining for profundity...no sense of sweaty self-consciousness. The sentences seemingly emanate from the ether, with a fundamental soundness and beauty which only a tiny, tiny few lucky people are capable of creating.Stegner could study the craft of writing for thirty years and still produce an inferior book to the twenty-seven-year-old Lawrence's Sons and Lovers. Lawrence had IT. He was the real deal. The genuine article. He WAS Mozart (Stegner was you-know-who).Sons and Lovers is a masterpiece. Not without its flaws, surely, but a masterpiece all the same. Some parts drag; some parts are choppy; some parts are frankly uninteresting. Notwithstanding that, it is just a single rung below Lolita and Under the Volcano in terms of quality.The MLA concluded that Sons and Lovers is the ninth best novel of the 20th century--and it's hard to quibble with that assessment. (Even though it is ranked AHEAD of the supernally brilliant--and better--Under the Volcano.)If you are a serious connoisseur of literature, this is one you have to get under the belt."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"SONS AND LOVERS was first published in 1913. It's the story of Paul Morel, a gifted artist. Paul is one of four children born to Walter and Gertrude Morel. The others are Edward, the oldest, Annie, and Arthur the baby.Walter Morel, a miner by trade was most attracted to Gertrude Coppard because she was a lady. Gertrude in turn thought that Walter was quite handsome and would be a good provider; however, over the years the couple become estranged from each other over Walter's drinking and brutish behavior. In their many arguments, Gertrude insisted on telling her husband off and usually won the verbal disputes, but was often physically abused. The four children all seemed to adore their mother and saw that her life was hard. They rallied around her as much as possible. They feared their father and keep their distance from him.The boys, Edward and Paul were the most protective of their mother. Edward, the elder son, was very bright and acquired an excellent position in London. He initially sent money home, but when he became involved with a woman, he spent every cent on her in trying to win her love. The woman was really undeserving of Edward's love and things went from bad to worse.Paul also tried to look out for his mother as much as possible. He found Miriam, a girl to love, but put off a proposal and marriage for years. He knew his mother did not care for the young woman and at first tried to overlook his mother's dislike of his girlfriend, but was not able to cope with the situation. His second relationship was with Clara, a married woman, but again, Paul could not completely give of himself.I really liked the way that Lawrence drew his literary portrait of what life was like for the family of a miner. It was interesting to observe the dynamics of the children and how they related to each parent. The home life was detailed as were their amusements and community life.Initially, I was not sure that I would like this book, but with each page that I read, I became more and more involved in the story. It was an excellent read and shows how manipulative a mother can be in controlling her children. The psychological hold that she had on her sons was something that they were not able to break. It also shows how influenced we can be by the interaction between our own parents."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"The main character in his many bouts with love, combatted by his intense lust for individualism and desire to be a world unto himself, could not overcome himself and therefore, with a conquistador's view of love, failed miserably at love's aquisition. He could not however create himself as an all emcompassing world, he search for satisfaction, and his realization that he could only love himself consequently chained him to himself.This book made me think more than most, but neglected to make me feel. Dostoevski is a poor writer, but suceeds in making one 'feel' rather intensely, like Hemmingway said. However, Lawrence, though a bit tedious and repetitive at times, makes you almost one with the character in their intellectual battle with themself, but not in their battle with emotions. I felt detached from Paul's emotions. I felt detached from his mother's, even though she was her emotions. Lawrence writes a great deal better than most of his contemporaries, and its a wretched pity that he still could not synthesize thought and emotion like only a few have done."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"Has any literary reputation (maybe Hemingway's) fallen like Lawrence's has? In my parents old set of encyclopedias, c. 1950, his entry was a paragraph long. In the 1970 Ency. Brtit. it was pages long. He was suddenly on par with Joyce... When I went through school I caught the very tail end of this mass admiration for Lawrence. It was a strange admiration too, mostly male critics gone overboard, calling such juvenile drivel as Lady Chatterly great literature and whatnot. I read practically all of Lawrences works, no mean feat, because the man wrote like a banshee. I also read the bios and the Letters... And I've come to the conclusion that Lawrence wrote one beautiful novel and that's it: Sons and Lovers. That Lawrence later disliked the novel is interesting because it evidently ran afoul of his ludicrous philosphy of life (and that so many intelligent British men at that time were taken with such nonsense is a bit disturbing and quite funny; I can't think of any woman infatuated with with his loopy ideas). This novel is written in beautiful prose and it evokes an England that no longer exists; nothing else that Lawrence attempted comes close to the beauty in this novel... Some of his earlier, short stories and novellas do, but they are few and far between.T.S. Eliot once said that Henry James had a mind so fine that no idea could violate it. Lawrence is an example of the absolute opposite: of a writer getting so carried away with his ideas that the art starts to suffer. He's like Tolstoy (but on a vastly smaller scale) in that he had to propagandize his ideas at every little turn... But Sons and Lovers is definitely worth the reputation that it has had all along."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"I have long been interested in the work of D. H. Lawrence. His reputation as one of the greatest novelists of the past one hundred years, as well as the censorship battles at the turn of the last century which led to some of his works being banned in England until the 1960's were all reasons which led me, finally, to read him. I started with Sons and Lovers, which was originally published in 1913.Sons and Lovers takes place in Nottingham near the coalfields. Paul Morel is one of three \\"sons\\" in the story and Miriam, Mrs. Clara Dawes as well as Paul's mother, Mrs. Gertrude Morel are all the \\"lovers\\". Mrs. Morel is married to a husband who pays her no attention, and who would rather go out all night drinking. She is thus devoted to her two oldest boys, William and Paul, and from an early age they are coddled to excess. They develop into mama's boys who cannot make any decision without thinking of the effect it would have on their mother. When William dies after a brief illness, Mrs. Morel becomes almost frightfully attached to Paul, and their exchanges seem incestuous with the terms of endearment they use. Paul's feelings towards his mother seem nothing less than Oedipean. The tender words exchanged between mother and son are far more passionate than the dialogue between either of Paul's lovers, Miriam or Clara. Since I had not read about the plot of Sons and Lovers before I started the novel, I did not know if mother and son would develop a sexual relationship. It certainly seemed plausible by their dialogue. Since Paul confesses to his mother, as well as to his two lovers, that he can never marry them (and they soon figure out why) it is not far-fetched to imagine that possibility.There is much passion in the story and the sex that takes place is subdued and not even written about in euphemism. Quite abruptly the younger characters turn on their lovers and Sons and Lovers suffers, in my opinion, from an overabundance of phrases such as \\"She hated him for it\\" or other such phrases using \\"detest\\" in its place. One minuscule fly in the ointment of sweet caresses might turn Miriam instantly against Paul with a phrase such as that. It grew tiresome to read that once again Paul \\"hates\\" Clara or that Miriam suddenly \\"detested\\" Paul.Clara Dawes is separated from her husband Baxter yet both see other people on the side. One hundred years ago it might have seemed scandalous for a British woman who was still legally married to be seen in public courting other gentlemen. Clara's mother, Mrs. Radford, was my favourite minor character in that she spoke like someone who has seen everything and wasn't afraid to call a spade a spade. She spoke her mind and provided comic relief. She was also likely a target for the censors of one hundred years ago for her degree of openness.I enjoyed Sons and Lovers for its descriptions of working-class England at the start of the 1900's. Lawrence writes some characters' dialogue in Nottingham dialect which fortunately was not difficult to decipher, despite the abundance of apostrophes and briticisms. Lawrence finds new ways to describe the countryside and flowers, coaly skies and hazy mornings. It was a delight to read his inventive descriptions for such dismal and dreary images. I plan to read more of Lawrence this year and thoroughly enjoyed Sons and Lovers."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"Well, I'm one of Amazon's cheaper customers: They'll never get rich off of me which is why I've been spending the last couple years reading Lawrence, Fitzgerald and Horatio Alger for free on my Kindle.I'm almost done with Sons and Lovers and have been enjoying every second of it. Unlike Fitzgerald, DH Lawrence writes about poor people masterfully: Every detail, from the texture and smell of the flowers to the wide spectrum of human emotions are masterfully spelled out. The characters are not obsessed with money, they are more concerned with getting on with life and immersing themselves in their social encounters. And they don't, for the most part, drink themselves into oblivion, although alcohol definitely can open the door to some interesting drama.I particularly enjoy how the characters will love each other in one moment and despise each other in the next, which is really the way it works in the real world. Lawrence, unlike many writers these days, gives the reader plenty of foreplay in his romantic encounters but, perhaps because of the mores of the day, barely lingers on the details of the actual sex act. He leaves much up to the imagination and if you happen to blink, you might miss out on something juicy, which is a refreshing change of pace from the soft porn that is littering the marketplace.I don't read romance novels so I'm not qualified to say whether this would fall into the category of romance, however. The writing reads so effortlessly and the details are sketched like a masterpiece in an art museum. I really don't know what to call this book except great and I can't wait to sink my teeth into more of Lawrence's writing."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"This book follows the life of the Morel family, and takes a close look at the close mother-son relationship.

Paul lives a fairly regular, if a little sickly, childhood and goes to work at the early age of 14. As he grows older, he finds the intense love he feels for his mother drawn away from her, first by the timid and Romantic (with a capital R) Miriam, and later by a suffragette named Clara Dawes. Throughout the entire novel, Paul and his mother share an intense, sometimes to the point of discomfort, relationship that plays heavily into the very dramatic conclusion of the novel. Beautifully crafted and wonderfully descriptive, Sons and Lovers is a wonderful novel and is sure to appeal to a broad audience."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"This is one of Lawrence's more famous works and it is about a young man who grows up in a poor English family, just as Lawrence did himself.One can start by quoting another writer: \\"Sons and Lovers was the first modern portrayal of a phenomenon that later, thanks to Freud, became easily recognizable as the Oedipus complex. Never was a son more indentured to his mother's love and full of hatred for his father than Paul Morel.\\"The novel is semi-autobiographical and it is the story of how one son struggles to break free of his mother\`s emotional grasps. The mother is in an unhappy marriage to a coal miner in western England around 1900. She has three sons but she has the strongest attachment to her middle son, and she tries to transfer her hopes and expectations to him.Without giving away the plot, it is the story of the middle son trying to find his way in life. The story seems very realistic and believable and has many twists and turns as the middle son, Paul, moves away from home. In the novel he attempts to reconcile his various relationships with different women, one from his youth, and another with an attractive married woman.When the book came out, it was considered to be on the edge of the censors boundaries, especially in America. Bellow and other writers in the 20th century considered the work of Lawrence to be somewhat groundbreaking in the develoment of realism and in the descriptions of passionate love scenes and human desires.It is an excellent novel and well worth the read.As side note, I read this at about the same time that I read James's \\"Portrait of a Lady\\" and I thought they were both outstanding reads."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"The words beautiful, slightly twisted and tragic embody Paul's inability to love other women as he loves his mother in Sons and Lovers.

This book is also a study in the shifting narrative technique; he is a pioneer and the bridge between the conventional pre-20th century omniscient narrative and authors such as Joyce and Woolf, where the very storyline consists of jumps between the personal emotions and opinions of the various characters of a novel. DH Lawrence is proof that quality literature with a distinct sexual edge CAN be produced. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"Few novels by any author have ever been examined under the microscope of autobiography more thoroughly than SONS AND LOVERS. Nearly every character represents someone from the life of its author D. H. Lawrence, who clearly has used himself as a model for the protagonist, Paul Morel. To complicate matters there is a well-documented undercurrent of the Oedipal Complex between Paul and his mother Gertrude (also the name of Hamlet's mother who was linked to Hamlet in the same potentially incestuous way). Lawrence was later to deny ever having read Freud but his much older wife Frieda (a dead ringer for Gertrude) has written in her memoirs that she had several discussions with Lawrence about just that theory.Gertrude, a pretty woman of twenty-three marries a handsome, virile, but loutish man named Walter. Their marriage is unhappy since he drinks, is abusive, and has nothing in common with his wife. They have four children of whom Paul is the focus of dramatic interest. He is artistic, sensitive, and hates how his father treats Gertrude. She in turn lavishes on him all the love that might otherwise have gone to Walter. As Paul matures, he meets two women of consequence: the virginal and puritanical Miriam and the earthy and sexually aggressive Clara. Gertrude approves of Clara but disapproves of Miriam. From an Oedipal perspective, Miriam is a threat to Gertrude's primacy over Paul while Miriam as a floozy is not. Paul has an extended affair with Clara that she breaks off when her husband re-enters the picture and beats the crap out of Paul. Paul has a single sexual contact with Miriam, knowing that she would find it most distasteful, so he breaks off this relationship. Gertrude dies of cancer with a push from Paul. Walter becomes a cripple and drifts out of Paul's life. Paul devotes his life to his art as the book ends. All of these characters relate to Paul in ways that are at best weird and at worst ugly to contemplate. As Gertrude smothers Paul with a misplaced affection, she makes sure, perhaps unknowingly--we are not sure, that he will have difficulty relating his own burgeoning sexuality with any other woman. Miriam, in her sexlessness, is a Gertrude surrogate that Paul can feel comfortable with so long as they do not achieve intimacy. Clara is the chippie that Paul can show physical affection toward only so long as he does not show emotional intimacy. It is no surprise that both relationships turn out badly. Walter, who starts out as the Bad Guy, slowly accrues the sympathy of the reader as he has a positive side that even the confused Paul can see.SONS AND LOVERS may be full of a constant undercurrent of sexual energies running at cross purposes, but it is not necessary to see the book only or even mostly in terms of seeing a twisted Oedipus to enjoy reading it. There are other non-sexual themes at work that engage the reader. Lawrence was upset over the slow disintegration of English society caused by an encroaching industrialism that he saw as crushing the human spirit. Whether one chooses to see SONS AND LOVERS under a sociological or a sexual lens is a matter of personal taste. Lawrence, who was an advocate of freedom of choice, would certainly agree."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"Not even close to Lady Chatterley's Lover. I was expecting more from this novel. Paul Morel loves his mother. He is the ultimate oedipal mama's boy. So much so that he can't marry his true love Miriam. So instead he hates her for creating a conflict that takes him away from mom. Then he has a purely sexual relationship with Clara... At the end of the novel, Paul's coming of age comes to its climax. What will he do as a man??? (move forward or die-- I won't give it away) He makes up his mind in one sentence, and it's a little too Hollywood-ish to believe. But then this is not 1913.This novel is supremely dated. Read it if you want to check off classics, but don't expect transcendant brilliant ideas to come across from the early 20th C. If you haven't read Lady C, do so first."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"Sons and Lovers is D.H. Lawrence's highly autobiographical novel of the early years of a young man's life in mid-nineteenth century England. As such, the book is very intense emotionally, as Lawrence seems to convey his own strong feelings about his family into his characters. One result of this exaggerated level of emotions is a constant state of tension and unreality. A simple scene becomes a moment of high drama and the constant repetition of such scenes eventually dulls the reader to those moments of genuine crisis.The book begins with the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Morel. Gertrude is an educated, sensitive woman who marries Walter because of his physical appearance and charming personality. She also believes, falsely as it turns out, that he does not drink and is the owner of this own house. Mr. Morel is a miner and the family lives in \\"The Bottoms,\\" a hardscrabble mining community. It soon becomes clear that he cannot cope with the responsibility of raising a family that grows to four children. In response he turns to drink and abusive language (although no real violence) toward his family, and especially toward his wife. Throughout the book Walter is portrayed, not as an evil man, but as one defeated by life. His family comes to despise him and at the same time love him, depending on his moods and behavior.William, the first child, is athletic and intelligent. He grows to manhood early in the book and leaves to go to London to seek his fortune, but comes to a tragic end. The second child, Annie, has only a modest role in the novel as benefits a book with this title. Paul, the third child, is the main character and Lawrence's alter ego. Unlike his siblings, Paul is sickly and unathletic, and he and Mrs. Morel develop a strong attachment for each other that carries throughout the book. The final child, Arthur, also plays a minor role in the plot.The book is divided into two parts; the first largely concerned with the early years of the Morel family and the second with Paul and his love affairs. As a teenager he meets Miriam, a young girl on a nearby farm. Paul develops a fondness for the whole family and he and Miriam become entangled romantically and the understanding is that they will marry some day. But neither Paul nor Miriam can make a sufficient commitment to this idea and even when Miriam finally does so Paul is incapable of a similar response. At this point an older woman, Clara Dawes, comes into Paul's life. She is married to Baxter Dawes, a brutish man from whom she is separated. Paul is attracted to her physically and they begin an adulterous relationship. But again Paul has difficulty sustaining a mature relationship and is constantly torn between his love for (and even dependence on) his mother and his wish for a mature and stable relationship with a woman.The novel is also infused with a heavy dose of religion. Miriam in particular, is described as highly religious and even derogatively referred to as a nun. The religion view that sex is something dirty is also evident.It would help, given the nature of the book, to read a biography of Lawrence before tackling this novel. Many of the characters in the novel act in dysfunctional ways and the reader wonders how much of their behavior is a reflection of Lawrence's own life experiences.It is difficult for me to rate this book much above three stars because of the depressing tone and unrealistic behaviors of the characters. One wants to say to Lawrence, \\"get some psychological help before writing about your life!\\" On the other hand it is a fascinating story written by one of the outstanding English writers of the nineteenth century. It is not his best work, but still quite good in many respects."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"I attempted to read this book twice years ago. I failed to finish each time, finding the novel laborious. Now, married and with children, I have read through this book eagerly. It is perhaps a half-lifetime of experience that has allowed me to see this story in a different light. The examination of Paul Morel's emotionally incestuous relationship with his mother and the way it cripples his love for other women is insightful. My Barnes and Nobles version of this book (I put this review under this version since it is the most popular) has a contemporaneous review (Lascelles Abercrombie, Manchester Guardian, July 2, 1913) that assesses this book much better than I can:\\"Indeed, you do not realize how astonishingly interesting the whole book is until you find yourself protesting that this thing or that bores you, and eagerly reading on in spite of your protestations...You think you are reading through an unimportant scene; and then find that it has burnt itself on your mind.\\"This book has truly burnt itself on my mind, and I am glad that I came back to it."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"While \\"Sons and Lovers\\" would not be a best seller if it was written by a current day author, it was, for its times, quite controversial and forward-leaning and should always be considered one of fiction's classics. On its published date, 1914, the world was enamored with Freud's Oedipal fixation and found itself newly-awoken to the sexual side of humanity. Before this era, sexuality was either repressed or made a separate entity away from emotional caring. D.H. Lawrence relit the 'Oedipal candle' and the mother/son controversy went on. While neither Freud nor Lawrence ever fully understood their own sexuality, let alone that of others, this piece of autobiographical fiction allowed society to continue in its personal understanding of its physical self.While I fully agree with other critics that the main thrust of this novel is the interaction of mother and son, I also feel there is much more that can be psychosocially understood from its reading. The mother, in today's terminology was a narcissist. All of her actions throughout this tale are directed back towards herself and her own happiness. She married a very handsome and well-built man because she mistakenly thought that he owned the house in which he was living and that he could provide for her in the manner in which she felt she deserved. When this proved false and her plans became futile, she turned her selfish need for personal fulfillment towards her sons. She felt that it was their duty, and not their choice, to make her happy. Throughout the novel Paul, the younger of the two, is left with this onerous and suffacating burden. In very short order he, too, changes his need structure to rely on her for his recognition and fulfillment. But, his mother being a narcissist, she can never provide this in a mature and caring manner. Instead, she does so in a self-devised and incomplete manner making Paul to always wanting more and more and never feeling complete. He, in turn, was never able to fulfill her insatiable needs of attention and personal fulfillment. Neither person took any responsibility for their own actions or their own psyche and, because of that, eventually developed a love/hate relationship with each other. This is dramatically shown in the fact that Paul, while continuing to profess his love and caring for her, actually murders his mother while she lie on her death bed.In social situations the damage that Paul suffered at the hands of his mother, were generalized into the rest of his life. His work was never fulfilling, his love/hate relationship with his mother translated into an approach/avoidance behavior with women and his ultimate goals in life continued to focus on what would make his mother happy with little or no concern for himself. Because his mother had never equated her sexual life with any type of caring or emotion, Paul, too, made a divide between sex and love and often mistakenly confused one with the other. He never allowed himself to feel both together or, for that matter, had the capability to do so. The women in Paul's life had their own irrational agendas. One sacrificed her life while waiting for Paul to eventually admit his love for her and the other lived her life based solely on her own selfish and ego driven emotions while leaving rational thought unheeded. The author, if this truly is his autobiographical sketch, certainly lived and most probably died a very lonely and disturbed life. He never made the effort nor probably never had the emotional strength to understand himself as an independent being apart from the maternal demands that were continually laid at his feet.While the subject of this book does merit 5 stars, I only gave it 4 stars because of the rambling and diffuse writing that occurs in the first half of the book. Yes, I understand that the author himself viewed life as a rambling and purposeless process but we, as readers. do not need to re-experience his self-confusion in order to fully understand it. We, too, have our own life experiences from which we can draw and do not need our hands held while we come to understand the author's internal insecurities. Nor do we need to have the various derivatives of the work 'hate' be used in nearly every paragraph in order to understand the love/hate relationship that the author had with everything around him. We, too, have a degree of intelligence that can comprehend intense negative feelings directed towards the world."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"In what is considered to be D. H. Lawrence's most autobiographical novel, Lawrence's main character, Paul Morel, is a frail, artistic boy, having more in common with his mother than with his coal miner father. His mother had had some education before she married the once-attractive Walter Morel, but he eventually succumbed to alcohol and his bleak life in the pits. When Paul's older brother, who became the mainstay of the family, left for London and later died, his mother transferred her dependence from him to Paul.Written in 1913, the novel was shocking at the time, dealing as it does with an unhealthy relationship between mother and son, leading to the son's subsequent inability to love women his own age. Having only scorn for her wayward and irresponsible husband, his mother needs Paul for emotional support. When Paul begins to develop a love for Miriam Lievers, a neighbor with whom he has been close friends since childhood, his mother becomes even more possessive. A \\"spiritual\\" girl, Paul comes to believe that even though Miriam has \\"given\\" herself to him, she does not love from an inner need, that at heart she is \\"a nun,\\" and that her passion is more dutiful than real. Since he himself is still tied to his mother, emotionally, his own ability to love fully is also compromised.His next relationship, with Clara Dawes, a married woman separated from her husband, is far more passionate, but Clara is also far more liberated than Miriam, and she demands an emotional commitment from him in return. It is not until his mother's death, however, that Paul realizes the extent to which his mother has truly controlled his heart and soul, leaving him far more bereft than is normal for loving sons.A novel which probes the inner psyche of Paul Morel, Sons and Lovers is a novel which speaks directly to the modern reader, eliciting both sympathy and empathy as Paul tries to become his own man. Lawrence's ability to tap into universal feelings and needs elevates this novel into a sensitive study of love in all its forms, not just in the case of Paul Morel, but on a deeper, grander scale. Though the novel is almost a hundred years old, it is as fresh and rewarding to read today as a contemporary novel, even when one considers the mores and prohibitions of that time period. Lawrence, ahead of his time, has created one of the enduring classics of English literature, one which supersedes time and place. n Mary WhippleWomen in Love: Cambridge Lawrence EditionLady Chatterley's Lover (Bantam Classics)The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd (Broadway Theatre Archive)"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"i approached this book reluctantly as i felt that it was far to detached from my current surroundings to have a note of relevance.

If you haven't read it do so!"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"This novel created considerable controversy, along with Freudian accusations of an Oedipal relationship between Paul the son and his mother Gertrude.D. H. Lawrence depicted the physical attraction between Paul and Clara in a very frank direct manner that was quite radical for the time. The tormenting uncertainty betweenPaul and Miriam, along with his strong attraction to Clara as compared to the mutual emotional dependency between him and his mother were understandably overwhelming to the public.It was very instructive to see how the absence of love in the mother's life led her to have an emotional dependency on one of her kids, only to switch to another son when she loses the first one. Portraying human narcissism through motherly love is a very shocking way of examining human nature. It was very interesting, as well, to see how the son was always torn between loving a woman and loving his mom, which are very different and incompatible emotions.Lawrence's honesty is very admirable considering the period in which the novel was written, and the unique way he described the son's decision while the mom is in pain on her death bed might raise some deep insight regarding this Author's vision. I, though, reject the possibility of a deep emotional thinker, and go with a merely honest portrayal of a pleasure worshipping male, who did not understand typical male desires as compared to typical human feelings.Lawrence had many admirers, including some smart/confused feminists, who thought of him as a great writer who portrayed quite accurately women's feelings. I, on the other hand, agree with the good writer part but sense in him shallowness and pure blind desire with a great dearth of complex analysis."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"This is really a book of psychological analysis. It's not exactly an autobiography but Lawrence makes a good deal self-eveluation of his childhood.When you read the novel you feel in an instant that someone who can describe human conditions that successfully,must have lived it all himself.Paul's excessive attachment to his mother and how his life became unbearable after her death shows the human helplessness.He tries over and over to LOVE someone other than his mother but each time he finds some missing part which is fullfilled by his mother. He really loves Miriam but somehow love also falls short to live happily-ever-after. When I first started the book I felt that the main character was Mrs.Morel. I was mistaken. Lawrence used all of the characters with nearly equal emphasis.Of course the leading one is Paul. On the other hand you take lots of things from other characters by his clear depiction. Paul,thus Lawrence, is a good psychologist.If you like to find your own thougts and feelings told by an author you should read Sons And Lovers.I finished it in a week."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"I suggested Sons and Lovers for our book club because it was on three respected \\"Top 100\\" book lists. We often read classics, so the club eagerly voted to include Sons and Lovers on our reading list.We all finished the book; but much to our surprise, we were unanimously disappointed. On a scale of 1 to 10, one person gave it a negative four. Ouch!The first 150 pages of the book are about Paul Morrell's youth and family life in a small coalmining town. This section is lively, interesting, vivid, and enjoyable. The second section of the book (the remaining 400 pages) is a study of Paul's obsession, frustration, and indecision about the women in his life. Reading it is like watching someone at a restaurant become very angry and emotional because he cannot make up his mind what to order; it is both boring and frustrating. Paul's constant vacillation between loving Miriam and then hating her (often both in the same sentence) eventually becomes laughable to the point of inviting parody.My book club agreed the book had potential, but the second section really lacked momentum. Paul's obsessions and indecision simply became boring.To his credit, Lawrence's prose is smooth, direct, and immediate. He is very much of the Modern tradition. The first section of the book was superb. I am certain I would have enjoyed the book much more if the second section were perhaps 100 pages shorter. I liked parts of Sons and Lovers enough that I'll try Lawrence again someday. But I can't really say I recommend this one."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"\\"Whatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of a world a mother's love is not.\\" James Joyce\\"Mama's gonna check out all your girl friends for you... Mama won't let anyone dirty get through... Mama's gonna wait up till you get in... Mama will always find out where you've been... Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean...\\" Lyrics from the song \\"Mother\\" by Roger Waters of \\"Pink Floyd\\"This rather abstract, deeply affecting autobiographical novel by D.H. Lawrence is sure to unearth a myriad of emotions and conceptions for most readers as it did for me. In fact, one could easily scribe a terse, ten page thesis on this one. Talk about a complex story filled with a group of complicated, and yet captivating characters, especially the two main characters - Paul Morel (based on D.H. Lawrence himself) and his possessive, yet extremely endearing mother Mrs. Gertrude Morel. Yes, as you have probably read in the other reviews, Freud would have loved this one, for it's a prime example of his Oedipus complex theory. However, to focus solely on that aspect of this story would be doing this masterpiece a grave injustice, for it is so much more than that. The abnormal and imperfect relationships of Lawrence's \\"Sons and Lovers\\" are among the most widely discussed and analyzed in English Literature. This is one of those novels that will keep you completely absorbed from the first chapter on to the very last page.The story takes place right around the turn-of-the-century in the small, rather poor, mining village of Bestwood, England (Bestwood actually based on Eastwood where Lawrence was born). All of the main characters (with the exception of Clara Dawes, who was a composite) are based on real people in Lawrence's early life. Essentially, Paul Morel's early life story is the story of D.H. Lawrence. Paul is one of four children of Mr. and Mrs. Morel, two people who are complete opposites of one another, with the former being an uneducated, uncouth, and extremely unsophisticated mineworker. Estranged from her husband early on in their marriage, Mrs. Morel decides to take comfort in her four children, particularly (after a family catastrophe that I will refrain from disclosing) her middle son Paul: \\"Wherever he went she felt her soul went with him. Whatever he did she felt her soul stood by him...\\" And to young Paul, completely alienated from his ogre father, his mother is his whole existence, by far and away \\"the strongest tie in his life\\". However, trouble soon awaits the pair as Paul begins his slow ascent into manhood.As Paul enters into his teens, and those hormones start kicking in, he soon falls deeply in love with the austere, esoteric, loner Miriam who lives on a farm not too far from Paul's home. For many years the two of them carry on an extremely intimate, but yet purely platonic relationship. An intimacy that leaves Paul confused and totally unfulfilled. His feelings for this all-consuming girl seesaw back and forth from love to hate. And of course, his mother far from approves, \\"she's not like an ordinary woman... she wants to absorb him... til there is nothing left of him, even for himself... she will suck him up\\" (the very definition of transference!) Of course, his mother's adverse opinion of Miriam proves to be one of the main reasons he chooses not to marry the girl.Paul's second love affair is with Mrs. Clara Dawes, a suffragette, who is currently separated from her troubled husband. She is introduced to Paul through Miriam, and at first the two become close friends (it is her sage advice which soon helps him end his frustrating, platonic relationship with Miriam). However, despite her being married and Paul's heart belonging to someone else, the two of them begin a passionate love affair. Of course this affair also leaves his mother very despondent and discouraged to say the least. And in the end, of course... well... I'll refrain from disclosing anything more.I know this is a rather long review, however I still think I could write for days about this one and even then not quite do it justice. D.H. writes with such detailed, flowery, and poignant prose. This novel is a unique, in-depth look inside of the artist himself. He very bravely sketches for us his true character, warts and all, and about all the events that made him what he was.Lastly, I've read several reviews bashing Mrs. Morel, but all in all, with what she had to work with, she seemed to do a relatively good job in raising her children. The majority of 'mama boys' I have known in my life usually are self-centered, egotistical, under-achieving, pompous jackasses. They are the type of guys who think that it's their planet, and the rest of us here are just visiting. Thankfully so, D.H. Lawrence did not turn out that way! Ergo, his mother had to do something right.In closing, all I have to say is - WHAT A MASTERPIECE!"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"This Kindle version is not the unexpurgated test first published by Cambridge University Press in 1992, It is the version extensively edited by Edward Garnett and first published in 1913, and omits approximately 100 pages of Lawrence's original manuscript. Garnett also made several editorial changes to make the text less controversial for the times. This was the only version available to readers for almost 80 years after it was written.&#34;Sons and Lovers&#34; is a semi-autobiographical novel in which the story's main protagonist, Paul Morel, struggles to maintain relationships with two female characters (Miriam and Clara) despite an almost Oedipian relationship with his mother, whose own disastrous marriage drives her to focus an abnormal amount of affection on her sons. Paradoxically he ends up killing his mother (out of kindness) rather than his father. Paul is a frustratingly complex individual and, for me, less than authentic. If this were not so evidently autobiographical I would be more skeptical. Lawrence himself, while the son of an essentially illiterate coal miner and a school teacher, attended Nottingham Grammar School and the University of Nottingham before becoming a teacher himself. His alter ego in the novel, Paul Morel, leaves school at the age of thirteen and becomes employed one year later, taking night school lessons and studying art. Despite his father and presumably his boyhood friends speaking in a thick East Midlands accent (although his mother does not) he seems to develop an almost unbelievably artiiculate manner of speech. Where does something like &#8220;Oh. You make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate&#8221; come from? It doesn&#8217;t ring true to me, although Lawrence himself was obviously very intelligent. Paul Morel lacks his education however.The seeming oversuse of the word &#34;hate&#34; throughout the text also puzzles me. As an example: &#34;And why did he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering then he hated her - and he easily hated her.&#34; And this is the girl he is supposedly falling in love with. Perhaps &#34;hate&#34; implied something different almost 100 years ago. Is this an example of semantic drift? I found it disturbing.Despite these minor irritations I did enjoy reading &#34;Sons and Lovers&#34; and immediately went on to read the unexpurgated version of &#34;Lady Chatterley's Lover&#34; which Lawrence wrote towards the end of his relatively short life while living in Italy. I found that to be a much more enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"Reading this book makes me want to have sex with my mother.

I think it's a good story, well-written, with conflict and drama. Lawrence creates a very real setting, a very real time period, and real characters who are in conflict over their wants and needs. The conflict between working class necessity (putting bread on the table) and middle class values (wanting the bread served on fine china set on lace tablecloths) reverberates throughout the story. I found it sad that the character (and, presumably, D.H. Lawrence himself) chose one parent and one set of values over another, though I do understand that he felt he had to do this in order to live a literary life. The characters in this story aren't exactly likable, though they aren't bad people. For me, this book succeeds because it paints a real portrait of different class values."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"My edition takes pains to make clear that Lawrence had not read Freud before he wrote this book, and was only slightly familiar with psychoanalytic theory when the novel was published. That makes it all the more interesting that Sons and Lovers is basically a case history of an Oedipal Complex. Also, Lawrence's alter-ego Paul comes across as a person who (as Lawrence would later say of himself)'tends to homosexuality' but there too it is unclear whether Lawrence realizes this or is revealing more than he means to. Generally the feeling is that of reading someone's most intimate diary, and wondering if he intended it for publication all along. And while the diarist is a pompous, annoying sort of a person, it's intriguing enough that you're inspired to keep going.As added fun while reading, play a game I'm calling Misogynist Bingo and see how many times in the book a female character 'bends', 'bows', or 'drops' her head, compared with how often a male character does.

Paul Morel is the central figure, whose life revolves around his struggle with his love of two women and his devotion to his mother. Sons and Lovers is at its core about the dehumanizing effects of the modern world. It is no longer possible to live in peace and harmony with ones environment.

The story revolves around the Morel family, a lower-middle class family living on the Nottingham coalfield. Initially, Lawrence vividly describes the hardships faced by Mrs. Morel in raising a family of three sons and a daughter while living from hand to mouth, in face of the frequent beatings delivered by an oft-drunk miner husband. For the larger part, he examines in detail the passionate relationship between Mrs. Morel and her second son, Paul. Disillusioned from her drunkard and temperamental husband and devastated by the death of her elder son, Mrs. Morel has high expectations from her second son, Paul. At the same time, Paul is torn between his duty towards his beloved mother, and his passion for the two other women in his life, Clara and Miriam. It is widely believed that through this novel, Lawrence has addressed the dynamics of his own complicated relationship with his mother, and has depicted the dilemma that faced him. D H Lawrence has masterfully handled the fragile subject of intimate relationships between loved ones. In my view, it is a definite must-read.

Somehow doing this usually means that most people emerge with a hatred of it but Lawrence's book is of such quality that it is able to survive.It is about a woman who marries a coal miner someone who is below her class. While he is young there is some joy in her life but as she grows older the class differences create a wall between them. She lives for her two male children who she tried to keep out of the mines and to ensure that they can live middle class lives. As she grows older the children become more important to her. The death of the oldest means that she suffocates the younger son with a love that affects his normal development.The story is told through the eyes of the younger son. There is little question that the novel is autobiographical and based on the early life of Lawrence. His life is almost identical to the events portrayed in the novel.Lawrence was a prolific novelist and short story reader but this work is probably his most accessible. His later novels tended to be more about peoples relationships but without the social content.Nowadays the class issues have receded a bit into the background. At the time of its publication the book would have been seen as revealing the divisions that operated in Britain. Most critics tend to focus on the relationship of Lawrence and his mother as the primary focus of the novel. To some extent this is true but the book is much more. It is a portrait of a society thankfully now gone. It is the portrait of a young man being propelled by his mother to escape his fathers destiny. Unlike Lawrence's other books which have tended to date this book is easy to read and still a classic."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"Emotional manipulation and possessiveness are at the core of this most intriguing novel. D.H. Lawrence's SONS AND LOVERS greets the reader with the author's elegant prose while systematically immersing the story in a swirling cloud of tangled dysfunction.Married to a drunken, rowdy coal miner in early 20th Century England, Gertrude Morel has neither a life nor a true love. Her only chance for happiness--as she sees it--is to live vicariously through her sons: first William, then Paul. Her subsequent possessiveness, her relentless interference in their lives, is smothering and destructive. When William dies, Gertrude devotes all of her attention--her manipulation--to Paul. Her son becomes a symbolic soulmate. . .lover. . .and Gertrude is unable to let him go to pursue his own relationships.Torn between his love for his mother and his guilt whenever he harbors feelings of affection for another woman, Paul is anything but a suitable suitor. He falls in love with Miriam, but his emotional dysfunction all but dooms the relationship--a relationship constantly sabotaged by his mother. Needing a physical outlet, he has a brief affair with a married woman, Clara Dawes, but even then, his love for and devotion to his mother prevails. As his mother's health fails, Paul's existence becomes even more problematic, culminating in a transcendent death.SONS AND LOVERS is not a &quot;feel good&quot; read, and Paul's inability to break free from the psychological bondage with his mother is frustrating and sometimes exasperating. Yet the true victim of this Lawrence classic is not Paul, but Miriam, who only wishes to love, and be loved in return. The man she has fallen in love with is incapable of such devotion: the tragic complexity of the story lingers long after this book has been put down.--D. Mikels"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"The story is brilliant. It is about how a woman (the mother, Gertrude) takes her son (Paul) as her lover instead of choosing her husband. She did not have the will to love the husband, and instead turned that will on a child. The title is not &quot;Fathers and Lovers&quot; or &quot;Husbands and Lovers.&quot; The father is capable of being loved, but in Gertrude's mind, she is too good for the husband. Therefore, she turns her lover's heart towards a child (&quot;Sons and Lovers&quot;). In modern psychobabble, Gertrude doesn't recognize boundaries. The child is defenseless to the emotional power which penetrates him. He is absorbed and becomes one with the mother's heart and goals. It is similar to molestation but instead of a physical penetration, there is an emotional penetration. When the boy starts to grow up and should, rightly, begin to become whole with a woman, he is not free to take that step. His sexuality drives him towards an appropriate lover, and seemingly makes him appear available, but his emotional heart cannot take another woman into himself. There is already a lover who has penetrated his heart (i.e. his mother). For a man to be complete in love, he has to be able to enter a woman physically at the same time he takes her into himself emotionally. Paul can't allow another woman in emotionally because his mother is already there. Hence, even though he is able to enter a woman physically, the whole experience is deeply unsatisfying to both Paul and all the women in his life. The mother is not really satisfied because she can't have her lover completely (i.e. physically and as her life's mate), and the other women in Paul's life (with whom he could have a physical relationship) are left unsatisfied because he wills not to take them into himself emotionally, and thereby deprives these women of the experience of wholeness which accompanies surrender in love. Hence, the women he should be able to complete himself with (i.e. those with whom he can complete the physical act), he eventually wears out. They give up because he is not available. His heart belongs to another. E.g. Claire goes back to her husband even though Claire's husband is less refined, because Claire would rather have all of a working man, than only part of an artist. There are scads of women today who are throwing themselves at this inpenetrable wall of the mother's inappropriate molestation of her son's emotions, not really understanding why and how to work with it. Lawrence sheds insight into that process. The cure is to exchange the will to love the mother for the will to love the lover. Go for it!"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"This work by D.H. Lawrence was rated number 9 on the top 100 list, and I think it's a fair rating. Sons and Lovers is a beautifully written and intricately drawn story of a young man. This actually serves as a pseudo autobiography as it mirrors DHL's life rather closely. There is a quality to this work that you do not find in contemporary novels. The characters are developed to an incredible depth and with great skill and precision. You find after reading this book that you feel you know some of the characters better than your neighbors. This is not a book about action or drama, it is about life. The focus here is not on the storyline, but on the people involved in it. As opposed to today's authors, Lawrence uses the storyline to define the character and personality of the participants. I think this book is so well written that it can make you look at your own friends and family and understand how little you really know of them. Many scholars talk about the idea of Lawrence introducing the Oedipal complex, but it's not really what this book is all about. While that psychiatrical phenomenon is a component of this work, the defining quality of this work is really about Lawrence's ability to capture the people in his story as eloquently and with such detail as he has. If you can appreciate good literature, this book is a must read for you."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"This story of the Morel family begins with a dramatic portrayal of the effect industrialization has on human lives. Mr. Morel, a coal miner in turn-of-the-century Britain, lives a life of drudgery, anger and desperation. He takes his frustrations out on his wife Gertrude, while the real source of his unhappiness is his own low self-esteem. Gertrude is embittered by his hardness and so looks to her sons to fill all her emotional needs. This constitutes Part One of the novel, which to this reviewer's taste is the more satisfying section. The detailed descriptions of the arguments and even outright fights between the married couple are as powerful as anything in fiction, and bleakly dramatize how poverty can destroy the very hearts and souls of the working classes. Morel is oppressed by his employer, so he in turn oppresses his wife, who emotionally smothers her sons. Fight the power!All of which is what makes Part Two such a disappointment. The entire second half of the book revolves around the second son, Paul, and how his closeness to his mother makes it impossible for him to engage in satisfactory relationships with other women. Miriam, the milquetoast who yearns for a transcendent, spiritual love, cares for Paul so much that she lets him walk all over her. The much tougher and independent Clara introduces Paul to a more physically satisfying relationship, but neither of them has any real attachment to the other. The weakness of this second half is not just that it all seems to take far too long; it's that over time, the characters become very unsympathetic. None of them have the strength of will to break away from their failing relationships, despite the fact that these failures cast dark shadows across their lives. And there's certainly nothing tragic about these young people mooning about, complaining that their relationships aren't what they'd like them to be; most especially in the context of Part One, which reminds us that there are people in this world who are really suffering.Readers who are deeply interested in the internal subtleties of male-female relationships (and this probably includes a majority of young women) will love this book. If the two parts were published separately, this reviewer would unhesitatingly give Part One five stars, while grudgingly giving Part Two three and a half. For Mama's boys (and those who've seriously dated them) this book certainly rates five stars, but others will find these characters so annoying that even four stars may seem generous."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"This is probably the most autobiographical of Lawrence's novels, dealing with the childhood, adolescence and early adulthood of the author. It is a brutally frank portrayal of the relationship betweem a domineering mother and the younger (and surviving) son, a relationship that colors every aspect of the protagonist's life, from his relationship with his father to his romantic relationships with two very different women. Lawrence paints this portrait with very fine brush strokes: an attention to descriptive detail and some of the best characterization in modern English literature. Although the reader might not like the characters in the novel, there is no doubt that these are real people - especially the mother, Mrs. Morel. The setting of the novel is the coal fields of Nottingham and Lawrence carries on the work begun by Thomas Hardy in writing of the English working class with realism and detachment, eschewing the English literary tendency to moralize and to judge.When Lawrence began the novel he had only passing knowledge of the theories of Freud regarding the mother-son relationship that became the backbone of the psychologist's Oedipus Complex. Essentially the author was writing from experience: the psychic bond between Mrs. Morel and her son, Paul, was very similar to the bond shared by Lawrence and his mother. This bond between son and mother amounts almost to a husband and wife sort of love - without the sex - and prevents the son from ever achieving a fully satisfactory relationship with another woman because of the hold the mother has on the son's soul. It is not until the mother is dead that the son is able to begin to free himself from her hold. The novel, then, is the story of that struggle.I have never been a great fan of Lawrence's literary style, finding it a bit too jerky and over edited - a criticism I find with this novel. True, there are passages of poetic beauty (especially some of the descriptions of the Nottinghamshire countryside) but I found the prose a bit too tedious and lacking spontaneity. This is probably Lawrence's best novel (far superior to the more popular Lady Chatterley's Lover) and the one on which his reputation is firmly based; also, a novel that should be read by every mother and every son."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"I read this a long time ago and hated it with a passion.

This time, I was so moved by certain sections my tears were falling on the page, and it took me only a week (or maybe it was six days) to finish.

After a while, I was able to figure it out myself, and that was kind of fun -- almost like learning a new language."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"D.H. Lawrence is a beautiful writer that goes deep into the human mind and soul to write. He is never satisfied with meer fiction, with mediocre descriptions or with plain verse. Lawrence loves to pick the mind and sexuality of both males and females. His books, though called dirty and shameful, interpret the minds of lustful and questioning young adults in a way that makes love and sex accepting and wonderful.Sons and Lovers can be considered Lawrences autobiography, because of the events and places that were used in the book resemble much of the writer's own life. It gives, therefore, an interpretation of how close Lawrence and his mother really were. D.H. Lawrence has written a woman's thoughts better than many female writers have and spectics have always guessed that he has been able to understand women so well because of his mother's raising. This book will give proof to this idea. Lawrence is very vulnerable here because he not only exposes himself as the son, but also inevitable as the lover.I loved this book not only for it's intuition, but also for it's ability to keep me entertained and excited throughout the events of the lives of the characters. Again, D.H. Lawrence is taking his place as one of my favorite authors of all time!"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"Sons and Lovers by D. H. Lawrence. Recommended.Sons and Lovers is said to be the most autobiographical of D. H. Lawrence's novels; according to the introduction by Benjamin DeMott, some critics have found it too flatly so. Like the protagonist Paul Morel, Lawrence was born to a coal miner and a woman who has married beneath her class, and his older brother died young, DeMott notes. Many other details coincide as well.Unlike some of Lawrence's other works, such as Women in Love, in which Lawrence explores lofty themes in a philosophical and often grim tone, Sons and Lovers is as down to earth as Paul's rough, violent, yet congenial father Walter. Despite his many apparent and iterated flaws, Walter Morel is shown as a whole person rather than a fictional creation, with a gentle, content, industrious side, at least when he's sober. Perhaps his \\"smallness\\" is a function of where he is and who he is expected to be rather than who he could be. He's so tied to his lot in life, the mining life, that it never occurs to him that his more gifted sons could aspire to more. That they achieve more is a source of both pride and derision for Walter Morel. Although Walter is a background character (to both reader and to the Morel family), it is he, \\"an outsider,\\" who forges the bond between Gertrude Morel and her sons, first William, then Paul.Gertrude Morel is not the first woman to try to live her life through her children, but her hold over her sons dooms their relationships with other women to failure and leaves them deeply unsatisfied and unhappy. Her motivations may be questionable, but she is sometimes right. William's fianc&eacute;e Lily would have cost him dearly, emotionally and financially, had he lived to marry her, and Mrs. Morel sees her own mistake of a marriage in his future. Although she makes her beliefs known, she seems willing to let William make his decision and suffer the consequences.Having learned from the experience with William, Mrs. Morel takes a different approach with Paul, who seems to be her last, best hope for justifying her own life. Her relationship with Paul becomes overtly sexual. When they go out together, they behave like lovers on a date. \\"He stroked his mother's hair, and his mouth was on her throat.\\" When Paul tells his mother that he doesn't love Miriam (how can he?), she \\"kissed him in a long, fervent kiss. 'My boy!' she said, in a voice trembling with passionate love. Without knowing, he gently stroked her face.\\"It would be too easy to attribute all this to an Oedipal complex, but it is more complicated, as life is. Paul serves as Mrs. Morel's alter ego, pseudo-lover, and breadwinner. Everything she did not or cannot have must be Paul's. She is savvy enough to know who is a threat to her hold and who is not. She recognises in Miriam a woman much like herself-intelligent, thwarted, let down by men, hungry for a kindred spirit or soul mate. Paul, too, is aware of this and hates Miriam for it-and for the fact he does, indeed, love her, making him unfaithful to the woman to whom he owes his fidelity. There are spiritual overtones as well, as the religious Miriam tries to sacrifice herself for Paul, whom she sees as a \\"Walter Scott hero.\\" This sacrifice repels Paul ever further.Mrs. Morel rightly perceives that Clara Dawes is not a threat to her-she is fascinating, attractive, enigmatic, and sensual, but she lacks the ability to be more to Paul than a diversion from Miriam, Mom, and himself. Knowing that nothing of importance will come of this affair, Mrs. Morel even encourages it. It cannot divert Paul from her, and it fails as a result.In the end, the only intimacy Paul is capable of is with his mother. She has come between him and his own consciousness-and he has allowed her. Everything is filtered through her. How she has achieved this is not always clear, as she uses more than rhetoric and conscious effort to mold Paul. When he wishes her dead, there is hope that then he would begin to live. \\"Mother!\\" he whimpered. \\"Mother!\\" Then: \\"He would not take that direction, to the darkness, to follow her.\\" With the past buried, there may be a future for him. Only Lawrence knew as he wrote this most human of his novels..."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"In D.H. Lawrence's &quot;Sons and Lovers,&quot; the Morel family lives in a coal mining village in late 19th Century rural England; the father Walter is a coal miner who comes home drunk every night and fights, often physically, with his wife and children. Unable to control her husband's unruliness, Mrs. Morel directs her affection to her three sons, instigating them to turn against their father. Her love for her sons is not merely maternal, but so possessive that she gets jealous when the boys focus their attention on the neighborhood girls, whom she treats with haughty condescension.Paul, the middle son, is Lawrence's alter ego. He aspires to be an artist but works as a clerk in a surgical appliance factory to bring money home to the family. When his older brother William dies of pneumonia, Paul replaces him as the primary object of his mother's affections. At times their mutual endearment is so extreme and smothering that it's downright creepy, such as when she embraces Paul and tells him that she never &quot;really&quot; had a husband, implying that Paul somehow must act as a spousal surrogate.Paul starts a shy relationship with a girl named Miriam, but his mother's guilt trip prevents him from making a full commitment. Eventually he turns his interest to an older woman, Clara Dawes, who works in his factory and is separated from her husband. As opposed to the clingy, sensitive, virginal Miriam, Clara is liberated, proud, aloof, sexually passionate, and generally distrustful of men. Her husband, who also works in the factory, is a loose cannon and tries violently to intimidate Paul.Paul's relationships with Miriam and Clara are full of tension and antagonism. He unleashes on the women the hostilities that he had stored subconsciously against his mother, criticizing them for faults displayed by Mrs. Morel and not their own. It is ironic that his mother dies from cancer, since Paul realizes that his mother's cancerous influence on him lingers even after her death.Lawrence's motive in writing this book may have been to exorcise some childhood and adolescent demons, maybe in an attempt to explain his own personal relationships with women. At any rate, he is an excellent writer; like W. Somerset Maugham, his prose is direct and unpretentious, and he can write romantic scenes and dialogue without being melodramatic or tawdry. The theme of maternal influence is timeless, relevant in any age, and Lawrence captures it perfectly."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"D.H has the intention to destroy realism .He wants what is physic than human .D.H describes Mrs. Morel as she is the bearer of culture .But she is suffering from a certain void"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"The setting of the novel is in the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire area of England. The novel is the story of the Morel family. Gertrude and Walter Morel married and went to Bestwood, a mining village in Nottinghamshire. She was a well educated and refined person; he was a warm, vigorous, uneducated man. They had four children- Annie, the daughter, and three sons- William, Paul, and Arthur. As Gertrude Morel's sons grew up, she no longer felt love for her husband, and instead turned all her love and passion towards her sons. The sons grew up hating their father and completely dependent upon their mother, who became the strongest factor in their lives; as a result, when they became men, they were unable to find a satisfactory relationship with any woman. William, the eldest, chose a flignty girl who gave him physical satisfaction, but nothing more, for his soul was his mother's. The struggle of this impasse killed him. Paul the second eldest, chose Miriam, who fought his mother for his soul; torn between the two women he ultimately returned to his mother. Later, he turned for a physical relationship to Clara, an older married woman, but again he found that the ties with his mother were too strong for a succesful relationship. Paul told his mother that as long as she lived he could not live a full life or love any woman. She became ill, and Paul dedicated his life completely to her.

Although you don't have to like the characters to like the book, I didn't even like the plot. It was bland. You're probably wondering why I gave it three stars.

Being mass-market paperbacks, they are easy to carry around. The only problem I would have with this is that there is not a lot of room in the margins for making notes about the text. There is some room, but you would need to write small. I would recommend this edition above others if you just wanted to read the story with really studying it.D.H. Lawrence wrote this in a time which also saw Sigmund Freud start with his writings of Oedipal conflict and motivation. A reader from today will start thinking about how much fun Freud would have with this within the first few chapters.I would have to say that I have not read a lot of D.H. Lawrence, but this book has convinced me to read more. The actions Paul, the main character, takes tell you what is happening, but if you look at the imagery of nature around them, you will have another idea of what is going on. Lawrence is a great writer. Look at the flowers when Paul and Clara have finished walking the slippery path by the river.

Mrs. Morel is portrayed by Lawrence as someone who tries to steer the lives of her sons, especially Paul, intervening in his choice of lovers and careers. Although her motives may be noble, her actions have unforseen consequences which affect adversely Paul's life. Lawrence's novel is said to be semiautobiographical, since the Morels are seen as fictitious counterparts of his own family.

It is in this book where D.H. Lawrence explores probably for the first time the circumstances and conditions of his youth in order to set himself free of the shadows of the past. The dominant, omnipresent influence of his mother a tie so strong he is hardly able to bear her death. So strong he almost chooses to follow her into the immense night which engulfed her. And if he walked and walked for ever, there was only that place to come to the place where his dead mother was awaiting him. Yet in the end, facing the seduction of death, he turns around and walks towards the light the faintly humming, glowing town thus deciding to continue the path of his life, alone but free. The story of a mother with an unfulfilled life and a marriage that was failure, too. A mother that substitutes her own life by the lives of her sons, making their success her victory. The victory that will make her triumph over the share of life she didnt get. Mrs Morel takes possession her sons of the lives, especially of Pauls (the counterpart of D.H. Lawrence). And by doing so she casts a shadow on all of Pauls actions, thoughts, and experiences. Everything he will do he will do it, in the end for his mother. This pressure, this shadow makes it impossible for him to see the light which would lead him along the path of his life and therefore his youth becomes a struggle, a fight against himself. He falls in love, but eventually he isnt able to love. The mother, sitting at home, jealous, is his conscience and she wouldnt allow anybody to come close to him. And so we see Paul grow up, a person bursting of life yet unable to live. With passion he falls in love, the passion though turns into pain. Pain, the keyword of the book, penetrates every chapter. A sensitive soul, deeply connected with nature, caught in torture. He felt as if his blood was melting into tears or his vision of a sunset: Gold flamed to scarlet, like pain in its intense brightness make us feel how the world of Paul utterly dissolves into torment and struggle. A book that is the vision of pain, not without any happiness, but always a happiness based on pain. This vision comes to us so real, so profound and sincere that the book seems to me an approach on life itself."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"THE BOOK WAS A SCHOOL BOOK WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE.

Overall, it gets a 3."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"Of all the 20th century books I've read, this is by all means the greatest. It's the wonderful - and at times heart-breaking - story of the Morels, significantly Paul Morel. It tells of his years as a boy and as a man, the women he painfully loves, and his struggle to obtain peace of mind. It's definitely a story worth reading, and one you're sure to like."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"I hated this book. It's not the writing that's in question. Although what Lawrence describes is formidably bleak, nevertheless he describes it well - even the minor warmths that sustain the people. And it's not that he is not perceptive either - there were moments when he could have been writing my story, used exactly the same words I did to describe the same feelings.It was the characters I didn't like at all, especially Paul Morel (moral?). In the first half of the novel we learn a lot about his mother - in fact for a long time I thought the novel was about her. In the second half of the novel the story moves to her third child Paul (the second, Annie, is minor; the last, Arthur, almost trivial) and his 'loves' for Miriam and Clara. Miriam is pure and initially Paul leaves her that way, only activating the relationship later when Clara tells him he had never really tried with her. But once the relationship is sexual Paul retreats. Clara, the alternative woman, is separated from her husband and Paul experiences real passion in winning her over, but she too is unsatisfying to him. Is it his mother's love for him, and his love for her that is to blame? But who are these two women who we have little knowledge of to give us a foundation of understanding of their behaviour as we do of Paul and his mother?What really distressed me was the selfishness of Paul - one of his last acts in the novel - with his sister Annie - is truly appalling (it's not sexual). So what is Lawrence's reason for drafting the novel as he did. Many people experience disturbances to their sexual awakenings, but I would like to think that outcomes do not necessarily have to be as bleak as Lawrence portrays. This is a novel - it doesn't have to faithfully represent people's awful experiences. By doing so for his characters I can't help feel that Lawrence is fatalistic - if things go wrong for you, bad luck, you'll end up a derelict and there is no help for it. I cannot accept this.The most moving parts of the novel both involve Paul's mother - related to the death of her eldest child William and her own death.Other recommendations:Wedekind: Springtime AwakeningTurgenev: Spring Torrents"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"I just loved this book, what a work of art.

I didn't really like it to much but I recognized the man had talent. He has some of the most elegant prose I have ever read. I heard this is a superior novel and much more profound so I decided to give it a whirl.Basically I couldn't stand it. I admit his writing is great, but I just can't get into this. Maybe it's the subject matter which is kind of strange, or maybe it's just personal taste, I don't know for sure. I am a great fan of literature of all kinds, but the period of writing from 1910-1925 I don't seem to enjoy. Sure Joyce wrote some ingenious things, Hemmingway was a great romantic writer but the stuff just doesn't click with me. Oh well, I gave the book 2 stars because I enjoyed the prose, but that is all I enjoyed."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"This has been the most artless novel I've tried to read this year. It was excruciatingly long and I could barely get to page 200. I could not finish it. I actually ran out and bought the Great Gatsby just to remind myself what a great novel is supposed to be.It was like Lawrence just decided to slap everything together about these dull people, all without consideration for the reader's patience. I don't think in the history of literature have I ever seen so much description of people looking at each other and walking around. And the dialogue was exceedingly hollow. The father could have been extremely interesting but almost all the time, I had no idea what he was saying with Lawrence's annoying use of colloquial country English. Of course, Lawrence is quite literate; he knows a lot about scenery and nature but that's not what makes a book great. It is plotting, lyricism, and resonance that makes a book fun to read, and not to mention selection and editing and the craftmanship of scenes and situations. Worse yet, his prose style is sickeningly robotic. It made me want to puke. So far this year, all the supposedly great Brit writers have been thoroughly disappointing."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"knowing the reputation of this novel, i was curious to find out what the fuss was about. but i found that the best thing about the novel is the description of his family, especially in the first part. his writing is simple and direct, and part one paints a very vivid picture of working-class life in england circa 1900. the other thing that surprised me about the book is the euthanasia at the end. i wasn't prepared for this and quite honestly was shocked to read about paul and his sister annie 'gliggling' and they prepare the morphium od for their mum. paul's love for his mother is also disturbing. his last kiss of the beloved cadaver is completely morbid. frankly, i'm surprised this aspect of the novel didn't cause more controversy. in comparison, the sexual material is pretty tame, granted i am 100 years removed from the book's first appearance.the structure of the book is based naturally on the biography, but still, the story is a little shapeless. there are characters and incidents introduced that are never taken up and resolved. paul's brother arthur, for example, makes short appearances from time to time, but he doesn't figure in the story at all. you can argue this is like real life, and maybe this is what lawrence was trying to achieve, but by the standards of a traditional novel, it is sloppy.i also never really got into the book. usually, i race to the end to find out what happened, but with 'sons and lovers', i coasted. at first, i thought this was because of the book's shapelessness, but there's no reason a biographical work of fiction can't be well structured. i realized the reason is that paul morel is just not your typical 'hero' of a biographical book. in fact, he's no hero at all. he has too many worts and he doesn't try to cover them up - i think this unlikeableness or aloofness of the main character makes the book itself unlikeable and hard to get into.nevertheless, lawrence does write nicely and the novel has some very interesting moments. worth a read.3 1/2 stars"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"Gertrude Morel thought at first that she was getting into a good marriage. Walter Morel seemed happy and successful and was not a drinker. She thought he would make a good husband and a good father to their children. It was only after they were married for awhile that she found that he spent much of his time drunk and didn't own any of the property he'd told her he owned. A seed of resentment was planted.Once their children, especially two sons, William and Paul, were born, Gertrude stopped caring much about her husband at all and concentrated on her offspring.Paul ends up with his mother's undiluted attention and affection. His decisions are largely based on keeping her happy, and when his thoughts wander to other females, such as those he dates, his mother grows petulant and her pouting convinces her son to come back to her. Although Paul has a good job and a bright future as an artist, he finds himself unwilling to commit to the girls he dates, because nobody can quite match up to his mother in his mind.This is a sad story of a mother ruining her son's life without meaning to. She really only wants to love him, but her love is so overbearing that she doesn't leave room for anyone else in his mind.The characters in this story didn't grab me. They were all incredibly weak, from Walter with his drinking problem drifting farther and farther away from his family; to Paul, unable to break away from his mother; to Gertrude, unable to make a life for herself and clinging to her son instead; to Miriam, allowing herself to be hurt over and over instead of walking away from Paul once and for all. They all needed to have some sense shaken into them."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"I wish I'd lived around the turn of the century. Then I could have gotten any piece of tripe published, judging by this novel. Were standards just lower then? 'Sons and Lovers' is the long winded cause of an uninspired idea. DH Lawrence took the members of his family, attached an 'emotion' to them, then narrated his life (slowly) repeating this emotion (the 'I may be poor but you can't take away my dignity' mother, the 'I'm going to drink to hurt you' father, the sensitive son, whatever). The book's tension is portentous and its prose is artless save an occasional lapse into the countryside (how many ways can you describe green hills and wysteria? someone should have told Lawrence, not many).My theory is that 'Sons and Lovers' falls under the Gatsby effect - since it's taught so much in high school it is often one of the first novels people read. And the first novel you read to learn the way novels work will always feel the quintessential, even when the sad truth is there are probably more skilled manuscripts passing by publishers' desks everyday. Someone just hit that banal note first."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"D.H. Lawerence kinda scares you with this book. It's beginning chapters, while it introduces you to characters, are boring. Let's face it: Classic British Literature is boring, and Lawerence only adds to it worse. His character, Paul Morel, obviously loves his mother a BIT TOO much. I'm not saying you have to consider this bad, I'm just saying that it made the book pointless. A man, living his life with constant remorse because no other woman can satisfy due to his mother?? How sad and how pathetic. The guy lost his virginity to a girl, then LEAVES her. The book is no where near what I call entertaining or exciting or even worth reading. However, it does have one quality: If you need to go to sleep, pick up this book."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"I bought this book because my brother was reading it and kept saying how interesting it was. The story is about a woman who marries someone below her class and then invests everything in her children. The story focuses on her relationship with her son Paul.

As I read this 3rd person omniscient novel. I kept thinking \\"Oh, hell, get on with it!\\" Having read Lady Chatterly's Lover, I knew this tome was going to be a slog-fest, and I was right. On the other hand, in 1913, the reading public had lots of time and no TV soap operas, so I suppose they didn't mind tedious passages. For example, Lawrence labors over mom's and Paul's love of flowers (she's thrilled to find blue flowers in winter) and I wanted to scream, \\"Okay, I get it, flowers symbolize fecundity and beauty, and mom and son(s) have a relationship bordering on incestuous, only without the sex. Now what?\\" I started skipping whole passages and lost nothing of the chain of events. Dad is always a no-goodnik, and mom is always a prim saint. It's an okay story, but what was the point again? Oh, yeah, life is nasty, brutish and short. And quite a bore for poor, downtrodden Mom. I guess Lawrence's desire to be on the cutting edge with his self-proclaimed masterpieve didn't include an obvious alternate conclusion: the book could have been titled, Gay Sons and Lovers.That it was written in 1913, when people were still shocked by tasetlessness and for the most part unaware of Freudian psychology, I'm sure it was steamy for its day. But this story could have been written as a twenty page short story and should have been."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"Wow...I don't remember the last time that I've read a novel that would bring out in me such immense sensitivity as this one.

Bravo. It is story of Paul Morel who loves his mother more than himself. Mrs. Morel who is married to a ignorant, illiterate coal miner tries to find comfort, solace and love in her sons, first with Walter and when Walter dies unexpectedly, with Paul, the second son. She lives for him, he for her. She is so possessive of him that she objects his involvement with his first love, Miriam. He then goes after, Clara, a married woman. The book revolves around Paul and these three desperate women, who comfort him, torture him andhe scornfully resiprocates. But he is always faithful to his mother , who he adores. I guess we are all like Paul, in someways. Miriam is a haunting character who reverberates in the entire book, so innocent, pure, religious, pious and madly in love with Paul. Clara, on the other hand, very rigid, calculating, demanding and yet very vulnerable. In Paul we see callousness, sacrifice, piety, haughtiness, repentance, a bit of Roskolnikov, a young man whose life is torn between a adoring mother and two lovers. In the end his high spirits and intellegence prevail and he conquers his demons."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"This is a perfect book for anyone who enjoys reading twentieth century British literature. I like the fact that D. H. Lawrence is able to realistically portray the emotions of the many characters in the book. I did not only learn Paul's side of the story, but I also gained insight into Gertrude's, Miriam's, and Clara's thoughts and feelings towards Paul and towards each other. This omniscient narration makes the story a more interesting study into human emotions. Lawrence deals very heavily with psychological motivations for each character's actions, making the characters more human and believable. This is a great story that goes far beneath the surface. Sons and Lovers is a thought-provoking tale of love, death, possession, vulnerability, and heartache. I would recomend it to anyone looking for a good book to read."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"This is not the drum I march to. But it was one of my teacher Ms Worby's favorites. And I can see why. Lawrence does present us with graphic images, dramatic confrontations, an oedipal complex, and a love triangle. The disputes between Clara and Miriam are especially memorable. Clara's vain attitude contrasts sharply with Miriam's genuine love for the protagonist Paul. In all honesty this book is never boring. The reason I could not get overly attached to this is I feel Lawrence lacks the charm that Dickens always throws into his novels. I have respect for this book, and I understand its significance in the world of literature. But I don't feel D.H. Lawrence is another Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"The plot of the story is simple but the narration is very impressive. Life of the main character ,Paul Morel, will be revolving around his mother. Paul will fail to replace his mother by any other woman. When his mother dies, Paul will lose focus and his life becomes chaotic. But it is not a tragedy and story ends with positive note.Following is my favourite part in the novel. Morel is a drunkard and his wife and kids do not like him. I liked the portrayal of change in environment of Morel's house when Morel is in the house and out of the house. The Miriam's character is very consistent.Finally, if you are used to reading classics, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"I never thought a book could be so enjoyable, but yet I found it confusing to muddle through the ideas that D.

Great books are meant to inspire thought, and Sons and Lovers does just that."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"We have, before us, a delicate subject; the male desire to obsessively love his mother coupled with intense hatred of his father. D.H. Lawrence admitted to being troubled by such feelings and expressed them in his third novel, \\"Sons and Lovers.\\" Critics have named it to the top 100 best books of all time. First published in 1913 and originally carrying the title \\"Paul Morel,\\" Lawrence wrote about a dysfunction that Sigmund Freud explored about the same time that became known as the Oedipus complex, so named for the Greek legend of King Oedipus. There's much more to it, of course, but basically \\"Sons and Lovers\\" is a sanitized version of Freud's later lengthy discourse.There's no doubt that Lawrence suffered from such feelings, and his rambling autobiographical novel takes the reader into the deep feelings and troubled musings of Paul Morel, Morel's relationships with his mother and two lovers, hatred for his father, and the subsequent unhappy entry into a lonely life. The feelings are intense, the cogitation never ending, and the entire story is circuitous and based on decisions that sometimes seem poorly implemented.There is no question that Lawrence embodies the classical writer with exceptional language skills and a talent for the portrayal of realistic scenes. One should read this novel, if for nothing else, to revel in the descriptions of the beautiful countryside, the inclement weather, and the community found in rural England's coal country. The passages describing the flora and fauna are mesmerizing in their detail and his descriptions of family life conjure up the simplicity of cooking, eating, and socializing that characterized subsistence during this time in history.The plot is easy to follow but difficult to relate to. A young man is torn between the obsessive love of his mother, the platonic friendship with a neighboring farm girl, and a passionate physical affair with a married woman, all the while harboring extreme hatred for his father. Lawrence captures that simple idea through a multitude of mind-numbing explorations of unfulfilled love, so much so that I found myself becoming impatient with the indecision and shouting, \\"Get on with it.\\"I recommend this book for those with the patience to wade through intense personal relationships, the ability to interpret thick symbolism, and the patience to unravel convoluted streams of consciousness. I would not recommend it to those who want fast action, graphic sexual encounters, or captivating mystery.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"Not having read any DH Lawrence I was not sure what to expect.

Though this book is not considerably too long, I must admit that it took me a lot longer than usual to finish compared to works by other authors. The writing is not difficult to understand, and there are some excellent prose throughout, but the book just seemed to drag at certain points. Even if you haven't read this book, you probably know that this story is primarily about a mind-controlling mother, Mrs Morel, who ruins her 2nd son, Paul, by forcing him to devote all of his love and attention to her. What results with Paul are heartbreaking relationships with two women and a stifled career as an artist. The breadwinner of the Morel family, though not the head of the family by any means is Mr. Morel, simply referred to as Morel throughout the novel. Morel is an illiterate miner who spends whatever extra money he has on booze. Morel is also cruel and abusive, being despised by all the family members. As the novel progresses we see him age, become softer, but really never forgiven by the family. I found myself actually liking and pitying Morel the most by the end of the novel. Do a little research on D.H. Lawrence's life. He has left the world with an amazing amount of work in his 44 or 45 short years on earth. I will definitely read more of his work, the next likely being Lady Chatterley's Lover."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"Lawrence drew a picture of his own life which is an image that many can relate to.

The story opens with the courtship and marriage of Walter Morel, a miner, and the quiet Gertrude Coppard, four years his junior. Immediately Lawrence sets the mood: \\" ... for three months she was perfectly happy; for six months she was very happy.\\" Soon Walter's drinking takes over their relationship and he begins beating Gertrude, one cold night locking her out of their house. Babies come as a matter of course, and their third child Paul becomes the novel's protagonist, not a gifted writer, like the author himself, but a painter who can hope to support himself with his art. Paul is depicted as having a very strong sex urge, an attribute not frankly discussed in English literature of the previous generation. Even Thomas Hardy (and I detect a very strong influence here) could not depict sexual situations in narratives like \\"Jude the Obscure\\" as Lawrence does in his novels. (In fact, an unexpurgated version of Lawrence's 1928 \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" was not approved until a generation after its original publication, thirty years after the novelist's death.) Paul's intense relationship with his mother has provided critics with all sorts of theories, the most common being that it skirts incest. True, they are very close when Paul is a child and, like his mother, Paul learns to despise his father. He lavishes affection on Gertrude, invents little pet names for her and even admits in one chapter that he won't marry as long as she is alive. But I don't think it's so much attraction on his part as affinity. They both distrust the same people, such as animalistic Walter and tenacious Miriam, the girl Paul comes close to marrying, much to his mother's horror. (Paul also seems to have inherited his mother's basic selfishness along with her devotion, so that his motives in Chapter XIV are apt to raise ambivalent feelings in the reader.) Gertrude is more ready to accept the coolly elegant Clara, probably because Clara is already unhappily separated from her husband Baxter, a man his wife finds difficult but still desirable. Paul's tense relations with these three women form the plot of \\"Sons and Lovers\\" and keep the reader deeply involved in its development. Granted the prose sometimes shades off into purple (\\"The hot blood came up wave upon wave\\"), for the most part the tone is well-controlled. To read this direct book is to understand why Lawrence became one of the most controversial authors of his time."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"Sons and Lovers was good read - format was not great but ok - love the charecter descriptions - very well written"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers (Classic boos on Cassettes Collection) [UNANBRIDGED]","review":"Great story line but almost too descriptive when it comes to countryside.

Otherwise, this mystery could prove to be quite a challenge.Carr's serial detective, the humungous Dr. Gideon Fell doesn't show up until halfway through the book, and three poisoned corpses have already littered the landscape.

Unfortunately in high schools everywhere, short stories are the norm in the classroom and even in community colleges. I attended and graduated Middlesex County College but I did not have Professor Sisko. This anthology also has activities for students in the text to make it easier. Each short story has a pre-vocabulary or writing set up before reading it. I don't prefer Short Stories since they don't have that much to read about. In this collection, she has chosen the popular Eudora Welty's \\"A Worn Path,\\" Zora Neale Hurston's \\"Sweat,\\" James Thurber's \\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,\\" Kate Chopin's \\"The Story of an Hour,\\" O.Henry's \\"Gifts of the Magi,\\" Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery,\\" William Faulkner's \\"A Rose for Emily,\\" 3 Edgar Allen Poe's short stories including \\"The Tell-Tale Heart,\\" \\"The Masque of the Red Death,\\" and \\"The Cask of Amontillado,\\" Ambrose Bierce's \\"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,\\" and Frank Stockton's \\"The Lady or the Tiger\\" which is the author's personal favorite. She also includes a chronological list of publications and dates. The earliest short story is Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"Dr Heidegger's Experiment\\" in 1837 and it's most recent is Roberta Fernandez's \\"Zulema\\" in 1990. I recognized the names of some of the faculty members like Sallie DelVecchio who taught me creative writing many years ago.

There is not a simple definition of what grace is, rather these essays as a whole seek, through a variety of topics and disciplines, to define Grace in an expansive way, realizing this to be a term so loaded with meaning and importance that simple definitions will not suffice. Specifically, however, these essays are coming primarily from a distinct Wesleyan perspective, in honor of a man who has spent his life and career developing and pondering such a perspective, Thomas Langford. In his own book, Practical Divinity: Theology in the Wesleyan Perspective, Dr. Langford sought to show how deep thought, academic engagement, and varieties of methods and traditions are important only insomuch as they reach out to the common person, and result in transformed thoughts and lives. In the same way, the collection of essays before us seek to show how wide, deep, and meaningful Grace truly is. The book is divided in to four sections, each devoted to essays from a specific discipline or focus.The first part focuses on Biblical essays, that is writings which seek to discover how grace is seen within the Biblical narratives and letters. The second part focuses on grace seen in history, the third on grace seen in theology, and the fourth studies grace from the perspective of culture.All in all a very good, and valuable, text."},{"Title":"Concert for piano and orchestra (Edition Peters)","review":"by all means if you are a lover of the graphic sign, graphic signifier, musical notation, this was the first large work of the American avant-garde that virtually contains any and all graphic notation,schemes/means,agendas,approaches,excursis that the avant-garde came to utilize, I can only think ofthe late Cornelius Cardew and Sylvano Bussoti whose work even approaches the conceptual depth(s) and impeccable graphic workmanship as Cage's \\"Concert. . . \\", This work can be played as a solo for piano or simultaneously with the other various nefarious \\"Solos For. . . \\" various instruments, each of those works are played as a self-contained piece with no direct coordination with this work, you need not even start together or inhabit the same identical performance space for a legitimate reading of the work.The graphics here utilizes all kinds of \\"processes\\",'pathways'\\"chemins\\" like following a circle of tones,going up then turning South, then North,Adorno referred to this work as a kind of accounting system of shuffling the deck,deeply engaged in inventing music as one goes along.

Unlike other abridgments it is based on an actual translation of Sanskrit verses Chakravarti Narasimhan has selected. He includes an index of the verses and a glossary of names at the end of the book, as well as several simplified genealogical tables. The introduction could be more inofrmative, but at least it is accurate in its refrences to previous translations. In my opinion more verses should have been inlcluded from the Philosophical portions of the Mahabharata, especially from the Santi- and Anusasanaparva. Still, the translation is accurate and it a much better introduction than some of the other abridgnents. For the beginning student, wanting to get a glimpse of the Epic, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Mahabharata","review":"Reading any abridgement gives me a bad feeling of missing something important, but this book deserves five stars:- It is written in simple English, without archaic words, so I was able to read it without using my dictionary too much. It means much to me, English not being either my mother or second, but learned language.- Every Sanskrit word is written using diacritics, so that you know how to pronounce names and places. I like to know that Pandu's brother is DhritaraSHtra and not DhritaraStra.- All the ninety-nine chapters are self-contained, each forming a logical unit, so you can read one chapter at a time.- It has very useful genealogical tables, glossary and list of alternative names.Like the Mahabharata by Rajagopalachari this is a very good book for introduction to this great epic."},{"Title":"Mahabharata","review":"Although Narasimhan has done a proficient enough job in this translation - his English is certainly much better than most full length translations currently available -- it is nevertheless a rather dry version of the great epic. If you are new to the text this will be heavy going, IMO, and you will probably soon find yourself lost in the morass of characters and their complicated relationships. He has not done much to help the reader make sense of the whole thing, unlike some other introductory versions, such as that by Krishna Dharma. It is a page turner only in the sense that you will be constantly turning backwards to remind yourself what is going on. But three stars anyway, as it is after all a faithful version of this wonderful work."},{"Title":"Mahabharata","review":"This is one of those important texts that I have always wanted to read, but have never gotten around to reading. To be honest, the length daunted me (1.8 million words), and I never know which abridged version to buy or which is worth reading.This abridged translation weighs in at 216 pages, and the translator prepared this book with the purpose of providing only the main story of the epic. In his own words: \\"I have selected only those verses which relate to the main theme, and which help provide a more or less continuous narrative. This process of selection reduced the total number of verses translated to some 4,000.\\" (The 4,000 is out of the possible 74,000.)Although the nature of an abridgment like this nearly guarantees that the poetry in an epic poem will be lost, I still found it worthwhile to read. The nested story-in-a-story was great, and the rivalry between the Pandavas and the Kauravas was interesting. I have read enough references in Indian literature to be aware of the story without ever really understanding the subject. This gave me enough base to connect the dots.I am sure that there are scholars out there who can point out the positives and negatives of this particular translation. I am uniquely unqualified to say anything at all about its respective qualities. It does seem to be generally well-respected.What I can say is that for someone who wants to get a bare-bones understanding of the narrative, then this appears to be a good choice. It is clearly and cleanly written."},{"Title":"Mahabharata","review":"This is the best abridged Mahabharata with modern English and true to the original Sanskrit.

It is sometimes compared to the later Homerian works of ancient Greece, but the importance of those pieces to westerners does not come close to matching the significance of this poem to Hindus.The Mahabharata is many things: morality fable, history, inspirational tall tale, religious discourse, literary masterpiece and national epic. It tells of the lives of members of two feuding, inter-related families, whose fortunes rise and fall over the course of many years. In its verses, gods come to earth to speak with men, heroes and villains share center stage, and in the end the largest battle ever fought on the subcontient is waged. (60,000 war elephants along with several million other assorted troops.)I personally found this poem dismaying to my western mind but also interesting. It does have long boring stretches, especially in the Krishna sermons (in which the great battle is suspended so the blue-skinned warrior-god may speak to a single man) but its soap opera-like tales of the wavering fortunes of the characters at its heart should be sufficiently vibrant to hold the interest of dedicated readers."},{"Title":"Farm Journal's Country Cookbook","review":"My mother, who is in her 90s and still a great farm cook, mourned the loss of this cookbook, so recently I hunted up another copy on Amazon.

I think most educators just look at the publication date. Since Hamilton's book was published in the 1940s and Bullfinch published in the 1800s, they think Hamilton's book must be much easier to read: not so.While Hamilton's MYTHOLOGY is confusing, redundant, and just plain inadequate in spots, Bullfinch's MYTHOLOGY provides clear and often exciting renditions of the much-loved myths. While Hamilton summarizes, Bullfinch is an excellent storyteller, who pulls you into the story in the same way that the original authors did. Even though Hamilton wrote sixty years or so after Bullfinch, her diction is much more confusing than his. For educational purposes, I heartily suggest giving Bullfinch's MYTHOLOGY a try.The only gripe I have with the text is that it uses the Latin names for the gods only. Modern mythology has seen a return to the original Greek names. This can easily be overcome though."},{"Title":"Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable / The Legends of Charlemagne / The Age of Chivalry (Laurel Classic)","review":"Thomas Bulfinch taught at Harvard College in the mid-1800s.

Spying on the corrupt head of Columbian National Security, Ramon Montoya, they get the shock of their life when they get on tape Montoya killing Revolutionary leader Maria Salvador in cold blood, shooting her in the back. Next thing Fiona knows, Tony is shot and dying and makes her swear to find mercenary Angel to help her get the tape out of Columbia and show the world what Montoya is capable of doing.Angel is nothing like Fiona imagined when she hunts him down and he is reluctant to aid her, afraid of failing yet another woman in his care. However, Fiona's passion to break the story draws him in, even while he is convinced she is a foolish woman who cares more about her career than reporting the truth. However, Montoya knows what Fiona has and he will do anything to prevent her from sharing that tape with anyone. Now, in a race against time, Angel and Fiona are travelling across Columbia with enemies all around to get her to safety. Angel and Fiona never imagined their greatest fight would be against their own hearts.Excitement begins on the very first page and does not let up until the very end in Mercenary's Honor. Angel and Fiona have many enemies and few friends as they try to escape certain death at the hands of the ruthless Montoya. Between gang members, corrupt law enforcement and revolutionaries who believe Fiona killed Maria (the story Montoya released) there is no safe haven for Fiona and Angel. Sharron does a fantastic job of portraying the sense of imminent danger facing our couple, really making us sweat it out as we wonder what will happen next.Fiona and Angel both have their own issues, especially with guilt, to overcome. Angel punishes himself for not being able to save his former lover, who also happened to be a reporter hoping for her next big story, when she got in too deep and swears he will never end up in such a situation again. He doesn't want to help Fiona but knows he has to and through his relationship with her, he finally finds what he needs to recover from his past. Fiona feels guilty over Tony's death, especially since he'd have never been there to get the damning video footage if Fiona hadn't pushed him into it. With Angel's rather blunt and sometimes unappreciated help, Fiona gradually manages to put her guilt aside and accept that he knew what he was getting into and that by blaming herself, she's not seeing the full picture. Fiona and Angel need each other and their blossoming love to reach their full potential.One of the things I liked best about Mercenary's Honor is that Fiona is just an ordinary woman overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds. She has absolutely no skills to help her get out of the jungle alive and makes more than a few mistakes. She is a perfect example of the normal every day woman standing up in the face of adversity and finding her inner strength when she needs it most. If the Silhouette Bombshell line were still alive and kicking, Fiona would definitely have been a Bombshell Woman. If you are looking for a fast paced and suspenseful story to take your breath away, then Mercenary's Honor by Sharron McClellan is a must-read.Kelley A. Hartsell, September 2008.

She wants a chance to do real, investigative work so she heads to Bogota, Columbia to try and discover something newsworthy. There she and her cameraman Tony Torres witness the execution of a top Revolutionary leader by Ramon Montoya, the head of Columbian National Security. Luckily, they get the execution on tape, unluckily, Tony is shot and killed in the process and while he lies dying, he urges her to run and get to a mercenary named Angel for protection.Angel Castillo is exhausted and all he wants is for the alcohol to take his nightmares away. He's still mourning the loss of his irrepressible fiancee and when Fiona walks into his bar, the similarities are painful. When he finds out about the death of his friend, he shakes off his funk and takes on the job of protecting Fiona and getting her and the tape out of Columbia. It's just a job he tells himself, and he'll be damned if he gets involved with another reporter.Angel drags Fiona all over Columbia, zig zagging their way through enemy territory, mercenaries and the military. Her resolve to do the right thing impresses him and his admiration and lust for her grows. At first Angel tries to hold himself back and stay aloof, but he remembers the last time he let something wonderful slip through his fingers and he vows not to make the same mistake again.This was a surprisingly exciting, thrilling and sexy read! I was really impressed by this little gem. Angel was extremely sexy and competent and Fiona was a brave and intelligent woman. I liked how she did what Angel told her to do, too. Sharon McClellan didn't rely on Fiona making stupid, reckless decisions to further the story along and when Fiona was able to help, she did so quickly and assertively. These were two well adjusted and intelligent people stuck in a deadly situation. Let's put it this way, if ever I was in such a situation, I would want to be on their team because these two were survivors. They used their wits and their brains and were able to not only get out alive, but were able to find love along the way. The love that these two found was a little abrupt but Sharon McClellan made it work and it wasn't intrusive. The whole story flowed naturally, and she was able to work a believable romance throughout all the action and it was just enough to make all the thrills worthwhile.There is a lot of crazy action in this fun story. Lots of memorable characters and also a lot of humor. While Angel is a quiet and steady merc, he and Fiona do share a few laughs that helped to relieve some of the tension. This was a perfect blend of romance, action and sexy thrills and I wouldn't mind hunting down some other books by Sharon McClellan.

Set in England in 1818, it is also a story of a love between two people who sought freedom, adventure and passion and found them in each other.Beautiful, free-spirited (and really short at 5'1\\") Aurora Huntley thought she would never marry, certainly not her enemy, Julian Bencroft, the Duke of Morland. For generations the Bencrofts and the Huntleys have been at war owing to a missing black diamond their great grandfathers failed to deliver to the Crown. But on the night she stages her own ruin to avoid an arranged marriage, Aurora unwittingly runs right into Julian's arms. Julian decides it's time to end the feud between their families, and wanting both the diamond and the beautiful girl, he offers for her. She accepts. And they are off to find the treasure.It's a well-told tale for the most part. There is no question that Kane is a word master. The beginning is full of sexy love scenes between the newly married couple (the first of which seems a bit over the top for a virgin). The heroine is intelligent, the conversations interesting. Among the positives is the character Mr. Scollard (a wizard who lives in a lighthouse) who is quite fascinating and adds a bit of charm, not to mention they would never find the treasure without him.I would love to have given this 4 stars but as I wouldn't recommend it, I just couldn't. The reason I can't rate it higher is the last part of the story (from about page 300) disappointed. The novel came in with a bang and went out with a whimper in my opinion. There were too many \\"I love you's,\\" too many explanations, and not enough plot. The clues came together too easily.

She sneaks out to a tavern and naively believes she can get one of the sailors to put her into a compromising position without really taking intimacies with her. She is saved from certain ravishment by Julian Bencroft, the Duke of Morland. He takes her to a tavern room more for her own protection from the patrons rather than engaging in any intimacies but they are attracted to each other and are caught in an embrace by her brother. She is dismayed to discover that Julian is an enemy of the family.The Huntley's and Bentcrofts have been feuding for generations about a black diamond worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. Julian has no interest in the money but is interested in Aurora. He marries her to protect her reputation, and to aid in his search for the diamond to settle the feud. He plans on giving the diamond to the British Government.Julian is an adventurer and I would have loved for him to be, well, a little more adventurous and mysterious. He was almost tame. He is brave and smart and like many of Kane's heroes, he is coolly in control of his emotions yet is not distant from the one he loves.Aurora is kind hearted but as stated earlier a bit nave. She is also brave and ready to charge to the rescue when her family is in a crisis.These two spend most of the book looking for clues to the diamond's whereabouts and evading an assassin that has targeted Julian. The mystery is interesting but the romance is better and I liked that these two communicated their thoughts and feelings with each other."},{"Title":"The Black Diamond","review":"Phew, if your going to read this book you had better turn the pages with oven mitts and keep a fire extinguisher nearby because it is HOT STUFF!

The plot, was not too bad, but if you can believe a man who is bashed, stabbed then spends hours searching and tracking his wife is then able to satisfy his wife sexually etc , etc, then I would like to meet this superman.

You're better off reading something from the WROX publishers to learn PHP and the MySQL Tutorial from MySQL AB.This book covers a lot of PHP but the examples are awful and the layout of them are even worse.Altough they recommend some coding standard, they unfortunately do not implent it in the examples themselves.The chapters jump back and forth and if you like to know something about object orientated programming in PHP then stay away from this book. It will not teach you, but it is merely a explanation for C or Java programmers.This is not really a PHP5 book, but a brushed up PHP4 book. The MySQL version examples are still 4.0, which suprices me as 4.1 is released at the same time as PHP5 and has some important changes regarding PHP.

I previously purchased the \\"Visual Quickstart Guide - PHP\\" and \\"Visual Quickpro Guide - Advanced PHP\\" but have to say this book is so much better. It goes through everything you need to know in seperate chapters and provides text on the why's and how's of PHP. For anyone who has tried taking the advice of many and \\"RTFM\\" but has become overwhelmed, this book is great. (I'm definitly not saying forget the online manual; it is essential.)Thank you PHP5 and MySQL Bible."},{"Title":"PHP5 and MySQLBible","review":"This book is not meant to be a profound cache of code-snippets. Indeed there are some coding errors. I freely admit that I learned raw html \\"OJT\\" years ago, with little reason or time to learn anything more involved that wasn't required of me. I was a designer, typesetter and layout hanger, not a programmer. I have no experience in C or in Java. Call me a programmer groupie, I have dozens of family, friends and acquaintances who program miracles daily in all different alleys while I play a \\"very aesthetic game of tiddleywinks\\". When I began getting clients who wanted websites that DID things instead of just glorified yellow-page ads, this \\"turkey\\" asked all of the \\"eagles\\" which way to turn -- they looked at what I needed and what paths that might lead to, and they all said PHP. I started playing around with canned PHP webapps about two years ago, and I quickly picked up how to install mods and then modify those same mods no sweat, but even with a few different sorts of PHP/MySQL in 24 hours, one week, etc. books -- I never really understood the WHY's and HOW's of the GUTS of those webapps [framework, huh?!], let alone how to create even the simplest of freestanding flat calls, all of which have recently begun to make my life SO much easier. I quickly learned that those 24 hours/one week/etc. style books are ALMOST STRICTLY made for folks with C and Java experience even though the books desperately claim otherwise. Why did I choose this book? Because a few friends of mine who have been working with PHP since near the beginning told me that this was one of the few version'd books that always has a worthwhile amount to offer both beginners and seasoned pro's, as well as everyone in between. I actually started reading this one cover to cover, and was not the slightest bit disappointed in my investment. Let me clarify -- I actually COULD read this one cover to cover without wondering what magical decoder ring I was missing. Instead of a code snippet \\"Instant PHP\\" book, I finally wound up with one that I can look at the examples in the book, and without even trying the examples verbatim, write my own similar but original code for what *I* want to accomplish. I don't know Jane Adams, I am not her banker, and I don't know what I would do with her recipe database so 6 page long examples of how to code any of that to be used verbatim in 24 hours are of little value to me. Yes, the book jumps around -- there's a heck of a lot to cover here! 1000+ pages might seem rather hefty, but it has been a godsend for me. Take the reviews however you will; I found it extremely educational AND entertaining, and having seen dog-earred copies in the offices of some of said \\"eagles\\" -- I am fairly certain there is some great stuff in here for PHP pro's too. If you really feel the need, give it a few minutes at your local bookshop -- then come back to Amazon for the killer discount.

However, I was impressed by the content. The dialog within the book is comprehensive as well as enjoyable. This is not a dry manual. It does jump around, but with so much covered, there's no correct navigational path to develop each topic in succession. I found it great to read the book, but create my own code based on examples found in the book. (Copying the code line by line didn't help me.

Far worse is that even some of the most basic, three lined examples of code contain fatal errors.Unfortunately, most examples of code are unnecessary long and complicated and seem to be chosen randomly. I agree with other reviewers that the first few chapters about the history and variables are OK but from then on it gets really hairy.I can't believe this book still gets 3 out of 5 stars. I would never buy this book again, or recommend it to others. In fact, I'm on Amazon to order a different book on learning PHP.

If you get this you will be spending most of your time debugging the inherently flawed code. This is a real headache especially if it's your first time doing things like self-submitting forms. What's even worse is that the examples are barely elucidated and there is nothing on how to correctly setup example-specific MySQL tables, columns etc. Basically you are left to copying the examples and hoping to learn something whilst debugging because there is little or no info provided on the dynamics of the code."},{"Title":"The Importance of Living","review":"The book was as if new, absolutely thrilled!The book teaches one, in the ancient Chinese way, how to uncomplicate ones life and thoughts and illustrates how it was done by the Chinese"},{"Title":"The Importance of Living","review":"Lin Yutang made all us westerners the service of putting a broad view of the traditional Chinese life philosophy in an accessible manner. This is not cheap \\"new age\\" or the like, this is true humanism written by a thoroughly human person. I read this book 20 years ago and it still delights me and brings me back into trying to live a more enjoyable life, paying attention to the small and simple rather than wasting energy chasing \\"success\\". I could hardly add anything new to all the praises already made here.

This is the kindof book you'll want to revisit again and again; just open and read anything and you'll say 'yesss'. . .If you like what's written, learn about 'Wabi-Sabi' too, the Japanese equivalent to the Chinese philosophic values of simplicity and essential living. This Japanese rendition orients (untended pun) Wabi-Sabi to graphics... then carries it through to life.Wabi-Sabi: for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers. Their famous tea ceremony exemplifies the beauty of purity and simplicity, as does Yutang in this fine book.Amazon offers three pages of books regarding Wabi-Sabi; some are 'decorative'coffee-table books and most of those are rather superficial. Shop carefully.Another Wabi-Sabi book I much appreciate isIn Praise of Shadows. Delving into both Chinese and Japanese perspectives is not redundant; the differences just go to give further depth and understanding. Oh: The only Western take on 'less is more' thinking which occurs to me is via Mies Van Der Rohe, a noted architect; that 'less is more' line is his.Americans especially, with their yen (another pun, intended) for embellishment/ego-centric fashionsaimed at impre$$ing others would benefit greatly by the concepts of Lin Yutang and Wabi-Sabi.Another point: Elsewhere at Amazon, the author credited is 'John Day'; actually, the reference is the John Day Company; publishers (maybe of this fine book in the 1930s; hope that misinformation will be straightened out...

After reading Tom Hodgekinsons books about idleness and freedom, I was interested in this book because it was mentioned a lot by Tom. Not nearly an easy read and I wish it could be shortened by at least a half. Much of what he said makes sense but I wish it was more of how one should live and less of ramblings not pertaining to living. All in all, its ok. Would definitely recommend Freedom manifesto and How to be idle by Tom hodgekinson"},{"Title":"The Importance of Living","review":"I regard the discovery of one's favorite author as the most critical event in one's intellectual development.-Lin YutangMy exposure to Chinese culture and philosophy comes, these days, through my experiences with Tai Chi Chuan and various other martial arts and Qigong. This study brings me close to many Chinese and Taiwanese people. None are more gracious, accepting, and friendly. I appreciate how their culture blends into ours so seamlessly.Lin Yutang's 'The Importance of Living' is, to me, the best exploration of this blending and this contrast between our two peoples.He is an essayist, writer, philosopher, linguist, and a cultural critic, among other many talents. And, The Importance of Living deserves to be on your bookshelf. From his table of contents get a quick feel of what you will experience: Approach to Life, Spirit and Flesh, On Being Mortal, On Having a Mind, On Human Dignity, On the Sense of Humor, How About Human Pleasure, On Growing Old Gracefully, On Conversation, The Art of Reading, The Art of Writing, and last but not least, The Return to Common Sense...The best peek at this work is the blurb on the book's cover:\`The Classic Bestseller that Introduced Millions to the Noble Art of Leaving Things Undone.'You will laugh.

Written in 1939, its philosophy and view of life are most helpful to those of us tossed by the political and religious pains of our time. The references to the Chinese poets are worth the price in themselves, and the authors jaundiced view of just about everything is priceless."},{"Title":"The Importance of Living","review":"I first heard of Lin Yutang, I am almost reluctant to say, many years after my exposure to Alan Watts and the \\"New Left\\", long before the \\"Neo-Cons\\" came to be a force majeure....in fact,..it was during a Michael Savage discussion of his new (4th) political bestseller, \\"The Political Zoo.\\" He even remarked that he was probably hurting his own sales to remark on this classic work of Yutang--which experienced a resurgence in sales the LAST time he mentioned it in about 1998. But I ordered the Political Zoo at the same time--they are so different as to occupy quite different spaces in the mind and thought.....I know that fans of Savage (Michael A. Weiner, Ph.D.) are have probably already purchased this book--those who missed the mention in the late 90s, or if they failed to write it down in the recent mention, have found it.Yutang makes people like Watts, westerners who dabbled in Eastern thought, seem like the true dilettants they were. In any advanced Psychology class contrasting Western and Eastern Philosophy of Living, Yutang comes across as the one who has truly digesting both styles of living, to the point of being able to allow an intelligent lay reader to thing deeply and make some rational and deeply philosophical decisions about life-style.I'll give one example--the Western custom of shaking hands, versus the Eastern tradition of shaking one's OWN hand. In the mid-19th century, Col. Fremantle discussed the dirty American habit of hand-shaking--which was not done in the upper classes in Britain and in the the officer corps. The point being--close human contact was considered a very special phenomenon and not part of daily human discourse......even in a western culture. There are many such relevations in this book--which is why it fascinated Savage, and why it will fascinate and reader who is interested in cross-cultural psychology and comparative con-specific behaviour....well written, and highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"The Importance of Living","review":"Lin Yutang has a lot to say on \\"the importance of living\\"- nearly 500 pages worth. I read most of this book and skimmed through some of it. Reading Lin Yutang is like liesurely conversation with a learned friend. I found some of his opinions on life quite profound and humorous; other things that he had to say I thought were silly, chauvanistic and even insulting. But he does give you a lot to think about.I basically agree, however, with the basic theme of the book which is to take some time to contemplate life. It's actually a much needed message for the Western world that is getting so caught up in rush, rush, rush. I would even say with the emerging China that is becoming more and more American with the emphasis being on rushing around, and the pollution, and living to make money; that Lin Yutang's message is especially needed in reminding us all of the old Chinese way.Actually, Lin Yutang's philosophy is very close to Emerson and Thoreau and the other New England transcendentalists in his understanding of the natural world. Lin Yutang, is also quite critical of Christianity in this book. Not quite so much as Mark Twain in his scathing and sarcastic \\"Letters From Earth\\"; but critical all the same. As a Christian myself, I took his criticisms in stride. I didn't agree with him completely but I do think that it would do Christianity some good to focus more on \\"living a happy life\\" than being a religion that sends people to heaven or hell.Lin Yutang's idea on living as it relates along spiritual lines is best expressed in the following quotation: \\"It is against the will of God to eat delicate food hastily, to pass gorgeous views hurriedly, to express deep sentiment superficially, to pass a beautiful day steeped in food and drinks, and to enjoy your wealth steeped in luxuries.\\"Incidently, Lin Yutang, later wrote \\"Pagan to Christian\\" which explains how he left the paganism he advocates in this book and turned back to Christianity which was the religion of his youth. Actually he eventually manages to come to a shaky reconcilliation between Paganism and Christianity or the so-called \\"Eastern\\" and \\"Western\\" worlds."},{"Title":"The Importance of Living","review":"Americans don't know how to relax.

I was surprised that how undercredited he was in Chinese society when i found out that he, using English as second language, can write a 52 week bestseller in USA in 1938. He was nominated twice for Nobel prize but lost , yet i think the CHinese Nobel prize winner Gaoxingjian cant measure up to a tenth of LinYutang's achievement in writing bestseller, compiling Sino-English dictionary and invented Chinese typewriters.What was true about Chinese and Americans no longer hold, but the brilliance of this book is for all human kind!Interesting enough the traits that was used in the book to describe Chinese and Americans have switched places. Nowadays, our impression about European/Americans are that they got labour unions to protect workers right, minimum age, so many vacations, family is given a top priority; while lot of Chinese are working non-stop, dumping the Made In China labels to every corner of the globe.I ordered the Chinese version online the other day, but yesterday, i couldnt wait for its arrival and i went to the bookstore in shenzhen to get a cheap english copy, it was indeed cheap, less than USD2 and brandnew, however, in the Foreword by Editor, iwas told that Lin is a great man and a pride of Chinese, however his views are against Marxist ideas and readers should be careful, so they apologize for having to make some deletion. OH, i guess i need to buy a complete version in amazon again.However, when i reflect on this a little bit, has China really changed so much? Freedom of speech will lead to social turmoil and riots in a yet developing country with enough illiterate everywhere, Democracy is a form of thinking which in itself is a by-product of evolution of our brain as said by Lin; the ultimate function of brain is to help us live, so problem of hunger and poverty must be solved first before everything else. So is the logic of Chinese Communist party and that of majority of citizens here. This seemingly negative trait has been glorified well by Lin in a logical way.Therefore, i guess despite how life-enjoying americans have become and how all Chinese are burning candles at both end, this book still hold true in some way."},{"Title":"The Importance of Living","review":"This delightful book is certainly worth the reader'swhile when the author's succintly bring you into hisconfidence and reveal in an unbutton mood his experienceof thought and mind from the Chinese philosophy which hasmellowed through centuries towards the enjoyment of life.It is punctuated with proverbs, poetries, satires, prose,wittiness and little stories throughout the book.

So much truth in what he says. Well writen, meaningful, insightful beyond belief, and even funny."},{"Title":"The Importance of Living","review":"This is a humorous and delightful read. Written from a Chinese Taoist perspective, Lin Yutang regaled us with a leisurely look at life, dubbed the philosophy of loafing. With musings on a wide range of topics such as religions, physicality, family life , social etiquette, dress, philosophy, food, nature, travel, literature and the simple pleasures of life, he never fails to entertain with his brilliant use of words and the candid expressions of his personal take on what makes life fulfilling. I am a Christian reader and ironically find ready resonance with his appreciation of an embodied human life, the beauty of simplicity and the gratuitous realm of play. One cannot help compare his portrayal of the Taoist outlook with the Cynic (Greek) philosophy of Diogenes. While there are of course areas where I differ from Lin, especially the anemic version of Christianity he was exposed to, I find his writing bold, irenic and brilliant. I think if the Christian faith was to be embraced within the Chinese cultural context, this book offers valuable materials for reflection. It enhances both my appreciation for the best of Chinese philosophy and the Judeo-Christian practice of Sabbath when rightly understood. This book stands next to the likes of GK Chesterton in his humorous philosophizing. A book to savor on a reading vacation with your legs curled up on a bed like a perfect loafer.

It arrived approx 2 weeks after purchase - now to read the book"},{"Title":"The Importance of Living","review":"What I like about this book is the author's eloquence in evaluating simple acts in our life taken as granted (e.g. laying down, drinking tea, having a nice conversation) and in bringing out their simplicity yet beauty. In this manner, he teaches us how to enjoy them as they are and therefore gain a deeper appreciation of life itself. This book is like a reminder of things that we already knew but became forgotten as we grow older and is a collection of concrete philosophical ideas that would enrich our way of living.The downside of this book is the tendency of the author to be verbose and to use complicated expressions. It is somewhat a vocabulary marathon to understand what he writes, not to mention the chinese expressions oftenly used without clear explanation (even with the explanation summary at the end of the book). The other is the impresssion of somewhat chinese-centric and xenophobic writing style.In conclusion, this book is valuable in the way it reminds us the importance and enjoyment of living. It is however not an easy reading, and his writing style needs some getting used to."},{"Title":"The Importance of Living","review":"I bought this book many many years ago at Swindons's and it was the perfect book for enjoying civilization. :)"},{"Title":"The Importance of Living","review":"I felt the need to leave an alternate opinion quickie-review as I love older chinese writing (all of Cao Xueqin, Pu Songling, Lu Xun, The Monkey stories, chinese folktales, myths, and so on) and was looking forward to this after reading the online reviews.

I've read it several times and have spoken on Lin, and have even appeared as Lin Yutang one time.But the Little, Brown \\"reprint\\" edition is a travesty of cheapness....a white cover and no running heads. Why do American publishers cut corners? It's an insult to the author and the reader. I recommend you avoid the Little Brown edition and buy the original 1937 edition, published by John Day Co., or if you want a new alternative edition in quality paperback, buy the recently published edition in Singapore by Cultured Lotus, available from http://www.selectbooks.com.sg.

This book was a major turning point in my Life. After working the \\"American Dream\\" i.e. 50 hour work weeks and having zilch to show for it in 3 years, I had a nervous breakdown. Luckily I survived and made it through. Afterwards, I searched the bookstore for a genuine book and found this diamond in the ruff. Wow, was I not dissappointed! This book is totally refreshing for the stressed out individual. Like the heading I wrote proclaims, welcome BACK to your childhood and to the Mystery thereof. After reading this book, I realized that unless one enjoys Life, it is simply not even worth living! Sounds harsh but it's true, you know it. Lin Yutang boldly stands for the human condition. This book relearned me on the fun of my childhood. How could we have gone so far astray? I've dove head first into various religions which did do some good but really only left me full of dogmatic doctrines and repetitive rituals. The Bible says that we should be as children. What good is that advice without a proper manual for the return to this innocense? This book is the manual leading one back to the joys of those not so distant memories. I recommend it to everybody I meet. Take back that precious gift which was stolen from you, the Mystery of Life. Just because you are breathing and active does not mean that you are truly Living, never forget the importance of it! Stand with us and don't look back upon, otherwise babblonn!!! And thank you!!!"},{"Title":"The Importance of Living","review":"I bought a copy of this book (the original 1937 edition) in a secondhand book store in the 1970s for the princely sum of $1.00. Through countless moves since then I have somehow managed to retain this book, which is surprising since I have lost or given away so many books, almost all of which cost me much more money than this one did. I can honestly say it was the most profitable dollar I ever spent. This is a wonderful book -- rambling at times, it is true -- but it contains many gems. Yutang is a superb writer and his quote of Chuangtse (as he spells the name of the famous Chinese philosopher) is classic: &quot;Spit forth intelligence.&quot; This, along with William Strunk's famous dictum &quot;Omit needless words,&quot; is a phrase every writer should live by."},{"Title":"The Importance of Living","review":"Lin-Yutang (1895-1976) a Chinese humanist and humourist, wassteeped in the ancient wisdom of his motherland. Lin-yutang was also a cosmopolitan. Educated at Saint Johns University in Shanghai, he went on to take his Master's degree at Harvard, then his doctorate at the University of Leipzig. His two most well known writings 'My Country and My People' (1935) and 'The Importance of Living' (1937) brought him international fame, the latter a perennial classic and best seller for decades. A decent reprint of this remarkable book has long been overdue. Happily, the Singapore based publisher, Cultured Lotus, has made a new edition available. The positive reviews were gratifying to see.This isn't a book to read in a hurry. As the cover-blurb puts it: \\"offered as a remedy to modern day living, is the classic distillation of Chinese wisdom, revere inaction as much as action , observe the place of humour to ensure healthy living, and simply celebrate existence. Gaily serious, cynicaly kind, shot through with a sense of comedy and backed by sages of many centuries, it brings forth the salt and tang of life.Lin Yutang observes: \\" a man who loves life intensely must be always jealous of the few exquisite moments of leisure that he has. And he must retain the dignity and pride of the vagabond. His hours of fishing must be as sacred as his hours of business, erected into a kind of religion as the English have done with sport. \\"Superficially, one might see such a philosophy as a refusal to take life seriously - but, Lin Yutang's perspective here is summed up by the quotation from Chang chao:\\"Only those who take leisurely what the people ofthe world are busy about can be busy about whatthe people of the world take leisurely. \\"Hence, what this outlook refuses to embrace is the notion that the only meaningful activity open to us - is that which is purpose driven, against which, leisure time will be evaluated as 'dead time.' Lin Yutang reminds us of the positive, living potentialities of 'leisure' time. Much of this is of Taoist inspiration, but like the ancient Greeks, even Confucius recognised that human life is meaningless, if reduced to repetitive, merely utilitarian processes.Lin Yutang's thought ranges over many aspects of life. Not everything said in this book reflects the 'oriental' point of view (he knew Europe and America)- or Taoist wisdom. Whatever he touches on, usually elicits some witty fact or observation. Nevertheless, many - if not most readers, find Lin-Yutang at his most compelling when digressing on the finer details of ancient Chinese culture, be it the appreciation of tea and incense, eminent Chinese painters and poets - and their works. Although but sixteen pages, the 'Critical Chinese Vocabulary' Lin-Yutang appended to this text is immensely interesting and worth its weight in gold, when it comes to unpacking the delicate shades of meaning permitted by the combination of various Chinese characters. This is a charming and delightful book."},{"Title":"The Importance of Living","review":"This is a true modern classic (to those who consider 1937 modern anyway). Lin Yutang offers a meandering, informal look at life, happiness, the differences between Eastern and Western cultures, the enjoyment of food and many other things. What I like best about this book is not what it argues for or advocates (Yutang is about as far from an academic philosopher as you can get) but the joy and wisdom he injects into every paragraph. He is often considered a Chinese thinker, but this is only partially true. His very broad studies and experiences make him a true cosmopolitan, the sort it is hard to find today. The Importance of Living is really a call to appreciate the earthly pleasures of life and not take so seriously the overrated follies of modern civilization. You don't have to completely agree with his views to appreciate his style. The ideal life for Lin Yutang is that of a lazy, wandering Taoist scholar. Not a humorless ascetic, but someone who approaches life with a sense of humor and an ability to enjoy the small pleasures. Yutang identifies himself as a hedonist (later in life he became Christian, but that's another story). There are many self help and new age books out today that tell you how to live a simpler, more spiritual life. This book tells you the same thing in a way that is far wittier and less sanctimonious."},{"Title":"The Importance of Living","review":"I first became aware of this great book when I found an old copy in my Father's library, when I was around age 14. Though it was not exactly an \\"exciting\\" read for a boy of 14, I found some of the headings intriguing...\\"On Having a Stomach; On Having Strong Muscles; On Playful Curiosity; Celibacy A Freak of Civilization ( of course as a 14 year boy old I HAD to read that one!), Inhumanity of Western Dress... and many others.Perhaps it was partly in response to this book, that I developed an interest in Chinese culture which has now spanned over 40 years.This book gets the reader back to the very basics of human life--food, friendship, tea, smoking (a bit controversial nowadays), growing old. It is all about CHERISHING EACH PASSING MOMENT and learning to instill each moment of life with quality and to live it artfully.I was so happy to find this book reprinted. It is not necessarily the kind of book one must read all at once, but a book to pick up on a rainy day, and just savor a few pages--while drinking a fine cup of tea and awaiting a visit from a special friend.It's one of thoe rare books that may well become a part of you and of each moment of your life."},{"Title":"The Importance of Living","review":"I am actually disapointed to find this book in wide circulation. A friend had introduced me to an old copy of 'The importance of Living' on the balcony of a mountain home in the Blue mountains, Sydney, Australia. The edition he showed me resembled a holy text, with its simple red cover and black insignia-character. On opening the cover of Yutang's book, the reader must peruse the contents. This is an intriguing read in itself. Chapters such as 'on having strong muscles' and the classics 'on tea and friendship' and 'on Luck' illustrate Yutang's unorthodox approach to life and philosophy. After reading Yutang, after immersing myself in his slow and simple prose style, I decided, as I am sure many before me have, to live my life by his recommendations, to treat sleep, tea, friendship and leisure as Yutang himself would. So profound was my reaction to 'The importance of living', that I began to reproduce selections of text on my computer. I printed sections describing firecrackers and stuck them beside the front door. I 'blu-tacked' a section about the merits of lying sideways in bed just above my pillow. Soon the house was littered by the floating philosophy of Lin Yutang. I lived in that house for nearly one year. In that time, Yutang philosophy carried me through abject poverty. There is also reason to believe that my adopted Yutangisms were a major factor in the genesis of a whirl-wind and ultimately life-long relationship. Basically, read Yutang's wise words on life, adopt or reject his ideas after long, easy, tea-drenched contemplation. I gaurantee you will not emerge unchanged."},{"Title":"The Importance of Living","review":"I found Lin Yutang's writings many years ago. The book gives me a peaceful feeling and leads me back to the importance of simple living. I enjoy the author's views on aging especially in a society where aging is not often honored.

And as he was born in 1900, was a silent man and left us a huge library, I simply had to read this book to see what it was about.Mr. Yutang is definitely a nice person. It would have been a pleasure to have some conversation with him.I know that some of his beliefs can seem quite strange, in this crazy 21st. century days we are living, but in a certain way I believe he embodies the Chinese tradition of letting things pass instead of fighting with them.This book has some funny passages, such as the one where he describes his passion for walking in the rain and how he later would lie to explain to people why he was all wet...It certainly packs a different approach to life and it is interesting to learn his opinions about our western life styles. And having lived in America, he never condemns any of it, but simply points some absurds and curiosities that couldn't be easily accepted by a chinese.There is certainly some to be learned from his culture of appreciation and his delightful essays about many aspects of our lives that would have simply passed unnoticed otherwise."},{"Title":"The Importance of Living","review":"I actually found this book whilst browsing the shelves in a thrift shop in a village in England. I liked the look of the title and it cost me the princely sum of 50 pence sterling. What a find - Yutang's words of wisdom often comfort when the world seems like its turning upside down. This book has been on many of my travels, I often recommend it to friends hoping they'll get as much out of the prose as I did. In a Global World that seems to be moving ever faster - its a pleasure to take time off, relax and philosophize with the Author. This book is never far from hand, I often re-read chapters when in need of inspiration. Kick of the shackles, open up the pages, spark one up and spend some time alone - you'll be a wiser and more tolerant human being for having read this book."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of private pensions","review":"A good reference book for anyone connected with a pension or profit sharing arrangement. It is not a guide to IRAs, Keogh plans, SEPs, rather it focuses on traditional defined contribution and defined benefit plans. While this book seems written for more for budding actuaries, those wishing to study design alternatives or asset management will find this book provides a good background. I find two flaws with the book.First is the lack of examples. While the book discusses full funding limitations, it does not show you an example calculation. While it tells you how to calculate the minimum liability, it does not show you an example of how to present it in the financial statements. This book is not a text book, but it would be very helpful to see some real examples in practice rather than only discussions about the rationale behind the method.Second, the single chapter on pension accounting is weak. Issues not mentioned include accounting for minimum liability, disclosures under FAS 132, understanding the relationship between funding and expense, curtailments and other plan amendments, the interrelationships between the conflicting limitations of ERISA/IRC/GAAP, the effect of pension assumptions on the financial statements and the impact of FAS 87 for an over funded plan on the financial statements of the sponsor. The perspective focuses more on the reasons the accounting standards exist, not the strategy or day-to-day issues of how the pension affects the financial statements of the sponsor. If accounting is what you need, buy a current intermediate accounting book."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of private pensions","review":"Very coplete study, covering almost all imaginable subjects, from actuarial maths to investment management to organisation and HR aspects of pension provision. This is not a manual, though.

Accordingly, it is apleasure to welcome the 9th edition, published under the auspices of the Pension ResearchCouncil of the Wharton School, and featuring a dream team of authors: Dan M. McGill, KyleN. Brown, John J. Haley, Sylvester J. Schieber, and Mark J. Warshawsky.As always, the book's coverage is comprehensive and includes an array of empiricaland statistical data in addition to thorough coverage of the laws and policies that shapethe American retirement system. The book provides good coverage of recent developments,including the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the growth of hybrid plans and the (slow)emergence of phased retirement. The book also includes a good chapter on the most problematicissue arising from the trend towards defined contribution plans, namely the risk thatindividuals will outlive their resources in retirement.Although the pension laws have been amended frequently since the enactment of theEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), these changes have mainlytinkered with the rules, not always for the better. For at least the last 15 years, pension scholarshave been advocating systemic changes. ERISA responded to problems and workplace conditionsof the 1960s: today's problems and conditions are very different.The need for change has become more urgent as a result of the recent financial crises.However, the Obama Administration faces major problems that must take priority over changingthe private pension rules including: two wars; reinvigorating the economy; the credit crisis ;the health care system in general and Medicare and Medicaid in particular; and putting SocialSecurity on a firmer financial footing. Pension reform is controversial: will this Administrationor Congress have the time or the political will to address fundamental, long-term reform?Despite all efforts by Congress, private sector pension coverage has hovered around 50%forseveral decades, and the percentage with adequate coverage is far less than 50%. Recentlegislative initiatives have focused on encouraging individuals to save more for retirement: butin the present environment that approach is unrealistic, particularly for the lower incomeworkers who are most at risk. Adequate retirement income requires mandates. There is a strongargument for severing completely the link between health care coverage and employment, andperhaps the same approach would, in the long run, improve our retirement system.One of the great virtues of the book is that it collects and analyzes information from manysources and many disciplines, and I am not aware of any other single-volume work with suchbroad coverage. Nevertheless, I have a short wish list, probably idiosyncratic, of features thatI would like to see covered or covered in more detail, in future editions. The final chapter of thepresent work discusses the future of pensions, and I suggest that this chapter could be expandedsignificantly by delving into several unanswered questions.First, despite some recent cutbacks by major employers, problems of pension coverage andadequacy disproportionately affect part-time employees and employees of small employers.Why is this the case and how can this problem be addressed? Second, it is clear that the rateof contributions must be increased. The current tax incentives are both very expensive andineffective. What combination of carrots and sticks is best designed to achieve this goal?Third, it is not enough to get money into the system: we must try to keep it in the system byincreasing portability and reducing pre-retirement leakage. Social Security is a good model: butan enhancement of retirement security by increasing Social Security benefits does not appear atall likely to happen. Fourth, the runaway cost of health care and the amount of waste in thehealth care system directly reduce the level of retirement security, by reducing the amountsavailable for contribution and by increasing the amount required in retirement.Book reviews 151Fifth, the amount held in individual retirement accounts (primarily rollover IRAs) is nowgreater than the amount held in private sector defined benefit plans or private sector definedcontribution plans, yet the rules governing IRAs have not evolved to reflect this. Sixth, we needto develop a better framework for regulating investments by all types of retirement plans.Finally, we need to develop better distribution alternatives for individuals with account-basedretirement savings. We should not expect every retiree to invest successfully and take appropriatedistributions over a period of up to 40 years, a period in which mental acuity is likely todiminish.The authors may legitimately claim that these topics are not part of the book they set out towrite. However, their inclusion would make an excellent book even better.DAVID PRATTProfessor of Law, Albany Law School"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of private pensions","review":"Clear, comprehensive, well-organized and updated.

Wright and home friendly books from Joyce Goldstein and others. The list goes on and on. Mediterranean cooking has been addressed from about every angle you can think of, but part of that interest is due to Ms. Wolfert's own works, starting with her landmark \`Couscous and Other Good Food from Morocco'. But, if this volume were the only one you had on \`Mediterranean Cuisine', you should count yourself fortunate that you found this book.While this is not a scholarly book by most standards, like all of Ms. Wolfert's works, it is much more than a list of recipes. One major premise of the book is that a native of a region on the Mediterranean coast could walk the perimeter of this Sea and find familiar food all along the shores of the old Roman Empire. This forms the basis of Ms. Wolfert's organization of chapters which is based on the leading foodstuffs of the Mediterranean from the Maghreb (Northern Africa from Morocco to Tunisia) to the Levant (Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, and Syria). In fact, I have to suspect than friend Nancy Harmon Jenkins borrowed Ms. Wolfert's concept of how to present Mediterranean cuisine in Jenkins' 2003 book, \`The Essential Mediterranean'.Ms. Wolfert's basis for choosing recipes she states in for simple reasons. First there are \`...great and famous dishes for which I can find superb recipes'. Second are \`...regional and unusual dishes'. Third are \`...dishes which illustrate contrasting or similar uses for the same materials'. Fourth are \`...delicious dishes that are not widely known'. All this means is that \`This is a very personal book, a book of food that interests me'. And, almost all of the recipes come from home cooks acquired on Ms. Wolfert's many regular trips to the lands of the Mediterranean.One warning is necessary about the publisher's blurb that this second (1994) edition contains '75 new recipes'. In the introduction, Ms. Wolfert herself says that this has been more of a trade of 75 healthier, less fatty recipes for 60 older recipes. The book is not that much larger than the original edition, but I think all of this is of only minor concern, as the real value of the book lies in the insights Ms. Wolfert gives on the overall world of Mediterranean cookery.The flagship chapter tells the story of the combination of \`Garlic and Oil' in Mediterranean cuisine. There are recipes combining these two items from one end of the Mediterranean to the other and Ms. Wolfert presents several samples from Spain, France, Italy, and Greece. The last of these recipes for \`Sauce Rouille', a classic condiment for Bouillabaisse leads to Ms. Wolfert's riff on why bouillabaisse purists say that this dish cannot be made beyond 100 kilometers of Marseilles. All of this is done with a rather large sense of tongue in cheek. To make restitution, Ms. Wolfert offers us two recipes for the much less legendary \`Soupe de Poisson', a simple Provencal fish soup with but one white fleshed saltwater fish.The olive oil and garlic chapter is followed by a chapter on olives themselves. Ms. Wolfert piques our intellect by observing that if you divide the Mediterranean with an imaginary line down the sole of the Italian boot, along the eastern shore of Sicily, and down the boundary between Tunisia and Libya, you will have divided the cuisines into those who eat olives marinated and cured (the east of this line) and those who eat olives cooked with their dishes (Spain, France, Italy, the Maghreb). Ms. Wolfert has no good idea why this should be and the only thought I can offer is that this is roughly the boundary between the Eastern and Western Roman Empires when the split was made between Rome and Constantinople.The most famous of all cooked olive dishes is probably the Neapolitan \`Spaghetti alla Puttanesca'. Ms. Wolfert gives us a new explanation for the origin of this easy dish and befitting its fame, offers three different recipes. The most traditional includes a tomato sauce. Ms. Wolfert's two alternatives include no tomatoes, but are heavy on basil or peppers and raisins. All three are as fast or faster than any other recipes I have seen.The remaining chapters are on:Eggplant, Tomatoes, Peppers, and Other Mediterranean VegetablesChick-Peas, Lentils, and BeansPasta, Couscous, and Other Mediterranean Farinaceous FoodsHerbs, Spices, and AromaticsYogurtCheeseNutsLemons, Oranges, Figs, Dates, and other Mediterranean FruitsAs familiar as all of these subjects are, Ms. Wolfert has something new to say on most of them. On cheese, for example, while the most famous of Mediterranean young cheeses are mozzarella and feta, Ms. Wolfert gives equal time to Sardinian and Egyptian varieties. The highest praise is reserved, of course for Parmesano Reggiano.Since this edition was published in 1994, before the full flourishing of the Internet, all sources are mail order only, but most of these sources are familiar to all us foodies, so tracking down their Internet sites should be pretty easy. The Bibliography is modest with almost all entries being books available in English such as titles from Elizabeth David, Alan Davidson, Waverley Root, Claudia Roden, and other English and American writers.Just like her hero, Elizabeth David, Ms. Wolfert has written many excellent books, but if you could have but one from each author, I would take this volume and Ms. David's first \`A Book of Mediterranean Food'."},{"Title":"Mediterranean Cooking","review":"I would have liked to see more recipes from Syria and Lebanon, although the ones that are included are very good.

Also, like so many other cookbooks, the index is annoying. There are recipes for gazpacho, but if you look under \\"Soups\\" it's only shown as \\"cold vegetable\\". Same with Pasta Puttanesca no mention of it in the index at all, only \\"spaghetti with olive sauce.\\"But don't let this discourage you, if you only want a single Mediterranean cookbook, get this one.

I agree that his tone is not too novice-targetted, nor is it too technical. He uses Microsoft Movie Maker 2, Pinnacle Studio 8 and Ulead VideoStudio 7 for most of his illustrations. Unfortunately, although the book came out this year, as is common with software, Pinnacle is up to Version 9 and Ulead up to version 8. He does cover other prosumer editors like Vegas, Liquid Edition, and Premier, but the book is primarily focused on users of consumer editors and equipment, not the professionals. That was Ok with me.His advise on equipment and technique was interesting to read although, in my opinion, he did not spend enough time on accessories. This is not the best book for advice on accessories. Most of his time is spent on video editing software. As is also unfortunately common, he did not talk about set-top stand-alone DVD recorders, which some people use for archiving. I found his advise on \\"The Basics of Shooting\\" to be quite helpful.(2) The book can be a bit wordy and he overuses the adjective \\"lovely\\" to describe software features, effects, pictures, etc. It sounds a little odd sometimes.(3) For equipment and software, his focus on Sony camcorders sound unnecessarily. Similarly, he sometimes sound like a salesman for Pinnacle Studio. Now, I happen to like Sony camcorders (I am on my third) and Pinnacle Studio (warts and all) but I would have preferred more balanced descriptions. So, if you do not have Pinnacle or Ulead VideoStudio (both of which I have) you may feel a little put out.Overall, a useful book. It could be better, but for $20.39 on Amazon, I think anyone relatively new to digital video would find the book helpful and worth the money."},{"Title":"PC MagazineGuide to Digital Video","review":"This is a field that spans both hardware and software. Unlike, for example, Photoshop, which is a pure software construct. If you're going into digital video, the hardware issues alone can be daunting. Important things like choosing an internal analog capture card. Who are the main vendors? What are the salient features to compare? Ozer gives you these data.In software, you have to pick some video editor. These run the gamut from the entry level Microsoft Movie Maker 2 to more powerful and expensive alternatives like Pinnacle Edition, Sonic Foundry Vegas or Adobe Premiere Pro.Many other issues are shown in the book.

Its kind of funny, as I was reading it, I realized how much time this book would have saved me if I had it just one month earlier. All the countless hours I spent on the web (consumer reports, pcmag.com, etc) doing the research on the proper gear and the must haves to go along with it. This book answered all my questions and a lot more that I had never even thought of. One of the interesting things that I can think of off hand was the audio setting during recording. After reading the manual that came with my camera, it suggested that I left audio setting at 12bit. They claimed that this would allow room for more audio tracks. After reading this book, I realized that most of us aren't going to feed an extra audio track into our cameras, we will more than likely do it post recording in pinnacle or other editing software. So I switched to 16bit and it will stay there. Also another misconception that was pointed out was recording in 16x9. Most of us think that 16x9 will capture more video, when in fact this is true for professional movie makers with cameras most of us cant afford, but not so for just regular consumers. The fact is 16x9 captures less video, then the standard 4x3. This is great book for those considering home video and those well established in the home video arena. I highly recommend this book to those in seek of answers to everything video."},{"Title":"PC MagazineGuide to Digital Video","review":"1. This book covers basic, though fairly advanced digital video topics. The progression of the book is smooth, and easily followed. The author does not assume the reader is a \`dummy', yet he does not frustrate us with overly-technical prose.

The author frequently provides a product comparison matrix to help you decide what product or feature set will work for your situation.3. Reading this book beats standing in front of a retail rack of product boxes, with wildly varying prices, claims and features.

The author may go a little deeper into repairing houses than the average fix-up investor goes. Dworin is addressing serious renovation work on houses, way beyond just painting and clean -up.There is good money to be made in home remodeling, particularly if can do most, or all, of the work yourself.The most valuable chapter in the book to me is Chapter 6 \\"What Work Should You Do?\\" Dworin says not to waste time and money on repairs that buyers won't pay extra for. All houses will have flaws, and buyers don't scrutinize each item in a house, they look at the whole package. If you try to make a house flawless, you'll only wind up charging too much for the house and not finding a buyer. I like how the author describes the various typical problems that are found in houses. He goes on to explain whether or not it is necessary to repair each item, and if so, tells you how to do it.Most of the book is devoted to describing various parts of a house and how to make repairs to each part. The book is a little dated in that it describes how to make repairs to things that are no longer commonly found in houses, such as old style gas-gravity furnaces. However, that is the exception rather than the rule. You can find many good repair tips in this book.For those who want to go a little deeper into home renovation, this is a good book to read and keep. For those who are just doing fix-up houses that require lighter repair, its useful for you too, if only to see what else is possible, or what you could aspire to do in the future.Terry Sprouse is author of the book, \\"How to Start Your Own House Fix-up and Rental Business in Your Spare Time.\\""},{"Title":"Profits in Buying and Renovating Homes","review":"Written by spec rehab professional Lawrence Dworin, Profits in Buying & Renovating Homes is an in-depth guide to buying, repairing, and selling fixer-upper homes.

Not a topic traditionally dicussed in our graduate schools of social work, it will grow dramatically in importance as the way social services are provided to people in need.The book begins by defining the meaning of religiously based social work. Various entites can provide social services in a religious setting, among them local congregations, interfaith agencies, national projects such as Habitat for Humanity and sectarian agencies like Catholic Social Services, relief organizations, and religiously affiliated international organizations. The book details the purposes each of these types of organizations serve, and discusses the role that they play in the provision of social services.Part two of the book discusses the theological bases and the historical emphases on religion in social work. It reflects upon the fact that many social services started out as religiously affiliated agencies, but as social work became a profession rather than a beneficient activity, the rift between social work and religion began to grow. The authors discuss how infrequently religion arises today in the professional educational activities of social workers, such as MSW programs and professional conferences.The book then discusses the religiously based social services provided in two locales: Philadelphia and Greensboro. The examination of religiously-based services in two areas can serve as a jumping-off point for how other locales examine their provision of services.The intersection of religion and social work is sure to grow in importance as the federal government continues devolving responsibility for social progams to state and local government, and permits more involvement by religiously affiliated agencies. The Newer Deal is an excellent book to consider both the good and bad aspects of this fundamental change in social work."},{"Title":"Contemporary Irish Drama: From Beckett to McGuinness","review":"A good counterpart to recent surveys by Christopher Murray and by Nicholas Grene, Dr Roche concentrates on Irish drama over roughly the post-WW2 period up to the early 1990s. His juxtapositions work energetically to open up new perspectives on Beckett--no small feat given the weight of scholarship that confronts the novice to his drama. By playing off Godot against Behan's Quare Fellow, we see that Roche's thesis--of the recent Irish drama less concerned with conventional plot than an entry into the void, what waits outside the wings of the stage--gains force.His chapters on Tom Murphy, Friel, Tom Kilroy, and plays about \\"The Troubles\\" continue this exploration into less comforting, confrontational plays exploding (at best) stereotypical limitations of Ireland and its representation. Roche avoids jargon, constructs his points carefully and cleverly, and brings to us welcome insights and a refusal to fall into cliche as he winnows down forty-odd years of plays to concentrate on the writers best suited to challenge us today.At one point he reflects how lucky he was to see a particular play in many performances, and how he sat \\"rapt.\\" Such enthusiasm, tempered with a wide knowledge of contexts within which internationally and locally to place the drama he studies, add to the appeal and the energy found in this volume."},{"Title":"Master of Middle Earth the Fiction of J.R.R. Tolkien","review":"Countless scholars and quite a few amateurs have tried to dissect the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. Most do a rotten job. But Paul Kocher actually does it well -- while his essays are a bit outdated, \\"Master of Middle-Earth : The Fiction of J.R.R. Tolkien\\" still stand as some of the best interpretations of Tolkien's work.Kocher tackles such subjects as whether Middle-Earth is really an imaginary world, or one tied closely to reality, followed by a critical look at \\"The Hobbit\\" and how it related -- or doesn't -- to \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" One of the most intriguing essays in here is \\"Cosmic Order,\\" a look at how Tolkien portrays free will, predestination and fate, followed by a study of how Tolkien writes Sauron and the other evil creatures of Middle-Earth, such as orcs (which Kocher thinks are trained to be evil) and barrow wights.Kocher then does a 180 and looks at the free peoples of Middle-Earth, and the importance of each race. A careful study of Aragorn follows, tracing the uncrowned king's subtle development over the entire trilogy and studying his status as a hero. As a grand finale, Kocher examines various short works that Tolkien wrote or translated, including the lesser known creations like \\"Imram.\\"Most people who analyze \\"Lord of the Rings\\" end up like that guy in Nabokov's \\"Pale Fire\\" -- they see only what they want to see. But Paul H. Kocher, who was a professor at Stanford, does a very good job of analyzing \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" Certainly nothing has been put out that disproves him.Kocher obviously had a great deal of respect for Tolkien, even speaking with intense scorn about people who dismiss \\"Lord of the Rings\\" as \\"just an adventure story.\\" But he doesn't pull his punches due to that respect -- he's about as honest as he can be when he doesn't like something, such as the cockney-speaking Trolls.Kocher's essays are somewhat out of date, since they were written in the 1970s, long before the \\"Unfinished Tales\\" book was published, and it only dips into the \\"Silmarillion.\\" But at the same time, his essays are thoughtful and in tune with Tolkien's trilogy, and stick closely to Tolkien's Christian beliefs and his mythic influences.\\"Master of Middle-Earth : The Fiction of J.R.R. Tolkien\\" is a solid resource for people who have read \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Master of Middle Earth the Fiction of J.R.R. Tolkien","review":"This book sets out Kocher's interpretation of Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The main weakness of this book is the scant coverage of The Silmarillion - perhaps understandable as Kocher has another book devoted to it.Kocher had a law dgree and a PhD, both fron Stanford, where he also taught English. He may have practised law - which may account for his lawyerly analysis in this book of Aragorn as the key character of Middle Earth.If you read only one book to help you along as you read Tolkien's books, this could be a good choice.

Tolkien","review":"The author is deceased, and the text has never been altered since its original publication in 1972, so some of its facts are outdated. But the bulk of the book remains insightful and useful: nothing published since has invalidated Kocher's discussion of the moral stances and the nature of evil shown in LotR. He also provides the best analysis ever published of the character of Aragorn, and what are still the only studies of the rare poems \\"The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun\\" and \\"Imram\\". But it would have been nice to have added a footnote saying that \\"Imram\\" is now easily available in its original context (unknown to Kocher) of The Notion Club Papers (in Sauron Defeated, p. 296-9)."},{"Title":"Master of Middle Earth the Fiction of J.R.R.

The chapter on Aragorn is an extended discussion of his place in the LR, and Kocher's opinion that he is the real hero of the work. This chapter alone makes Kocher's book well worth reading.The last chapter, \\"Seven Leaves,\\" may be of less interest because six of the \\"leaves\\" are about JRRT's writings that are on non-Middle Earth topics.Although the book was published in 1972, it does not appear to me to be outdated by later JRRT publications, and can be enjoyed by anyone who has read \\"The Hobbit\\" and LR."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground: 150th Anniversary Edition","review":"I found Dostoyevsky through reading (about) Charles Bukowski, and I gotta say I'm very impressed. For a writer back in 1800's Russia, I found his writing VERY contemporary, especially in the fatalist/nihilist tone... Like Orwell's 1984 (and Animal Farm), Dostoyevsky looked into the future and saw a miserable anti-human society built on fear, paranoia, self-hatred, and a misanthropic/selfish state of mind that our world has de-evolved into. Read this and see into the mind of the majority of the 21st Century human race.

As I read the story, I couldn't help comparing the main character's behavior to that of George Castanza (from Seinfeld)--had George lived in 1850's St Petersburg, that is. The pointless manipulations, emotional immaturity, and stunning combination of bluster and impotence exhibited by the story's anti-hero is fascinating, funny, and (yes) pathetic. Dostoyevsky brilliantly (perhaps unwittingly) created the template for the modern day male neurotic."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground: 150th Anniversary Edition","review":"I will not delve into the brilliant work of nascent existentialism that Dostoevsky's \\"Notes From Underground\\" represents as there are plenty of reviews who have already done that for me. I do want to help customers in choosing a translation out of the many that are available, as there doesn't seem to be much to guide one through them here.Perhaps the best translation I've found to date is that by Andrew MacAndrew, available in a Signet Classics edition. MacAndrew's prose has a vigor and modern clarity that truly make this work speak to the reader - the Underground Man truly comes to life as a living, breathing character with a relevance and immediacy.For all the praise the Pevear/Volokhonsky translations have gotten, I do not think they necessarily surpass the efforts of those who came before them in this particular instance. Although a big fan of their Tolstoy, the Dostoevsky comes off somewhat comparatively muted.Compare MacAndrew's rendering of the opening words in which the Underground Man introduces himself:\\"I'm a sick man... a mean man. There's nothing attractive about me. I think there's something wrong with my liver. But, actually, I don't know a damn thing about my sickness; I'm not even too sure what it is that's ailing me.\\"To Pevear/Volokhonsky's:\\"I am a sick man... I am a wicked man. An unattractive man. I think my liver hurts. However, I don't know a fig about my sickness and am not sure what it is that hurts me.\\"Of the two, MacAndrew's Underground Man obviously speaks a more contemporary English. I am aware that this has actually been a criticism of his. In fact, many readers might actually be put off by the brusque and terse take or find it even slightly disturbing. Purists will also doubtless find much to annoy them about MacAndrew's more interpretive (as opposed to literal) approach to translation. The Pevear/Volokhonsky actually appeared in 1993, about 30 years after MacAndrew's. There's nothing particularly wrong with their version. It has a stately, nuanced charm and is apparently much truer to Dostoevsky's original in the literal sense (to the point of translating his flaws and idiosyncrasies). But personally, as a reader, I just got much more out of reading the MacAndrew translation. You immediately get a taste of the angst of this character from MacAndrew's terse, flippant diction.Two others to take note of: The classic Constance Garrett translation can still be found in a cheap Barnes and Noble Classics edition, along with a good selection of Dostoevsky's shorter works. Garnett's haphazard, hasty, and somewhat reckless method of translation has been much criticised, as has her quaintly Victorian diction. Mirra Ginsberg's translation in the Bantam Classics series matches the Pevear/Volokhonsky translation almost word-for-word, although I find the wording where she deviates to actually be better overall."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground: 150th Anniversary Edition","review":"The incable of love, a man in the undergound questions the validity the objective reality and the norms of normal morality. Rages against the positivist notions of social order - and claims himself that \\"he couldn't even make an insect of himself\\". In Notes from Underground, Dostoyevsky plunges into the depths of the human soul to discover selfish and evil tendencies that was already inherent in the human mind and brings this out very generously in the book. \\"I am a sick man. I am an angry man. I am an unattractive man\\" perhaps gives us an idea of the personity of this man, and essentially about some of us that exist in the world.A great book by a great author; if you are interested in reading about a guy who throws into question the validity of positivism, moral order, and human kindness, this would be a great book to read."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground: 150th Anniversary Edition","review":"\\" . . . it's hardly literature so much as a corrective punishment.\\"While reading Part I of \\"Notes from Underground,\\" you'll undoubtedly get the same feeling. The first third of the novel is a practice in rambling conjecture, as the protagonist of the novel, the \\"Underground Man\\", espouses his thoughts and beliefs on his miserable and embittered life. However, Part II picks up interest as Dostoyevsky presents a short, yet powerful, story of this castaway and how he become so alienated from \\"real\\" life.Without a doubt, the protagonist is a haughty, arrogant erudite who feels himself superior to others. Set in 1860s St. Petersburg, the protagonist immerses himself in Romantic literature and comes to view the world through these unrealistic novels. Yet, in practice he fails to act upon any of the noble ideals set forth in the novels and comes to despise himself. His self-loathing and self-pity manifests itself into a vile existence, where self-delusion and an active imagination takes the place of real social interaction in the outside world. Although the protagonist later derides a prostitute on her doomed existence, it is he who is doomed to an early death with no mourners at his funeral.While the first part of the novel is a droll treatise on his twisted philosophy, the second part details the protagonist's pitiful attempts at maintain dignity and self-worth. Although he thinks highly of himself, his delusions of grandeur are quickly squashed by those who do not care about his existence, such as an officer who barely notices him as he pushes him out of the way everyday.Perhaps most disturbing is the protagonist's stance on love. To him, love is not about a mutual respect and caring for each other, but is merely a sadomasochistic game of power and domination. To him, being loved means allowing another to tyrannize and control yourself. The loving relationship must include a domineering partner and a submissive partner. Indeed, the protagonist is incapable of real love and quickly repels any hope of love.Overall, \\"Notes From Underground\\" delivers a poignant psychological case study of an individual far removed from society, who despises everyone and thinks there is a cabal of conspirators to subjugate him to his poverty-stricken existence. Written almost 150 years ago, this novel is still relevant today. Most of us, myself included, have certain qualities of the \\"Underground Man\\" espoused in this novel, as it is hard not to become alienated and hardened in modern society. Once again, if you can slug your way through the tedious Part I, you are rewarded in the end."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground: 150th Anniversary Edition","review":"I just finished reading this text, and I must say this is one of the most powerful books I have had the privelege of reading. Dostoyevsky penetrates the depths of individuals who are alienated from and yet envious of society. I have never read anything as remarkbly accurate as this text is in representing this complex, torturous situation.This text will alter your perception and change your way of thinking, creating an epiphanic experience that is spiritually enlightening and ultimately rewarding."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground: 150th Anniversary Edition","review":"this is one of the best books i've read to date. its about a man and his failure to connect with the world around him. the novel is spilt up into two parts. chronologically the first part happened after the second part so is essentially the underground man reflecting on his past, by a theoretical means. the first part of the book is a philosophy on life and people, and the second part is the manifestation of what he was talking about in the first part.the underground man is an interesting character because throughout the novel he liberally depreciates himself and celebrates his own misery. he says that he is doomed to be miserable because of his intelligence, because he has the capacity to critically observe the world, and yet because of this very fact he says that he can never be an insect. this reminds me of a quote from Nietzsche 'even a man who despises himself respects himself as one who despises'. but overall, this over critical approach to living hinders the underground man so that he is quite passive throughout the novel, despite his words, which i suppose could be considered an action of sorts. and it's because of this passivity that he fails at connecting with others, isolating himself with his thoughts. now it could be argued that his refusal to act is an expression of his utilizing his freedoms. he acts in a way that is not accepted by society, which is why he is so isolated, but by isolating himself, he is demonstrating that he has the capacity to exercise free thought and action, to not blindly follow the status quo. his outcast status is the ultimate freedom, and yet he's so miserable, which would tie into the intelligence bit. and all of this would leave him going in circles in his thoughts, making them all sound paradoxical because if he does or doesn't he's screwed kind of thing, so he's passive.but it's good. i liked the theory a bit more than the story manifesting the theory, partially because it gets rid of the trappings and gets right down to the concepts, so less digging on my part, though the digging can be fun i'll admit. i'm in something of a dystopian phase right now and revel in all like material, so this book came to me at a great time. i recommend it to everyone. its a great read and gives you something to think about."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground: 150th Anniversary Edition","review":"This book is as great as all dostoyevsky books.I was in stitches with the Dostoyevskys perceptions. Bumping into a gentlemen then going out to buy a new suit just so he could look respectable when he bumped him back."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground: 150th Anniversary Edition","review":"Dostoyevsky led a troubled life and struggled with the questions of suffering and the meaning of life. The opening line of Notes From Underground sums it up, \\"I am a sick man...\\" Underground is difficult reading, especially for such a short book. It is all over the place with many different streams of consciousness. It appears to be very autobiographical and this is what was the most value to me. If you are a fan of Dostoyevsky, this is essential reading, because it will give you insight into the man and help you understand his more popular works better. The short story \\"The Dream of a Ridiculous Man,\\" also significantly contributes to an understanding of the man.On a side note, the included short stories \\"White Nights\\" and selections from \\"The House of the Dead,\\" were interesting stories that can stand on their own.In short, this is recommended for fans of Dostoyevsky, but the average reader might want to avoid."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground: 150th Anniversary Edition","review":"This is one of those books that would be suitable for multiple readings, each time coming away with more than you had the last.Fabulous book. The first part had me very frustrated. It's stream of consciousness writing, and frankly I can't always follow my own stream of consciousness so Dostoyevsky's lost me a bit. But that is only the first 28 pages (in the edition I have).In the second part \\"A propos of wet snow\\" it really picks up. The underground man is very much the anti-hero. He is just not a good person, the kind we all hope we aren't. Whats funny though is that in an overexaggerated sense he could be all of us. I don't want to give too much away here.....Near the end of the book, when he meets Liza is the most interesting part in my opinion. Through out the entire book he claims to be honest with himself, but it seems like his conversation with Liza is the only time in which he actually is honest. This is short lived however, as he leaves in a hurry and draws back...I am not going to tell you much more...I believe that is what the editor's review is for....Great book...you will understand why Dostoyevsky is one of the greats!"},{"Title":"Notes From Underground: 150th Anniversary Edition","review":"Dostoyevsky is Dostoyevsky, and if you care about literature you will read his great works if you haven't already. But what makes this edition of one of those great works, Notes from Underground, great is that it is combined with other shorter works from different periods in his life. Dostoyevsky is serious stuff. Living in a time and a place of brutal oppression, he could do nothing else but write about the serious questions of life. And through the writings chosen for this collection, we can see the progression of his thoughts and beliefs as he aged.We start with \`White Nights', a story of selflessness in which a young man helps a girl connect with her love even though he loves her too. Though this story has the grave tone common of 19th century Russian literature, it has a tinge of hopefulness in the man's sacrifice. This is the young and idealistic Dostoyevsky, before he was jailed for having \`revolutionary ideas' and sentenced to death only to be pardoned moments from being shot. Obviously this had a great impact on his mind and went a long way towards destroying any hopefulness he had. The transition is seen in the three stories selected from The House of the Dead, his first successful work. Written in 1862, or about a decade after his imprisonment, these stories tell of senseless murderers and corporal punishers. Almost entirely devoid of emotion, we can see a Dostoyevsky who has gone inward and narrates simply and pragmatically. Life has become a matter of survival, with no room for the sentimentality of the protagonist in \`White Nights'.Then in the main event, Notes from Underground, the emotion is back, but it has been transformed into anger and hatred in the form of the bitter and isolated narrator. There is much existentialist (this work is considered the founding work of existentialism) rambling in the first part, as he debates with us, the reader (even though these are his memoirs, not a two way discussion) about logic and determinism, arguing that man will not always do what's best for himself, as propounded by the utopians of the time, but will often act in direct antagonism towards themselves to display \`individualism'. And, as he is an \`individual', he cannot act properly in society, which is why he is now isolated and bitter. Then he gets into a proper narrative in Part II, as he demonstrates his ideas to us with stories from his earlier life. There are three parts to this, but the most interesting is the last: his brief encounter with a prostitute, where he shows the inkling of decency and love towards her, but rejects her when she returns it. Despite feeling much revulsion for the narrator to this point, there is a sense of poignancy at this end for him, and perhaps reflects both Dostoyevsky's struggle with society after his imprisonment, and our admiration for him despite his nihilistic views.The collection closes with Dream of a Ridiculous Man, a story written just a few years before his death. In it, a man decides life is meaningless and wants to commit suicide. He chances upon a little girl whose mother needs help, but he brushes the girl away. He then goes home, feels guilty, falls asleep, and has a dream. In the dream he goes to a utopia where everyone is happy until heteaches them to lie and ruins the society. He awakens a changed man who only wants to love others as himself. Near the end of his life, Dostoyevsky had found God."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground: 150th Anniversary Edition","review":"This story can stimulate your thoughts in many directions: history, philosophy, psychology, your own existence.

It is a useful, user-friendly dictionary into the Native American language spoken in Eastern and Central Massachusetts, prior to the coming of the Pilgrims and Puritans. An actual DICTIONARY. Not just a list of towns with Native American names, or a phrase book, but a whole dictionary. This is a serious, major \\"find,\\" if you or someone you know has an interest in this kind of thing, and happen to live in the eastern Massachusetts area.This language was sometimes called Natick, sometimes Massachuset(t), or sometimes Wampanoag. Edward Everett Hale wrote an introduction for this volume, which helps place the topic in historic perspective. James Hammond Trumbull, the dictionary's compiler, was the State Librarian of Connecticut for many years, in the 19th century. He was one of the leading authorities of his time, in various subjects of New England antiquarian interest, and was awarded several honorary degrees from Yale University. He published many other books, leaflets and articles on the topic of the native tongues of pre-colonial New England. If you'd like to see more of his works, look online for a copy of \\"Bibliography Of The Algonquian Languages,\\" by James Constantine Pilling. You can sometimes find a used copy for sale.Trumbull's primary source for this dictionary was John Eliot's so-called \\"Indian Bible,\\" printed in 1663. If you'd like to seek out a copy, you will probably have to find it on microfilm, unless you have access to a really amazing library. The title of the microfilm is listed today as \\"Mamusse wunneetupanatamwe Up-Biblium God naneeswe Nukkone Testament kah wonk Wusku Testament [microform] / ne quoshkinnumuk nashpe Wuttinneumoh Christ noh asoowesit John Eliot,\\" by University Microfilms International, in Ann Arbor, Michigan. If that's too much of a mouthful, (or keyboardful, as the case may be), try doing keyword searches in a large library's OPAC for the terms \\"Eliot,\\" \\"Massachuset,\\" \\"Bible,\\" and \\"1663.\\" Observe the way I just spelled \\"Massachuset,\\" with one \\"t\\" and no \\"s\\" at the end. Sometimes a library's cataloguer might have spelled it with two \\"t\\"s, but they shouldn't have put in an \\"s.\\" You might need to try a few different spellings, but you should be able to get it in three or four tries.One thing to be careful about -- Trumbull occasionally tries to make speculative connections between these words and the languages of Asia, or the Phoenicians, or the ancient Hebrews. He doesn't do this too much, but it happens now and then. In many ways Trumbull was a creature of his times, of course, and in his field of study, that means that he was prone to speculating rashly about the origins of Native American tongues. Trumbull passed away long before anyone knew about the land bridge across the Bering Staits, so you should try to cut him some slack on this issue. No one really had a clue, about how long the people of this continent had been here. Just try to stick close to the actual dictionary function of this interesting book, and don't get too caught up in the ill-informed etymological speculations.The dictionary itself is almost 350 pages long, and each word is carefully cross-referenced to the biblical verse it appears in, in Eliot. The alphabet used is basically our own, although there are a few differences. There is no letter for b, c, d, f, g, l, v, x, or z. Some of these may seem wrong to Massachusetts residents -- there is obviously a \\"c\\" in the Massachusett tongue, as we can see from the word \\"Massachusetts\\" itself, along with Cochituate, Scituate, etc. However, this a question of orthographic convention, and Trumbull's decision not to include a \\"c\\" is as good as any. He does sometimes have \\"ch\\" as a \\"letter.\\" He considers the two symbols to be inseparable in proper Natick. The only other alphabetic oddity is the existence of a letter for \\"double o,\\" which looks like the symbol for infinity. This is alphabetized right after \\"o.\\"Again, the main use of this book would be to grapple with Eliot's \\"Indian Bible,\\" but you might also want to try using it to make sense of local place names, named by this areas original inhabitants. Try John C. Huden's \\"Indian Place Names of New England,\\" or anything by R. A. Douglas Lithgow, if you'd like a compilation of local indian place names. Or, of course, you could just get a local map from AAA.If you're going to try to use this for Eliot's bible, you may also want to know about his \\"Indian Grammar Begun: Or, an Essay to Bring the Indian Language into Rules, for Help of Such As Desire to Learn the Same.\\" That book is available from this online bookstore. You might also want to look online for the Mashpee Wampanoag Language Revitalization Project, under the leadership of Jessie \\"Little Doe\\" Fermino, which has been trying to bring this ancient tongue back to life.Lastly, I'd like to strongly recommend that you look for \\"Native Writings in Massachusett,\\" by Ives Goddard and Kathleen Bragdon. It's a beautiful two volume set, with a lot of amazing things to offer."},{"Title":"Martin Hewitt, investigator","review":"If you like mysteries and great enganging writing skills. . . the kind that keep you up way past your bed time and get you into work late. . . this book if for you. I love Aurthur Conan Doyle, but this guy is better. Half way through the book I found myself reading slower because I didn't want it to end!"},{"Title":"Martin Hewitt, investigator","review":"Martin Hewitt, Investigator is a series of short stories linked by the protagonist, Martin Hewitt, and written down by a good friend, the journalist Brett. The similarities to Doyle's Holmes are striking and most likely intentional. Doyle had killed off Holmes in 1893 and other writers were looking to fill that void.Unlike Holmes, however, Martin Hewitt runs an investigative business, is a very personable gentleman, works well with the police force and easily makes friends. Add to this his ingenious ability for disguise and fluidity in thieves cant and in Mr. Hewitt you have an investigator that is able to blend in anywhere and solve the most intriguing of crimes.In Martin Hewitt, Investigator, Brett gives the details of several of Hewitt's most renowned cases, many of which he was intimately involved with as well. They are tales of impossible to solve crimes that Hewitt was able to crack by piecing together a few clues (a burnt out match, raindrops on a hat, uncapitalized letters in a note) where the police detectives had failed.While the solutions to these various crimes and mysteries do fit together well with the evidence and clues, the reader is not privy to all the information that Hewitt is (as he doesn't share it with Brett). Hewitt then chides Brett (or the police) for not having seen such and such clue and then builds his entire case on that missed bit of information. Morrison uses this ploy to make the solving seem even more spectacular, but this style patronizes the reader and is not a fully satisfying reading experience.----A note on the Kindle edition: There were no errors that I noticed, and the format worked fine on Kindle. Sadly, though, the illustrations aren't available on free editions. There was one story, in particular, that would have benefited by being able to see the floor plan."},{"Title":"Martin Hewitt, investigator","review":"Martin Hewitt is not Sherlock Holmes, but then again, who is? From what I've read, the character of Martin Hewitt was a contemporary to Holmes, and almost seems to me the \\"anti-Holmes\\". However, I did enjoy reading these mysteries very much. I don't think they're any more outdated than the Holmes stories are. But, if you're interested in this book, don't expect it to be like Sherlock Holmes, as Mr. Hewitt is not much like him at all. For example, he's not going to have a client walk into his office and give him his life's history through deduction like Holmes might. The characters don't quite have the personality of the Arthur Conan Doyle characters, and the writing seems simpler, and the mysteries generally simpler. However, I did enjoy reading them very much, and since I think I downloaded this book for free, you can't beat that. I don't think it has an active TOC, but if I remember correctly, very few typos. Anyway, for free you can't complain too much. Mystery lovers, give it a try!"},{"Title":"William Willya and the Washing Machine","review":"This is a great book. It is so interesting - my son wants me to do all the reading, but after a few pages he can't help himself and starts reading the words he knows (he's 5 yrs.)

There are also words repeated over and over so if they didn't know how to say that word at the beginning of the story they usually do by the end! The pictures are great as well. There's a good lesson to be learned (\\"do your work first then do your play\\").

It not only takes you step-by-step through all the basic family and household financial issues, it discusses what to look for if you or your spouse are working for a family or individually-owned business. It helps you to uncover assets that might be hidden. It tells you what to do to document your possessions so that you can prove they existed if they should suddenly disappear, which is not unlikely in divorce situations. It has a sobering chapter on your worst nightmares and how to try to document money that you may have unknowingly contributed to your marriage, believing that you would get credit for if you divorced.

It is NOT biased in directing the reader to a lawyer, but instead offers practical advice when a &quot;one size fits all&quot; or &quot;cookbook&quot; answer would be inappropriate or varies by state or county. To the contrary, a main point of this book is to encourage the reader to understand the financial issues involved, so as to be able to take personal responsibility to try to minimize legal fees. An ounce of prevention can be worth a pound of cure, before making final decisions and signing on the dotted line. Moreover, a word of caution: the judicial system, as in the court, judges, masters, etc. respond negatively to people who represent themselves, particularly when the opposing side has legal representation. Even out of court, if your spouse has a lawyer and you don't, it would be self-destructive to go up against them on your own. It would be folly to try and &quot;buck the system&quot; to save a buck. In fact, if a lawyer recommends this book to a client, that's a good sign that they will NOT take advantage of that client, who is then well informed, and more likely to be able to do some of the background work for themselves. This book helps take the stress out by giving you the knowledge to help yourself and thereby to help your lawyer, IF you use one."},{"Title":"Divorce and Money: Everything You Need to Know","review":"Gayle Rosenwald Smith's book is the most useful and user-friendly book for people going through divorce that I have seen in a long, long time. Her advice is practical, intelligent, and for this Texas divorce lawyer, an invaluable tool that I plan to recommend to all of my clients. It guides the reader through the often confusing jungle of financial issues that arise in divorce in a concise and clear manner without talking down. Especially useful were the &quot;Views from the Bench&quot; and glossary of legal and financial terms. Smith has obviously done her homework, interviewing attorneys, judges and financial advisors across the country. I'd gladly recommend it to anyone who's facing the often confusing and frightening prospect of divorce."},{"Title":"Divorce and Money: Everything You Need to Know","review":"What I liked about this book is that it listed all sorts of things (experts, disasters, retirement, for example)I need to consider and investigate in my divorce.

I cannot recomend this book highly enough. I was confused as to why this informative, excellent book has recieved such negative comments by some of Amazon's reviewers. There is another book with the same title--but with a different sub-title, that was refered to as preferable; even though I found that Nolo Press book (which I examined) to be less informative, more difficult to comprehend and more expensive; $14.95 v. $34.99.Everything You Need To Know, certainly lives up to its promise; helping the reader understand the process--using easy to read charts to compliment the user friendly style; including all of the financial information an individual could possibly need. A bit of reading, including questions to ask your attorney (which it helps the reader to find); will help to defer costs that inevitably will arise.Much the same as Gayle Rosenwald Smith's previous book--WHAT EVERY WOMAN SHOULD KNOW ABOUT DIVORCE AND CUSTODY, her new book will help guide the reader through a very difficult and emotional time--at a price that will not add to a stressful endevor."},{"Title":"Divorce and Money: Everything You Need to Know","review":"... both \\"Divorce & Money\\" books, that is, one by Smith and the other by Woodhouse.

Whether you are looking for answers to your questions, or for what questions you should be asking about the financial aspects of your divorce settlement, it is most likely covered in this book. Sorting out marital finances and identifying all assets, sometimes hidden or overlooked, can be a complex and confusing process. This is a subject about which anyone going through a divorce would be wise to be as fully informed as possible, whether using an attorney or not. Those in the pre-divorce stage will find this information particularly helpful as well, not the least of which is knowing what records will be needed, often more easily obtained and documented before separating. The material presented is practical, comprehensive, clearly organized, and made relevant with some real-life anecdotes. There are helpful charts and asset forms, as well as a list of additional website resources.

A beautiful love story, timely today because America has grown in it's acceptance of color in the President.Rock on Pearl!"},{"Title":"COME, MY BELOVED.","review":"I enjoyed Pearl S. Buck's novels The Good Earth, The Angry Wife and God's Men. I did not get that sense of pleasure with Come, My Beloved. My major criticism about this work is that it has a very s-l-o-w start. We are introduced to David Hardworth MacArd and his son of the same name and their mission in pre-independence India. Gandhi and the nationalist movement are prominently in the background and are viewed as threats to the MacArd mission. In spite of this perceived threat, nothing really happens until page 122, almost halfway through the book, when the son brings his new wife Olivia from the US to India. The MacArds spend their time educating the locals in the MacArd ways, spreading their own personal philosophies as well as the word of God throughout the country.I spent almost the entire length of the novel waiting for the exciting blurb on the back cover to happen:\\"Brought up from birth by Indian customs, Livy was the fourth generation of her American family living in India. Her father and grandparents before her had done much for India in their own stubborn God-fearing way. But now a new spirit of independence stirred in the land, and Livy--part of the changing times--was in love...with a native doctor.'No!' said her missionary father when Livy wanted to marry her Indian lover. 'I cannot allow it!'\\"The character Livy, however, is not introduced until page 243--and the novel is only 279 pages long. Until I read her name I sincerely wondered if the publishers got the blurbs mixed up with another novel. One might believe that Livy would be a central character, but she is nothing more than a minor presence who doesn't stick around for any length of time to give a damn about her. Does she marry her Indian doctor lover? Does her father Ted (David MacArd, Jr.'s son) consent to the marriage? Who cares! In her past novels Buck did not disappoint, but Come, My Beloved is an uneventful tale about four generations of a missionary family whose men and women tend to fall in love and propose after only a couple meetings. Maybe I shouldn't have taken the novel so literally, but the patriarchs of the MacArd family are all too quick to slip wedding rings on fingers of virtual strangers.Buck paints brilliant descriptions, and I liked this image of a sunset:\\"The sun was sinking into the Red Sea in a fury of dying color. Heat smouldered along the horizon, it inflamed the half clouded sky and as the sun touched the water the hot light ran across the smooth sullen water like liquid metal.\\"Even when the story lagged I wanted to go on because I could always succumb to the scenic portraits of rural Indian life. In two of the prior novels I had read, Buck had me hooked with her descriptions of China and I loved her way with words as she described monsoons and even famine in India. Buck lived in China and wrote about it as a native would perceive it; although she did not live in India, she brought to her writing the same sense of intimate acquaintance with her mise-en-sc&egrave;ne."},{"Title":"COME, MY BELOVED.","review":"This is the story of men in search of God.

She is swept back through the years and finds herself lost and alone in the war-torn countryside. She makes her way to a farmhouse and discovers a gravely-wounded Nazi deserter within its walls. Her nurse's sense of duty to help all others compels her to save his life, all the while trying to squelch thoughts that this man could easily have been one of the soldiers who captured her grandfather and held him prisoner during his time fighting there as a German-born American soldier.Despite their suspicions of each other and the secrets they both hide, Peg and Thomas find they need each other to in order to survive in the ravaged countryside and to avoid being caught by the S.S. which is now searching for the young man, who ran away from his paratrooper unit after losing his fiancee in an air raid. The novel chronicles the pair's experiences as they wander from town to town trying to find the impossible: a safe place to live. The mystery of Peg's arrival in the past is finally revealed to her and she is faced with choosing between returning to a safe life in the future . . . without Thomas, or remaining in the past with him, where she has little chance of any future at all.What worked for me:I always enjoy time-travel stories and although most of those I read send the protagonist further back into history, I must say I found the setting of Nazi-controlled Germany refreshing and that the story's plot had some interesting twists to it. The only other book I have read recently set in that era was a mainstream novel, Remarque's \\"A Time to Love, A Time to Die,\\" which obviously didn't have the happy ending normally associated with a romance story as \\"A Love Through Time\\" did.What didn't work for me:The condensed time-line and some of the plot points bothered me a bit. I won't lay them out here and spoil the story, but I WILL say that if my husband turned around and fell in love just a few months after I died, I'd be back to haunt him over it. For sure!Overall:An intriguing and suspenseful story. If you enjoy time-travel romances or have an interest in the lives of ordinary Germans during World War II, it's worth a look. :^)"},{"Title":"A Love Through Time","review":"I loved this book.

A bit old-fashioned, of course, but so agreable to read and enjoy : the heroine always needs a man to help her, and generally falls in love with him, but why not ? Of course, the end of the short story \\"alibi for isabel\\" is'nt what we expected, but that's fine : heroines by Mary R. Rinehart do'nt kill their husbands cold-blooded.

Every story deals with war time back here at home with all the discussions about rationing, blackouts, boys off serving etc. That in itself is not off-putting but the book is supposed to be mystery flavored-and it is not-it's a group of stories about not much of anything.The ONLY little tale that is interesting enough to be recognized is \\"The Lipstick\\" that comes at the very end. It is a clever story that makes you wonder \\"did she fall or was she pushed?\\"I bought this book because my taste runs to the quirky and a little out of the ordinary mystery and/or thriller.

I enjoyed it as a fun light read."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"A classic science fiction and horror mix that includes monsters created by the amoral Dr. Moreau.About: Set in the late 1800's, an educated and professional man named Edward Prendick inadvertently becomes stranded on a South Pacific island. This tropical island houses the laboratories of Dr. Moreau - a mad scientist of sorts who is doing some unusual and cruel experiments on animals on the remote island. Although Moreau attempts to hide his studies from the stranded newcomer, Prendick eventually finds out what is becoming of the animals when he hears screaming from the laboratories. Prendick is naturally terrified that he too may become one of the doctor's subjects.Thoughts: Originally published in 1896, the novel is an adventure, with some thrilling twists in a spectacular setting. It's definitely horrific and scientific, although the science is unrealistic based upon today's standards. It has also been adapted into a variety of movies over the past 100 years. Some look interesting, so I plan to watch a select few since a movie version could be fun and I think would translate well.There is some interesting commentary hidden in the story, bringing up questions around human and animal social structure, issues of vivisection, definitions of pain, and some unusual monsters; which in some ways reminded me of Frankenstein. So it could be an excellent book for discussion - take a look at its Wikipedia page where there is loads of fodder for thought: [...]Highly recommended for anyone interested in stories with darker themes. Only 200 pages or so, or just several hours of listening time, I finished it quickly. It was a great read since I love science fiction, horror, and classics and this is all three.

The book also came sooner then the \\"expected date or arrival\\""},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"This classic from 1896 is thrilling from the very first page. It begins with three men afloat aboard a dingy after the sinking of their ship. One is the narrator, Edward Prendick, who eventually finds himself on another ship sailing to a nameless and isolated island. The island is populated by strange creatures and an enigmatic leader who he finds to be Dr. Moreau. This name is known to him as a scientist of ill repute run out of London years prior.Prendick soon learns of Moreau's more recent experiments and the island's animal-turned human population. Wells' imagination provides a terrifying but engrossing menagerie including the Leopard Man, the Hyena-Swine, the Swine Folk, the Ape Man, Bull Men, Horse-Rhinoceros, Wolf-Bear, Ocelot Man, Dog Man and the Monkey Man.It is at this point that the book finds its meaning as Prendick is introduced to the Law governing the behavior of these beings: \\"Not to go on all-fours; that is the Law. Are we not Men? Not to suck up Drink; that is the Law. Are we not Men? Not to eat Fish or Flesh; that is the Law. Are we not Men? Not to claw the Bark of Trees; that is the Law. Are we not Men? Not to chase other Men; that is the Law. Are we not Men?\\"This intonation creepily delivered by the beast-people raises the moral and ethical question that Moreau never considered, \\"Should we manipulate science, genetics, and biology?\\". All Moreau is interested in is 'can we?' without full entertaining the implications and impact of his efforts. In addition to this theme of progressive science, Wells raises the differences between man and animal, class distinctions, and religion as central organizing principle of a society.This is what makes it a great read. It can be consumed for its thrills and chills or one can analyze it much deeper (or in my case, both). I am glad I finally got around to reading it and believe it would make for a great book club discussion."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"The Island of Dr. Moreau by H.G. Wells is narrated by a man called Edward Prendick. In the start of the story he goes on a dinghy because the ship he is on called \\"Lady Vain\\", which is sailing from Callao, sinks into the ocean after running into another ship. He is picked up by another ship and dropped off at an island along with a cargo of animals. The island is inhabited by a Dr. Moreau, his assistant Montgomery, and some other servants who look strangely animal like. He is led to a room to stay in and told that the island isn't visited often. He eventually finds out that Doctor Moreau is performing surgeries on animals. Edward Prendick has heard of Doctor Moreau and remembers that he got in trouble a while back for his grotesque experiments with animals.This book is interesting because Doctor Moreau's goal which is to make animals as intelligent as humans, is something which may be accomplishable in the future through genetic engineering. Currently scientists are doing Moreau-like experiments where they genetically engineer animals for new traits. I'm totally against genetically engineering humans to be animal-like, which is what the narrator at one point in the novel fears Doctor Moreau is doing, but I have nothing against experiments to give animals the mental capacity of human beings. It would be interesting if humans were not the only intelligent and speaking animal using tools."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"The two movies that I have seen on The Island of Doctor Moreau over the years served as an introduction to the storyline.

Wells in the company of Jules Verne who wrote ahead-of-their-time stories that were basically adventure stories. I unfortunately turned up my nose at Wells having never read any of his books other than War of the Worlds.Flash forward three or four decades and I found a reference to Wells' The Island of Doctor Moreau in a much more modern novel, James Hynes' Kings of Infinite Space. (Now there's the kind of book I enjoy ... caustic humor and biting satire.) To make a long story short, I was bored and looking for a little light reading. That's when I remembered the reference to Wells' novel and purchased it for my Kindle.Even before I had finished The Island of Doctor Moreau I had ventured back online to download two more books by Wells. Despite being written more than a century ago, the book is even more relevant now than when it was first penned. Granted, science has gone much further than Moreau with his transfusions and surgical procedures, but Wells' exploration of the nature of humanity and humanity's relation to its maker is timeless.I had forgotten what a utopian thinker Wells was in his day and was pleasantly surprised to be reminded of that fact. The only caveat I would suggest is that there are a few unflattering racial and ethnic comments made in the book (but given the world in which the book was written, this is a very small complaint)."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"great book, great conversion to kindle and great price!

The way I view this novel, Moreau is doing this work simply for his own intellectual enjoyment. He sees a problem or a concept and is attempting to answer or address it. I don't think he even cares about publishing what findings he may have so that others might possibly use his results to improve the state of man. He simply doesn't care.
