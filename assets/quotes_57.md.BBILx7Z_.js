The author name used for the pulp story was 'Jim Mayo', a name Louis used long before he began using his real name.The original story was set in Nevada where the Ruby Hills are located, they soar upwards of 11,000 feet. This was an area of active mining and cattle ranching. With this setting in mind, Louis L'Amour wrote his 1949 pulp story for WEST magazine, giving the name of Ross Haney to his main character. Ross Haney later became the Bill Canavan of the novel. The plot has to do with land settlement and development, especially with Bill Carnavan having the desire to have a ranch of his own. When he stakes claims to do so several ranchers turn against him. In spite of changing Levitt's fiance's name from Sherry Vernon to Dixie Venable in this longer version, both stories still remain pretty much the same.Readers wishing to read the complete, original story may still do so in Louis' book entitled THE RIDER OF THE RUBY HILLS, a book containing four magazine articles all of which later were reworked into full blown novels.This novel, WHERE THE LONG GRASS BLOWS reads much better than the magazine story as a more skilled Louis L'Amour did the writing and the story is more fleshed out than the earlier 1949 pulp magazine story. For true L'Amour fans reading both will be very instructive.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Where the Long Grass Blows","review":"Quite enjoyed this one, the cards were on the table almost right from the start. Bill Canavan rides into town, on the way he meets the feisty girl he wants to marry - and races her and her horse Flame, Winning as well.She is daughter of one of the clans who are controlling things thereabouts. The other clan is headed by Reynolds, a man with a very unsavoury past which Canavan knows well enough - and when challenged lets everyone else know about it as well.Canavan, however, knows sometihng none of them know - he has staked out or bought all the water rights thereabbouts - and there is going to be big trouble brewing - Canavan is the man to handle it though.Wry humour, tough action and some good western reading. L'amour does a rollicking good yarn."},{"Title":"Where the Long Grass Blows","review":"This story was full of action.

As much as any thing, this is probably a result of L'Amour's amazing productivity.I came late to the Western genre somewhat by accident, at age 56. I think I have a detached view. I started with L'Amour, as perhaps most neophytes do, because he has so many titles out there and everyone has heard of him. His stories are good, as is this one; a tale of a man who comes to the lawless valley with a mission to establish himself and confound the villains while doing so. It has a couple of clear flaws, though, the main one being a seemingly tacked-on late bit about a smuggling operation. But it's sound, and of course the protagonist succeeds. L'Amour has good detail and atmosphere. He tends to have sentimental passages about the west, manhood, morality, etc. here and in all his books. Not that the subjects are at all questionable, but they tend to be in didactic passages in the protagonist's thoughts rather than arising from the art of the story itself.L'Amour is a good starting point in the genre. He is a solid 3 to 3 1/2 star writer. This is praise, not condemnation. But there are many better Western writers to go for, while time's a wastin', Elmore Leonard for just one."},{"Title":"The Romance Languages","review":"This is an excellent book for either the interested layman or the refined linguist concerning the romance languages (more than the typial five, incidentally). The included languages are: Latin, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Catalan, Occitan, Rhaeto-Romance and Sardinian, with another chapter about various romance-based creoles and pidgins. Within each chapter, there is a section on phonology, morphology, syntax and lexicon. There are also interesting charts and maps, contrasting different features of the different languages.The tone of the book is serious and academic, although the language is not so erudite that a hobby-linguist (like myself) cannot understand it. The five &quot;standard&quot; romance languages in the book also feature in Bernard Comrie's &quot;The World's Major Languages&quot;, to which this book is best described as a supplement (it's the same publishing company and features many of the same writers), although these five have approximately twice as much treatment as they do in the latter book, albeit some of the text is lifted directly from &quot;Major Languages&quot;. The tone and &quot;feel&quot; of the entries here are identical to those of &quot;Major Languages&quot;, incidentally, so if you are familiar with that book you will instantly be comfortable with this one.One feature that I appreciated was the many comparisons drawn between the various languages, with all of the shifts in phonology, morphology and syntax explained and contrasted. For example, if you have ever wondered why many words in French that begin with &quot;f-&quot; have a corresponding word in Spanish that begins with &quot;h-&quot;, this is explained as are all other issues of this sort.All in all, an excellent book for anyone interested in the romance languages."},{"Title":"The Romance Languages","review":"This book offers an incredible comparison and representation of the romance languages. It discusses their similarities and individual characteristics.

This truly is a great book!"},{"Title":"The Romance Languages","review":"The book satisfied the strict demands of my university professor and I enjoy reading it. However,the vendor did not do a good job at describing the quality of the book.The cover is falling apart, the borders are dirty,brown and curling, so much so that I had to take a wet paper towel with clorox and wipe the book before I could dare to touch it and read it, not to mention the expected highlighted pages.

It'll frustrate a player if he or she wants to get a skill (say dodge blow, scale sheer surface), but cannot while the character is not in the right career. Sure you can handle this as a good game master, but the crucial point is: the career system hinders the players. Besides: the german names for some non-player-characters are too ridiculous for a native speaker."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"So you think all roleplaying games are the same, just imitations of the crude AD&amp;D? Then obviously you haven't come across Warhammer! One high point OF WFRP is that it's world is so good that even if you don't like the system, you will be more than overly tempted to play in the Warhammer world. The Warhammer world is like none other- realistic, grim, dark, and with a touch of horror and despair. With yet promises of glory and fame on the horizion.Conspiracy, corruption, and crime riddles the streets. The evils of society in general is enough to keep our heros busy but an evil, greater &amp; darker then all others, lurks in the shadows. They are the Chaos Gods, dark fiends with hidden servants that plot to bring the world to it's knees. Even if they have to destroy the world completely to do this. Chaos is the arch-enemies of all arch-enemies, no other RPGs have any villian(s)like Chaos. Chaos, is after all, one of the other many things that make Warhammer so unique.Warhammer has relatively easy to understand but very realistic rules that run smoothly, over 100 character careers, over 130 character skills, seven types of Magics including over 150 spells, and much much more. And unlike some RPGs, like AD&amp;D for instance, Warhammer does not imply any ridicolous rules like: &quot;Thieves can only wear leather armour&quot;. This is one system you simply can't let slip your fingers."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"Warhammer: Fantasy Role-Play (WFRP) is one of my all time favorite fantasy settings. As a hard-line GURPS freak, I take a lot of flak for that. I can understand why. Most GURPS fanatics hate WFRP character creation. It is rigid with little free choice, and is based on a random roll system, much like d20. I feel that it works for WFRP, and while many (perhaps most) GURPS players end up using GURPS in place of the WFRP system, I would never do that. WFRP works for game balance, it eliminates the rampant munchkinism of d20 and many other systems (including GURPS).The setting is of course based upon the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles. It is a grim world. Chaos Beasts will tear out your throat, secret cults infest the cities, Skaven armies hide in plain sight. Magic is rare, and those who use it are often hunted by witch hunters and burned at the steak. There is a definite Lovecraftian influence on the setting (hence I like it).In WFRP the characters progress through a number of careers. In order to do so, they must earn enough experience points, learn the correct skills and obtain the needed Trappings (equipment). Characters start weak, but can eventually become powerful after taking the advances from two or more Advance Schemes. The only thing you need to think about in preparation for character creation is race: human, dwarf, elf, halfling or gnome. There is very little possible min/maxing. Class (a generalization of several careers) will be chosen based upon how well you roll for characteristics. Your Starting Career is rolled randomly upon the appropriate Class table (Rogue, Warrior, Ranger and Academic).The rules are based upon percentile skill checks which in turn are based upon the characteristics of the character. That's about all that is needed to be known.Players often learn a hard lesson about combat. Too often, they jump in all gung-ho from too many years of DnD. There characters end up missing limbs, insane and eventually dead. Combat is VERY nasty in WFRP. The smart player will use combat as a last resort. For those characters that don't die, there are insanity points. Collect too many and you go nuts.My only gripe with the game is the magic system. Mages will find advancement slow and agonizing. In my humble opinion, that is not all bad, what is bad are the spells are little more than rough cut conversions from the paternal wargame. Realms of Fantazy, does little to fix this. But that is another review."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"This game gives a twist to the typical player stereotypes and gets people out of their comfort areas but in an enjoyable way."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"This book is worth it for the crit tables alone. The crit effects and descriptions are WAY beyond brutal. They can be toned down and used in an D&D campaign, though."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"After playing severl other roleplaying systems, like Mythus, AD&amp;D, Rolemaster, Call of Cthulhu, and others, I can say that I find Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay quite interesting. Some of the features that attract me (as an avid gamer with 15 years experience) is the level of fear the players face as they adventure...the rules are as such that death can visit your character quite swiftly (not in the case of...well I have 52 hit points -- I know I can handle those two bugbears). Throw in the deep cover history and brooding flavor of the game world and you have a very playable match! Warning! This game is not for crybaby players who don't want thier characters to have arms lopped off or head split open...for fearless players only!"},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"I have been a game master for this WFRP for about ten years and never have I had more fun. This game is easy to learn and exiciting for the novice and expert player. The design of the game is excellent and keeps all of the players (and game master) honest. For anyone who has ever played a RPG this game is a must. For those of you who have never played, get this book...you will never have more fun with a group of friends than when you are knee deep in Snootlings and in the shadow of a Troll."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"Having played roleplaying games for about a decade, I have been introduced to and tried a lot of different games. The one game that I keep getting back to is Warhammer. Having been designed and published over a decade ago, the game mechanics could probably be made more sophisticated or more polished if it was remade - but they work! And the game world is probably the best I know, its a dark, chaotic place of grim humour and a place where there is still heroic deeds to be made, Dragons to be fought and forgotten places to explore. A strange mix of technology and magick, of fantasy and a gothic medieval world - and it all blends together beautifully.When I look back, some of the most fun roleplaying sessions I have ever participated in, have involved Warhammer. Buy this book! You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"Having ran this game for over 5 years, I can truly say it beats out the other fantasy systems hands down. overall realism and the inability for players to get too &quot;godlike&quot; makes this easily the most long running campaign setting possible. The only downside to this is, it is completely new system, and if you have no experience with it, it can be difficult to use. Its magic system is difficult-I would suggest finding the freeware copy of the magic supplement, and it is very easy to lose a character to death (or a BY-Chance crit) so it is for serious gamers, not Monty hall characters. I love the book."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"WFRP has to be one of the greatest fantasy RPGs of all time! Richly detailed world with it's inhabitants striving to live against incursions of Chaos and it's minions, and where horror (and humor) lurk right around the corner! Outstanding character development by the use of careers, and a well put together and easy to use dice system. Combat is swift and deadly, magic hard learned and also as lethal, bringing role-playing more to the focus to get through encounters and adventures, making &quot;hack and slash&quot; a rare occurance. Characters develop in different areas by using experience to earn skills, attribute bonuses, and magic. Experience earned during an adventure can also be applied to changing careers, which are not unlike character classes in D&amp;D/AD&amp;D. However, there are careers for nearly every walk of life (over 100 are available, and other can be created easily). Don't be overburdened with optional rules you'll never use, and pass the time with a system you think that has &quot;something missing.&quot; Try it, and you'll never play TSR fantasy, or other fantasy system, again!"},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"Not only is this a really fun game with just enough realism, but it also ushers in a host of richly detailed campaigns. Buy it, you'll not be disappointed. The game system is perfect."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"Warhammer fantasy roleplay is a great game. And so is Dungeons and Dragons too!!"},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay This book was originally published by Games Workshop to compliment their popular Warhammer Fantasy Battle miniatures game. It has long been a gamers' favourite (including this reviewer) despite the lack of supplementary material. A complete system in one volume, this book covers all the rules and background required to play: characters, monsters, combat, magic, religion, and the history and geography of the Warhammer game world. A short adventure 'The Oldenhaller Contract' is also provided to introduce new players to the game.WFRP introduced the unique 'career' system where the players advance through progression in a series of careers. More than 100 varied careers are detailed, each with its own skills. This system allows players to create a truly unique character and offers more flexibility than the typical Fighter/Mage/Thief/Cleric choices common in other fantasy roleplaying games. Combat is deadly and realistic (at least as much as is possible in a fantasy game), which quickly teaches new players to seek less violent solutions to problems. The standard mechanics are simple percentile based which is both a plus and a minus. They greatly speed up play (no reams of tables and modifiers to consult) but have been criticised as being too simple especially as regards to non-combat skills which do not allow characters to improve over time. The magic system is the weakest section in WFRP, being slanted towards the more martial applications - possibly since it was inherited from the Warhammer Fantasy Battle game.While the mechanics are not without its faults and the magic system could stand a complete rewrite, Warhammer fantasy RolePlay (WFRP) succeeds due to its gothic, dark fantasy background where cultists and conspiracies lurk in every shadow. It also has one of the most intriguing game settings ever published: a renaissance-era 'Germanic' Empire full of roleplaying potential. Combined with what many players feel to be the finest roleplaying campaign series 'The Enemy Within' (published separately), this game is a classic that deserves a place in every rolegamer's collection."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"I can only agree with all the other reviewers: This is by far the best rpg ever! In my humble opinion..... Well, you got your skill list, about 100 careers instead of levels, 150 spells(oh, and soon Realms of Sorcery comes out too) and enough monsters for some time. But what you must remember is that this is the original dark fantasy game. Your players save the world? Yes. And get fame and fortune? No. In fact, they were the only people who knew about the grave danger. And there is a warrant on them for killing the evil demonologist, who everybody thought was good. Get it? You might prefer your politically correct, heroic rpg's, but many, including me, find it refreshing to see a realistic world, with races who hate each other, noblewomen who are beaten, and adventurers who are broke. To make it even better, the system and the world, in some way or another, outright FORCES the game to get based on roleplaying instead of combat. You may have your AD&amp;D's, runequests, and Castle Falkensteins: I don't care. I got the real goodie."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"I have played many role playing systems and I would have to say that by far Warhammer is the best system. It was recommended by a friend, I had never heard of it before.. but I'm glad I took the chance on buying it.The system of career advancements, skills and the *one* tome of rules (not 5 different books that you need to collect) makes for an excellent game.Buy this book, you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"Why fix what wasn't broken?Dungeons and Dragons wasn't my first foray into the worlds of fantasy role-play. There was a used bookstore next door to a shop my father would frequent. While there, I'd raid the used books. But finding a mint condition of this game literally changed my life. With dark story tones, wickedly evil art, and very simple mechanics (even for a n00b, at that time), this one purchase is the main reason I am today a game designer.The mechanics are all percentile based: roll lower than your given percentile, and the character succeeds. It is, essentially, a point-based system. Players spend experience to purchase bonuses provided by their character's career. Once all such bonuses are taken (and the order in which they are taken is nothing more than player prerogative), the player can opt to move the character into a new career. With over 100 careers and a like number of skills, there's no way any two characters will be similar unless it is of purposed design.And this is the One Book to Rule Them All. Fantastic histories, rules on commerce and trade, a disgusting bestiary (Beast of Nurgle, anyone?), a huge chapter on magic, detailed combat rules and critical hits that work well, another huge chapter on religion, and a delve into an unused asylum as an intro story line that rivals the Tomb of Horrors or the Tombs of Gersidi.The sourcebooks are a bit hard to find, but every now and then you'll come across a few that are a bit less expensive than a semester at Oxford. Even if the books are expensive, I daresay it is more than worth it. Remember, this game is from the early 80's. Now go look at what TSR was doing in those years.There is no comparison. Warhammer smashes all contenders."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"&quot;On a lethality scale from 0 (a day with Barney) to 100 (first second of the game, you are seriously wounded or dead), this rpg rates a 90.&quot; I love this game.

Ten years later it is just as fresh and playable. The supplements that are out there are useful and well written but they are not an necessity. The magic system is complicated and difficult to get used to but that only adds to the unique nature of the experienced character. Rules do not slow down this book and the time from first picking up the book to being able to play is much reduced as opposed to other games. All in all if you play other role-playing games fine.

I've always loved GW art and this was no exception- how many other RPGs have not one, but TWO different mohawks on the front cover? As I started to read through it, I found some clunky mechanics, but there is a lot to love about this game.The setting has changed a lot since 1986, but in a lot of ways I prefer the version presented here. It leaves a lot to the GM to fill in the blanks, so if you want every single little village and hamlet detailed, this won't deliver that. What it will deliver is brutal and truly fear-inspiring critical hits, harsh but fair rules, an old-school preference for grit, random chance, and deadliness, and a unique and fun method of character advancement that goes beyond simple classes and archetypes and really helps define your character."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said already?

Great to have them in ebook form and re-read them all."},{"Title":"A Castle of Adventure","review":"I spent years growing up in England and learned to love the many adventure stories of Enid Blyton. This book must have been the first that I ever read of Ms. Blyton. She is the queen of children's adventure and mystery stories with her \\"Adventure\\" series and her \\"Five\\" series. While these books were penned many years ago, I have found in re-reading them, that Ms. Blyton has managed to capture the essence of the spirit of adventure and imagination of children from any time period (even old children like me - 63). I am re-reading Ms. Blyton, with an eye toward writing some young teen adventure/mystery stories myself. For that purpose, reading the master (Blyton) is well worthwhile."},{"Title":"A Castle of Adventure","review":"Growing up overseas, we all read English author Enid Blyton's \\"Adventure\\" series. There was always a long line for reading this particular series and we considered ourselves lucky if we got to read one that week from our school library. Many years later, seeing them available on Kindle ( thankfully not having to store them in my bookshelves)I decided to give them a try to see if they were still timeless enough to pass down to my great nephews/nieces. Although this particular book has a weaker plot than the earlier books in the series, it is still good. Compared to more recent books designed for this age group, it has a strong emphasis on loyalty, problem solving and self-reliance. Further, the language is in readable English without the poor grammar so common in more recent kids' books. Static language teaches grammar and I feel should be teaching correctly. It is worth the purchase for a kids mystery."},{"Title":"A Castle of Adventure","review":"My nine year old granddaughter wanted me to bring her an English book written for preteens when I visited England.

She loved them all--The Castle Adventure, The Sea Adventure, The Island Adventure, The Mountain Adventure, and The Valley Adventure. I have discovered that she wrote over 400 books for this age group during her life. I am sure these are not the last one I will buy!!"},{"Title":"Lovin' Spoonful (Silhouette Romance)","review":"The erratic and slightly disjointed story of how a television chef falls for her station manager . . . Mildly funny at times, but there's no particular logic to the sequence of events or the characters' changing feelings for each other. SPOILER: This book's main reason for existence is to prove that you should never hide engagement rings in food."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This book is a great source for mothers who want to breastfeed their babies. LLL is an organization dedicated to helping mothers breastfeed their babies. Their 40+ years in existence is based on the belief that nurturing one's baby at the breast is the ideal way to care for a baby. This book is the culmination of years of experiences and medical research."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"this is the one to own!my mom harassed me into going to my first la leche meeting, and i went so that she would stop bugging me. it was great, and from that experience i was introduced to this book.wab enabled me to empower myself with knowledge. when the nurse told me i could not nurse because i had a c section, i knew that i could, and pushed it. i knew what a successful latch might look like, and i knew the importance of getting positioning and latch right for us. we still had some challenges, but what wab taught me was that i could be successful. i love the stories from moms that make up a part of the book.now, as a la leche leader, i use this book as one of my resources when helping moms online or on the phone. if moms want more detail than the book provides, calling a local leader can be helpful. there is information in the book which can lead moms to resources."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This is my least favorite book on breastfeeding. It seems more concerned with tooting its own horn than with informing women how to get their babies nourished at the breast with their mother's milk. They dedicate pages to the benfits of breatsfeeding but nothing to giving readers a repetoire of things to try when easy doesn't work. This book is boring for the above reasons. Please read The Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of Answers : The Most Comprehensive Problem-Solution Guide to Breastfeeding from the Foremost Expert in North America to ensure much greater success. Interview all your local hospitals and ask what their initiation rates are for breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is not all a bed of roses. It can be maddening in the beginning when nature does not seem to be taking its course due to a variety of reasons.

I don't know what's up with the last reviewer, but in my opion this is THE BOOK that every expecting mother should read. It not only addresses everything you'll need to know about breastfeeding, but also post-partum depression (which is very real) and helpful information for/about new fathers. Pumping, storing, allergies...you name it it's in there. This the bible of breastfeeding and much more. Easy to read and easy to reference - A great gift and a must have."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This book is an excellent tool in aiding, helping and researching breatfeeding. I read it for the first time when I was pregnant with my first child and I still read it from time to time breatfeeding now my second. It's a book that everyone women should have and always keep for reference. If a problem arises while breastfeeding this book can help you solve it. It explains that breastfeeding is so much more than food to a baby and there is nothing like breatfeeding a child!"},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I credit this book with the success I had breastfeeding my son nearly 20 years ago, even after a very shakey start caused by an uninformed, unsupporting pediatrician. When my daughter was born 5 years later, I often referred back to that very book when I needed to refresh my mind or solve any difficulties I experienced along the way when nursing her. Now I am awaiting the birth of my third child, 14 years after my second. Since my copy of the Motherly Art is long lost, I plan to purchase another just to get me through any bumpy times.The LeLeche style of mothering that is spoken of in the book can be a bit over the top to many readers. However, if taken with a grain of salt and used as a suggestion, not a mandate, just reading about and becoming aware of this parenting option can be very useful to balance out the often opposite advice and social pressure out there and can be very helpful in opening the mind to other possibilities."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"Good book but buy the latest version/edition. This one is older than me. Better yet...go to a Le Leche League meeting in your area.

The book is so encouraging and has so much great information in it. I never needed another book.

I am buying another one for my sister in law, who is going to try breastfeeding her new little one on the way!"},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"La Leche League is the authority on breastfeeding, and this is such a great book! Warm, friendly and knowledgable, it has answers to just about every breastfeeding question that a mother could have. Also, it is full of information about the wonderful health benefits of nursing, for a woman and her child.In additon to it's wonderful breastfeeding information, it offers practical, loving advice about parenting and families. It shows a woman that she really should listen to her instincts and heart about raising a family.How I wish I had read this book while I was expecting my first! It would have been so valuable."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This book was helpful to me when my son was born and talked about many issues surrounding breastfeeding that are important. Addressing many issues such as the newborn and first-time nursing experiences, getting enough rest, the whole family, pumping milk to go back to work- this book touches on many critical issues that are on a new mothers mind. Another reviewer didn't appreciate the tone of certain passages that encourage a mother to trust her own instincts. I think that not enough mothers are encouraged to trust their own instincts when it comes to their baby. Often doctors and other well-intentioned people around a new mother offer plenty of advice about what the &quot;right&quot; thing to do for their baby is. This book simply encourags you to put the most faith in yourself and inyour judgement of your child's needs and health. No one else can ever know your child like you do or know what is right for your child. So, in defense of this fabulous book, I want to say that there is no ulterior motive at work in this book: the authors are trying to be supportive of healthy families and healthy parenting. La Leche League is a strong advocate for children and mothers everywhere and this book really serves as a useful tool to support families who acknowledge breastfeeding as the one of the most important gifts for a newborn and his family."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"Yes, this is one of the most popular texts on breastfeeding and it's fine as far as it goes, but having breastfed both of my kids (the first for 18 months and the second for two and counting), I must say I always find The Womanly Art disappointing. It's too busy rhapsodizing to give much practical information and far too often, it creates the impression that if there are problems in the breastfeeding relationship, re-positioning will fix them. This is not always true. Some women will have significant discomfort and even pain for several weeks when nursing - and even longer if their child has a high palate (which Art never discusses). I think La Leche League would do a far greater service to breastfeeding moms if they just admitted this. Then maybe fewer women would give up nursing because they think they're doing something wrong. In any case this is an okay basic text, but for specific info. Kathleen Huggins' _Nursing Mother's Companion_ is better and for sensible, comforting help, I think Karen Pryor's _Nursing Your Baby_ is wonderful."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I love this book! Every time I read it I learn something. It has helped me through many problems, and encouraged me to keep going when I felt unsure. I have even been able to help my GP with diagnosing my own breastfeeding problems!This book has saved my life, and I recommend it to every new parent who wants to make a commitment to breastfeeding.(And contrary to some other reviews, this book helped me when I went back to work). I have nursed 4 children, all for more than a year."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This book was very informative and supportive in content, and it was a quick read. My husband purchased this book for me after I was having problems nursing. With the help of this book I discovered reasons why nursing is so important for babies. If you are undecided about whether to nurse, read this book. It may change your attitude on breastfeeding in general, atleast it changed mine. This book is especially helpful since most Doctors don't have a clue about breastfeeding. I only wish I had read this book before I delivered my baby, it would have made the process run much smoother. However, this book needs to better address problems faced by some nursing mothers and how to resolve them."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This book is great if you want to hear about the benefits of breastfeeding, the La Leche League philosophy and if you have no problems breastfeeding. If you require substantive information, such as storage, pumping, lactation research info or more importantly, what to do in case of breastfeeding difficulties, this book has very little to offer. I have a serious low milk supply problem (my exclusively breastfed son ended up in the hospital due to dehydration...) and this book makes the condition of low milk supply sound like a problem within the head of a paranoid mother.For mothers with low milk supply (either real or imagined...) or other problems you are better off searching the web for the work of Dr. Jack Newman. In addition, avoid La Leche League and join the virtual support group MOBI (Mothers Overcoming Breastfeeding Issues), a Yahoo! group. In my serious quest for guidance, I found these to be the best resources for actionable information to turn my Low Milk Supply situation around. In addition, these sources offered much more substantive information on how lactation works and how to have a breastfeeding relationship with your child that works for you."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I bought a copy of this book when I was pregnant and I don't think I would have been able to keep breastfeeding without it. I have to disagree with those who say it doesn't address possible difficulties. It covers everything you could want to know about breastfeeding, and has good advice for how to cope with just about any problem. Perhaps it's not well indexed if someone had trouble finding info on mastitis, because it's in there! I had mastitis twice and this book was indispensible. It offers the support nursing mothers need and can't always get from friends, doctors and family."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I must admit I was put off when I first read this book; as I breastfed longer I gained increasing respect for its' tenets and now am an active La Leche League leader. It is heavy on philosophy, but it is a good philosophy that easily gets lost in our modern world. I come back to this book again and again. If you know you will return to work soon after birth, read it along with &quot;nursing mother working mother&quot; by Gayle Pryor."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"Thank goodness for this comprehensive book on breastfeeding! I have several others and none have given me the concrete knowledge and feeling of \\"I can do it\\" that this one has. La Leche League is an organization that promotes attachment parenting and is obsessively pro-breastfeeding, but it you can get beyond the preachiness, you'll find that you have a sound, basic guide to all apects of nursing.From bringing your newborn home to starting solids to weaning (including info on working, nursing multiples, and how fathers can bond) it's all here. One of my own experiences: when I found a lump in one of my breasts while nursing, I consulted this book while waiting for my doctor appointment and was hugely relieved after reading about the rarity of cancer in nursing women and the explanations of several types of benign cysts it probably was.I also especially like the section on the benefits of breastfeeding for both the infant and mother. You will not find a better lay explanation of how breastmilk positively affects your baby anywhere, in my opinion. I highly recommend this book for any nursing mother who has questions. While, as I stated before, LLL is sometimes pushy in its advocacy of breastfeeding, they are also a wonderful resource. I called our local chapter a few times and was met with pleasant enthusiasm and given wonderful advice."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"If you are looking for just one book for information and encouragement, read this one. If you think the book is missing something, then go check the others. You will be surprised to realize how comprehensive this book is. Unfortunately for me, I read a different book to prepare me for nursing. I had some problems with nursing and did not find enough information in other book. The other book also had no encouragement, it was more of &quot;just the facts&quot;, and was unemotional. The flip side is The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, (which I discovered after my nursing problems were over and my son was two months old), which intertwines positive encouragement and parenting style choices between the breastfeeding facts and how-to's. I especially love the sections written by regular mothers, which is like real advice from the real world. The opinion is written in the book to take from the book what is helpful to you and leave the rest behind. A refreshing change from other parenting books whose authors infer &quot;There is one way to do it, and that is my way&quot;. Book applies to both stay-at-home mothers and working mothers. Easy to read."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"The title just about says it all ... There are many more useful breastfeeding books out there. This book was much too anecdotal and not actually informative. I don't feel like I know anything more about breastfeeding because I read it."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"After my daughter was born, one of my sisters-in-law gave me a copy of this book as a gift. She is an ob/gyn with 3 kids of her own, so I thought this was going to be a real help to me--especially as I was having a lot of nipple pain whenever my daughter fed off my left breast. Unfortunately, I was sadly, sadly disappointed. Whatever question I had, the only answer the book had was \\"Consult your local La Leche League\\" coordinator. I also felt that any woman who was considering breastfeeding her child for a short period of time only would be made to feel guilty for that decision. All in all, I was very, very disappointed. I would recommend this book only for those of you who have some money to throw away and a bird cage to line."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I thought this book was great.When reading the negative reviews I was sadden that so many mothers feel that they have something to be guilty about. Maybe there is something to that and why they didn't like the book.It really helped me see that the way I wanted to raise my daughter was okay and not strange. Being a real mom and everything that goes along with it.Read the book, check out your local Leche League."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"We purchased this book after having spoken to a relative who has been LLL for 20 years, lactation consultants, neo-natal intensive care specialists, a doula and pediatrician. My wife was so looking forward to breast-feeding we wanted to do everything right. Unfortunately, our son has other ideas. Our pediatrician believes that some babies just do not like taking milk from the breast.So, now that you know where I am coming from, here is my beef about the book. Throughout the book, problems are brought out, but instantly dissolve if only the baby is breastfed. The book purports to be comprehensive, yet it has no information for babies who are drinking expressed breast milk from a bottle. Apparently, LLL believes that milk taken directly from the breast is the only type of breast feeding that exists (or should.)"},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"My mother and mother-in-law both recommended this book since I am planning to breastfeed my baby (which is due any day now). However, I was very disappointed. The information presented is very biased and does not take into account differing opinions and lifestyles. I was made to think that I'm a horrible mother and love my baby less if for some reason I decide that breastfeeding does not work for me, if I give my baby a pacifier, if I can bear to leave him to go to work, if I don't let him sleep in bed with me. While it started with practical information about breastfeeding, it only proceeded to be a springboard for LLL beliefs. If you want to be encouraged that you're doing just fine and that your decisions don't reflect your love for your baby, I recommend trying something else."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This book is short on practical \\"how to\\" advice on breastfeeding, and long on preachy passages that attempt to convenince all moms to stay at home and breastfeed until your child is 8. I'm a working mom of 3 and have extensive experience with breastfeeding. There are about 3-4 pages of this book that actually inform, and the rest is an attempt to pursuade mothers to stay at home and breastfeed the rest of their lives."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"My husband's aunt gave me this book when we were trying to get pregnant. In my sixth month of pregnancy I started reading this book and at first found some of the information helpful. Especially the information on a baby latching correctly. But, as I went forward I was extremely disappointed with the breast is the only way mentality and I was really grossed out by the chapter feeding your toddler and newborn, complete with a picture of a 2-1/2 year old feeding on one breast and a newborn on the other. I sincerely hope that breastfeeding works out for me but I don't want to set myself up to feel like I've somehow ruined my child's life because I didn't breastfeed. My advice is to skip this book and try to find one that isn't so shove down your throat with breastfeeding."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I am a stay at home mommy and teach childbirth classes out of my home.

Your Baby will thank you! ..The book does state that the best thing you can do for your baby is to work out of the home or not return to work at all. I totally agree!!

But if you already know you want to breastfeed and only want the straight facts on"},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I was very pleased to find this book and am thrilled that there is such a wonderful group of women out there that have written it!I would like to say that I was very fortunate and that my son took to nursing immediately after birth and I have had no problems whatsoever with it after 4 months. But for women who are still pregnant and thinking about nursing, or those that have new babies, I would recommend this book without any hestitation whatsoever. I was amazed after reading this book to find that I agreed with all of the values that La Leche League promotes. I am in no way a traditional person, yet I feel that the best any of us can do for society is to raise a happy baby who in turn will grow up to be a stable adult. In that regard I am a traditional mother who believes in putting her baby before herself.One reviewer on here wrote that she was in tears after reading the book and that it made her feel bad about returning to work. Well, she SHOULD feel bad. Nature gave her tools to use which in part are her intuition, and she ignored them. She claims that her baby is fine, but methinks that's rationalizing the situation. Nobody HAS to have a child. You should only have one if you are willing to raise the child yourself, rather them foisting them off on somebody else. And if you are willing to give up frivolous items to save money and you still can't stay at home, guess what? DON'T HAVE A BABY. They don't ask to be born, and the least you can do is care for them like every other animal in the animal kingdom.One other item is scheduled feedings. When I am hungry, I eat. When I am not, I don't. Sometimes I don't eat for several hours, and sometimes I eat half an hour after a meal. The point here is that you need to listen to your stomach. I am a thin person and the overweight people I know are the only people that actually &quot;schedule&quot; their meals. When your baby is hungry, they need to be fed. Scheduling them is beyond ludicrous and it makes me wonder where a mother's common sense is. Do they force themselves to only eat at certain times of the day too? One wonders.In closing, this book should help mothers out who care for their children and want to do right by them and not make excuses for themselves. Anybody who complains about the values promoted in this book is kidding themselves. They need to look in the mirror and ask themselves how they want their children to turn out in 18 years."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This book was a great help to me when I breastfed my now almost 2 year old (fully weaned at 21 months). I encountered great difficulties with breastfeeding at first. However, through reading this book and support from other breastfeeding moms, I discovered that most of the problems I encountered were common and with a little work between me and my daughter, could be overcome so we could enjoy a wonderful, mutually beneficial breastfeeding experience. Unfortunately, there is not an overwhelming support system for breastfeeding moms in our society. Consequently, many moms, when encountering problems or disinterest in breastfeeding, switch to the bottle out of dire frustration, misinformation, and lack of support. This book does not push any propaganda, but gives accurate, trustworthy, and pertinent information about the many extreme benefits of breastfeeding. I want to encourage any mother trying to decide whether to breastfeed, encountering any type of breastfeeding problems, or in need of any type of breastfeeding support to read this book."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"One of the reasons I want to breastfeed is because I have to (and WANT to) go back to work. While this book is informative, it is strongly anti-working mother. There is very little information on pumping and storing milk. Testimonials from working mothers emphasize how the mothers dread going back to work and what a chore pumping is. If you are a working mom-to-be then don't bother with this book - it will only tick you off!"},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This book was the original breastfeeding book. It was helpful in raising awareness about the benefits of breastfeeding, and about our right to breastfeed. However, it is now largely LLL propoganda, and very little information. It offers NO help with any problems--which are actually very common (about the only recommendation offered for any type of problem is &quot;go to bed with your infant&quot;). Dr. Mom's Guide to Breastfeeding and The Nursing Mother's Companion are much more helpful because they contain much more actual information. In particular, Dr. Mom acknowledges that breastfeeding doesn't always work and that the most important thing is the health of the child and the sanity of the mother (breast alone isn't best all the time)."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I am a fan of La Leche League and think they've done great things to promote breastfeeding and help mothers with many basic technical breastfeeding problems. I was disappointed, however, to read their information on breastmilk jaundice when my premature newborn was diagnosed with it. Instead of discussing various ways to deal with this condition, the authors state that it doesn't exist and imply that mothers should ignore this diagnosis. If I had followed this advice, it is likely that my baby would have spent a longer time in neonatal intensive care. Fortunately I had other pro-breastfeeeding resources on hand to consult (e.g. William Sears has a more balanced description of this condition) and have continued breastfeeding my baby after the successful treatment. Denying a well-documented medical condition because it might threaten their views seems a paranoid and irresponsible approach. I could not recommend this book to a first time mother unless she had other resources available as well."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This book is not a balanced book discussing the pros and cons of breastfeeding. It is fully a how-to, encourage the people who want to breastfeed book. If you have already decided to breastfeed, or if you are reasonably sure you want to breastfeed and are looking for a few more arguments in its favor, get this book. If you are sitting on the fence or looking for assurances that formula-fed babies are going to do just as well in life as a breastfed baby, don't buy this book.For the record, although I breastfed my son and would recommend it to anyone who was expecting a child, I am not of the opinion that those who feed their children formula have doomed their children to failure. There are plenty of perfectly well adjusted formula-fed babies out there--including me! That is one sentiment that is not expressed in this book, however, so do be warned.However, this book will give you all sorts of tips and descriptions of ways to continue breastfeeding or expressing milk to feed your child. Some folks seem to give up on breastfeeding after a bit of difficulty; it is important to realize that breastfeeding is something you have to LEARN how to do. If you and your baby magically fall into perfect step the first time you try breastfeeding and you have had no one tell you how it's done, you are very lucky!This book clearly describes how to get your baby to take the breast, what to do if it hurts (it ought not hurt! If it does that means you need to change your technique), and how to make sure that your baby is getting enough milk. It gives you hints about clothes to wear to allow you to breastfeed and ways to minimize your exposure when you breastfeed in public. It is a bit repetative, but it is not really meant to be read from cover to cover. It works much better as a resource you pick up and read sections of at a time.Once again, it is unabashedly pro-breastfeeding, and it has a chapter on breastfeeding a toddler as well as plenty of discussion about how much better breast milk is for the baby than formula is. This all comes in handy if you're trying to convince some busy-body that you're doing the right thing by breastfeeding, but if you've honestly determined that breastfeeding is not for you, you should save yourself grief and avoid this book.If, on the other hand, you want to breastfeed your baby but aren't sure that you can, DO buy this book! It can really help you out."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This is THE book to own if you are serious about breastfeeding.

I just can't say enough good things about it, a must have!"},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"My sister-in-law sent me this book when I was pregnant with my first child 28 years ago. I read and used this book through the pregnancies and infancies of both of my children. It proved to be a great help for me. I was 18 and uninformed about many things relating to breastfeeding. This book was a godsend! Breastfeeding is wonderful and I encouraged all my friends and family to try. The feeling is undescribable. Needless to say I no longer need the book, but I loaned my copy and it was never returned. I ordered two, one for a friend's daughter and one for me. If I ever get to be a grandmother I will give it to my daughter-in-law or daughter."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"As a Neonatal Intensive Care Nurse and first time expectant mother, I am a strong advocate for breastfeeding. I believe the Le Leche League has provided some great information within the book that can assist a new breastfeeding parent and provide them with alternatives for support should there be none available to them. However, at the same time I felt the author's preached alot of their own opinions throughout the contents of the book. In particular, the book contains a section that provides information for the mother who is returning to work after a baby. While it provides helpful information on pumping and storing milk, it also states that the best thing you can do is arrange to work from home or better yet, not return to work. I find this a little unrealistic, since the majority of families today are two income families. The feeling I had after reading this section was that Le Leche almost looks down on mothers who return to work and do not stay home to breastfeed their children. The author's also stated on numberous occassions throughout the book to question and sometimes refuse the suggestions of the medical providers, in regards to their child's care. I am a strong believer in asking questions, but if you don't get the answers you want or understand, please get a second opinion or ask for further clarification, do not refuse medical care for yourself or your child unless you are fully aware of the implications. Overall, the factual content was good but after I completely finished reading the book, I was unsure if by joining Le Leche League I was joining a support group for my child/myself or I was joining a cult!"},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I was lucky enough to have friends who breastfed before I got pregnant, so I knew that was the road I wanted to follow. One of my friends loaned me this book, and while reading it, I alternated between laughing hysterically and wanted to scream back at the sanctimonious preaching within its pages.This book is full of La Leche League philosophy on breastfeeding, bonding and attachment, but you have to really dig into it to find the practical and helpful information. Information about storing breast milk, pumping, and introducing bottles was very light and hard to find. When located, it was presented in a fashion that suggested that any mother who needed to do any of these things wasn't a good mother and wasn't encouraging good attachment with her baby. Well, my daughter was in the NICU, so pumping and storage and bottles were a necessity when she was first born.Another problem I have this book is that it is not very supportive of working mothers. There is only one small chapter dedicated to working mothers, again implying that you do so at the peril of your child and your relationship with your child.There are better, more informative books on the market."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I grew up knowing about La Leche League because my mother nursed all five of her children until we were three years old.

The chapter on \\"The Manly Art of Fathering\\" is a chapter especially for dads that I am sure most breastfeeding books wouldn't think to include. This book is a great resource because you can take from it what applies to your individual situation. I would love to stay home but I had to go back to work.

Easy to read."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I had trouble wading through this book. It wanders a little and the style seemed a bit fragmented. There's good stuff in there, but it's sandwiched between many side stories (which tend to end with &quot;I called LLL and they fixed everything&quot;) and a good deal of personal/LLL opinion. It might ALMOST have been better titled &quot;La Leche's Advice for Early Child-Rearing, with Notes on Breast-Feeding&quot;. (For example, they tell you not to spank... I got spanked, though not often, and I remember it as loving, last-resort discipline which worked.)A better buy might be &quot;The Complete Book of Breastfeeding&quot;, by Marvin S. Eiger and Sally Wendkos Olds. I read that book through with pleasure and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I own this book, and recently consulted it while struggling with a bout of severe mastitis while at the same time wondering how to stop my six month old from biting me. I looked at the index for &quot;mastitis&quot; and found NOTHING. I looked at the index under &quot;biting&quot; and found only references to toddler biting, not infant biting. I had very few problems breastfeeding my daughter until she weaned herself at 10 months, but breastfeeding my second child has been more of a challenge, and this book is no help at all. In my view, the book is more a platform for selling La Leche League's parenting philosophies than a real help to breastfeeding mothers experiencing difficulties. La Leche League has some admirable goals and philosophies, but so many women stop breastfeeding because they experience challenges like mastitis or biting, and this book fails to even recognize those problems."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"La Leche League is not just a breastfeeding support group -- it is a philosophy of parenting. This book strongly supports that philosophy, i.e., co-sleeping, nonspanking, stay-at-home-moms, no-intervention births, etc. Only about half the book is dedicated to breastfeeding information, and even that is a little bit disjointed. For a more concise and to-the-point resource solely about breastfeeding, I found The Nursing Mother's Companion by Kathleen Huggins to be much more helpful."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"All I can say is that this book and the help from the woman in LaLache. I had 4 children..the first I tried to nurse in the hospital, and he wouldn't latch on...the nurses had NO patience, no knowledge, no help...they told me I had inverted nipples, baby would never nurse....and I ended up crying there in the hospital, overwhelmed that I couldn't nurse my baby...then I had three more children...and didn't even try...because I thought I couldn't...then I moved to Franklin Park, Il...met some women from Leleche...and was pregnant again...after going to meetings, reading this book some 38 years ago...I was bound and determined to nurse this new baby....and I did and was successful...nursing the next three ... until toddler stage and the last one until he was 3...what a joy it was...and a blessed relationship...so all I can say is if a woman WANTS to breast feed, this book can and will help you...if you don't want to or are looking for a excuse to quit or because you need more time for yourself...then you would be wasting your time buying the book....I was successful for my last three babies in nursing and wish the same for any mother who really wants this experience..YOU CAN DO IT. (the informtion in this book and the additional support is what I needed)My second child was handicapped...and he cried and cried and cried...I would give anything if I would have known and had the support to nurse him...it could have made such a difference in his infant stage when he had such a rough time....Dolores"},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I read this book cover-to-cover when I was pregnant with my first child. Breastfeeding went very smoothly for us until she was 9 or 10 months old and went on a nursing strike. This book helped me recognize it for what it was (she wasn't self-weaning) and I was able to work through it and continue nursing until I chose to wean her at 14 1/2 months."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This is an all encompassing manual for breastfeeding. It coveres getting ready to nurse your newborn as well as continuing to nursing your toddler. I read it cover to cover while I was pregnant and am using it as a reference manual as my baby grows. I would recommend this book to any expectant mother!"},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"Being a mother of four (all breastfed children) and expecting my fifth baby soon I decided to read the updated version of this book. The authors eloquently describe the inner woven aspects of breastfeeding and mothering. The autors have gone beyond &quot;parenting philosopy&quot;. They have toutched on the core aspects of mothering from the heart which is all too often ignored in our society. The ideas brought forth in this book took me several babies and alot of growing pains to figure out on my own. This book should be required reading for expectant parents."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"While many people don't agree with all of the tenets of LLL, EVERY new mom will benefit from reading this book. It lets readers know that with very few exceptions, every woman can successfully breastfeed her baby. The bias is, of course, that every mom should breastfeed. After reading this book, it is hard to argue with this premise.The book provides information on the technical aspects of nursing as well as the physical, medical and emotional benefits. They provide details that show that no formula can even come close to copying the contents of breast milk.The authors make it clear that they believe that breastfeeding is THE best thing that moms can do for their babies. No matter how the reader feels about LLL, parents can benefit from their message. They want moms to relax and know that they CAN breastfeed while giving their children a wonderful gift."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This book is loaded with useful information about breastfeeding for both first-time and repeat nursing mothers. I bought it prior to the birth of my second child, and even though I had just recently stopped nursing my older child, I still found lots of valuable information in the book. Obviously, it adheres pretty closely to La Leche League philosophies, but if you learn to heed their advice of taking what works for you and ignoring what doesn't, you will be pleased with this book."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I found the book to be great as far as teaching you how to physically nurse. However, I felt that a lot of the information the book provided was to extreme and the LLL made you feel like an awful parent if you did not do everything to their extreme. An example would be that you are shutting up your baby by using a pacifier. The book goes on to say that in German pacifier means dummy, but last I checked in English it means to pacify and that's what it does. I agree that you can abuse it, but like everything else you need to use it in moderation. I do not recommend this book to anyone who is iffy about nursing because this book will turn you away, making you think that you have to follow their rules and that it's a lot harder then it really is."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"But an excellent resource on solving breastfeeding problems, breastfeeding in difficult situtions and everything you ever needed to know about breastfeeding but were afraid to ask!"},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I'm a bit put off by the review below stating that &quot;sometimes the bottle is the best and wisest choice for the baby&quot; - this is simply NOT true. Artificial feeding is never the best and wisest choice. If this person believed that reading a book would guarantee her an easy time, that's where the problem was - not in the book. This book offers practical advice and a sound foundation for breastfeeding. La Leche League exists to promote and encourage breastfeeding, and they do their part to make sure that every mother is able to give her baby the only truly acceptable infant nourishment. This book is not intended to substitute for a lactation consultant! If you need one, get one. Don't expect others to assuage your guilt over not feeding your infant an appropriate, nourishing food intended for human babies."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This is quite possibly the most frustrating, UNHELPFUL book I have read during my pregnancy and since my baby was born. I am a first-time mother and am committed to breastfeeding, but I want to do so in addition to being myself, so I need practical advice about clothing for nursing, tips for breastfeeding outside of the confines of my home, returing to the workforce, etc. Even the general guidelines that are offered by LLL about these things are overshadowed by qualifiers like &quot;if you must leave your tiny baby for a short time -- and the shorter the time the better...&quot; Obviously, anyone reading this book has already made a committment to breastfeeding, so that LLL only succeeds in CREATING GUILT AND ANXIETY about any minute a woman spends away from her child. Perhaps the most offensive part of this book is its treatment of the father's role in breastfeeding which is summed up by the index entries that refer to the husband's role. One of only two entries listed under &quot;husband&quot; is &quot;uncooperative.&quot; The entry for &quot;father&quot; is a little more inclusive of his role, but not nearly enough. I find this book entirely COUNTERPRODUCTIVE and will not give it or recommend it to anyone, particularly a new mother who needs a book that offers both practical, modern advice and encouragement."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I found this book extremely disappointing. Basically, it's a propaganda piece about how great breastfeeding is (which I agree, it is wonderful). But the book is not so helpful when you need information about breastfeeding problems. It's doesn't have enough unbiased, practical information on breast infections, alternate feeding plans for babies having trouble latching on, or pumping milk when you work outside the home.My daughter was premature and had trouble latching on. So we had to offer a mixture of pumped milk and formula. Much more helpful to me was Kathleen Huggins' Nursing Mother's Companion, a lifesaver."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"The only use I got out of this book was as a doorstop. In the case of difficulties it makes it seem like all you need is determination. It preaches the 'evils' of supplementing and tries to be scientific but fails.Quoting research from the 1920s an 30s does nothing except try to instill the fear of your baby dying. I found much better information and non-judgemental support from my OBs office and my ped.This book was horrible! It didn't offer any useful advice on common breastfeeding problems like Mastitis .. at least nothing useful."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I appreciated the basic information offered in the book and thought it dealt with my breastfeeding questions. It is a strong text for emotionally supporting a breastfeeding mother. However, when reality is that you are a working mother and also have a toddler to chase I didn't find the book helpful. It presented issues idealistically rather than realistically - breastfeeding takes a lot of time (when you have to pump, store, etc.) and a strong commitment from the entire family. I would have preferred that they own up to this in the book and dealt with it from this angle rather than just the emotional and technical side of breastfeeding (although they did this quite well)"},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I completely believe in breastmilk for babies. So the dogmatic stance of this book didn't offend me at first. However, despite my following this book's advice, I had horrible problems nursing my newborn children. Five different lactation consultants, including a counselor from the La Leche League, couldn't figure out the problem, or help my babies nurse. Meanwhile, I got mastitis over and over again. This book made me feel that if I couldn't get breastfeeding right, there was something wrong with me. That my baby would suffer, that I am a bad parent for having to go to formula. If breastfeeding is so natural, why couldn't I do it? Am I some sort of Darwinian reject? With all the problems I had breastfeeding, my first baby lost 1 pound the first week of her life. And I was a nervous wreck from my sore nipples, mastitis and worry. What went wrong? I still don't know. This book makes it seem so easy, and implies if you do have problems, they're easily surmountable with a little effort and patience. That wasn't true for me. This book made me feel that feeding formula, or even breast milk from a bottle, would be tantamount to child abuse, but with my problems breastfeeding I ended up having little choice. It would be a kindness for the authors to acknowledge that sometimes the bottle is the best and wisest choice for the baby, and that sometimes no matter how hard you try, breastfeeding just doesn't happen, or happen in time before the baby starves to death."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"The Womanly Art has been considered the ultimate guide for the breastfeeding mother since the 1950s. In those days there was little medical research, most data was anecdotal and there were only a few mothers, and very few medical professionals who knew what breastfeeding was really like. The breastfeeding rates in the USA at that point were abysmal (As was infant health,) and LLL and this book changed all that. Breastfeeding rates rose and continue to rise in the USA and Europe, babies became healthier and breastfeeding became the norm, as it should be, this book and LLL are responsible.If the information in this book wasn't working and hadn't worked, breastfeeding wouldn't be as workable as it is for so many women for more than a generation, and have the record numbers of women now doing what is BEST for themselves and their babies. This book WORKS!This book is comprehensive. It covers most aspects of breastfeeding, BUT it pulls NO punches. Having a baby is in no way a convenience, and caring for that baby properly is not convenient either. Breastfeeding is not always simple, but this book makes it direct, and gives you the power and knowlege on how to be successful. Some may be offended by this book's frankness, it's dedication to the fact that BABIES are what this is all about (not convenience) and some are threatened by the facts which prove the absoluteness that breastfeeding has no peer in infant feeding and there is simply NO substitute for Human Milk. But this book is honest, it gives the needed answers and it has thousands, if not milllions, of women and babies to vouch for it. The 2004 Edition (soon to be released) has even more medical benefits (including 47 studies on reduction of breast cancer and the most important IQ studies,) as well as even more information for women who choose to return to the workplace and require expressing milk for their babies while they are gone. (Wait for the new book, it is great!)Parenting is not for the weak, the complaining, or the excuse makers. That goes double for breastfeeding parents. Breastfeeding CAN be done, and this book ELIMINATES the excuses and leaves the reader with ONE choice, that breastfeeding can be done and should be done. Through it's gentle manner, interesting case studies and medical fact, excuses why \\"I couldn't breastfeed....\\" are explained, dealt with and then eliminated by this book. That might makes it *difficult* for some to read. But that is the reason why it is the BEST book on the market for parents. You can do this, and the Womanly Art will give you the ability to do so, if you are willing.Eleanor Roosevelt once said, \\"No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.\\" The same can be said for making one feel \\"Guilty.\\" No one can make an other feel guilty, one can only tell the truth, which is what this book does.Read this book, and perhaps speak with a local La Leche League leader, and you WILL be able to breastfeed. It may take some courage, but that is what parenting is all about."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"Now in its sixth edition, The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding has served as guide to thousands of women determined to do the best for their babies. And it is loaded with encouragement and practical advice about getting started at baby's birth, and continuing breastfeeding as baby grows.Unfortunately, the dietary advice in this book is terrible, so wrong that it is likely to undermine all the good that is intended in giving baby breast milk instead of commercial formula.Let's start with the first sentence in the chapter on nutrition. \\"If you already have good eating habits, there is no reason for you to make any major changes while you are breastfeeding.\\" We'll look at what the authors consider to be good eating habits in a moment, but even when a woman's diet is very good, her body needs extra nourishment to build a healthy child during pregnancy and lactation. The feeding of special, nutrient-dense foods to pregnant and nursing women is a practice found among all traditional peoples. ... These special foods were invariably animal products, rich in fat, foods like fish eggs, shellfish, fish liver oils, carp, butter, whole milk, organ meats, bear fat, eggs and pickled bones. In China, for example, nursing women eat up to ten eggs per day, a \\"major\\" dietary change that ensures high levels of important vitamins and fatty acids in their milk.But according to La Leche League, women should avoid high levels of animal foods because \\"research has linked high-fat diets to heart disease and other ills.\\" Nursing mothers should cut back on animal fats and eat more plant-based proteins, they say. \\"Any fat that is solid at room temperature (butter, margarine, vegetable shortening) should be eaten in moderation,\\" is their advice, even though butter is an important source of nutrients and the trans fats in margarine and vegetable shortening are really bad news for the developing infant. \\"Safflower oil, canola oil, and soybean oil. . . are important for your health,\\" say the authors, even though these invariably rancid oils contain nothing of benefit to the mother or her infant.All women have to do to have healthy breastmilk, say the authors of this book, is to eat a varied diet and avoid sugar, additives, highly processed cereals and grains, caffeine and soft drinks. Nursing women should also avoid salt, they say, even though salt is vital for the development of the baby's brain and nervous system. Human milk contains sodium chloride for a reason, but there won't be much there if the mother is avoiding salt.As for supplementation, only brewers yeast and B12 for vegetarians are recommended. Women can get vitamin A from carrots, they say, totally ignoring research indicating the increased requirements for vitamin A during pregnancy and lactation, and the difficulty of converting carotenes in plant foods to true vitamin A found in animal fats. Tofu, full of mineral-blocking phytic acid, is just as good a source of calcium as milk products, say the authors of The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.As the national voice for breastfeeding, La Leche League has an enormous responsibility to provide nursing mothers with accurate information on diet and nutrition. Instead, the very women who have the will and intelligence to enact the dietary changes that will ensure the optimum development of their children are bamboozled into political correctness. Hints that breastfeeding by poorly nourished mothers shortchanges the nursing baby are sprinkled throughout the book-from pages devoted to dealing with fussy babies to the admission that breastfed babies are subject to tooth decay. The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding needs an overhaul and a change of focus-from the promotion of breastfeeding for breastfeeding's sake to breastfeeding for healthy babies..."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"Now in its seventh revised and updated edition, The Womanly Art Of Breastfeeding is a straightforward and thoroughly dependable 480-page reference filled from cover to cover with everything new mothers need to know about breastfeeding.

Because there are many stumbling blocks along the way, this book helps nursing and expectant moms navigate the obstacles so that you can have the breastfeeding experience you want. As critics have mentioned, its purpose is not to validate formula feeding. Yet, it isn't unfair to those who have chosen that path. It simply is not addressing formula feeding as a choice because it a breastfeeding book. And, no, it is not a technical manual. The Breastfeeding Answer Book is better suited for those who need or crave technical information. Rather, it is a book that shows the beauty of breastfeeding and helps moms understand that it is okay to follow your instincts, listen to your baby, and follow your heart."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I was disappointed with this book. While it contained a wealth of information on the benefits of breastfeeding, I was expecting more extensive and broadranging advice to help with breastfeeding problems. The common problems like poor positioning, mastitis and low supply were covered, but even here did not seem to cover much more than is readily found in the pamphletts handed out by pharmacies, hospitals and child health clinics. I was already a convert, but needed advice about specific problems I was having feeding my 4 month old. I expected that a book of this size would contain information on problems which were somewhat less common, but still very real issues for many breastfeeding mums. I wanted advice about feeding positions suitable for very large breasted women, how to manage a very fast supply and what to do about infant allergic reactions to breastmilk. The book was unhelpful for me on the first 2, and more alarmingly, pretty much dismissed the issue of infant allergies to breastmilk, basically advising mums to keep breastfeeding affected infants as breastmilk was the best source of nutition and least allergenic option. It failed to discuss the severe weight loss experienced by breastfeeding mothers on long term no-allergen diets or the implications for infant health when even a very restricted diet fails to eliminate the allergen. The &quot;breast is best&quot; advice was poor advice in our case and ultimately, crash weaning onto very expensive prescription-only hypo-allergenic formula proved the only answer to stop our son's continued weight loss, illness and bloody nappies. I still feel betrayed by the advice I read here (and elsewhere from similar philisophical sources), knowing it influenced my decision not to wean my son earlier and that this decision caused him unnecessary weeks of pain and suffering.The benefits of breastfeeding are covered well in this book and commmon problems are covered too. It falls down badly, however, in failing to acknowledge that for some mums and babies breastfeeding remains problematic to a degree that it impacts negatively on the parent/child relationship or on the parent/child's health. It indicates that breastfeeding will be viable, positive and healthy experience for mother and child, if only the mother is willing to invest the effort. This is an false picture which causes real psychological pain for the small minority of women who cannot breastfeed and nourish, and the larger minority who cannot breastfeed without negative consequences for their own health.This book is a very effective motivator and well champions the breastfeeding cause for infants. However, the seemingly &quot;at all costs&quot; approach detracts from it's appeal."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This book is a gift for mothers who wish to breastfeed. The support offered by LLL is encompased beautifully in its pages. It offers information and suggestions about breastfeeding and mothering babies and toddlers. I particularly like the chapter on fathering. The Womanly Art looks at breastfeeding and caring for a new baby as it affects the whole family.

Going to LLL meetings before and after your baby is born is a great way to get support for the most important job in your life!"},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This book provided extremely BASIC information about breastfeeding. When it comes to difficult issues, the book falls flat, simply referring you to a local La Leche League (LLL) chapter for assistance. It is propaganda, as other reviewers have noted, to coerce women into joining LLL. I didn't need to gather with a group of women, collective breasts exposed, to learn how to breastfeed my child, but I would have appreciated some honest, in-depth advice from a group that claims to be so knowledgeable on the subject.This book was a waste of money."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"Thank goodness my husband hid this book from me after I broke down in tears after consulting it. This book is LLL propoganda. New mothers feel guilt, conflict, frightened, etc. and the last thing they need is a book that promotes self doubt. If you don't believe everything the LLL preaches this book is not for you. The actual breast feeding information is helpful, but the sanctimonious preaching about how you and your family should live your lives is not. It's been 6 months since I've laid eyes on my copy -- and this morning I read Chapter 9. Their promotion of stay at home mothering is all well and good (I wish it was an option) -- but please -- I can STILL nurse my baby and bond with her. She's 8 monthts old today and I work full time, I pump, and she's had nothing but breast milk. She's perfectly happy, content, healthy and well adjusted. YOU CAN WORK and breast feed exclusively. I'm sure there is another book out there for you to read -- OR consult a lactation specialist.

That said....This book is really just self-promotion for LLL - rather than be given a practical solution, you're just told to contact LLL for support when problems arise. It's not terribly informative, mostly it's just an attempt to persuade women to breastfeed (a noble aspiration) but USELESS if you have already made that choice which is likely if you have purchased the book!To reach any useful information, you have to wade through pages of hippie nonsense and preaching.

From how to get breastfeeding off to a good start all the way through to starting solids and weaning, you can find just about any information on breastfeeding you need.Are you a working mom and need information on the mechanics of pumping and storing breastmilk? The answer is here. Are you an at-home mom and need suggestions on how to meet the needs of your baby while still taking care of the house, other children, your husband, and yourself?

If you're having a problem (thrush, mastitis, overactive letdown, etc.), this book is full of helpful tips and suggestions to help you overcome the problem.While this is a wonderful book for the breastfeeding mother to read, it's even better for the expectant mother to read---being prepared with knowledge and information ahead of time can help a mother avoid problems and have a wonderful breastfeeding relationship with her baby from the very beginning.This book should be on the bookshelf of every expectant or breastfeeding mother."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"As a first-time expectant mother, I naturally have a zillion questions about everything concerning my unborn baby. Every question I had about breastfeeding was answered in this Bible of Breastfeeding. Not only does this book tell you why, how, and when to breastfeed, but it covers all aspects of breastfeeding (how to overcome difficulties, how to know when your child is getting enough milk, etc...). I must admit that I was VERY anti-La Leche League, but as a result of reading this fabulous book, I am now a LLL member and attend meetings regularly. There ARE some things in the book (and at the meetings) that I disagree with (I plan to schedule my baby and he won't sleep with me at night), but I feel totally at liberty to just take things that make sense to me and to disregard what doesn't. This book is easy to read and a MUST for all expectant mothers! Don't wait until after the baby comes, get it the moment you find out you're pregnant!"},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This book provides some very good information on manual expression and breastfeeding techniques. It also has some good basic information on complications although I think that it needs more. I am fortunate enough to be able to stay home with our baby. However, if I were not I would find some of the information on breastfeeding and working offensive. Many women don't have the luxury of &quot;making the choice&quot; and weighing the pros and cons of going back to work-they can't afford not to go back. The book does educate about pumping for women who do work, but the inference is fairly strong that you shouldn't be. Additionally, if you are not a fan of Dr. Sears you are going to have difficulties with this book. It advocates for the family bed/ shared sleep and is dismissive about concerns like rolling over on the baby. We have a larger, queen-sized bed but I disagree that this alleviates that concern and feel that our baby is fine in her crib in the next room. I referred to this book many times in the first week our baby was home and it had useful information. I think it's good to be well educated about your options so I certainly don't regret buying it, but definitely think the stance of La Leche League is not for me. I have ordered Nursing Mother's Companion for more comprehensive information on specific concerns and nursing and think it will be better for an ongoing nursing relationship."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"What an empowering book! There are a lot of books out there now that talk about breastfeeding, but this one is by far my favorite. Like all the others, it has technical information about the many benefits of breastfeeding, positioning your baby, going back to work, and how to get help if you need it, but it goes so far beyond that! This book shares the incredible joy and sense of physical connection that are unique to the breastfeeding relationship, and is one of the few books I've read that affirms the tremendous importance of mothers to their babies. If you're thinking about breastfeeding and want more information, if you know you want to breastfeed and need to learn more (and PLEASE educate yourself before your baby is born -- breastfeeding is something that both mothers and babies can only learn by doing, and information is your ally!) or whether you're a proud breastfeeding mom who wants to share the experience of others in your mothering community, this book has so much to offer you. Breastfeeding has been a transformative experience for me, despite (or perhaps because of) early breastfeeding difficulties I had to overcome with both of my children. It was because of the wealth of wisdom and information in this book, and because of other help I received from La Leche League, that I was able to breastfeed successfully. I am deeply grateful to this organization, and amazed by what they've accomplished, particularly since I found out they're staffed almost entirely by volunteers."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"Is your baby due soon? This book is full of great information on breastfeeding and will help you make an informed decision about how to feed and care for your newborn baby. Or maybe your baby is already born and you are looking for a good book about breastfeeding. Either way, this book is a great resource!Many mothers come to realize, during the course of their pregnancy, that everyone she knows will offer her &quot;advice&quot; on how to feed and care for her newborn baby. That can be confusing to a new mother because so many women have different ideas about caring for the newborn. Helpful information is what you will find in this book.&quot;The Womanly Art of Breatfeeding&quot; offers a wonderful opportunity to read from the experts on the health topic of breastfeeding. When reading this book, a woman is offered suggestions about breastfeeding that when followed can ensure success. This book also covers how the father can be fully involved in the care of the baby. Many fathers will find this reassuring that they will not be &quot;left out&quot; because they're not bottle feeding.I enjoyed reading this during my first pregnancy, and I feel sure you will, too! Actually, I read it more than once because I enjoyed reading it so much. The parenting suggestions included in this book are, in my opinion, meant to be a guide for you. You will know your baby best. After reading this book you can look forward to believing in yourself and your ability to mother your baby. A mother will gain confindence from the information in this book. The Womanly Art gives mothers solid information to start successfully nursing a newborn while touching on less common subjects such as health problems with the newborn or the mother, after the birth and beyond. This book is a great resource for expectant mothers. The &quot;Womanly Art of Breastfeeding&quot; is the best!"},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This book covers all the wonderful things about breastfeeding - of which there are a lot. For anyone looking for encouragement for breastfeeding, and/or reasons to give friends and family about why you want to breastfeed, it's a great book.However, if you've already decided to breastfeed, and are looking for something to get you through the tough parts, I can't recommend it. As far a reader could tell from this book, there are no tough parts. My fear is that someone having a difficult time with breastfeeding could decide that something must be really wrong, and quit in discouragement believing that other women don't have such difficulties. Having breastfed my first child to 20 months, and at one year and counting with my second, I can tell you that there are very tough moments in breastfeeding. LLL would be doing women more of a service if they didn't softsoap it, or use the soft-focus filter on all the possible problems."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I finally got around to reading this wonderful book and I am filled with regret that I did not take the time to read it when I was pregnant with my first baby. So many problems could have been avoided. But I am thankful to have read it now and would highly recommend it to anyone hoping/planning to breastfeed their babies. My partner read a lot of information on breastfeeding while I was pregnant and his *informed* support helped me to decide that nursing my babies is the style of parenting I like best! So Dads, this is a good read for you too...This book is the most well-written, supportive book about how to breastfeed and why that I have ever read. It is written in a style that makes it easy to read, not as a textbook... much more humanly. And it is sectioned off so that if there is a subject you are particularly interested in you can easily access that information. It is well-indexed and I came away from it feeling so enthusiastic about nursing my children.Also brings home the fact that each and every one of us make a difference. The organization was started because of seven mothers who all had nursed their children and decided they wanted to help other mothers with the dying art of feeding a child at the breast. Very empowering."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"Twenty-five or so years ago, there were only a scant handful of breastfeeding books available, and even less support and practical advice from doctors. At that time, a book like &quot;The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding&quot; was a Godsend to mothers who wanted to breastfeed their babies. It not only offered them emotional support, and the knowlege that they were doing right by their babies, but it gave them some basic, practical advice on how to nurse. (And how to fight a medical and social establishment that would assume formula-feeding at every turn.)The advice wasn't extensive, but it was better than nothing. It let women know that it was ok (indeed, even desirable) to feed babies on demand, and that most babies would want to eat more than every 3-4 hours in the early weeks. It let women know that it was ok to nurse for more than a few weeks or months. It let women know that it was ok to delay solids past 6 weeks... or even 4 months. Oh yes, and the book also introduced readers to LaLeche League, a hands-on, personal, mother-to-mother support group where women could meet other women who were also nursing their babies.Today, bookstore shelves are overflowing with breastfeeding books. Most general babycare books offer tolerably good breastfeeding advice. Most doctors and hospitals are reasonably supportive and knowlegable about breastfeeding. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding for a minimum of one year.And... unfortunately, as a general breastfeeding book, Womanly Art has outlived its usefulness. Its general breastfeeding advice remains minimal and, sometimes, dated. Its tone has become far too strident for many mothers.If you are interested in a book about LaLeche League, and are already committed to, or at least very open to, its particular mothering philosophy, the book is worth a read. But it is very much a book about LLL's philosophy (which extends far beyond breastfeeding), NOT a book about how to breastfeed. For breastfeeding books there are many, many better choices available.Women who just want breastfeeding advice/information are likely to be offended and turned off by the book's tone and, and minimum, will be frustrated at having to wade through the philosophy in order to find the practical advice."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I bought this book at my local LLL meeting. I've read several breastfeeding books and this one was by far the least helpful. I found it to be very negative towards moms who want to return to work, yet this is a group who needs a lot of support to continue breastfeeding! It is also not a good problem solving book. I've been nursing my son for nearly five months now and whenever I've hit stumbing blocks along the way, this book has been of no help. I feel that if you don't have the LLL's ideal arrangement, you might not get the best help from this book.There is some good information in this book, however not enough for its size. The good information it does have is also contained in pretty much all of the other books I've read on this subject, so if you are on a tight budget, you might get more bang for your buck elsewhere.Books I found more helpful and more supportive include &quot;Nursing Mother Working Mother&quot; by Gale Pryor and &quot;Breastfeeding: A Mother's Gift&quot; by Pamela Wiggins and Katherine Dettwyler."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I would recommend this book to someone who was unsure about breastfeeding and needed some convincing.I knew I wanted to breastfeed my child, but I didn't know anything about how to do it. I purchased this book hoping it would fill in the how, but it didn't. I rarely picked it up after the baby was born. I found other books much more informative and helpful.I respect this book as the classic it is, and I appreciate the efforts to make breastfeeding more acceptable. For those reasons, it is valuable. For breastfeeding information and guidance, I would select another book."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This book made the dull months that I spent on bedrest with twins fly. I read and reread it. It made me feel (this is corny) like pregnancy and breastfeeding were beautiful and natural,which is true. Unbelivably, there are many people, including my own family that are anti-breasfeeding,I think as a reaction to the pressure women may get that it's the best thing or whatever. Well, any mom that has done it knows that attitude is disgustingly anti-woman. The book is well written, and offers tips on not just nursing, but every aspect of parenting. The only problem I have is that it is so bias toward nursing, the authors dismiss any information that may dissuade a mom from it. For example, it is not impossible to get pregnant while nursing, although unlikely. But overall, breastfeeding is convienent,healthy for mother and child, free and the ultimate in bonding. Why on earth not do it?"},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"Although I was breastfeeding for the second time, it was not easier. With the help of this book and La Leche volunteers, I was not only successful, I felt it was one of the most satisfying experiences I have ever had. I received a lot of mixed advices from doctors and friends but this book was more reliable than most. I wish I had it the first time."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"Almost everything you can think of to ask--or didn't realize you needed to ask--about breastfeeding and the normal course of nursing a baby is covered in this thoughtful and gently informative book. You are urged to follow your own instincts and do what feels right."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"La Leche League is the world's leading authority on breastfeeding. Now in its 40th year, LLL publishes its best ever edition of its classic manual. Going well beyond the &quot;how-to&quot;s of nursing a baby, this book provides valuable support for the breastfeeding couple. If you only buy one book about breastfeeding, make The Womanly Art your choice."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"in the midst of a world full of horror stories and negativity. I am trying for a baby and I plan on breastfeeding at least the first year, and it seems like every time I turn around, I hear from some mother how awful it is and how I'll give it up after the first few weeks. I also can't count the number of times I've heard the words, &quot;I tried, but I didn't have enough milk&quot;. I know now that more than likely, the particular mother I talked to had plenty of milk, but not enough SUPPORT. Also, everywhere I go, I see little babies with bottles in their mouths, and it makes me wonder if breastfeeding truly is so horrible that everyone gives it up.This book is a reminder that other women have nursed their babies successfully, despite very trying difficulties, so I probably can, too. Every time I'm feeling discouraged or have a question, I pick up this book. My question is always answered, and my confidence always restored."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"As other reviewers have said, this book has the wrong title. It should be 'LLL mothering philosphy, go elsewhere for practical advice'. There are only 3-4 pages on how to breastfeed, and the information on those pages is very basic. There is very little advice on good positioning and good latching, both of which are absolutely vital to breastfeeding. The funny thing is that my mother bought an earlier version of this book in the late 60's. I read it, found it fairly helpful, and decided to order a later version, thinking it would be more up-to-date. However, they seem to have taken out most of the helpful stuff from the earlier version."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This book helped me in so many ways...from encouraging me to continue BFing to helping to figure out what the heck was going on with me. I'm a mother of two expecting number three. With my first I had the worst BFing experience and I wish I had this book then. With my second I was ready to put up a fight I was going to BF this baby and I did until he was 11 months!! There were many subjects covered in this book such as conditions caused by BFing like engorgement, soreness, etc. as well as tips and other helpful advice. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who wants more info on BFing, expectant mothers etc."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"As a one-stop, all around basic information source, I loved this book. It covers all basic areas, aspects and concerns of breastfeeding. If you need more specific or more detailed information, a more problem specific book may be needed in addition to this one. I most definitely recommend this book as a general first guide to breastfeeding."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"Today's world of long commutes, 50-hour workweeks, and half-baked frozen dinners cries out, with the voice of a frail and faultless infant, for homespun mothering. The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding captures the coziness of 1956, compiling fascinating updated text and stories of mothers' own personal experiences into timeless wisdom defying decade.The women in this book exude the capable warmth one desires from a big sister or best friend, never preaching, just mentioning what worked for them, what normal really is for the breastfeeding family.The sincere sharing in this book is substantiated with countless scientific studies on the unique value of human milk, and indeed the milking process itself. Practical hints on working and pumping, storage of expressed milk, sleeping patterns, good nutrition, and mothering the mother, catapult this book into the new millenium.The reader closes the book convicted that breastfeeding is best in this mayhem, materialist world, and that mother is the individual most capable of identifying and satisfying the deep-seated needs of the child. Like a soul-soothing friend, the Womanly Art of Breastfeeding will be there time and again to comfort, share, and reassure."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This book does contain some useful information on learning to breastfeed, but it is really just an advertisement to join La Leche League. I am expecting my first child in a month, and I do plan to only breastfeed, but this book is very preachy not only on breastfeeding, but also on co-sleeping, mom's who work, and many other LLL beliefs - not just breastfeeding as the title would suggest. Read The Nursing Mother's Companion instead. It is not nearly as biased, and it only about breastfeeding."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"...and find my local leaders to be not so nice, I do like this book. Buy it."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"While this book does contain useful information about breastfeeding, it is presented in tandem with an entire world view, ethos, life plan... call it what you will... that was almost enough to turn me completely off the idea of breastfeeding. Certainly it was enough to make me fear going to a La Leche League meeting, though I'm told that the groups aren't all as bad as this book (thank god!)Basically, this book has two points it tries to get across: (1) if you don't mother the LLL way, you're wrong and harming your baby. This entails sleeping with your child in your bed until the child decides it's time to move to his/her own room, never EVER leaving your baby with a bottle of expressed breastmilk (it's just not the nurturing WAY!), following the extreme version of attachment parenting, and of course, let's not forget, letting your child nurse until he/she decides to stop (or until they go away to college).Point (2) is: If for any reason, you fail to breastfeed, it's your fault and you're a horrible mother. You didn't try hard enough. Your child will probably be sickly and frail and you have noone to blame but yourself.Now, don't get me wrong, I am pro-breastfeeding, even for extended periods of time and I think that some things about attachment parenting are great, but seriously, this book should not call itself the _Womanly Art of Breastfeeding_, but rather _Be A Mother Like Us, or Else, and This Means How We Breastfeed Too_"},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This book is not for a working mother (or a mommy that MIGHT go back to work) because it pushes the opinion that there is no better mother than one who stays at home. And the tone of the writing is rather critical of a mother that would do anything else. I plan to be home, but I didn't appreciate the tone and critical way it was written. Plus, I don't really think I needed to read long diatribes of the joys of motherhood as opposed to getting instruction and help on breastfeeding--which is why I bought the book.I found other books that really dealt with instructing you on breastfeeding that were more supportive and informative--and dealt with current-day options and obstacles... not just returning to work, but schedules that get thrown off due to death in the family, etc. This book covers pumping for back to work in 10 pages--2 of which are dedicated to telling you that there is no substitute for nursing! True, but I didn't need 2 pages of condescension to get this through to me.Additionally, I really resented the CONSTANT push to your local LLL chapters--it was like CONSTANT advertising!At the same time, if you could get through the muckety-muck there actually WAS good information buried in there. I will certainly keep it as a reference (since you will never find one book that covers everything on a single subject) and I would recommend it for the same--but I would never recommend reading it cover to cover."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"As a devout breastfeeder, which I vowed to be during my pregnancy, I was determined that breastfeeding would be a success for my daughter and me. She was then born as a champion nurser, and I left the hospital certain that my brilliant girl and I would spend the next year enjoying this special experience together. Three weeks later, however, when she was on what they termed her second large growth spurt, and ate and cried frequently, leaving me in fairly significant pain and exhausted, I ordered The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding. This had been recommended by La Leche League and some friends, so I waited eagerly to see solutions to all of my breastfeeding woes.What I got was a fairly lengthy tome about the virtues of breastfeeding, staying home with your children, and co-sleeping. Well, I can spout the benefits of breastfeeding with the best of them, and staying home isn't an option for me. I was given a lot of information about how different babies eat different amounts, that it's impossible to determine what schedule will be \\"normal\\" for each baby, and basically that direct breastfeeding was better than pumping. There were some helpful hints about dealing with mastitis and plugged ducts, but not many specifics beyond what any mom could suggest. Particularly unhelpful was the section about \\"choosing\\" to work, which described how mothers and babies are bonded and the impact on children of being separated from their mothers. As a working mother in a foreign country for my job, working for a company that will sue me if I quit, the word \\"choice\\" isn't in my vocabulary, so I didn't really appreciate the litany that nagged even more at my already bruised conscience.This book does have some helpful guidelines, and can be very encouraging to anyone wanting to breastfeed but unsure of themselves. Since I was already confident and determined to nurse, it wasn't as helpful for me. If there was a companion manual entitled something like \\"The Practical Science of Breastfeeding,\\" this would be a great counterpart. I just needed more specifics, about everything from pumping to hand expression to sleeping through the night. This was just a little too \\"everything is different for every family\\" for me."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I read this book before the birth of my son and I found it to be instrumental in my success with breastfeeding. We had a successful nursing relationship from day one, and I felt very much prepared for the inevitable bumps in the road. Because I'd read this book, I was much more confident in my ability to breastfeed, and when challenges did arise, I felt very confident that they were normal and that I could handle them easily. I really can't say enough good things about this book! And it's much more than just a breastfeeding book, offering lots of great advice for many aspects of parenting the first year. Happy breastfeeding!"},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This is a must-have, no-nonsense reference guide for the breastfeeding woman. It was invaluable to me when all the questions arose with my first breastfeeding experience, as well as packed with lots of interesting information that made me understand my body much better."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This Book was my little helper for about the past 5 years straight. I have had two daughters and breastfed to both of them. If I had a question, this is the book I turned to, it had all my answers. It helped me become an artist at breastfeeding."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This book is considered to be the &quot;Bible&quot; of breastfeeding, but I referred to it the least of the three books I read on breastfeeding. It is a very interesting read, but I found it to be a lot of parenting &quot;philosophy&quot; and not enough real, practical help for breastfeeding. The testimonies of other women were fascinating to read but this isn't the book I reached for in the middle of the night to answer the tough questions."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"This book was a total disappointment. It didn't tell me anything different from the information that I received free from my hospital. I was so frustrated when I got home from the hospital and I had read this book about a month before my daughter was born. The best advice I can give is to see a lactation consultant at the hospital where your child was born or see if you can have someone come in and actually help you have your baby latch on. The book has zero information as to how to wean your child as well."},{"Title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I read this book before the birth of my first child. The nursing information helped me make a success of a challenging start, and continued to help as my child grew. If you are looking for a \\"textbook\\" of nursing technique with some helpful hints for overcoming nursing difficulties, this is a good option.But there are other aspects of the book that disturb me. For one, it is very value-laden. By that I mean that the book is not really about breastfeeding as much as it is about parenting. It equates sucessful nursing with mothering in a very narrow and limited way. There really is very little room in this book for those moms who work, prefer routined feedings vs. demand feedings, or have any parenting views that differ from the \\"attachment parenting\\" paradigm.Second, there are several statements made without any support or research. One of which was (I'm paraphrasing) that in all of history only one baby has ever been smothered while co-sleeping. I'm assuming they're thinking of the biblical example (king solomon), but anyone who reads the newspaper knows that this statement is absurd. Still, I recommend the book - and it could be especially good for those who are only half-committed to breastfeeding. It certainly gives a persuasave case for it!"},{"Title":"New Brewing Lager Beer: The Most Comprehensive Book for Home and Microbrewers","review":"This classic book has recently emerged from the land of the out-of-print books in a new edition, and I bought one as soon as I found out it was available. As an experienced homebrewer, I found it fascinating and informative. Noonan gets down to the hardcore chemical and technical foundations of brewing. And if you are interested in decoction mashing, Noonan provides what is probably the best description of the process that is available in print. This book is perfect for the professional brewer or advanced all-grain homebrewer.However, the sheer volume of detail would bore a newcomer to brewing, or worse yet, scare him or her off. The beginner simply doesn't need this much highly-technical information. However, after that beginner gets a few batches under his belt, this book would be a good addition to his or her brewing library."},{"Title":"New Brewing Lager Beer: The Most Comprehensive Book for Home and Microbrewers","review":"Noonan's text is simply superb. It is well organized, extremely detailed, and concise. This is a book about how and why you use each part of the brewing process. Noonan champions and explains the decoction mash, and even explains how to figure out if the malt you're using needs a decoction or an infusion mash. Appendices address both the infusion mash and the step mash, concisely, yet in detail.The first third of the book, dedicated to ingredients, is alone worth the price. The detail on malt, brewing water, and yeast instantly imparts a greater understanding of and appreciation for the brewing process.Read this book and begin to make informed decisions about your ingredients and the processes you use to brew beer from them."},{"Title":"New Brewing Lager Beer: The Most Comprehensive Book for Home and Microbrewers","review":"This book is required reading for any serious brewer. After reading it, you will know how to choose your ingredients, the correct process for your ingredients and the proper equipment to make high quality beers. There is a lot of good advice for setting up your brewery (at home or otherwise) and the general guidelines for getting the most out of your brews. Even though I have been an all-grain brewer for some time, I find that I still go back to Noonan's book for practical information rather frequently. The only downside to this book is that the theoretical sections can be rather confusing. I am an engineer by education and I had a difficult time of understanding the enzyme reactions that occur in a mash or way hop resins combine with ions in the wort. A good deal of this in-depth theory made this book read like a college text, instead of like a book for the hobbyist.Still, once you can distinguish the practical aspects from the theoretical information, this book is a must-have."},{"Title":"New Brewing Lager Beer: The Most Comprehensive Book for Home and Microbrewers","review":"This is without question the best book for homebrewing available. It is the only one that covers decoction mashing in detail. Most German brewers and even Anheuser-Busch use this efficient method to get maximum flavor and yield for your beer. Noonan covers a broad area of topics in great detail. From brewing chemistry to practical procedures outlined for the intermediate to advanced brewer, Noonan hits the bullseye. If you have brewed a little and really want to get into it, get this book!"},{"Title":"New Brewing Lager Beer: The Most Comprehensive Book for Home and Microbrewers","review":"This is the best written of all the brewing books I've read. Noonan is concise and informative about every aspect of brewing lagers. The chapters are organized well ('Water', 'Hops', 'Malt') and he is easy to follow when he lays out the procedures for brewing an all-grain beer. Two minor complaints: Noonan trumpets the primacy of the decoction mash and derides infusion mashing, which may give the novice homebrewer some confusion as to the 'proper' way to proceed; the book is also very scanty with recipes, though it never promises any and indeed its technical side is so superior to Papazian or Miller or anyone else out there, it belongs on the shelf of every homebrewer anyway."},{"Title":"New Brewing Lager Beer: The Most Comprehensive Book for Home and Microbrewers","review":"In January I was lucky to be stuck in Berlin with Salmonella...because it gave me a month to go through this book chapter by chapter, reading, and re-reading with highlighter. And after 2 reads and a well worn and hi-lit version of the book, I have to admit, it is a potent and nearly perfect book for understanding how brewing works on a variety of levels. Best of all, it follows through all methods of all grain brewing for lager beer in the traditional Germanic style.Thought the book tends to repeat itself a little as it describes the process, then re-describes the brewing process for practical use, it is well descriptive with paragraphs making perfect sense on a variety of levels of information. Once read by a beginner, he then has a great source for a step into higher understanding of the chemistry and biology behind brewing.I put this book as THE BEST brewing book on my ever expanding beer book shelf."},{"Title":"New Brewing Lager Beer: The Most Comprehensive Book for Home and Microbrewers","review":"...this is /the/ book for those who wish to enter all-grain (as opposed to extract or partial mash) brewing. The title specifically references lager beers, but the information, techniques and theory described apply to the production of ales as well. Don't buy this book first if you are just entering brewing as a hobby, but do buy it second or third if you move on to all-grain methods.Cheers to beers."},{"Title":"New Brewing Lager Beer: The Most Comprehensive Book for Home and Microbrewers","review":"Although this book has a lot of useful information in it, I was disappointed to find it was not about lager at all. It is simply a general purpose brewing book with a lot of emphasis on all grain brewing. This makes it hard to rate because as a lager book it gets zero stars, which is why it was on my Christmas wish list."},{"Title":"New Brewing Lager Beer: The Most Comprehensive Book for Home and Microbrewers","review":"New Brewing Lager Beer is the probably the most scientific brewing book I own. It goes through the chemistry of the mash, the effects of the water, calculations for almost everything you could run across, and several other things I can't remember. It has a small section of recipes, but it's mainly a fundamental knowledge book.It is also the fundamental resource for one of the most difficult methods of homebrewing beer: the dreaded triple decoction mash all grain brew. Apart from using wild yeasts, nothing strikes fear in the hearts of homebrewers like the thought of a decoction mash. Instead of shying away from it or explaining it away, Noonan embraces the technique with an almost religious zeal. Although decoction mashes require several times the amount of effort and care of a standard mash, Noonan's process leads the brewer through it as easily as possible, and the results are simply not reproducible by other means. The question is: is that flavor worth the effort? For Noonan, it is. For most other brewers, it isn't. For those types, Noonan provides scaled down mashing processes, including double and single decoctions, step mashes, and the basic infusion. (after trying all of them, I've settled on the step for most of my brews. I figure it gives a good balance of conversion/extraction and not taking all damn day!)For all its technical information, New Brewing Lager Beer is short on a couple fronts. It does not have much on recipe formulation or much of anything on ales, as the name would suggest. But that's ok: lots of other books have those."},{"Title":"New Brewing Lager Beer: The Most Comprehensive Book for Home and Microbrewers","review":"I have many books dealing with the subject of brewing and I find this to be right at the top of the list. The late Mr. Noonan presents a book not only relevant to brewing lager beers, but a wealth of brewing knowledge that carries over to all aspects of brewing.The art of making beer as a whole is represented. There are 40 pages on water alone. While a new brewer would find this book to be a lot to take in, anyone who has been brewing for a little time will gain much from this book. Mashing, lagering, water adjustment - it is all here and backed up with concrete science. Greg used the word 'Comprehensive' in the title and he delivered."},{"Title":"New Brewing Lager Beer: The Most Comprehensive Book for Home and Microbrewers","review":"Greg Noonan is probably one of the best authors on brewing books. This book is a great reference for brewing lagers, if not just brewing alltogether. This book is backed by true data, not anecdotes. Whether brewing lagers or ales, this book should be on your brew library shelf!!"},{"Title":"New Brewing Lager Beer: The Most Comprehensive Book for Home and Microbrewers","review":"This is one of the few book on brewing that I would recommend to everybody who is truly interested in art of making beer. Everything within the book is logically arranged and is layered from baseline topics to more advanced ones. This makes it very easy for Advanced brewers to skip the child's play and move right along into the good stuff, and for beginners to read all they need to know and skip through the scientific mumbo jumbo."},{"Title":"New Brewing Lager Beer: The Most Comprehensive Book for Home and Microbrewers","review":"I had the pleasure to hear Mr. Noonan speak about beer, he knows about beer and the beer world.Reading his book bring a sea of information at all levels - I got a bit lost in the bio-chimistry of fermentation transformation. Nonetheless, if you want to go beyond amateur brewing this is a must.Only drawback, after 10 years a refreshed version would be welcome."},{"Title":"New Brewing Lager Beer: The Most Comprehensive Book for Home and Microbrewers","review":"A lot of people like to group brewing books in to begginer and expert categories with nothing in the middle. As a brewer for over a year now I'm fairly well informed but far behind more experience(or obsessed) people. I found this book particularly interesting. I would not say I learned a lot of ground breaking practical information for my brewing process but I certainly learned more scientific information I didn't know. I can see how this would be a slow reader to those who \\"just want to brew\\" or those who didn't endure a chemistry/biology class or two."},{"Title":"New Brewing Lager Beer: The Most Comprehensive Book for Home and Microbrewers","review":"DO NOT get this book if you are a beginner looking to start brewing, I recommend How To Brew by John Palmer for that, a truly excellent book to start with. This is more of a reference guide for the advanced brewer ( being a beginner myself I have yet had a chance to use it )."},{"Title":"New Brewing Lager Beer: The Most Comprehensive Book for Home and Microbrewers","review":"In short this book was 90% about brewing which I already have several books on. I was thinking this going to be all the tricks and hints on how to make your lagers crisp and clean. You get a few temps and times but other than that just a lot of over your head chemistry and diagrams. I don't need a detailed breakdown of lager yeast to know what it does and why! If you need to know how to boil your wort (it's in here) you don't need to be brewing lagers yet."},{"Title":"New Brewing Lager Beer: The Most Comprehensive Book for Home and Microbrewers","review":"I enjoyed the book however the technology is outdated and most people ferment lagers at 9-11C, secondary ferment then filter at -2C. Nothing on force fermenting or Hermes systems for infusion mashing. OK reference book for the shelf."},{"Title":"New Brewing Lager Beer: The Most Comprehensive Book for Home and Microbrewers","review":"I hesitate giving this book a bad review because it's clear that anyone who does so must not be \\"advanced\\" enough in homebrewing to appreciate it. (We might not be altogether different from those who couldn't see the emperor's new clothes.)The book certainly isn't about brewing lagers (as opposed to other styles.) The author says as much in his introduction. That was a disappointment. More disappointing was the tone. It read more like a textbook than what I've come to enjoy in \\"homebrewing books.\\" (Books like Papazian's and Palmer's among others.) It screams with the message that brewing is just too serious of a matter to have fun with. I disagree. I guess that means I'm just a beginner."},{"Title":"MythBusters: The Explosive Truth Behind 30 of the Most Perplexing Urban Legends of All Time","review":"I've only caught MythBusters a few times on tv, but enjoy it enough to have shelled out for the book. It's fun to be able to read about their efforts without having to go to the effort to remember when the show is on tv ...Well written, with the same sense of humor and fun that Adam and Jamie display on the air.(And, for the reviewer who panned the book because she 'didn't know it was based on a tv show,' ... why should you blame the book because you didn't read the description?

One could be tempted to skip through all the writing about what they actually did during the show and just read if the myth's busted.

I found this book to be redundant at best.Other than a bit of background info on the hosts and the producer, there is absolutely nothing in this book that you won't find on the TV shows.All the info they cover is just a re-hash of each episode from the TV show, and given the choice, the TV show version is much much better than a print version that literally has low-resolution \\"screenshots\\" from the episodes to illustrate.I was also surprised to find the last 11 pages of the book Absolutely Blank!This was not a mis-print, it was probably cheaper to print the book with those pages left blank than to physically leave them out. The authors could not get enough information to fill in the blank sections?The book seems to be a rush-job that just capitalizes on the popularity of the TV show.The TV series this book is based on illustrates everything in the book MUCH clearer than the book itself.Given the option, buy or rent the DVDs of the TV series and forget about this book."},{"Title":"MythBusters: The Explosive Truth Behind 30 of the Most Perplexing Urban Legends of All Time","review":"Got this for my 7-year-old son.

Perhaps this is because of a marketing failure on behalf of its publishers or perhaps it is due to a lack of reviewers pointing out the value it offers to a general audience. Whatever the case may be the fact remains that this book _is_ worth reading--by the professional attorney _and_ the average man or woman on the street. The purpose of my review here is to show, in essence, why._The Art of Cross-Examination_ teaches its readers how--meaning: by what methods--the truth can best be reached given conflicting stories or observations (whether they result from dishonesty, or from a failure to properly identify the truth).One of the things readers will learn from this book is how to--and when or when not to--ask the questions that will lead one to the truth, whatever that turns out to be in each case. You will learn the methods and the proper manner of cross-examination and then you'll learn how both of these apply in differing contexts (such as when cross-examining an expert or a perjured witness).As in all great non-fiction books Wellman presents what is being taught clearly, building in each chapter on what was learned in the previous one. More importantly, the author presents his case for how a proper cross-examination should be conducted by reference to numerous, often-humorous, and always-dramatic instances of successful cross-examinations. It is because of this, that an attorney young in years (if he or she reads this book carefully) may be experienced in knowledge well beyond his actual age. And this, I think, is the major reason why it has--quite properly--become a classic in the field of law.One example of the type of instances Wellman cites in his book ought to be sufficient to show how instructive _and memorable_ they can be. This particular instance is a humorous case where the author himself is cross-examining the witness. The suit was brought against the Metropolitan Street Railway after two of the company's electric cars collided. I will let the author, in his own words, explain the rest.\\"The plaintiff, a laboring man, had been thrown to the street pavement from the platform of the car by the force of the collision, and had dislocated his shoulder. He had testified in his own behalf that he had been permanently injured in so far as he had not been able to follow his usual employment for the reason that he could not raise his arm above a point parallel with his shoulder. Upon examination ... I asked the witness a few sympathetic questions about his sufferings, and upon getting on a friendly basis with him suggested that he be good enough to show the jury the extreme limit to which he could raise his arm since the accident. The plaintiff slowly and with considerable difficulty raised his arm to the parallel of his shoulder. 'Now, using the same arm, show the jury how high you could get it up before the accident,' was the next quiet suggestion; whereupon the witness extended his arm to its full height above his head, amid peals of laughter from the court and jury.\\"This example is but one of many. What it shows is, not just the value this book has for budding attorneys, but also its appeal to the general public. In many ways it offers the same value as do the numerous stories about dumb criminals that we hear almost daily on radio programs or in the newspapers. Yet, for my own part, this book is decidedly better--for its emphasis is not on the stupidity of common criminals but on the intelligence and skill of heroic lawyers._The Art of Cross-Examination_ is thus a book for those who want to see great minds at work (and discover what made their success possible). It is a book that entertains as much as it instructs--and because of this has appeal to those both within and outside of the specific audience for which it was written. In short, if you are intrigued by the drama of the courtroom or seek to one day take an active part in that drama, you will love this book.(Note: the book, however great, is not without faults--and I do not therefore endorse it unconditionally. The author makes some glaring errors in his descriptions of human nature that I cannot agree with and I do not subscribe to his belief that _absolute_ certainty is impossible to us as humans. These faults--and a few others of less grave consequence--detract from the overall value of the book but they do not mar its value too much. And thus, my enthusiastic recommendation of this book, albeit with this minor note of caution.)"},{"Title":"The Art of Cross Examination","review":"Back in 1973, when I rose to my hind legs to cross examine my first adverse witness in my first jury trial, I had but one thought on my mind: &quot;What do I do now?&quot; The answer came to me from a little paperback book I had picked up on a whim while I was in law school. Remembering a few of the teachings in that book, I struggled through that cross and several more en route to a favorable jury verdict.The first two years of my law practice, I read &quot;The Art of Cross Examination&quot; once every three months, and I profited from each re-reading. Wellman gives a wealth of basic practical advice, gives it in an engaging fashion, and illustrates it with entertaining stories. When you read it, you may find some gender references which we &quot;enlightened&quot; moderns would describe as &quot;politically incorrect,&quot; but try to remember that the book was written a century ago. Despite the fact that it's beginning to show its age a little, this book is THE classic commentary on cross examination. Nowhere else can you find such good instruction at such a low price.

He let me try the case, and we received a rather just decision from the court. I was quite proud of myself, only to learn from my boss that the senior partner felt that my style of cross examination was ineffective at best.I determined to learn all I could about effective cross examination. The first book I read was also the last- Wellman's The Art of Cross Examination.

What a disappointment. The book is obsolete and contains virtually nothing of any use to today's trial lawyer. It's a fun read, and it's interesting to see some of the examinations excerpted, but using this book to learn to cross-examine is probably close to malpractice.

Wellman, therefore, provides the reader with several examples of lawyers employing different styles of cross-examintion.In terms of learning the craft of cross-examination, the most valuable chapters deal with the examination of experts and in the examination of the \\"fallacies of testimony\\" and the \\"Silent Cross-Examination.\\"In reading Wellman's work, the reader must be cognizant of the fact that the book was written in 1903 and, as a result, realize that some of the \\"practical\\" advice may be outdated. Even so, there still may be value in that advice.In the end, the same thing was true in 1903 as it is today - the practice of law is really the art of borrowing and Wellman has provided much for the practitioner to borrow."},{"Title":"The Art of Cross Examination","review":"As soon as they're hired, each of my new associates always recieves this book as a gift.The reason for this is twofold. On the one hand this book, dating from more than a century ago, imparts the kindly sensibilities the practice of law once had (and really, should still have).On the other hand, this book is masterful in its treatment of the process of cross examining witnesses.Second in significance only to the selection of a jury, the process of cross examination is key to winning jury trials. This is because admissions tendered by the opposing party can eliminate disputed issues or focus attention on credibility problems.Though Wellman often goes into great detail in explaining his examples, it's been my experience that new attorneys to the field cannot help but benefit from such complete treatments.In this way, Wellman leads by example both in relation to his gentility and his prowess."},{"Title":"The Art of Cross Examination","review":"This is a book of a famous attorney who lived from the late 1800's to the l940's. His book is a description of his many court appearances and the value of cross-examination to discover truth and fraud. It is a must read for anyone who anticipates being on the witness stand, especially expert witinesses. It has great humor, but more importantly, describes the time proven methods of cross examination to bring out the truth. It demystifies the process and gives a human side to a mostly misunderstood and mistrusted activity. It also shows why cross examination is so very important.

The book has about 5 pages of good advice. Unfortunately, it is distributed across 450 pages of bloated reminiscenses by windbags who bored even their contemporaries to death with endless tales of their salad days in court. Sad. It's about as useful in modern litigation as a copy of Hammurabi's code, but not nearly as succinct.Do yourself a favor and get a copy of Nolo's Deposition Handbook, which has about 300 pages of good advice conveniently distributed over 300 pages of text."},{"Title":"The Art of Cross Examination","review":"Page 33 line 13, &quot;To be a great advocate, you must be a great actor&quot;.

It really is &quot;art&quot; in every sense of the word.Who else but a highly trained artist, is able to cross-examine a hostile witness, who also happens to be a veteran cop, in such a manner that the cop actually ends up helping secure an acquittal?

NO WAY!Bottom line, if you are a great lawyer wishing to become an excellent lawyer, this book is required reading. Nuff said!"},{"Title":"The Art of Cross Examination","review":"Any trial lawyer has heard of this book and many probably have it. That doesn't mean that they have read it. The reason for having the book is that it has been around so long--the author was a trial lawyer in the late 1800s--that everyone feels that they must have it. The reason they have not read it is because it is very difficult and seems so outdated. The practice of law has changed considerably since the late 1800s.Much of what Wellman has to say is not practical anymore and the cases he relies on have no real parrallels to litigation today. Even some of his techniques--no matter what the case--are now considered wrong. Think how much the practice of medicine has changed since the 1800s!One simple example that trial lawyers can relate to is that Wellman suggests that once you impeach a witness with a prior inconsistent statement, you should then confront the witness and say, \\"Which statement is true?\\" He then instructs that you should keep arguing with the witness about which statement is true. Whether this was successful in the 1880s is impossible to know, but any good trial lawyer knows that it is an unsuccessful technique today.Having said all this, the book does provide a good historical account of trial practice and is worthy of reading if that is your goal."},{"Title":"The Art of Cross Examination","review":"While it is clear that Francis Wellman had tremendous success as a civil and criminal lawyer in the early 1900s, it is also clear that the advent of television, vis-a-vis- The Practice, Law and Order, etc, along with hundreds of movies filmed inside the courtroom, have outdated this book.As stated in another review, the advice about actual technique offered in this book is sparce while the recollections of Mr. Wellman's trial days fill the pages, unnecessarily. While reading these examples of cross-examination, it becomes almost laughable how Mr. Wellman prides himself on how he beat various witnesses in ways that if were on television today would not be renewed for a second season for lack of creativity.In the first example of an \\"expert\\" cross-examination, Mr. Wellman recalls the cross of a witness who the attorney attempts to prove is lying. The \\"zinger\\", after three pages of cross, is the attorney finally showing the witness a letter disproving his testimony (wow?). In fact, in the next few hundred pages, most of the crosses referenced are merely endless tesimony culminating with a piece of documetary evidence, like an almanac, picture, or treastise, that finally questions the credibility of the witness.While this method of cross-examination may have been revolutionary in 1900, today with the availability of witness information from infinite sources, and the public recognition of litigators whose crosses include more than attacking credibility, his book reads as antiquated and boring."},{"Title":"The Art of Cross Examination","review":"An outstanding book with excellent examples of the use of cross-examinations.

Apparently he refers to it a lot because it so informative."},{"Title":"The Art of Cross Examination","review":"This is actually a great management and sales book written by a lawyer for lawyers. Wellman explains techniques to elicit answers in the most revealing way in a courtroom environment. However, anyone who has a large staff or who sells for a living, gathering information from others in order to make decisions, can benefit from this book.In essence, Wellman is relying on a timeless and useful concept: \\"show, don't tell.\\" Use your questions to elicit a response, not to bludgeon or to make your own point. The answers of others will more effectively make your point better than you can make it yourself. Also, asking the right questions will yield surprising information. For sales people, proper questions gets at the real reasons for customer resistance.One of the maxims of negotiation is that people change their mind while talking. Thus, these techniques are helpful when you are trying to convince or influence some one in a negotiation. Proper, non-accusatory questioning allows the other side to justify changes in their positions that is beneficial for you as well. Also, it helps you figure out why they are taking certain positions, which leads to more win-win opportunities.I read once that thinking is actual a series of questions asked to yourself. As a result, this book will also help you think. Ask yourself better questions, and you will get a better quality of thought.Also, if you have kids this book can be helpful (especially Chapter 4, 'Cross Examination of the Perjured Witness'). Calmly probing what you suspect to be a fabricated story is much more effective than yelling or accusing. I can usually get a full confession faster than Perry Mason!I first learned of this book during an interview with F Lee Bailey.

I first came across this paperback in Law School during mock trials, and have come to rely upon it many, many times especially at preliminary hearings.Although dated (first edition 1903), the author quotes extensively from memorable cases and utilizes them to illustrate both the manner and matter of cross-examination. Wellman covers the topics of handling perjured witness and the expert, and the importance of sequence and the importance of paying attention to the nature of the psychology of the witness.The aspect of Wellman showing how, and knowing when, to illicit information from the witness is why this book has become famous.Wellman uses many famous (at the time) cases that are very humorous, and also timeless (marital discord in 1903 is marital discord in 2004, for example).

The context and culture, however, make these seem natural to the story and they are not the \\"isms\\" of violence and hate, but simple ignorance and conditioning.I am hoping that there is some work, in the body before me, that is not just romantic adventure, or tales of the exotic, meant for an entirely different century.There are a lot of books before me and I wouldn't mind if a few were really good."},{"Title":"Deadly variations","review":"To find out just how much our world has changed in the last ten to fifteen years, one has but to read a 'thriller' or 'espionage' type novel of the late 1980s. When the Iron Curtain descended for the final time, this entire genre of novels became almost superfluous. Almost--but not quite, especially if they were well done and believable in the first place.To me, thankfully, the 'Deadly . . .' books by Paul Myers are in this latter category, as classical music is one of my passions, and Mr. Myers knows very well whereof he writes! Having spent his working career as a producer and recording engineer for some of the biggest names in the classical music world, (The Cleveland Orchestra and George Szell among them) he is very well equipped to write about the musical world.His travels, obviously, also provided him with background information about the major cities and concert halls in his world. The reader may never be fortunate enough to visit these marvelous venues in person, but the six books in this series will take you to a good many of them, as Mark Holland does dual-duty as an artist's agent and previous-but-dragged-into-it-again undercover agent for the UKs 'Department'.This first book, written well in advance of the curtain's descent leans heavily on the rescue of an East German scientist twelve years before the story opens. It appears that he's now stumbled on an important discovery -- a deadly formula for germ warfare. Since Mark is the man who brought him out from behind the Wall, he trusts him -- and only him -- so Mark is brought back into the department. Temporarily.Of course, it doesn't work quite that way -- once an agent, always an agent, it seems. In spite of his protests Mark finds himself in Vienna, New York and London before returning home to Geneva and yet more treachery. Music lovers will enjoy the tidbits of gossip, while trying to figure out 'who is this?' whereas those readers who like espionage- type thrillers should be satisfied with this fast-paced story that abounds in twists and turns. The final clue is a dandy! It could only have happened in a musical world. I'm off to re-read Deadly Cadenza, the next book in the series. Too bad the series can't be re-issued!"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Guide to Cunnilingus: How to Go Down on a Woman and Give Her Exquisite Pleasure (Ultimate Guides Series)","review":"This book is a must for any woman wanting to improve her technique and suprise her lover. Every aspect of going down is covered between the pages of this book. If you ever had a question about going down this book answers it whether it concerns ejaculate, techniques, visual stimulation, toys, and even practicing.[...]"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Guide to Cunnilingus: How to Go Down on a Woman and Give Her Exquisite Pleasure (Ultimate Guides Series)","review":"When eating ice cream it is not typical to think of new ways to enjoy it. But perhaps one could use a different spoon, or maybe let the sides of the bowl or container warm up a bit first in order to make the ice cream more creamy. Timing is of course an issue, as one cannot let it all melt, and one does not want to hurry it down, lest one not be able to enjoy the taste and texture. So there are some rules that apply to the eating of ice cream, violation of which lowers the overall experience.For those who worship the female triangle, its warmth, its texture, its aroma, and its taste, the same sort of rules apply, and this book details these rules, without the clinical overtones that are sometimes encountered in literature and film on the subject. Even those seasoned in the art of pleasuring the triangle can always gain from advice. There may be different angles to pursue, as one maps out the geometry of the triangle, with the intent always of bringing its bearer to that blissful end state characterized by distinct auditory tones and bodily writhing.Whether the triangle is decorated or not, the author invites its worshipper to take due diligence in its care, knowing though that health and pleasure do not have to be antonyms, and that each triangle has its own distinct characteristics, giving unique pleasure to both involved. The clock plays a role of course. Timing can be delicate and highly variable, and experience works wonders. In general, one is to walk slowly at first: just a stroll. The circumstances will determine the rate, whether one backs off or moves forward with determination. Its bearer will send the signals to this end, but the author gives hints on how to read these. And just like good ice cream, one cannot help but to clean the bowl."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Guide to Cunnilingus: How to Go Down on a Woman and Give Her Exquisite Pleasure (Ultimate Guides Series)","review":"Well better late than never. When I was growing up and going through my teenage years, the only advice I got on how to lick the harry hatchet wound was from comedian Sam Kinison. He said just to write the alphabet. Well I figured out the hard way that's not really true, and making the letters K, X, and F are pretty difficult and can give your tongue a cramp.Now that I have read this book, I feel like a world class tuna taco eater. As I read this book, it felt as if I was a spy reading enemy battle plans. I learned about nerve endings in the clitoris, to electric signals from the vulva. After completing this book, all I can say is that the vagina has got to be the most confusing piece of flesh in the world, you really do need a book.

It will help.)"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Guide to Cunnilingus: How to Go Down on a Woman and Give Her Exquisite Pleasure (Ultimate Guides Series)","review":"I checked out this book because it has been nominated for an award in London, and was quite surprised at the depth and detail covered here. Most books that claim to explain stimulating women sexually seem to handle the material with kid gloves, almost with distaste. But the author clearly has a passion for explaining exactly how the female sexual response system works, and what types of stimulation produce pleasurable results. This is the first time I have seen cunnilingus clearly and honestly explained, and it is without a doubt the most complete book on the topic.In addition, because the author is a young sex educator working in the field -- at the established sexual pleasure pioneer Good Vibrations nonetheless -- the information goes beyond standard cunnilingus, providing how-to's on every possible variation one can imagine. Using manual stimulation (hands), adding sex toys, incorporating anal play, cunnilingus and S/M, sexual fantasy and cunnilingus, female genital massage, sexual pressure points to heighten pleasure, and the list goes on. There is a mine of information here, as well as etiquette for givers and receivers. The tone is warm and engaging, and doesn't make the mistake many sexual pleasure guidebooks make by coming off too seriously, or using \\"New Age\\" terms -- no \\"goddesses\\" or \\"yonis\\" here.This book rises far above the rest, and I've read them all. Most come off as soundbites, whereas this is a complete book and an exhaustive resource. It deserves to win that award."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Guide to Cunnilingus: How to Go Down on a Woman and Give Her Exquisite Pleasure (Ultimate Guides Series)","review":"This is a very good book, and it successfully managed to improve my sex life. With the techniques learned in this book, you can definitely give your lover pleasure without pain. The descriptions are short but to the point, and the techniques are what really get detailed in the book. There are also some chapters that inform you about the dangers of cunnilingus, such as disease and the effect that bad hygiene can have on both people. There are safety tips, cleanliness tips, and foreplay techniques.While this book is helpful for both men and women, it was clearly intended for lesbians. There's nothing wrong with that at all, but it just limits the information a man like myself can use. Most, if not all the illustrations in the book involve two women, and about 1/3 of the entire book covers relationships between lesbian lovers, and techniques and activities that could only be done between them. The author even stresses the fact that she is a lesbian, and that the book is intended mostly for that audience. Despite that, the book is helpful to both men and women, and I thought that it was very informative, well thought-out, and the author wasn't afraid to use coloquial language...no 'beautiful flowers' or 'godesses' in this book...just general terminology and slang, making it easier to read and understand. Definitely a great book for men or women looking to improve their sex life."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Guide to Cunnilingus: How to Go Down on a Woman and Give Her Exquisite Pleasure (Ultimate Guides Series)","review":"The title of this book is perfect for the content, as this is certainly the ultimate guide. I have bought and read all of the books on this subject, and Blue's book covers everything, literally everything, in a tasteful and warm-hearted manner. There are more ideas for cunnilingus, and giving a woman an orgasm with your mouth, than anywhere else. Every step is detailed and nothing is left to question. There are many helpful illustrations, dozens upon dozens of techniques and the book goes far into territory that other books do not cover. Of all the cunnilingus guides available, this one is the most useful.While I am a straight man, I had no problems with the material's all-orientation presentation. The author makes no assumptions about who is reading the book and instead concentrates on exploring the subject to the absolute limits. I have a mouth and lips, and my wife has female anatomy; this book was written for me. I was especially pleased to find out the lesbian tips, though the author makes it clear she is not a lesbian herself it is refeshing to know she has researched every angle for the book, including lesbian resources.

It is simply the best."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Guide to Cunnilingus: How to Go Down on a Woman and Give Her Exquisite Pleasure (Ultimate Guides Series)","review":"This is THE book to get on going down on a woman.

It's essential reading for guys who want to know exactly how to make women come and what happens physiologically when they do. Plus the sections on using extra tricks with cunnilingus like blindfolds, sex toys, fantasies, and advanced stuff makes it a book I keep using.

I was surprised to find out all sorts of other great stuff in this book.Now that I have read this book, I think that in a life or death situation I certainly could perform this erotic practice but I don't think there are any life or death situations involved unless we are talking \`the little death' of orgasm. As a woman, I did have a good idea involved in the \`how to' but now I have a knowledgeable book sense of what men and lesbians are experiencing.The book is well written and to the point, full of the usual female physiology, anatomy, and safe sex but I must say done very well. I didn't care for the chapter titles, not titillating enough for my taste with the exception of chapter five titled \`taste and textures'. I did learn some great facts for example the ph of the vagina and the ph of seaman. Oh yeah there is a whole chapter on tongue techniques and positions. Oh and we do touch on some other practices in the sex arena but this book is focused on the giving and receiving of cunnilingus.This book was spiced up quite nicely with the great short erotic stories at the end of each chapter written by Alison Tyler and sprinkled through out are some real people insights about going down.

All in all it was somewhat informative but definitely not worth the price or the time to read."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Guide to Cunnilingus: How to Go Down on a Woman and Give Her Exquisite Pleasure (Ultimate Guides Series)","review":"We got this book as well as the Ultimate Guide to Fellatio counterpart. My husband started reading it right away and didn't put it down lol, which is something to be said because he is not a reader! :) Right away though we noticed that the language of the book was fairly cras. It speaks to the reader as if they are a teenage buddy. We expected it to be a little more proffesional and straightforward, not crude and teenage bathroom talk. That said, we DID learn a few things, and the book DOES have good information. We decided that we were just going to ignore the offensive slang that everything is referred to as like cun*, puss*, every version of the word fu**, dic*, etc. and just take what we could from it, however, after about 3/4ths of the book, we ended up putting it down. Because the book is saturated with this kind of slang, it is very difficult to get past it if you are uncomfortable with this kind of language.The book is also very libral, which speak to the readers through most of it, as if you are a homosexual. Most of the pencil drawing diagrams are even girl with girl instead of guy with girl. Which doesn't really matter becuase the techniques are all the same no matter who is doing them, just something to be aware of for those that might be uncomfortable with this. Again, there are no actual pictures in this book, just the drawings.Last but not least, the book has an erotic story after each chapter designed to keep the reader hooked. Which might be fine, but again for us, the erotic stories were chalk full of offensive language. It is as if, the more times you use the F-word, the more sexually arousing it is. Bizarre. We skipped over them.All in all, if you use this type of language and are not offended by homosexuality at all, then this book really is a gem because the information, amongst all of that, is very good. It covers health precautions, history, techique, pressure, positions, and lots more! But if you don't use language like that and are even a little bit uncomfortable with homosexuality, then you may want to look for a book that is written a little bit more proffesionally. Hope this helps!"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Guide to Cunnilingus: How to Go Down on a Woman and Give Her Exquisite Pleasure (Ultimate Guides Series)","review":"This so-called author does not know how to explain anything in a straightforeward manner. Give us the facts, please, and skip the nonsense. If you're a straight male (like me) you just might get frustrated enough at the way this woman &quot;beats around the bush&quot; to fling the book clear across the room.Also, this writer is lesbian, which I have nothing against, but her approach to the subject made me nuts. It is not written for men (in order to know more about pleasing women) but, instead, written by a lesbian for other lesbians, etc., but the book cover and copy try to make it look like it was written for both: men AND women. In other words: it's bogus. The pulisher is trying to have it both ways in order to sell more copies of the book.My advice? Don't waste your money like I did.

The books have much common information - as you'd expect- but like this one they have different emphasis and different topics. The investment in buying all the cunnilingus books isn't big - less than $[...]- and is well worthwhile for the spice it will give, both to you as a performer and your woman in the event she is a reluctant receiver.This one has some erotic short stories inserted at the chapter ends which are good as I find reading one aloud to my girlfriend puts her in the mood for extra passionate lovemaking.I'm not giving this book 5 stars, however, because although the information is comprehensive it would have benefited from a good structural editor and an editor should have dealt with comments such as that in the Foreword by the author that she is \\"uniquely qualified to write this book\\". Like the \\"ultimate\\" in the title this is quite unjustified I think.

Despite an uncaring mother and a turbulent past, Raine has continuously pressed onward, determined to reach the top and never look back.In the midst of her journey, she receives a mysterious letter.

Who is behind the letter and what are their motives? Will these ever be revealed? Theseand many other questions will be brought to light throughout the course of the story.While Ms. Thompson offers us a unique storyline, the story unfortunately lacks the excitement that usually comes with mysteries.

What's Done In The Dark takes you on an emotional rollercoaster and you'd better be strapped in. Raine McKenzie's is a fascinating portrait of strength and fierce determination. Her ability to overcome the obstacles placed before her from birth is amazing. The loyalty displayed by Justin over the years is heartwarming. This is especially noteworthy considering his lifestyle. Raine's mother needed a one way ticket to a mental institution. With all of that said, The main point is you can't put the book down. Every chapter offers something that will either make you cry, laugh or hungry.. The food in the book should be in a cookbook. I liked all the oldies music that was mentioned in the book and the clothes. It really brought back a lot of memories of back in the day..

Many of his illustrations contain disturbing content--people hanged and still dangling from the gallows, miscreants tortured and locked in cages, children and adults deathly ill and/or starving. In 1566, the Dutch were struggling with the Spanish for control of the Netherlands and the aftermath of war is not pretty.However, many of Poorvliet's pictures also depict everyday scenes concerning the more pleasant side of life. The viewer is shown ships at sea; horses carrying soldiers and pulling plows; all kinds of housing--floorplans to facades to fully formed buildings; clothing of the various classes including the elaborate headgear of wealthy, deftly wrapped scarves, and helmets; household implements such as lanterns, pails, cooking pots, and candle holders; farming tools; vegetables and meats; and plenty of rural scenery comparable to the works of Ruysdael.Poorvliet's DAILY LIFE IN HOLLAND is based on information he collected from court records and other sources and tells the story of several members of a family over the course of one year. Poortvliet's earlier illustrative tale, IN MY GRANDFATHER'S HOUSE vividly depicted life in Zeeland over several centuries. I actually liked IN MY GRANDFATHER'S HOUSE better than LIFE IN HOLLAND because he portrayed history by tracing his own ancestors back through past generations. First he imagined his father's life, then his grandfather's life, then his great-grandfather's life, etc.Poortvliet's books provide a wonderful way to visualize life in past times..."},{"Title":"Daily Life in Holland in the Year 1566 And the Story of My Ancestor's Treasure Chest","review":"You don't have to be Dutch to love this book, it's absolutely marvelous. It brings another time and culture to live with its wonderful drawings, and the story Poortvliet weaves is alternately touching, funny, sad, educational and passionate.No matter how many times I look this book over, it never fails to amaze me. If I could only have 10 books, this would be one I would keep."},{"Title":"Daily Life in Holland in the Year 1566 And the Story of My Ancestor's Treasure Chest","review":"What a treat at Amazon's price! I ordered this book in anticipation of a trip to Holland and was AMAZed when it arrived. It is a beautiful book--even had I paid twice Amazon's price.The author/artist's telling of the story of his ancestor's cabinet, using wonderful paintings of day-to-day life, clothing, customs is a stunning combination. I am still re-reading about 20 or 30 pages daily, taking time over the text and painting details I skimmed in my first quick overview. I am not an art expert, but I have always liked paintings in the old, Dutch style. The artist includes a few of his own renditions of some lesser and well-known 16th century artists' works. His own way with portraits displays a depth of character, particularly in the faces we see several times within the book. I particularly enjoy his portrayal of everyday life--including some of 16th century life's not-so-pleasant aspects. Also, some earthy, funny pieces."},{"Title":"Daily Life in Holland in the Year 1566 And the Story of My Ancestor's Treasure Chest","review":"I recently became aware of some Dutch ancestry going back well into the 16 century.

This is a wonderful portrait of life in his own country many centuries ago. Every detail of life seems to be covered here, from getting dressed to bathing (or lack of it) to rats, eating, etc. I don't know which is better, the perfectly detailed drawings or the text descriptions of everything.

One of those immensely moving (the beautiful painting and architecture, the insight into how hard it was living in the past, the cruelty, the inventiveness, the humor and joy, the facial characterizations uzw) that made the author famous. One of those few in our lives that are 3+ standard deviations from the mean in communicating, compelling one to see what he found out about his past and what his ancestors may have seen.For me that is one of the best aspects, that to break the chains of dysfunction of the last century, rebuilding the bridges to the past and our ancestral culture, mean more understanding and love for our children as they face the joys and hardships of their own futures. At some point they may be ready, after \\"Tales told in Holland\\", Grimms', axe-wielding Mickeys, and X-men. For a truly educated child, the very few books such as these to me seem essential.

They are truly extraordinary. The writing is also very interesting as he weaves history and daily life in an appealing fashion. However, I have found that some of the content of the book is inappropriate for a family. There are more than several pages of nudity and explicit portrayals of both instruments used for torture (in order to extract a confession of sorts) and the torture procedure itself. This has made it impossible for us to keep as a family coffee table book. I regret this but realize that it is an inappropriate book for our family with younger children. Some may certainly argue that this was life in 1566 Holland and while that may be true, it is also true that murder and other heinous crimes are part of life in all of history. Still, is there a need to portray them in this fashion? I think not.

He's acting like a kitten again, and even brought me a little &quot;present&quot; for the first time since the accident.As an added bonus, Dr. Kamen also includes a number of very funny anecdotes about his struggle for acceptance in both the veterinary and chiropractic communities; his sense of humor and true love for the animals he works with comes through clearly in the book.I highly reccomend this book....not only for cat people, but especially for the vets and chiropractors who think they know everything already."},{"Title":"The Well Adjusted Cat: Feline Chiropractic Methods You Can Do","review":"I have taken my cat to a chiropractor and they muscle test and use the activator (which doesn't stress out the cat).

This is then intermixed with various pieces of folklore an tradition which incidently found within traditional Witchcraft. So, you not only understand the information but also understand where it came from and how it developed."},{"Title":"Masks of Misrule: The Horned God & His Cult in Europe","review":"It is too bad to see that this book, as well as the authors other books, namely &quot;Call of the Horned Piper&quot; and &quot;Compleat Vampyre&quot; are becoming scarce. Nigel Jackson has made a lot of important observations that bear upon the &quot;Old Ways&quot; that no one who is serious about Wicca can afford to ignore. I would give Jackson's books fewer stars, except that the material is so good. He isn't all that good a writer, and it isn't all that easy to follow him. Often he throws ideas together in ways that are distracting and that make one wonder if he knows how to develope his subject. He would have benefited by having a good editor. Howbeit, what's most important is that he does present this deeply interesting material, and it is up to the reader to absorb and use it. If used in Wiccan practice, the material will bring a depth of experience that is most authentic and powerful. Nigel Jackson is very deeply immersed in the oldest form of Eurasian sacred shamanistic magic that there is - at least 200,000 years old, and it's still alive and kicking."},{"Title":"Masks of Misrule: The Horned God & His Cult in Europe","review":"I got this book along with 2 others of Nigel Jackson's back in the 1990's and am currently enjoying them again. Enough so to warrant this review. I concur with another reviewer that 'Masks of Misrule' (along with 'Call of the Horned Piper' & 'Compleat Vampyre', also by Nigel Jackson) can be counted as required reading for any seriously devoted student of (Traditional) Witchcraft.The book is actually a kind of little grimoire containing the concentrated essence of the archetypal Primal Pagan God distilled from various traditions and cultures of (mostly) Europe, but also the Mid East & Asia. 168 pages with a modest glossary and index of certain terms & vocabulary. with 15 or so original illustrations by the author - artist. In reviewing this book I discovered Mr.Jackson has also a Tarot to his credit !This is a small book but whatever it may lack in great scholastic depth, or suffer from in a few typos, it makes up for in inspired Craft nuance. This will inspire the Witch, Wiccan or Pagan in their own research and devotion.Although THIS IS NOT a heavy, scholarly tome of dense academia, citing dry sources with endless footnotes; NOR a discourse on a particular dogmatic, hierarchal, copyrighted \\"Tradition\\", it seems to encapsulate, poetically and rather succinctly, the shadowy form(s) of the Primordial God out of the misty history of our Pagan past.It does require some open-mindedness as THIS IS NOT your common, standard neo-Wicca workbook of the currently common type. Nor does it tell (again!) how to cast a circle, basic color & planetary correspondences, love spells (have that in about a half dozen different books by now, don't you?) nor pages of dogmatic, scripted, pre-fab, (yawn) uninspired rituals. NO! This little grimoire takes you warmly by the hand and leads you into the Greenwood deep, down the twisting, crooked path of The Horned Master of Sorcery. The author gathers strands of the Leafy Green One - Horned God's DNA from the British Isles & the Continent and weaves them together to reveal the rough texture of the Primal Male Force in Nature & the Craft.Admittedly, the citing of resources would have been useful had the author bothered to include them. But if you are a true seeker in the Craft (in it for the long haul) you may already have some such books on your shelf (Ginzburg's 'Ecstasies' is an obvious source) or, you will be moved to seek deeper by what you find in 'Masks of Misrule'.I give this book 4 stars because the cover art is spoiled by the intrusion of bad 90's computer generated background & titling, and (as we have come to expect from Capall Bann publishers) it suffers from grammatical hiccups as mentioned in another review. Seriously, does Capall Bann consider proofreading unessential to printing books? But it is a great place for both the new and the old on the Path and the info & inspiration provided to personal gnosis far outweighs those minor hindrances.To give a hint of what you'll find inside, Chapter titles include:Intro.Lay of the ArthameIn the Sign of the HornsChapt.1 Icons of the Primal MasterChapt.2 The White Stag of AnnwvynChapt.3 Cycles of the Midnight HuntChapt.4 The Christmas Fool, Saturnus & the Cult of MisruleChapt.5 The Man in Black & the Road to the SabbatChapt.6 The Red Bones of ResurrectionChapt.7 Wudewasa: the Knowledge of the Green ManChapt.8 Satyromania - In the Kingdom of the GoatChapt.9 The Emerald Crown & the Morning StarWritten with mystical insight {for those with ears to hear and eyes to see} in a romantic spirit based on historical fact with original, inspired, free-form germs of rituals that give the devotional - magickal feeling without any dogma. The writer gives historical examples of old cultic traditions and cross-culturally relates archetypal masks of the Old One in an easy to read manner.AND THE ORIGINAL ART !!! WHY HAS NO OTHER REVIEW MENTIONED THE ILLUSTRATIONS? Mr.Jackson is an obviously gifted artist who manages to tap a nostalgic Pagan pulse. I only wish there were further explanations to reveal some of the magickal symbols in the talismanic images, done in an old woodcut appearing style. That may be intended as a subconscious device to be contemplated and divulged through in-sight.In short - get this one. If you like it - get the others by N. Jackson mentioned in this review."},{"Title":"Masks of Misrule: The Horned God & His Cult in Europe","review":"There is some valuable knowledge contained within this one for a Pagan who is pursuing information about the Horned God/Herne/Cernunnos; but due to the authors style, the reader must be able to synthesis/deduce meaning from paragraphs which are often disjointed and used as nonsequitorial analogy."},{"Title":"Masks of Misrule: The Horned God & His Cult in Europe","review":"Like Call of the Horned Piper, this is one of the few books available that presents Traditional Craft in an honest and straight forward way without any \\"wiccan\\" nonsense or \\"neo-pagan\\" overtones.

The book includes rituals and information on following the horned god that could guide the potential seeker who wishes to follow the spiritual path of the horned god. Of course if you are interested in just the history that is fine too. The book goes beyond the scope of Europe and discusses the Middle Eastern aspects of the horned god. The book covers lots of ground and has excellent information. It's only draw back being no bibliography or foot notes.The Horned God male counter part to Herodia, Diana and Hekate was worshipped through out Europe under a variety of different names. In Gaul he was called Cernunnos, in Italy and Basque he was called Janus or Janicot. His earliest traces were found in India deep inside a cave. Caves are rather significant to the horned god. It is in caves that the horned god was worshipped by the Shamans and their small group of people who were dressed in stag horns.The horned god was the one people prayed to because he was in charge of the forest. He dispensed health to the livestock and regulated wealth. People would often leave him offerings of bread an milk to appease him and guruntee their inflow of wealth. The horned god of the forest also had other aspects.One was of sacrifice and the other was of death. He was the escort to the world of the dead.At the Sabbat of Samhain he would die, his blood shed up on the soil to guaruntee survival and well being of the people. He did it so the people would survive. The Sabbat of Samhain was also a time of Misrule when things wnet in reverse. A tie in between times. It was also during this time that the Horned God became the Lord of the Dead.As a Lord of the Dead the horned God could be rather frightening. On his wild hunt with baying hounds, geese and white stags would pick up those destined to die. If a human was caught in his way while the wild hunt was on that human risked going insane or dying. WHile as God of the dead he would educate people with his tricks and shennanigans.During the Yule which in certain parts of Europe was celebrated during December and was the rebirth of the Horned God. This time was total reversal celebrated with servants being waited onby their masters and men dressing up as women. When celebrated as Janus or Janicat consort of Diana the book gives mention of a ritual dacnig around the pole.As the God is resurrected his bones take on special meaning. Earlier societies would save the bones of the animals they killed anjd color them ochre read. Red the color of blood led to ressurection. THe earlier Shaman had a meditation whe in they imagine demons devouring their flesh down to their bones. The demons were internal.As a fertility God he wood sometimes take the form of Pan , A greek god who had a ravenous appetite. He also took the form of a woodwose or a Green man and regenerated the vegetation in the forest. Followin the horned God were other Woowoses who were fairy folk some time gren and leafy at other times horned and hairy. They were called Bucwas. THe horned God in England was called Buuca or Puck. THis name has indoeuropean origins.Middle Eastern theology has fused with the theology of the horned god from Europe. In Jewish traditions a goat was sent off into the desert as a sacrificial offering. Azazel was a rebellious angel falen from heaven. He is described as a goat shaped angel and goes under the name of Iblis in the Arab world. According to the left hand path he is the one who illuminated the intelligence of mankind.The angels when they fell mated with man kind this mixture gave rise to the ones with witch blood or those from Tubal caine. They were metal worker and magic men.

None of Nigel's books are fiction. Nigel just expects his audience to be pretty well read; a person who studies history and folklore will recognize where Nigel's information is coming from. I often laugh at the people who get so upset at the fact that Nigel doesn't \\"cite his sources\\"- in my opinion, he cites them just fine, particularly in this book, which is one of his three most essential volumes.He gives textural citations, during his discussions, as to where he is \\"getting\\" this material. People who suggest that he is not doing so clearly haven't read the book. And as for the rest of his information- as I said- a learned person will recognize his sources.This book is essential for all modern Traditional Pagans who are looking for an alternative to wicca or other forms of \\"new-age\\" paganism.

This book clearly illuminates how ticks are really just like us--they understand that nothing leads to happiness like a warm puppy, and they realize that the only way to survive in this cold, harsh world is to leech off others as much as possible. The entire book was deeply moving, but I literally cried out loud when I got to the part about the evil scientists who conspired to blame lyme disease on such tiny, innocent creatures, when we all know the truth: lyme disease is caused by Vitamin D deficiency.

The author is a well known therapist with a lot of successful experience counseling people through difficult, painful breakups. Her compassion seems genuine and palpable. Her insight is interesting and refreshing. Basically, she argues that breakups occur when one or both partners are &quot;finished&quot; meeting objectives that could only be met through the relationship that is ending, but that once met, we need to pursue different relationships suitable for helping us meet new objectives. While it is possible, she explains, for many of us to eventually link with others who change at approximately the same rate and in the same manner as ourselves, it is often the case that partners are suitable for one another in the short run, but not in the long. She explains this in a nonblaming, helpful, positive manner and uses many interesting, credible examples. She also provides helpful advice on how to get through a breakup. I have read many papers and chapters on relationship dissolution (breakups) and find this author's treatment to be particularly helpful. No one source, of course, can answer all questions about all matters important to this or that human experience. Thus, I do not recommend this selection as flawless. However, if you are interested in listening to a helpful, encouraging, informative, useful collection of tapes on breakups, then this is a very worthwhile purchase. Moreover, it helps that the speaker's voice is crisp, clear, and attractive."},{"Title":"The Break-up Bible","review":"I have been listening to the Breakup Bible off and on for a few years now.

The first thing that struck me as I read this book was how compelling it is. From the first page onward, I really couldn't put it down. Ms. Matson has succeeded in weaving a story that keeps you guessing, and wanting to see what's next. She manages to lead the reader into a situation that seems to have no easy resolution, and deftly surprises us with one that is completely gratifying.Perhaps even more impressive is how authentic all the characters feel, children and adults alike. The main character, Emma, is quite likeable, but by no means perfect. It's both painful and amusing to watch her stumble over her faults, and eventually grow in spite of them. In fact all of the charcters are very likeable, even the ones who are technically the antagonists, and I think this is mostly due to the fact that they all have revelations during the course of the story, and in one way or another better themselves. (It doesn't hurt that Ms. Matson writes sparkling dialogue that breathes life into every situation her characters encounter.)I think what's most impressive about this book is that it is Nancy Matson's first. Any author who can make such an auspicious debut should be watched for future efforts."},{"Title":"The Boy Trap","review":"We just finished reading this great book titled The Boy Trap by Nancy Matson. The genre of this book is realistic fiction. The book is fun to read because it has a race, and inventors' contest and a science project. We were surprised by the amazing results at the end of the race. Most of us liked the part when Tommy spit gum in Emma's hair because it was funny. Some of us didn't enjoy this part because Emma's hair was her best feature. Another thing that we approved was when Emma's hair grew back because she didn't have to wear that hat anymore. Most of us liked when Emma was on the swing and her notebook slipped off her lap. We loved when Louise made a boy trap because it made the vice principal smile. The best part was when Louise and Emma worked together to build the boy trap. We would recommend this book to 5th graders and anyone who enjoys science."},{"Title":"The Boy Trap","review":"The boy Trap is definately my all time fvaorite book.I like how Emma and Louise try to prove that girls aresuperior to boys.

The prose are imaginative and quirky, while the wonderfully complex characters quickly drive the plot of this pre-teen &quot;battle of the sexes&quot; to a satisfying conclusion. I laughed all the way through it, and was touched by the fallible EMMA'S hard-learned lessons in the ways of life and science. All of the characters in The Boy Trap are enchanting and original. Of particular interest to me was Emma's often underestimated, best-friend LOUISE, who at first glance seems to be a fairly shallow side-kick, but who ends up in many ways to be the true hero of the story. This is typical of the many ways in which Matson offers up unexpected twists and surprises which will make you smile. These characters seem REAL; if you don't (or didn't) know kids like Emma and Louise, you'll wish you did.The Whimsical illustrations by MICHAEL CHESWORTH add spice and a touch of visual humor to what is already a very funny book.In case you couldn't tell, I LOVED it!"},{"Title":"The Boy Trap","review":"Emma's always known girls are better than boys, but knowingsomething isn't the same as proving it scientifically.

Soon the school's peace is shattered by a full-scale gender war. Worse still, all of Emma's experiments seem inconclusive. Her project leaves her in danger of failing 5th grade!

I love the main character, Emma and her best friend Louise. Their relationship with each other and with the male characters is very entertaining. I found the dialog between the characters very funny and quite realistic. I think kids in the 3rd to 6th grade age group will be able to relate to these characters and their dilemmas.I especially like the plot of the story. Emma loves science and her friend Louise is quite the inventor. Together, they want to prove 'scientifically' that girls are better than boys. It is refreshing to read a book where girls are drawn toward math and science. What is especially nice, is that Nancy Matson is able to show the girls in these nontraditional roles without them looking geeky or unpopular. The girls like science AND they're a lot of fun.One last note - I think the Michael Chesworth's illustrates are really nicely done. They add a lot to the humor of the story and really compliment the text."},{"Title":"The Boy Trap","review":"I was a little let down after how juvenile the whole thing was. I would probably recommend this book to a girl who's gossipy because it's the audience the book would be of obvious appeal; but I may be mistaken, because being a girl myself, I find the whole thing immature, unrealistic, a let-down, and quite frankly, revolting. I find the whole experience quite horrifying. I would also recommend this book to an obvious feminist, and, in short, someone who hates boys. As for my evidence for the unrealistic material, a girl in the fifth grade would be a lot more mature about matters such as those in the beginning of the book, especially those about being a \\"genius\\" as a fifth grader.

The apparently new characteristics when he then displays are in fact the manifestations of this unconscious...\\"\\"Since a group is in no doubt as to what constitutes truth or error, and is conscious, moreover, of its own great strength, it is as intolerant as it is obedient to authority. It respects force and can only be slightly influenced by kindness, which it regards merely as a form of weakness.\\"\\"But we do not separate ... one the one hand, self-love, and on the other, love for parents and children, friendship and love for humanity in general, and also devotion to concrete objects and to abstract ideas. Our justification lies in the fact that psychoanalytic research has taught us that all these tendencies are an expression of the same instinctual impulses; in relation between the sexes these impulses force their way toward sexual union, but in other circumstances they are diverted from this aim...\\"\\"From being in love to hypnosis is evidently only a short step.

This is somewhat ironic, since he was considered a heretic. In the Book of the Lover and the Beloved, what I find is a rather worrisome repetition of his desire to \\"suffer\\" for his beloved, which echoes the sentiments of Roman Catholic traditions of spiritual masochism. Personally, I find this kind of thing to be not only unnecessary to spirituality, but somewhat detrimental. The romantic mysticism of the book seems to be an echo of the same, which was prevalent in the Arabic Sufi mystical literature of the time, and I suspect this influenced Lull and other christian mystics. In fact, I think it is likely that these currents of thought, in their Sufi manifestations are probably more concise, pure, and free of superfluous elements. I do not say this because I have some bias, since I do not belong to either religion, and neither am I a Sufi. I only say it as a neutral outsider."},{"Title":"Los Misterios de Madrid (Spanish Edition)","review":"This book is written from the point of view of a fool. A slightly dumb, religious, peaceful in-store worker in his 50s from a small Spanish City is asked to go to Madrid. For some reason, the once-very-patriarchalic, not-so-well- respected-anymore member of the noble class wants him to search for a sculpture of a martyr, which has been stolen from the local cathedral and was supposedly taken to Madrid. He travels there, but how much has changed since his last visit! Involuntarily he runs into (and creates!) some trouble, and he meets a lot of sinister people cheating on him, but somehow he even makes it to accomplish his task. Although you readers might not be familiar with the location (Madrid), you will enjoy the descriptions of the observations and events. Day-to day life in a modern society seems so alien to this innocent guy from the outback, but nevertheless it seems so familiar to us. Reading this book creates and blends voyeuristic, parental, and amused notions within the reader. This writer, Antonio Munoz Molina, is a master of writing in a lot of different literary styles. How different the tone of this book is compared to &quot;The Winter in Lisbon!&quot;"},{"Title":"How To Study Romantic Poetry (Study Guides)","review":"This book provides a loose, but organic entry into the study of lyrical and narrative Romantic verse. The author does not neglect historical, political and biographical context. On the other hand, he does not overanalyze authors or apply any modern critical approaches to their work, though he refers to them and demonstrates awareness of them.One of the strongest aspects of the author's approach is his development and rigorous application of a methodical &quot;recipe&quot; for working through difficult poems. Though the approach is limited - it serves as a useful launching point for student's who are intimidated and/or relatively disinterested in poetry. The method is refreshing when employed in the classroom setting, easily personalized by the student and is certainly consistant with basic critical approaches (especially the New School approach that is so popular with disciplined high school teachers). In short, it leaves students with little excuse to say &quot;I didn't understand it&quot; when they are called on.The author surveys a poem or two by most of the major Romantic poets and includes useful chapters on romantic women poets and writing about poetry. The format of the book does not permit a teacher to overly rely on it &quot;as a script&quot; but can help a teacher (who has diligently researched the poems and poets they have assigned) tie together many of the important threads of Romantic poetry in a cohesive manner. I would especially recommend this book for teachers who do not have a strong background in this genre/era.At times the style of the writing is a tad self-indulgent and irritatingly vernacular, but is generally clear and useful."},{"Title":"How To Study Romantic Poetry (Study Guides)","review":"I bought this book as an undergraduate when I first began studying the Romantics and it helped me immensely. I fell in love with them and after just completing a Masters Degree, I now feel very comfortable with their poetry. I would highly recommend this book for anyone struggling to understand Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, etc., for the first time. They can seem so intimidating in the beginning and this book can guide the student to a better understanding of what they were trying to say and why.It's a slim little volume which begins with a chapter entitled \\"Understanding Romantic Poetry\\" and moves on to \\"Studying a Blake poem\\" with Blake being one of the more complex writers of the Romantic period. O'Flinn dedicates two chapters to Wordsworth, i.e., \\"Lyrical Ballads\\" and then \\"The Prelude Books I and II.\\" In Chapter 5 he covers Coleridge and in Chapter 6 Keats. Percy Shelley and Lord Byron are discussed but not to the detail of the other poets. Chapter 7 the next to last chapter in the book is entitled \\"Working with women's poetry\\" which is one of the weaker chapters of the book.Again, a good beginner's guide to reading and understanding the Romantic Period and their poetry."},{"Title":"The Secret Mountain","review":"I have a very, very, old book containing this story by Enid Blyton and another two.

Dipping into surrealism and imbued with spirituality, his poetry is compiled into \\"The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens,\\" which includes seven compilations of his work.Over his lifetime, Stevens wrote several books of poetry, but his exquisite poems are best taken by themselves: the lush grandeur of \\"Sunday Morning,\\" the hymnlike \\"Le Monocle De Mon Oncle,\\" and the humid grittiness of \\"O Florida, Venereal Soil.\\" He takes multiple looks at \\"Thirteen Ways of Looking At A Blackbird,\\" and the lush \\"Six Significant Landscapes.\\"In other poems, Stevens dips into outright surrealism, like in the delicate \\"Tattoo\\" (\\"There are filaments of your eyes/On the surface of the water/And in the edges of the snow\\"), and also adds a meditative bent into \\"The Snow Man\\" (\\"For the listener, who listens in the snow,/And, nothing himself, beholds/Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is\\").If nothing else, Stevens' poetry can be read just because it is exquisitely beautiful. He lavished details all over almost every poem he wrote, and gave many of them the quality of a dream. His descriptions are simply written, but brilliantly laid out: \\"When my dream was near the moon,/The white folds of its gown/Filled with yellow light.\\"His style tends to be a bit on the ornate side -- Stevens freely uses the more exotic terms -- such as \\"opalescence,\\" \\"pendentives\\" and \\"muleteers\\" -- wrapped up in complex verse, sometimes with a rhyme scheme and sometimes free-form. And lush detail is added to many of his poems, with descriptions of the moon, sun, plants and lighting, along with dazzling descriptions of the colors.But his writing is more than beautiful. Stevens' work often poses questions about death, life, religion, and art, taking the conventional and turning it on its head. His belief in the importance of his art is reflected in poems like \\"Not Ideas About The Thing But The Thing Itself,\\" which ends with the portentous lines: \\"Surrounded by its choral rings,/Still far away. It was like/A new knowledge of reality.\\"Wallace Stevens is one of the most unique poets of the 20th century, and the sprawling \\"Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens\\" is a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Opus Posthumous","review":"Stevens is a quirky and imaginative poet with a taste for unusual diction, a fluidity of ideas and an unerring instinct for the haunting and intriguing. The poems are meditational in their completeness and memorability and present a more delightful and pleasurable style of Modernism than the other 'greats' of the period such as T S Eliot or Ezra Pound. His attempts to create a 'Supreme Fiction' can at times be baffling, but there is a richness of pure self-indulgence in the poetry which means that it is immediately compulsive and a book which several of my friends agree is 'essential' to any poetry collection, whether its concern be with Poetry at its literary finest or with the langorous pleasure of 'the green freedom of a cockatoo...'and inspirational dream-like meditations. Treat yourself!"},{"Title":"Opus Posthumous","review":"Wallace Stevens is my favorite poet. This collection was prepared late in his life and is in a sense definitive, though the excellent Library of America collection is to be preferred as including a number of additional poems (including the controversial long poem \\"Owl's Clover\\"), as well as alternate versions of some poems, juvenilia, and also Stevens's essays.Stevens is known, it seems to me, in two separate ways. In the popular sense, he is known for a series of remarkable early poems, in most cases not terribly long, notable for striking images and quite beautiful prosody. Of these poems the most famous is surely \\"Sunday Morning\\" -- other examples are \\"Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird\\", \\"Peter Quince at the Clavier\\", \\"Sea Surface Full of Clouds\\", \\"Tea at the Palaz of Hoon\\", \\"The Emperor of Ice Cream\\", \\"The Idea of Order at Key West\\", \\"Of Modern Poetry\\". The great bulk of these come from his first collection, Harmonium, and indeed from thefirst edition of Harmonium, published in 1923. These were certainly my favorite among his poems on first reading. And they remain favorites.But his critical reputation rests strikingly on a completely different set of poems, all later than those mentioned above. (Though it must be acknowledged that at least \\"Sunday Morning\\" and \\"The Idea of Order at Key West\\" as well as two early long poems, \\"The Comedian as the Letter C\\" and \\"The Monocle de Mon Oncle\\", are in general highly regarded critically. And that most of his early work is certainly treated with respect.)I think it's fair to say that \\"late Stevens\\" begins with \\"Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction\\", perhaps his most highly regarded work. Of course the terms \\"late\\" and \\"early\\" are oddapplied to Stevens. His first successful poems appeared in 1915(including \\"Sunday Morning\\"), when he was 36. He was 44 when the first edition of Harmonium came out. That's pretty late for \\"early\\"! And by the 1942 publication of \\"Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction\\" he was 63. Indeed, his production from 1942 through his death in 1955 was remarkable: two major collections each with several long poems as well as at least another full collection worth of late poems, some included in this _Collected Poems_ but quite a few more not collected until after his death.What to say about late Stevens? The most obvious adjective is\\"austere\\". But that doesn't always apply -- he could also be quite playful. However, there is never the lushness of a \\"Sunday Morning\\" or \\"Sea Surface Full of Clouds\\" in the late works. The sentences tend to extraordinary length, but the internal rhythms are involving. The poems are all quite philosophical, much concerned with the importance of poetry, the nature of reality versus perceptions of reality, and, perhaps more simply, with growing old. (A Stevens theme, to be sure, that can be traced at least back to \\"The Monocle de Mon Oncle\\".)So: Stevens is an impossibly wonderful, remarkable, poet, either early or late. His lush and imagist early work remains a delight, and his philosophically involving late work rewards rereading and concentration. He is a poet to whom you can return again and again, and he will always be new."},{"Title":"Opus Posthumous","review":"Stevens is for me the great American poet of the twentieth century.His music is the supreme music of poetry .

After reading this collection of poems it is impossible to disagree. It is a marvelous experience to pick up this book and read a few poems."},{"Title":"Opus Posthumous","review":"Can poetry replace religion as an object of personal \\"faith\\"? Wallace Stevens thought so, and in this collection of exquisitely crafted poems he attempted to show us how. This collection contains many of his most famous pieces including the much anthogized \\"The Snow Man\\", \\"Fabliau of Florida\\", Anecdote of the Jar\\" and \\"Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Balckbird\\", as well as, his most famous (anthologized) poem \\"Sunday Morning\\".In many ways the intensely focused vision and complex word play that Stevens employed, which aimed at breaking down the Western metaphysical binary between word and thing, in his poetry is representative of the deeply complect nature of his poetic vision. While not only breaking new ground in form and voice, Stevens, in these poems, sought to promulgate a view of poetry as deeply subjective and personal as our contact with the world and Nature itself. As Stevens himself later explained, his poetry was meant to represent \\"not Ideas, but the things themselves\\".The Snow Man, for example, can be read as a mediatation on death and its place in the natural part of the unending cycles of being. Although, not a new idea, the way Stevens frames it, through his highly complex use of such simple language, brought to bear by the implied interrelationships of the individual words at play, introduces the idea of Gaia to the discourse of modernity. Thus, to understand and experience connection with the world itself requires the abandonment of irrational, socialized fears and a willingness to accept death as a natural outcome of life, without deference to hopeful dogma and superstition.As \\"The Snow Man\\" illustrates, the message that Stevens tries to impart, through the transformation of language from mere linguistic signifiers into \\"real\\" referential elements grounded in reality--in brute being--is simply to force the reader to realize that the same action can be enacted in our individual interactions with each other and the world. Through metaphor and complex word play Stevens shows that the very metaphors that we all live by, simply shroud the apathetic reality that surrounds us all--something that some are just not willing to face. Thus, in a way Stevens poetry, through a redoubling of signification falls back upon itself and reveals that the world and the word are merely one and that neither takes precedence over the other, both mutually informs and defines the other, but only we, through our harmonium with the world, allow them to do so. Otherwise, we simply continue to delude ourselves and fail to see the actual things that lie in the ideas themselves."},{"Title":"Opus Posthumous","review":"Our Modernist Master.

But reading on, I discovered the Stevens of the sound bite type quotations I'm constantly running into. This is the poem working out his larger philosophical concerns in greater and greater detail. Sometimes it was hard going, like reading the works of a 12th century Scholastic; but it was always worth it. He always had a clear point. This is a must read.

Stevens uses language not to depict the things of the world but to proclaim the mind's sense of being in the world. Stevens' language is often difficult, and his aesthetic defies simplistic explanation. Stevens is best understood by a mind that refuses to be taken into the conventional sense of things, but rather comes to sense the moments of the imagination and the life that is lived in them. What is known is not thing as idea, but knowledge in each moment as the life lived in the place. This seeking after a \\"Plain Sense of things\\" underlies most, if not all, of what Stevens writes. Anyone interested in difficult poetry that continually repays their efforts in full will want to have a copy of this book.

There are times when he is as oblique within his traditional cadences as Emily Dickinson, but like that same poet, the words coruscate and are not cliches. What poet of sixteen, learning what poetry is, wouldn't benefit from a memorization of &quot;Le Monocle de Mon Oncle,&quot; or of parts of &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;?Wallace Stevens begins in the tropics and ends in the cold north; his two seasons as a poet are summer and winter; in both climates, he excels. Witness the formidable achievement of Crispin's voyages (&quot;The Comedian as the Letter C&quot;) for Stevens in summer, and later poems in blank couplets such as &quot;No Possum, No Sop, No Taters&quot; for Stevens in winter. In between, there is the marvelous tapestry of controlled whimsy and exquisitely orchestrated anarchy of &quot;Notes toward a Supreme Fiction&quot; where we have everything but the kitchen sink (caparisoned elephants, a flag whacking at the halyards, the President ordaining the bee to be immortal).We all know &quot;Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird&quot;; we might profit by reacquainting ourselves with &quot;Academic Discourse at Havana,&quot; &quot;An Ordinary Evening in New Haven,&quot; &quot;The Auroras of Autumn,&quot; &quot;The Dove in the Belly,&quot; and (forgive us if we do not record the full title, with its wince-worthy epithet, of the truly splendid sequence of small but glittering poems) &quot;Like Decorations in a Cemetery.&quot;These poems really should slay the thoughtless notion that the pentameter is an insurmountable restriction for the modern poet, because we see that a poet who is hampered by such an alleged &quot;difficulty&quot; is really no poet at all. (It was Mr Cummings who said that no poet should venture vers libre until he has mastered the old cadences, stanzas, &amp; forms.) We really must ask ourselves if the more facile modes of composition are necessarily improvements over these (or any) lines by Wallace Stevens:&quot;Panache upon panache, his tails deploy / Upward and outward, in green-vented forms, / His tip a drop of water full of storms.&quot;Or the pasage in &quot;Of Modern Poetry&quot; where we see the actor (poet) as &quot;A metaphysician in the dark [...] twanging a wiry string that gives / Sounds passing through sudden rightnesses.&quot; Or yet again:The old seraph, parcel-gilded, among violetsInhaled the appointed odor, while the dovesRose up like phantoms from chronologies.An anthologist of poetry once called Wallace Stevens's universe &quot;solipsistic&quot;; but we demur at this term. It is evident that, in spite of the occasional impenetrability of meaning, the discursus without destination or the &quot;description without place,&quot; the missing gist or multitude of gists, the ideas hiding almost successfully behind a glitter-glatter of joy in the sounds of the words themselves, Wallace Stevens had a lifelong conversation with reality that helped to compose these marvelous concertos of the supra-quotidian. His &quot;pick of ebon, pick of halcyon&quot; rarely failed him as he plucked his antique string in an accord of repetition. There is sometimes a surfeit of color, an impression that the poems (however elegant) are all &quot;surface,&quot; and the tone can sometimes oppress; but this oppression, if possible, is salutary. Always in evidence, however, is a mind at work on the language, making an ineluctable music, sometimes comic, sometimes tragic, consistently if not invariably enchanting:. . . words of the sea,Words of the fragrant portals, dimly-starred,And of ourselves and of our origins,In ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds."},{"Title":"Opus Posthumous","review":"Worth having just for the ADAGIA, a work I have sought long and in vain until now."},{"Title":"Opus Posthumous","review":"Length:: 2:06 MinsWallace Stevens is really two poets, or rather, he is a poet slowly turning into a turgid metaphysician as one reads through this collection.

But once his first lines took notice of &Ograve;The exceeding brightness of this early sun ...&Oacute; the poet had found his pace.In his century, Wallace Stevens is one of the 5 leading poets native to America - I would rank him ahead of Marianne Moore, Hart Crane, T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound as the breathless runner up. None of these people can hold the candle to W. H. Auden, but then, Auden was not a native. But how important is it anyway for a nation to have great poets to her credit? Judged by the reception of poetry in America, not very much. I know people who take courses in creative writing, because they come cheaper than a therapist.To be a poet in troubled times is never easy, and the 20th century was a watershed between the cultural paradigms.

Stevens compares the Grecian Urn to a standardized, mass-produced, trade-marked, Dominion wide-mouth glass canning jar. Stevens is a master of imaginative analogies & understated humor yet in this anecdote his tone is direct & apparently simple.Not being a literary expert or even fond of poetry (except haiku), I still do not know the meaning of this simple parody or Stevens' intent (if he was conscious of his 'intent'). Was Stevens condemning an increasingly standardized, industrialized 19th C American culture where imagination was diminished by the industrial revolution? Is the jar a symbol as an industrial product? Or praising Americana ? Did he reject Keats' literary allusion to a Classical Greek tradition? Was this an insider's joke? Maybe Stevens had just closed a big account between Hartford Insurance and Dominion? Or was he ambivalent / indifferent, he simply saw a jar along the roadside & reflected on how it was so different from its natural surroundings? What do you think?Definitely a literary, intellectual's joke, though. This sample's austere tone is unrepresentative of Stevens -- many of his poems are vivid & striking in imagery and use of far-fetched analogies, experiments with pure imagery & sounds.Of the American modernist poets, I like Stevens & Frost as poets. I dislike the snobbery and condescending tone of Pound & Eliot and both only reinforced my belief that poets are effete intellectuals who benefit mostly from snob appeal. W C Williams was probably the most decent man of all the modernists but his poetry rambles on & on ...Stevens, a corporate lawyer, retired from an insurance company where his career peaked as a VP. I find it understandable that an imaginative, philosophical genius in such a tediously boring field would need a creative outlet for his imagination. While their poetic styles vary, ethically, Stevens is comparable to WC Williams, the rural family doctor who wrote verses as a creative avocation. Both represent the American spirit of professionals who turned to poetry as an avocation, as a substitute for scripture, as a personal expression of beauty.ODE ON A GRECIAN URNBy John KeatsThou foster child of silence and slow time,Sylvan historian, who canst thus expressA flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:What leaf-fringed legend haunts about thy shapeOf deities or mortals, or of both,In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?What men or gods are these?

It is through this struggle, ultimately expressed in &quot;Sunday Morning,&quot; that Stevens comes to the final conclusion: Poetry is the supreme fiction."},{"Title":"Opus Posthumous","review":"Wallace Stevens is a god! If you don't know him than there is definately something wrong with you. Have your head examined. Then, buy this book. It is an excellent compilation of Stevens's great work. If you don't like him than you are a caveman with a shallow brainpan, and I just don't like you. What a wonderful poet. He really really is just a wonderful poet."},{"Title":"Opus Posthumous","review":"This continues to disinterest, more out of differences in poetic palatability than in actual quality. As a supposed surrealist and modernist, harboring such structural rigidity ultimately defeats and contradicts Steven's full adoption of his moniker. Quite honestly, the majority of his work, while revolutionizing a style throughout his time, fail to stand to many other, more literately dense poets. Brenda Shaugnessy is a strong recommendation for a polished example of the craft.Pet sounds to Kid A. The difference is immediately obvious."},{"Title":"From the Kingdom of Memory: Reminiscences","review":"Once upon a weekend retreat at the Monastery of the Holy Spirit, I became absorbed by Elie Wiesel's fascinatingly describing his Memory of Jewish holidays, the Talmudic literature, the Jewish Laws and stories of Abraham, Moses, Isaac and Jacob. At that point in my life after retiring as Prison Chaplain, I began to look at the lives of Jewish writers. I wished to grasp some of their pain, suffering and depths of Faith in the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Elie Wiesel had written much of those feelings in his \\"Night\\"; \\"Dawn\\" and \\"Souls on Fire.\\"While caught-up in writing about my Memories of serving as a Prison Chaplain, I wanted to choose a good Model. My first underlining began with Elie's wonderful quote from \\"Society and Solitude\\" by Emerson to begin his chapter, \\"The Stranger in the Bible.\\" Then I looked back at the first chapter, \\"To Believe or not to Believe.\\" There I read the habits of a Jewish mother as she teaches her children, a Talmudic Ledgend of Moses and Rabbi Akiba, other stories of other Rabbi's...I was really hooked!After Elie's return to his birthplace of the little Jewish city of Sighet, revisiting sights of his boyhood, he arrives to that key chapter, \\"Making the Ghosts Speak!\\" He writes of his own \\"despair of humanity and God!\\" From his studies of history, philosophy, psychology, he realized his anger at the Germans. \\"How could they have counted Goethe and Bach as their own and at the same time massacred countless Jewish children?\\" Then he admits that he \\"was angry at God too, at the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob! How could He have abandoned his people just at the moment when they needed Him?\\" His struggling led to his conclusion: \\"I am free to choose my suffering but not that of my fellow humans.\\"This small gem of Essays has that fearful power to prod around one's insides, revealing your own gut-wrenching memories!

His depiction of strange peoples, cultures, and social systems is endlessly fascinating.Some may say his style is an acquired taste, but I believe his elegant language, inventive names and coinages, and ironic humor is unequaled in or out of SF.With the exception of \\"Chateau D'If\\", the stories in this collection (including \\"Green Magic\\" and \\"The Narrow Land\\") are rarely anthologized, and so it is a must to the Jack Vance collector.To those unacquainted with Jack Vance, try the \\"The Dying Earth\\", \\"The Last Castle\\", \\"The Dragon Masters\\", or \\"Lyonesse\\" for the master at his best."},{"Title":"The Narrow Land","review":"This is a 1980's collection of seven - not 8 as the back cover says - short stories by Jack Vance; or rather, 6 short stories plus an unforgettable novella, Chateau d'If. D'If is a enterprise promising the jaded unforgettable adventure - for a price which is a lot higher than it seems at first. The other six stories are little gems, just a handful of pages in some cases, but drawing beautifully realised worlds and societies of the far future, another world, or an alternative today.Green Magic is \\"fantasy\\" rather than sci-fi, and argubly so is the World Thinker, for all there are spaceships and computer systems. There are just touches of Vance's bone-dry wit, (there is a line in the Narrow Land which is just fantastically understated) with more than enough action to hold the interest of even a 13-year old boy. There is sadness and joy in \\"Dicantropus\\", and often the hints you get of things outside the strict telling of the tale are interesting enough you can tell another author might have spun a bloated novel out of tense short story, with deleterious results.All in all, these stories work so well at the length they are you cant wish them longer, although at the same time you wish they were. If you can pick up a copy, this is actually a good place to read a bit of Vance to see if you like his style, and of course if you have read Vance there is some great stuff here you owe it to yourself to read."},{"Title":"The Narrow Land","review":"Here under one cover for the first time are eight scarce and long unavailable stories by one of the very best writers we have in science fiction. Eight stories rich with the exotic and ironic aplomb of the singularly inventive and vivid style which characterizes the author."},{"Title":"The Narrow Land","review":"This is good collection of otherwise-unconnected tales by Jack Vance, most of which would be classified as Science Fiction. On the plus side, I enjoyed every single story here (and I am not one who can claim to automatically like everything by Vance). On the other hand, it contains none of my personal favorites (like \\"Sail 25\\" or \\"The Moon Moth\\" or \\"When the Five Moons Rise\\"). Here are:\\"The Narrow Land\\" (1967): Ern the crested water baby, having hatched from an egg, must try to find his way in a strange world, consisting of a strip of land and sea bordered by a wall of storm and a wall of night. Unusual for Vance in that the protagonist is not human. The cover art by Wayne Barlowe depicts a scene from this tale. (24 pages).\\"The Masquerade on Dicantropus\\" (1951): An explorer wonders why the primitive natives of Dicantropus are so secretive about their ancient pyramid. Meanwhile, after six months on the planet, his wife is going stir-crazy. (16 pages)\\"Where Hesperus Falls\\" (1956): An immortal man, bored of living, plans to commit suicide; but his vigilant guardians, who regard him as a valuable specimen of the ancient past, aim to foil all his efforts. (9 pages)\\"The World Thinker\\" (1945): A maverick lawman pursues a interplanetary fugitive into the strangest of sanctuaries: the mind of a half-mad alien with the godlike power to dream up entire worlds. Though somewhat revised for this volume, one can still tell that this is very early Vance, quite different in tone from his later work. (26 pages)\\"Green Magic\\" (1963): Ignoring cryptic warnings, a magician seeks to master the occult secrets of the green realm. Pure fantasy with no sci-fi elements. (13 pages)\\"The Ten Books\\" (1951): Explorers find a planetary utopia, whose idealistic culture is inspired by their records of Earth. Also published as \\"Men of the Ten Books\\". (20 pages)\\"The Chateau d'If\\" (1950): Looking for adventure? Come to the Chateau d'If, where you can have adventure for a price. Except the precise nature of your \\"adventure\\" is a surprise, and the past customers are not talking. You may know this story by its alternate title, which is somewhat spoilerish. (62 pages)."},{"Title":"Issigonis","review":"For anyone with any interest in the Mini Minor this book is a must read it takes away all the unknown about such an influential man. From his childhood to a well respected design engineer the author has left nothing out and is very easy to follow."},{"Title":"Issigonis","review":"Sir Alec Issigonis was a most interesting person.He grew up in Tuekey.He never saw a car until he was almost a teenager.He saw an aeroplane before he saw a car.In the 1930s he converted an austin car to a rcing car and drove it in races.The book shows the various twists and turns of his career.it also shows his strengths and his weaknesses.For instance he seemed completely obvious of the internal political situation of the companies where he worked.The problems of managemnet of the British Motor Industry are hinted at but not spelt out.Similarly the economics of the mini are not spelt out.Other reading indicate that itv was sold too cheaply.In australia most cars are built using the principles that Issigonis propounded.There are front wheel drive with an east west engine.It is worth while reading the book to see the person who lead the way to how most cars are produced throughout the world"},{"Title":"Issigonis","review":"This book is pretty good read. Sometimes the writing stalls as I think the editors didn't check it for flow. Overall though, this is the most complete biography of Issigonis' life and what he accomplished."},{"Title":"3DS Max Lighting","review":"If you are already good at modeling and texturing, you really owe it to yourself, your models, and maps to pick this manual up and study it so that you can coax the most out of the many lighting options 3ds max gives you. You may say, well, I already know alot about 3ds max lighting. You may know enough to get by, but after you read this book, you will be doing more with 3ds max lighting than just getting by. This author will teach and give you alot of insight into how to properly manufacture different lighting situations. The majority of the book is of the ideals, practices, and methods you should employ while being concerned with lighting. There is not very much actual 3ds max lighting work or training, hence the 4 star rating, but the way in which this type of information is presented is probably the best choice for \\"understanding lighting for the long haul.\\" The author takes the approach of explaining everything about light to you in detail, then essentially leaves it up to you how you proceed from there based on what you have learned about light, NOT JUST 3DS MAX LIGHT! I agree with this method. I would rather understand light, and in turn be able to apply that in 3ds max with much greater effect than just knowing what the 3ds max tools do, but not why they work the way they do. 2 different mindsets really, and I'll bet that the student of light first, will produce higher quality overall results most of the time if not all of the time. This author writes very well, and I liked his book alot. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because although the included tutorials are reasonable and serve the purpose, perhaps at least one or two complex/advanced lighting effects, or exercises could have been included to really blast the reader off in the right direction and give the user a concrete notion of how to tap the lighting power. Even without this though, this book is worth your time. It will make a very noticable difference in renders, and will unlock the world of lighting to you. Maybe it would be nice to see this author offer other cg topics in the future!"},{"Title":"3DS Max Lighting","review":"As a newcomer to 3DS Max, I was delighted to find this wonderful book to teach me about how to use lights properly. The author has written the book to give beginners a good grounding in lighting theory, and follows that with numerous examples of how to use lights to effectively light scenes.I found the step-by-step approach very helpful in learning each and every parameter. I believe my lighting is much better now that I have read most of the book. I would highly recommend it to anyone wishing to learn lighting in 3DS Max"},{"Title":"3DS Max Lighting","review":"If you are looking for a book with nothing but \\"put a light here and here and here and render\\", then you will be disappointed by this book. The book clearly states that it is about learning the theory behind lighting so that artists will be able to tackle any lighting problem without a formula. If you want a \\"quick fix\\", yeah sure, this book isn't for you, and you are probably a lazy artist. But if you want to learn real lighting, how real light works and how they differ from MAX and mental ray lights, if you are a serious artist who wants to really understand lighting, then this is a brilliant book.As for the content being available on the web...who cares? Would I rather have to search all over the net for it, or have the author package it in one place for me? I found it convenient and thoughtful. I'm not sure what book Jonny read, but I don't think it was this one."},{"Title":"3DS Max Lighting","review":"Overall its a good book.But the author is explaining the physical qualities of light too much which sometimes confuses & may not be required that much.Because physical qualities of light is different from CG lighting.So there is no point of comparison explained randomly.Well this book gives you fair understanding of 3DMax lighting interface & some techniques for intermediate users in good detail.And it evokes in you a quest to study the lighting in reality first with the eye of an artist.Then try to implement in your Max scenes.Which i think is a very good approach.e.g I improved certain elements of my lighting scenes like source of light,intensity,interaction with materials.I would like to read any advance book as well written by Mr Nicholas."},{"Title":"3DS Max Lighting","review":"I got through, maybe the first eighty pages before I realized that I hardly new anything about lighting. This author is the master. He understands and explains real light so well that any artist could walk away with a brand new understanding of how to light. I never new before how inadequate MAX lights are, and how much has to be done to make them work like real lights. Now I know. My lighting will always be better and I owe a debt of gratitude to the author."},{"Title":"3DS Max Lighting","review":"this book really helped with my understanding of CG lightning, definitely worth purchasing,the author knows exactly how to explain from basic to experts stuff"},{"Title":"3DS Max Lighting","review":"This book is really not very good at all. Looking at the cover you can see the standard of lighting in the book is not going to be great. The examples consist largely of scenes constructed from primitive spheres and cubes and don't go into any real depth...they are so far removed from real-world production problems that it is laughable. This is no surprise when you discover that the author has actually written a book on Lightwave lighting and though his production experience is fairly lengthy, these all seem to be Lightwave productions, as there is nothing within this book to suggest that the author's knowledge of 3ds max is anything but cursory. I think that if the makers of 3ds max saw this book they would be very disappointed that a book is available that makes their great application look so very very bad."},{"Title":"3DS Max Lighting","review":"the book was not good. author deals with general concepts and examples are really silly, even images like Hdri is not included on the cd. you can get more help from reading a manual or internet. I bought this book because I wanted to do architectural rendering especially exterior and I thought I would find practical examples in a book. That's not what happened, there was nothing new I did not know and examples with boxes and spheres are just a joke.If you have a real job doing renderings you will be in a big trouble because book doesn't touch that. Author seems like he doesn't knows this stuff but doesn't really get into specifics.Author wrote a book for Lightwave so 3dsMax came naturally to write, how convenient. There was no quality example in a book that I could use and book is not cheap. It said that author worked on Stargate and other movies. Why didn't author just give practical examples in a real environment? All examples are stupid and I can't find it useful. All scripts in a book can be found on internet free anyway. I don't think that title \\"3dsMax Lighting\\" is the right name, it just makes Max look not what it can do."},{"Title":"Marjorie Main: The Life And Films of Hollywood's \\"Ma Kettle\\"","review":"Like the rest of the reviewers here, I looked forward to the release of this biography of a favorite film star and its promise of meaningful insights into the life and career of Marjorie Main. But when I received and read this volume, I was terribly disappointed to find it an extremely superficial treatment of a clearly complex life story and not at all worth the price.Half of the page count of this book is comprised of a detailed index/filmography containing virtually nothing of value pertaining to the actress but, instead, referencing Hollywood trivia of other actors and personalities.The \\"biography\\" portion of this book, meanwhile, glosses over the personalities and events one would think were central to the life and lifestyle of Marjorie Main and seems to rely mostly on studio shots and publicity posters to push the page count as far as it could go.For those who expect a work of scholarship and insight, this book will in no way justify its cost -- or your expectations. For a credible and satisfying treatment of the subject, we'll have to wait for another author to take up the challenge."},{"Title":"Marjorie Main: The Life And Films of Hollywood's \\"Ma Kettle\\"","review":"I very much enjoyed this biography of the much missed Marjorie Main. There was no one quite like her in the movies, then or now. Marjorie Main was mostly a supporting player throughout most of her career, yet she starred in a few movies most notably with Wallace Beery, a co-star she did not enjoy working with, and, of course, with her co star Percy Kilbride in the Ma and Pa Kettle Universal series.Since Marjorie was mainly a supporting player, not as much has been written about her in terms of movie magazines and scholarly movie study works. Therefore, in my opinion, the author Michelle Vogel had her work cut out for her in terms of finding a great deal of biographical data. She does provide much history, but the final work, although interesting and informative, left me wanting to know more about her.However, the ten chapter text is filled with wonderful photos, a list and discussion of all of Main's film and stage appearances, and a beautiful color cover shot of Marjorie.This is a wonderful source of information on Marjorie Main, and I suspect the only one we will probably ever find. Younger movie audiences have never even heard of Ma Kettle, so I would assume this is it. So, Michelle Vogel, I thank you on behalf of fans of Marjorie Main and for fans of Ma and Pa Kettle."},{"Title":"Marjorie Main: The Life And Films of Hollywood's \\"Ma Kettle\\"","review":"I bought this book for my mother who is now living in a nursing home. We used to watch the Ma and Pa Kettle movies together when I was younger and I thought this would be an interesting read to bring those memories back. On each of my visits with Mom I'll read a chapter of the book. We're now mid way through the filmography and we're enjoying the film facts and trivia as much as the biography itself. We never did hear a lot of gossip on Miss Main back in the day so this book enlightens you on all aspects of her personal life and career.This is a must have if you're a fan of the classic film comedies of yesteryear and especially if you're a fan of Marjorie Main. The photographs are wonderful too."},{"Title":"Marjorie Main: The Life And Films of Hollywood's \\"Ma Kettle\\"","review":"Finally a bio on one of Hollywood's greatest character actors of all time, Marjorie Main. When you read this book and remember the countless classic films that she was in, it makes you wonder why she hasn't been written about before and why, and this is perhaps the biggest crime of all, she hasn't got a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame. Something should be done about the latter!This book is a loving tribute, well researched, beautifully arranged with some super photos and very informative about what Marjorie Main was like both on screen and off. Her marriage to the eccentric Dr. Krebs (a much older man) makes some of today's Hollywood partnerships seem somewhat normal! What a strange relationship!The filmography is peppered with facts about the making of each film and/or the stars involved. I wish more filmographies were set out like this. Reading this part of the book is just as entertaining, if not more so, than the biography section.Overall an extremely enjoyable read and one that Marjorie would be proud of. Thanks to the author for doing this wonderful lady justice. A job well done!"},{"Title":"Marjorie Main: The Life And Films of Hollywood's \\"Ma Kettle\\"","review":"This long awaited biography on Marjorie Main is such an enjoyable book. The filmography is extensively researched and peppered with trivia relating to each film and co-star. A trivia buff's dream!The rare press book info, childhood stories, studio archive papers and personal letters to Marjorie from Dr. Krebs, her very strange husband, is a treat to read. Their relationship has to be read about to be believed and even then, you're left scratching your head. Marjorie seemed like a very jealous woman, even though her husband was 25 years her senior, she was exceedingly accusatory of his actions and in turn he would feel the need to write long letters of explanations to calm her down.Dr. Krebs would even go as far as to write her IOU's for small amounts of money leant to him, by her. After his death, she would continue to talk with him as if he were alive and she'd even set a place for him at the dinner table! Don't want to give too much away so I'll end this before I do.As I said, it was a VERY strange relationship, even by Hollywood's standards...Marjorie Main comes across as a real character, both on and off the screen. Her eccentric lifestyle makes for a real page turner and the photographs are reproduced well. Clean, sharp images (which many books do not have these days) and there are a lot in here to look at too. Just about every one of her 80 plus films is represented as well as many rare promo and portrait photos.This is a great companion to the recent 'Ma and Pa Kettle' DVD sets that were released last year. Reading about Marjorie Main's life and career makes you want to pop in a movie and watch her work her magic.Long overdue book this one and kudos to the the author who does a fabulous job of weaving everything together for a most enjoyable and informative read. A great tribute to a great star!"},{"Title":"Marjorie Main: The Life And Films of Hollywood's \\"Ma Kettle\\"","review":"I've long been a fan of Ms. Main so I was very excited to see a biography finally written about her. As a veteran of close to 90 films, she was one of the most prolific of Hollywood's great character actors.Known mainly for her role as \\"Ma Kettle,\\" upon reading the extensively researched filmography I had forgotten just how many good films she had appeared in apart from the \\"Kettle capers.\\" These films were undoubtedly made better by her presence. She was one of a kind, both on and off the screen and this book reveals both sides of her life, both personal and professional.Such an entertaining read and with a filmography, complete with film facts and trivia for each film, this book is worthy of sitting on your coffee table so you can quiz your friends with some of Hollywood's little known but worthwhile info.Really a wonderful read.

The extensively researched filmography is a wonderful reference guide for film fanatics.

In typical McFarland fashion, the illustrations are reproduced with excellent quality, and include not only movie stills but also lobby cards and posters. The research is highlighted by letters written by Marjorie's husband that reveal much about their relationship and offers a different side of Marjorie. Michelle Vogel has written a MUST HAVE bio for fans of Marjorie and anyone interested in the Golden Age of Hollywood. If you only knew her as Ma Kettle, this fine book will illuminate one of the great American character actresses. What an excellent choice for a biography!"},{"Title":"Marjorie Main: The Life And Films of Hollywood's \\"Ma Kettle\\"","review":"Marjorie Main has always been one of my favorite actresses and I've long wondered what her personal life was like away from the screen.

Of course, Marjorie's other films aren't overlooked and the extensive filmography is loaded with details on her co-stars (a lot on Percy Kilbride aka Pa Kettle) and each individual production.There are photos on almost every page.

The book is set during the civil war which ensues in former Rhodesia with a minority white government unwilling to extend voting rights to the majority unrepresented black population. In highlighting the human level of these problems, Lan very effectively shows us how destructive and instructive colonialism can be for a people. By reading of the relationships that existed before white rule and their destruction and also their emergence out of this experience, we are ultimately awed by how strong the human spirit can be. In spite of such horrific abuse and forced represssion, the local people are able to conquer their lives and move forward and create a new life. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a different perspective on life and humanity in such traumatic circumstances as war and colonialism."},{"Title":"Guns and Rain: Guerrillas & Spirit Mediums in Zimbabwe","review":"As a son of Zimbabwe I would dare say herein lies many of the clues,explanations and answers to some of the seemingly illogical occurences and happenings in Zimbabwe.

Rosenberg's novel presents a scenario that has Suddam Hussein still ruling Iraq and threatening his enemies with weapons of mass destruction.The beginning of the novel is electrifying. The President of the United States, James MacPherson, has just landed in Denver, Colorado, when a kamikaze pilot attacks the Presidential motorcade. The country is thrown into a state of panic, as the leaders of the free world must decide how they will retaliate.Jon Bennett, a brilliant Wall Street strategist and close friend of the President, is on the verge of brokering a deal that could bring peace and prosperity to the Middle East. Unfortunately, the specter of terrorism threatens to destroy Bennett's deal and any hope of world peace. The stakes could not be higher as the most powerful leaders on earth make decisions that will determine the fate of the world. \\"The Last Jihad\\" is a gripping spy novel, filled with action, twists, and turns that will keep the reader engrossed until the story reaches its shocking conclusion."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Joel ably taps his experiences working for such luminaries as Bill Bennett, Rush Limbaugh and Steve Forbes to weave a compelling story grounded in reality. His characters and story know the way around Washington because Joel does, too. One of the best political / military thrillers to come down the Beltway in a long time."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Rosenberg's book and the sequel, &quot;The Last Days&quot;. My only complaint is, as a former Marine Corps combat (Vietnam) veteran, I came across some very jarring inaccuracies in both books describing certain functions of weapons employed by the protagonist. I cringed every time I read a passage describing the insertion of a &quot;clip&quot; into a rifle or pistol. In one particularly bizarre sequence, two .357 Magnums (please!) had their &quot;safeties&quot; clicked off before firing.Mr. Rosenberg, my Parris Island drill instructor, Staff Sergeant Rash, would hang me by my heels and beat me severely about the head and shoulders for such silliness.For the readers of this review who are puzzled by my comments, please allow me to explain. A &quot;clip&quot; is only used with manually loaded rifles such as the World War II era M1 Garand. Constructed of spring steel, the &quot;clip&quot; holds eight rounds of 30-06 ammunition and is pushed into the receiver of the weapon from the top and is discarded once all shots have been fired. Modern weapons, including the M-16, the AK-47, the German MP-5 and the 9mm Beretta pistol use MAGAZINES, not &quot;clips&quot;. The magazine is inserted into the weapon from the bottom and features a spring follower which pushes the ammunition to the top of the magazine as the weapon is fired.As to the .357 Magnum, it is a six shot REVOLVER and does not have a SAFETY! Yikes!Other than the above, albeit minor, discrepancies and a very strange dream sequence in &quot;The Last Days&quot; (what was that all about?), Mr. Rosenberg has crafted fine and entertaining reads.I'm looking forward to his next book. Let me be the first to volunteer to read the galley prior to publication to point out any inconsistencies. It would save the inevitable teeth gnashing engendered by weapons-knowledgeable readers who discover this fine author.Please indulge this closing quote from my Marine Corps mentor, SSgt. Rash, \\"When in doubt, empty the MAGAZINE, Marine!\\""},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I read the book on the basis of Rush's recommendation, but I can't be as enthusiastic as he was. There are some great scenes that are well researched, action packed and truly engaging, but there are other portions of the book that lack credulity and seem contrived. Although I am sympathetic to the author's overall perspective, I hope that his next book is more polished and endures another few rounds of editing and critical analysis."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"It took me awhile to get into this book because of the abundance of characters. It almost required a character list. Portions of the book are more a \\"tell\\" than \\"show,\\" which writing style the author eventually turned around. BUT, I'm glad I stuck with it. Well-told story; definitely full of action and suspense. Some critics decried the Christian/Republican aspects. Do they do the same when reading \\"their side's\\" fictitious perceptions? Remember, this is fiction. When it involves politics and world views, in order to have a storyline, a writer has to choose a side he's writing about. And the most obvious is from that which he believes. The author doesn't force feed anyone with his beliefs. It's just a part of the story. In fact, the hero Jon Bennett is an atheist, and shakes his head at the believers.This reader thoroughly enjoyed the book; once past page 50, reluctantly laid it aside and quickly picked it up again. Looking forward to Mr. Rosenberg's next offering."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Along with the many other things in the world that the events of 9-11-01 changed, the world of the international thriller genre of popular fiction changed as well. The direction of these novels is never more apparent than in Joel Rosenberg's \\"The Last Jihad\\".Published in 2002, part of the initial storyline is already outdated. To prefix the book, it's stated the Osama Bin Laden is dead and Saddam Hussein is the threat to the world. In our present state, Hussein is in custody and Bin Laden is still at large. Nevertheless, the premise is both credible and exciting. From the opening chapters, the events that happen to and surrounding the President are not only chilling but all too real. Just as Clancy's view of terror attacks and thwarted terror attacks in \\"Debt Of Honor\\" and \\"Rainbow Six\\" were before their time, the same could be said for Rosenberg. The events seem to be ripped from headlines of the future.It's not just the plot that makes this such an easy yet fun read. Rosenberg's writing style flows very well. Some authors see fit to use over the top language that makes you think they're just trying to impress the reader with their vocabulary, but Rosenberg keeps it simple and let's the story, the action, and the characters do all the work.The story and the characters also have added meaning for any Christian reading the book. It's obvious that the author himself is a Christian, and this is reflected in several of his characters. You can see the influence that this has on his characters, and in the language used in his book, and is something that is welcome to the world of fiction.All in all, this is a fantastic effort from a fairly new author on the popular fiction scene and one that makes me anticipate the sequel, \\"The Last Days\\", even more. In fact, I'm ordering it now."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This is a terrific book. I have a habit of reading 2-3 books at a time. Read a few chapters of one book one night, and then a few chapters of a different book the next night. I read this book cover to cover. It is that good. Moreover, while this is a novel, you still get the real impression that earlier in the evening on NBC a breaking news story mirrored Chapter 9 of Rosenberg's book. In other words, one moment you're reading &quot;The Last Jihad&quot;, and the next moment you're listening to Brokaw announcing what you just read in the book. Tremendous book... the movie will have to be one major extravaganza to do the book justice."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"The Last Jihad is a novel about an alternate future. In 2011, the US and its allies have relentlessly hunted down and destroyed terrorist organizations throughout the world. Headquarters and training camps have been raided and individual terrorists have been picked up and tried for their crimes. New airport security measures throughout the US have eliminated domestic hijacking. It would seem that the war against terrorism is being won.Or has it? As a motorcade takes I-70 from Denver International Airport for the downtown convention center, a chartered executive jet from Toronto explodes over the freeway, spewing fire and metal over the vehicles and severely injuring the American President. Reports arriving from London, Paris and other national capitals describe similar attacks. All air traffic in the US is grounded and various federal agencies start looking for the source of the attack.As a new terrorist war erupts throughout the world, Jon Bennett is meeting a Russian Jew named Dmitri Galishnikov in the King David Hotel in Jerusalem's Old City. Bennett is negotiating the deal of the century, opening up one of the largest gas and oil fields in the world offshore from the Holy Land. Dmitri and his partner Ibrahim Sa'id had discovered the field back in 2000, but nobody would risk any investment in the area, particularly after 9/11/2001. Now Bennett's firm, Global Strategix, is willing to invest billions as long as the Palestinians and the Israelis will cooperate -- i.e., make money, not war.With the terrorist attack on the President, however, all commercial development in the Middle East is being held in abeyance. Bennett is called back to the States to meet with his former boss, James MacPherson, the President of the United States. MacPherson asks Bennett to accept a position as a senior economic advisor in order to promote the gas/oil venture as a matter of US public policy. Instead of making about two million a year in salary and stock options, Bennett is being asked to work for ninety thousand a year. Moreover, he will have to give up his financial interests in the deal, thus losing his chance of becoming a billionaire in the near future.Amidst all the turmoil, the President sends Bennett back to Israel to lay the groundwork for future negotiations with the Palestinians and the Israelis. The possibility of nuclear war against Israel is very real, for one nuclear missile has already been captured on the ground. Now the terrorists have send an assassination team to take out Bennett himself.Jon Bennett is not your typical hero. He learns how to fire a weapon during a firefight. He has never had to ignore pain and keep on moving prior to the real thing. He hasn't got a clue about secret agents and assassins, but now he finds out the hard way how to protect himself and his friends from such dangers. It is an interesting time in his life.This story is a realistic portrayal of the political and emotional realities of the Middle East. It differs from the actual events in that Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya and other terror supporting nations are isolated and watched, but otherwise left alone while the terrorist organizations themselves are raided and dismembered. Thus Saddam Hussein has ten more years to development his weapons and defenses. At least one of these weapons is a nuclear warhead acquired from the Russian stockpiles.While this future will never happen, something much like it may still be part of our timeline. The hatreds and tactics of terrorism are real even if the personages may differ. Such terrorist offensives must be countered through good intelligence, including informants within the terrorist groups themselves, and by pinpoint strikes with minimum, but locally decisive, force.Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys realistic tales of covert operations and the efforts of intelligence and counterintelligence services to detect and foil such activities.-Bill Jordin"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This was a very good book. The American President has declared war on terrorism with spectacular results.He has destroyed terrorist training camps and killed Osama Bin Ladin.An assassination attempt is made on the life of the President.Iraqui hit men also strike in London,France,and Saudi Arabia. In the background oil and gas have been discovered off the coast of Gaza.Throught the efforts of Jon Bennett and Erin McCoy they are trying to use this find to achieve peace.In the meantime Israeli commandos stop the Iraquis from launching a scudmissile armed with a nuclear warhead.You also have four deadly Iraqui terrorists named the four horsemen who are on a dealy mission for Saddam. The United States goes to war with Iraq with Israel anxiously waiting in the wings.All of this is leading to a nuclear confrontation in the Middle East.

I couldn't put this one down! The story moves with lightning speed, and all of the details are either so reality-based or of such reasonable conjecture that if you are like me, the hair on your arms will be standing on end through certain passages! One phrase towards the end made me slam the book closed and put it right down, while my mind cleared the imagery Mr. Rosenberg's descriptions provide! It was an easier read than a Tom Clancy novel and I highly recommend this book! (May I also sneak in a two-thumbs up for my last read, \\"Bias\\", by Bernard Goldberg? Anyone that can't agree that bias IS a part of the process that network news agencies employ to choose and then cover stories lives in DeNile. His proof is irrefutable.)"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I read the Ezekiel Option by Joel Rosenberg first.The beginning of that book is topped by this prequel The Last Jihad.I will read more of Joel Rosenberg as his writing makes me feel like I have visited the world he created.In the Last Jihad felt I that I had been in the bunker with the president making those tough decisions.I felt goose bumps when the book ended.I'm a fan of Rosenberg! You will be too!"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Coming to the final page of this book, I feel utterly exhausted by the pace and physical energies that have been expended. Jim Bennett is a young Wall St. wiz kid who has been chosen by the President of the US to be a major part of his peace making deal between the Israeli and Arab worlds. Jim, who is bent on becoming a multi millionaire as fast as possible, reluctantly agrees to be part of the team following an attempt to assassinate the President and after undergoing a test of his loyalty in a way that is almost sadistic. He and an attractive female secret agant are sent to Israel where they tie up with Mossad, the Israeli secret service. The forces of Saddam Hussein are on the brink of starting a nuclear war and have the intention of wiping out any city which is anti Saddam, beginning with the Queen of England, the US president and the Joranian royal family. The counter attacks by the Israelis and the forces of the US are swift and terrible and the really frightening thing is that this is not just a novelist's dream but a quite possible scenario given the state of the world of today."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This novel begins and ends with an attempt on the president's life. Between those events lies the harrowing tale of the attempt to determine which of the president's closest associates is the traitor providing the terrorists with information on his location and the attempt to keep an escalating situation in the Middle East from spiraling out of control and turning into a world war.The majority of the book is told from the perspective of Bennett, the president's protege who has been left in command of the business that the president had to leave when he began his campaign for governor of Colorado. He is the only character whose psychology we get to examine intimately. Despite his flaws, he is likeable and one really hopes that things will work out for the best for him. As tensions escalate, the president asks him to leave his commercial work and come on as a White House advisor, specifically, to take the business deal he closes in the early pages of the book and attempt to turn it into the centrepiece of a new Middle East piece plan.The book is very well paced, and although it deals more with the politicians and secret service agents (rather than the more direct military/intelligence characters of a Clancy or Robinson novel) it remains a page turner.So, why only 3 stars? The first reason is the abruptness of the ending. There is absolutely no denouement at all. The last chapter reads as if there must be two more following it which mysteriously vanished. One supposes that Rosenberg has a sequel in the wings.Secondly, keeping in mind the author and the time it was written, this book comes across as something of a propaganda piece. Rosenberg was one of the editors of World Magazine, before he resigned to promote his book. World was adamant in making the case for a war with Iraq, and many of the presuppositions of this book are drawn from those arguments (the presence of weapons of mass destruction and a link with al-qaeda). The timing of the book cannot have been coincidental, and I resent it when I find an author trying to influence my political opinions so overtly (whether I agree or disagree with them)."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This contemporary novel of terrorism is every bit as electric as Rush says it is.

You want more."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"The Last Jihad starts off great, but then you're immediately thrust into an overly detailed background of the president, who isn't even the main character, and how he met the book's main character years later. A decent amount of the story delves into political aspects and meetings, making it a duller read than I anticipated. Eventually the pace picked up and the book ends with quite a bang. It's the in between stuff that really made it hard to enjoy this book more. I'll probably eventually see how this story ends, but my hope is that Rosenberg has improved on leaving out so many details that do nothing but slow the book down.Spoiler warning:One of my main gripes is the unexplained appearance of the world's most dangerous terrorists, the Four Horsemen, at the end of the book. They were being tailed for many, many miles by US agents and were eventually followed into a hotel where the men had four separate rooms. When the agents make a move to capture the terrorists, they're nowhere to be found, despite the huge surveillance watch on their movements. If I remember right, this was in Russia.

Very rare for the slow reader that I am.This political thriller was written shortly after 9-1-1, and released just prior to the U.S. invasion of Iraq. It is set in the near future (c2011?) and remains extremely timely.The action screams from the pages from the opening event of an assassination attempt on the President, and doesn't let up. Rosenberg is a saavy political and military writer. He takes the action all over the world, from Colorado's mountains, to Saddam Hussein's Baghdad (he was alive when this was written), to Russian train stations, to the hills of Jerusalem. The plot basically involves Iraqi aggression, with nuclear overtones, against the west. The story is credible enough, and complex enough. Characterizations are OK, with less overstatement than I usually have to suffer in this type of a novel.As I mentioned, this was written prior to the capture and execution of Saddam Hussein, but interestingly . . . substitute Iran for Iraq, and Achmedinijhad (sp) for Hussein, and you have an up-to-date \\"could happen\\" adventure thriller.Rosenberg is Clancyesque in his use of current military/security procedure and technology, but not perfect. (I have some personal experience). Neither is the editing, and it reveals that this book was rushed to press. Examples: His description of the size and composition of a presidential motorcade was over the top (maybe in 2011, who knows). A Navy Seahawk helicopter is called a Skyhawk in one erroneous reference. I believe a .45 caliber ACP round is used in auto-pistols, NOT revolvers (.45 Colt round). And, Dirty Harry movies aside, NO modern plainclothes enforcement officer carries a .45 caliber six shot revolver (excess weight, bulk, limited capacity). This comment, by the way, concerns the same agent in the story that not only always carries night vision goggles in his luggage (maybe), but also packs a spare set (uh, no). You can't load half a dozen adults, including their equipment and a stretcher into the typical metro police helicopter and get the thing off the ground. Why when under urgent attack in the high tech \\"safe room\\" of a Jerusalem home, does the owner resort to calling the White House and waiting for a SEAL Team to arrive, when there are more than adequate response resources available within minutes from the Israeli authorities. There are more, but you get my drift.Rosenberg also reasonably and only semi-subtley inserts a Christian salvation message in the story. I say \\"reasonably\\", as Islam is given equal time in the book, in terms of idealistic speeches. Fair enough.So this was not perfect, but it was a super-engaging can't-put-down fun read that remains on target with what's going on in the world. I'll go 4 stars for that."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"If you're interested at all in how today's world events could play out, you must read this book, as well as Rosenberg's sequels, \\"The Last Days\\" and \\"The Ezekiel Option.\\" I'm just starting \\"The Copper Scroll\\", but I have every expectation that Rosenberg will come through as he did in the first three.

A compelling oil deal to unite Israel and Palestine is also a subplot. That one is a little unrealistic. But the role of General Aziz certainly is so similar to the feelings of the current Iraqi dictatorship.Some of the scene shifts and political maneuverings are a little bit too rapid fire without enough time given to develop certain characters and how they relate to the story.

Make sure you don't start to read this until you have time to finish, it is that good! When I read the last page I closed the book and went \\"whew\\". I passed it along to my husband and son(13) and both got hooked immediately. One thing I really appreciated is there was no rough or obscene language and yet it did not distract from the way the characters made their points.

Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I like Joel Rosenberg's fantasy books even more, but this is an utterly terrific political novel."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This genre is one with which I am quite familiar. Sadly, I found The Last Jihad to be off the mark in several areas, despite a valiant effort by the author to create an exciting adventure novel. Obviously the first problem is unfortunate timing. The author relied on the status quo remaining for a time in Iraq, but as perverse fortune would have it, his basic premise of Saddam Hussein instigating a new major war must now be relegated to one of those exercises in \\"what if?\\"-you know, a game where speculation on a possible outcome of past events is predicated upon a rift in the time continuum causing history as we know it to be changed. If President Bush had not first kicked Saddam out so swiftly in our real world, the story would have been far more interesting, having moved into the \\"eminently probable scenario\\" category. Obviously this was not Rosenberg's fault, he gambled as one must when dealing with real people and current situations.My real complaints are mainly annoyances at descriptions of actions that are exaggerated beyond reason in an attempt to create emotional impact. An example? US agent shoots terrorist in back of neck with a standard load .45 semi-auto pistol (860 fps solid-point bullet) and \\"virtually\\" separates his head from his body. Combat vets and medics are allowed to laugh heartily here. I also found the dialogue off-key, especially involving the President and his staff: simplistic, rather juvenile and superfluous banter during moments of historical crisis. Radio chatter between pilots also was apparently taken from old Clark Gable movies, a plethora of antiquated and unnecessary \\"Roger, Roger that\\"s and \\"five by five\\"s. Most startling was the idea that the President would order pre-emptive nuclear strikes on two cities with a combined population of nearly ten million civilians just to get Saddam Hussein seemed a bit over the top, even for a fiction story. The thinly-disguised politicizing gets a bit old and smacks of anti-Arab propaganda. Descriptions of how Saddam's top military officers cavalierly execute their seconds-in-command by shooting them down without warning in front of the rest of the troops for no reason other than to get their attention, like the pistol-shot decapitation scenario mentioned above, would play better on the Itchy and Scratchy cartoon show favored by Bart and Lisa Simpson. But my main criticism is the lack of interest the characters generate. The main protagonist seems a poor choice, shallow, ineffectual and altogether unlikable, his main traits being selfishness and greed. I wouldn't let my daughter marry him. The love interest between him and a lady undercover agent, whose character was barely defined, seemed lukewarm at best, never developing into a passionate, tender affair to balance all the violence.For this type of novel, one would perhaps better enjoy a thriller featuring the political savvy and story pacing of Vince Flynn, (Separation of Power) the character and plot development of Tom Clancy (Clear and Present Danger) and the military weaponry, clandestine operations and Middle Eastern cultural expertise of Phillip E. Carpenter. (Arabian Assignment: Slavery and Terrorism in North Africa) I am not sorry I bought The Last Jihad, however, it filled some time during a slow period, but there are other novels of this genre far superior if you have not already read most of them.-Barker Reviews"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I am not a big novel reader.

(I won't tell you if he does it).It's a news junkie's dream. But don't expect to know any more going out than you did coming in, about what's really happening in the world, or about the true nature of the Arab-Israeli conflict, or about what-and who-motivates and eggs on the fanatics of the world. To find out, you'll have to go elsewhere.On the plus side, I'd have to say that Rosenberg is a good news writer, is definitely in the know about the way things work \\"inside the beltway,\\" that is, inside our mega-government complex.

The characters are interesting and not flat. The action is exciting and even a little gory. It has some overtly Christian stuff in it, but isn't preachy.What's not so good about TLJ? Rosenberg's method of telling a story is scattered. He likes to have little soundbites (even as small as a page or less) on one part of the story, then skip to another soundbite, then again to another. This style is, to me at least, quite irritating and can be confusing. What's more, this book (though an interesting take on politics in the Mid-East [and the US's involvement in them]) offered me no profound opening into the culture or political attitudes. It focused mostly on the Americans; it might have been far more interesting if more focus was put on the other points of view represented in the book.So, altogether, I give it three stars. It is fun, but nothing special nor worthy of the many must-read lists (Rush Limbaugh notwithstanding)."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This was one of the series I had been missing.

It is an extremely fun and exciting read that will be hard to put down. I'm a very slow reader, but kept the book in my hands all week, everywhere I went, until it was finished - it was THAT good. There have been a few reviews that are quite hard on this author, but I truly think they were mostly without good reason. HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This book is hard to put down. I read it after I read Epicenter and liked that order. Mr. Rosenberg makes it easy to feel that you know his characters. His descriptions of people and places are easy to see with with mind's eye. It is also non-insulting to those of us who prefer clean reading. It is an exciting story but also leads to a lot of thought about what is really going on in our world."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I really debated over what to rate this book, and ended up deciding on 3 1/2 stars. I'll admit that I had extremely high hopes for this book, and it just didn't quite deliver. But maybe my expectations were a bit too high! After reading the back, I was expecting Vince Flynn level writing and action, and this fell short for me.First off, when reading this book, you have to keep reminding yourself that it's just fiction. It's written as if Sadam Hussein was still alive and incharge or Iraq, the US hasn't invaded Iraq yet, and Bin Laden has been killed. But that's a pretty minor issue with the book. I mean, it was written a number of years ago, and I can just understand that it's fiction!I love a book that grabs my attention from the start and just doesn't let go. Yes, this book grabbed my attention, but it didn't keep it. There were a number of parts where I was enthralled with the action, but it just always seemed afterwards to lose my attention. I also had a really hard time believing that in the midst of a MAJOR act of war, the President wants to focus part of his attention on a business deal. Yes, I understand that supposedly this business deal is supposed to completely change the world, but for the moment maybe we should be more focused on all of the bombs, and attacks and such!There were also way too many characters, and very few of them developed well enough for me to care about them. The focus kept shifting around, from one person to another, and it was happening a bit too often for my liking. At one point, the US was tracking a group of 4 terrorists, called the 4 horsemen. Even though they mentioned that they were some of the most feared terrorists, no other details were really given. I would have loved to have heard a bit more about their past so that I had a real reason to push for them being caught.Overall though, it was a pretty good story. There were some great moments of action and suspense. I was debating over if I would continue on to the next book in the series. But when I reached the end of this one, I realized that I don't have much choice! It ends on such a major cliff hanger, that I have to know what's going to happen!"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Joel Rosenberg has a prophetic edge and profound knowledge of Middle Eastern history and people and their place on the global stage. Though fictional, this book--and all of his others--give chilling insight into events past, present and future. An excellent read, The Last Jihad is just the beginning of a thrilling series. I highly recommend reading The Epicenter, his non-fiction book, as well, as it offers background and an in depth understanding of his fictional writings."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I ordered this book for my daughter to complete the set of the wholes Epicenter Series by Joel Rosenberg.

This is happening now, my friends!God bless,LS"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Excellent book. It is one of a four book series. Unfortunately, the publisher did not number them, so when I started reading the series I read them out of order. It discusses the end times and the upcoming war in the middleast, that will bring about World War 3. It may be fiction, but it is very close to reality and what could happen in the near future. I definitely would recommend all of Joel Rosenberg's books."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Another great book by Joel Rosenberg. I would recommend that this book be read before reading the others in this series.I read Dead Heat as my first entry into Joel's wrting and wish I had started with Last Jihad.Knowing when this book was first writtin (prior to 9/11) makes the book even more scary. Joel has an uncanny ability to take facts of the world situation and put together a very possible and very worrisome perspective on the future of our world."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"The Last Jihad is a must-read for every true red-blooded American. It's the start of the best-written series. Joel C. Rosenberg is the greatest author ever. This book starts with action and excitement and ends with one of the most tragic and hair-raising gunfights in Israeli history. I don't know how Rosenberg wrote this so well. When you begin to read it, there is no putting it away. Every page holds new adventures and challenges that put you right in the center of what is going on today.Rosenberg could not have made a better character than Jon Bennett. He is such a classic American with high values, good instincts and a large bank account. You are put in his shoes and are faced with the decisions he has to make as a Senior Advisor to the President.Every word of this fabulous book draws you into the political world and shows you the \\"inside scoop.\\" It's such a great book, you have to read it. I certainly say that Rosenberg deserves three cheers for The Last Jihad."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Please, the Hardy Boys books featured deeper characters. Gene Autry movies had better dialog, and less-contrived plots. I mean, how far can \\"timeliness\\" carry a novel? Obviously, to the best seller list. But staying power? Long-term interest? I confess that Rosenberg builds some nice momentum with those cinematic quick cuts from scene to scene. Because Rush Limbaugh recommended it, and I like Rush, I give it one star. Because the good guys win, it gets another. Other than that, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I received this book for Christmas 2002. I read it in two days. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and felt it moved quickly. I highly recommend it to others. If you like Clancy-type stories, you'll enjoy this one.I appreciate Rosenberg's positive outlook toward evangelical Christians. It's all too often that conservative Christians are viewed as unintelligent and out of touch with reality.Looking forward to Rosenberg's next novel."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This is an exciting, fast paced thriller.It begins with a kamikaze type attack on the motorcade of the president of the United States. Along with that there are other major terrorist threats occurring.The story is a bit outdated now due to world events of the last couple of years. Nevertheless, it is a great concept with tons of action.There were a few implausible elements in the story. One thing that didn't make much sense to me was an attack on the former director the Mossad. I didn't really see the point in attacking someone who was no longer in a position of power. But, of course, terrorists are not rational.Additionally, there were a couple of technical areas where a bit more research by the author would have been good. These were not things that took away from the story line a great deal, but Rosenberg is not on a par with Clancy in providing realistic details yet.I haven't read any of Rosenberg's other books, but I will certainly be reading 'The Last Days' which is the sequel to this one. This is an exciting book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This was a good book, good, not great.Rosenberg has a flair for detail, in that way, you may say he's much like Tom Clancy. He explains things in a very detailed manner, like Clancy.HOWEVER, the plot here is a little too straightforward. The idea was great, but it seems like that's all he had to work with.His basic idea and then the minute details.It's almost as if it's an outline for a future novel. If Rosenberg had added another 100 pages of straight characterization, he would have made a GREAT first novel.I say three stars, and on that, I'll buy his next novel to see if he improves."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"The Last Jihad was a page turner from start to finish.

I plan on getting all of his books to continue the story."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I was worried going into this book that I would not have enough background knowledge on recent developments in terrorism. The overwhelming amount of news on this current topic has caused me to draw away more than be pulled into it. Yet, from the beginning to the end I was riveted by this action packed thriller. I even enjoyed the few bits of politics that remained simple enough for even me to understand. Rosenberg was off on some of his guesses for the future after 9/11, but this doesn't drag down the full impact of the story. Over all I was struck by how exciting this book was. Definitely not the long drawn out political junk that I had originally expected."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Very exciting with a very supprising ending. A timely book giving a good picture of the present middle east problems."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Either I'm a fast reader, or there are some slow-poke readers out there. Two sittings, 2 days - cover to cover. It's that fast paced a book.The first thing to consider is that this book was being written when the attacks on New York and the Pentagon actually occurred - so rather than being immediately dated, Mr. Rosenberg tried to bring them into his novel.The second thing to consider is that the scenario of history is one that was entirely possible - that the U.S. simply declared war on terrorists, and then went after them without actually utilizing more than special forces and/or troops in Afghanistan. Certainly in 2002 that was feasible.A comment made by another reader - that your vehicle taking a GPS reading wouldn't let you know where that vehicle is - has apparently never really paid much attention to GM's On-Star (tm) system - which ALWAYS knows where those vehicles are. Or has she never heard of Lo-Jack (tm)?It's a proven fact that Saddam had WMD. The whole world knows that - he used them. It's also a proven fact that he kicked the UN inspectors out. If the U.S. hadn't invaded Iraq in 2003, then the rest of this is entirely plausible. As it is, now it must go into the fiction and/or alternative history pile. Although it is interesting that a recent news headline mentioned that it appears that Saddam Hussein, in prison in 2004 may be suffering from prostate cancer - which Rosenberg has him suffering from in 2010.The characters in the book needed to be expanded quite a bit. As it was, while I found the action sequences to be quite thrilling, the character developement left something to be desired. The use of everyday technology by the main character was interesting, but I find it difficult to care, really, whether Bennett and McCoy end up married.Certainly riveting, though - from the kamikaze attack early on, to the dropping of the nuclear warheads in the end. (The sad thing is, though, I had Mr. C figured out in advance - or at least who he had to be.)"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This is a truly awful book.

He paints a compelling and entirely believable picture of courageous American leadership responding to the clear and present danger posed by Islamic fundamentalist madmen. It's a thriller that thrills without having to rely on gratuitous profanity or promiscuity as background color. If you own a first edition of Clancy's Hunt for Red October, its worth a fortune. I'm holding on to my first edition of The Last Jihad because this author is sure to cause its value to appreciate."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Full disclosure - I am conservative: I listen to Rush, watch O'Reilly, etc., so I'm not bashing this book because of the content of its politics (oops - now I sound like a seminar caller). I bought this book after hearing Rush interview the author on his show.When the reviews on a book are from such unusual book reviewers as Rush Limbaugh, Steve Forbes and Sean Hannity and none of the major book reviews, it should be a clue as to the quality of the book. This book starts off great - the first episode is gripping and entertaining. Then it goes nowhere. Characters are shallow and poorly developed and serve mainly as personifications of the conservative ideal. After the intro, the plot goes nowhere. The book is rather short, which is a blessing in this case. The prose is filled with cliches and is often awful. Some reviews have made comparisons with Clancy - one thing that is Clancy-like is that the politics of the author are on full and annoying display. Where Clancy jumps between storylines every chapter or perhaps a little more often, this author jumps between story lines every page. Considering you never get more than a page or a couple paragraphs on each story line, it isn't surprising that the plot is not developed very well. Finally, where Clancy gives you accurate technology detail to the point of irritation, this author has based a significant part of his plot on the Blackberry personal email devices being used for communication in an underground bunker in Israel - Blackberry is not yet in Israel and would certainly not work underground. This book is like Clancy if Clancy wrote comic books.Best to get your political commentary from Rush and O'Reilly and leave the book reviewing to the book people."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"A brilliant insider's account of a fictional view of the war on terror.

I must say flat out that I am greatly disappointed by this book. My reasons are many, but here are a few:1. The characters come fast and furious, with so little character development, that quite frankly, I was confused throughout the entire book. There are so many characters introduced in the first half of the book that I really did not know who the main characters were until well into the book.2. Author Rosenberg seems as though he is trying to impress the reader with his knowledge of governmental processes, weapons, etc. There is so much useless information given, I found it frustrating and distracting.3. Rosenberg gives far too much distracting detail on what color nail polish someone is wearing, how many cubes of sugar used in a person's coffee, the firing sequence for a surface to air missile, etc. It is non-stop and aggravating. It truly distracts from the narrative of the story-line.4. Rosenberg switches from scene to scene far too frequently, again confusing the reader.Granted, Mr. Rosenberg is an authority on Middle East politics, but his attempt at fictionalizing Iraq's grand assault on the world's powers flounders in trivial and inconsequential minutiae. Since I purchased the entire series, I am hoping that the next book will be less detail and more story.At best, I give this volume ONE star for confusing the reader with ridiculous detail, and not advancing the narrative story at a satisfactory pace. This book needs a Reader's Digest condensation, and then instead of 300 pages, the resulting 150 pages might be more coherent and interesting.Sorry Mr. Rosenberg. I love you but dislike your book."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Great novel well researched I recommend this novel to my friends please offer more novels like these on Amazon com"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"what a read combined with the other four book in the series a real can't put it down and can't wait until I strat the next one book.

In this time it is a must read."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I really enjoyed The Last Jihad, which I read a year or so ago. I really, really enjoyedThe Ezekiel Option (Political Thrillers Series #3)which I finished a few weeks ago. I really, really, really enjoyedThe Copper Scroll (Political Thrillers Series #4)! There's a book in between the first two which I missed. Nevertheless, if you like thrillers, prophecy, and the End Times, you'll love these books. (And I learned a lot of new things about the End Times and the Bible, too.) My husband then zoomed through them, and he loved them, too!"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"The book really does start out with a bang - a terrorist attempts to take out the Presidential motorcade in a Gulf Stream IV private plane, and it is heart racing action and suspense from there. My wife and I started out reading Rosenberg's \\"Epicenter 2.0\\" and while we were part-way through it the rumblings in the Middle East got louder (uprising & ouster in Tunisia, and Egypt, and as of today, Civil war in Libya, protests in Syria, Jordan, Bahrain, and Yemen).Epicenter was very compelling non-fiction, so we thought we'd get Rosenberg's fiction books and start from the beginning. It's been a great read! Highly recommended if you like political thrillers and/or if what is going on in the Middle East is interesting to you.Update 6/3/2011:There are some parts in the middle where it slows down quite a bit. But, then something exciting will happen, and it will pick back up again!There are some intense actions sequences in the 2nd half of the book as well. And there are at least two good plot twists regarding who was involved in the attempted Presidential assassination.I do agree with some of the other reviewers on at least two things: first, the character development (and sometimes the dialogue as well) are thin. This is Rosenberg's first novel, so I think some slack can be cut there. I am planning on reading the rest of them.The other thing is that the political viewpoint of Rosenberg is very obvious. I personally am of the same political stripe as Rosenberg, so my gripe isn't that I disagree with him. But it does come off clumsily sometimes. SPOILER ALERT: Like the attack under the glass dome, it is an evil event. But Rosenberg is overly obvious to directly say 'there's an evil presence at work' (parapharse). He could describe how it feels, or have the darkness be a part of the characters dialogue (just off the top of my head, and I'm not a writer) and I think it feel a little less forced.Criticism's aside, it is a fun, thrilling, action-packed read. I loved it! I can't wait to read the other books in the series and see how Rosenberg's writing develops. The subject matter is also very fascinating and relevant to real-world events going on right now in the Middle East, despite the fact that this book is fiction, and was written in 2001 when Saddam Hussein still existed."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Month's before 9/11 Joel Rosenburg wrote about Islamic terrorist flying a plane into a building to attack the President of the United States.

It was exciting and full of action. However the parts in between the action were really slow. I would read a page and not remember any of it and had to start again, or even just skip some.

Joel Rosenberg went through quite a bit of research in order to make this book realistic and to give it a historic background. The plot involves a deadly assassination attempt on the president of the United States. Other attacks are in the planning and/or execution stages. As the U.S. government grapples with the attacks, their ferocity and audacity, behind the scenes are players who are feverishly seeking who is to blame.

I don't read alot of fiction but when I do, I love a good political thriller. Rush Limbaugh turned me on to Vince Flynn and I love his books. So when Rush so vehemently praised &quot;The Last Jihad&quot;, I thought I'd give it a try. I was a little turned off because A) I thought this guy was trying to capitalize on 9/11 and B) I'm used to Mitch Rapp, Vince Flynn's hero; a real macho terrorist-killing machine. Rosenberg's hero is a...Wall Street strategist?!! Oy Vey!But I have to admit, I LOVE THIS BOOK!! I couldn't put it down and read it in 11 days, a major feat for me. The action is non stop and there is not a wasted scene in the entire book. Rosenberg doesn't bog you down with minute details, and I noted one inaccuracy in a shoot out, but otherwise this book was amazing. I don't read these books for thorough character development and intellectual dialogue. But I enjoyed the characters and the dialogue seemed real to me, but it won't win any literary awards.I just got &quot;The Last Days&quot; and attended a book signing last night.

Now I'm hoping he will soon release another."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I read this book because a friend recommended it. I don't have a problem with the subject matter, because I consider myself a conservative. I also understand that Joel Rosenberg is a very intelligent and accomplished man, with a vast amount of experience. However, this novel was not compelling enough to keep my interest. The character development was nonexistent, the transitions between sections were rough and the amount of cliche throughout the book was absolutely irritating. I was reading it for a discussion group and was about 40 pages from finishing it. We finished the discussion and I had no desire to finish, despite being so close to the end. It was a complete waste of time. I understand he has a nonfiction book out (Epicenter) and I would be interested in his thoughts because of his background, but I have no desire to complete this series of novels."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This review is for the Tyndale House Publishers paperback edition, 2007, 306 pages. THE LAST JIHAD, first published in 2002, was on the USA Today's Top 150 Best-Selling books list for 18 weeks between December 2002 and November 2003, reaching the peak position of 32. Stuart Woods has four novels on the USA Today best-seller list.In this story, it's 2010 and the President of the United States, code-named Gambit, is traveling in an impressive motorcade from Denver international airport to his hotel. A kamikaze plane tries to take him out. Ah, it's those terrorists again, and this time there are definitive links to Saddam Hussein. This political thriller then takes us into the presumed workings of the United States government in the decision as to how to best protect its citizens.Most of the sparkle in this story is in the timing. It was conceived and written post 9/11 but before the second Iraq war, although cognizant of the first. The theme is rich in the justification for a preeminent strike. It is prescient, although not so much of events, but as to the mood and presumptions of post 9/11 America.Warning! The writing here is unimpressive, below average with strained dialogue that drifts towards speeches.Rush Limbaugh writes in his cover blurb, \\"Rosenberg nails it....\\" Well, in Rosenberg's fictional version the United States and Israel have physical proof that Iraq has Weapons of Mass Destruction and the administration displays this conclusive evidence to the American people. Rosenberg is not an apologist for what happened. Instead, he provides a scenario we could have felt good about."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"The Author surely knows his stuff, I can see from his background that he has been close,extremely close to our countrys political problems. I can say this has been the best novel I have read in some time. It has also shown me that we do have a very strong belief to our concern with Isreal, maybe to strong. I have come to beleive we should take care of America first and then if anything is left help others. That is the way the rest of the world operates. Saying that and writing my manifesto does not do the job of stating this is a wonderful book and I certainly will read as I have already purchased the followup \\"The Last Days\\""},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This book was written before the Iraq war but after September 11th.

While I don't agree with the politics of those who endorse the book (Limbaugh, Hannity, et. al.) I also don't agree with those who have unfairly reviewed the book based on strictly political motivations. Putting all politics aside, it is simply a good story that is well-crafted and engaging. I found the characters to be believable and likeable and the plot - albeit devestatingly frightening to consider - equally plausible. Sure, some of the sequences do seem a bit far fetched - but this is a novel set in a fictionalized future - and they do not detract from the overall story. Mr. Rosenberg is to be commended on crafting such a compelling story. I look forward to reading the sequel!"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"The Last Jihad was a surprising, thrill-ride through a realistic scenario that could happen. Current events, including the recent war in Iraq have made this book all too real and somewhat chilling. Clearly Joel Rosenberg is a legitimate insider with a breadth and depth of foreign policy that matches few others.Like most readers, I had only known Rosenberg through his regular reporting for World Magazine. But, as this novel demonstrates, Rosenberg not only is in the know, (experience with Limbaugh, Forbes, and other political heavyweights), but can also craft a rich, textured novel that leaves the reader rushing to turn the page.The sparkle of the action and the tightness of the writing reveals a talent beyond that of a first-time writer, which Rosenberg is. The Last Jihad has Clancy-esque quality, minus the extra 200 pages, and yet still contains the richness and vibrancy that bonds the characters with the reader.What's even more impressive is the reality of what plays out in The Last Jihad. You never scratch your head and say, &quot;That couldn't happen.&quot; Instead, you wonder and worry and wish it doesn't come to pass!! Obviously with the Butcher of Baghdad no longer in power, that is not possible.The Last Jihad is a superb novel in ever sense of the word, from the rich, layered writing to the impressive, but not boring details, to the political machinations that only an insider could chronicle, to the heart-pounding, real-world drama that unfolds. What's more, Rosenberg iserts the presence of Christian faith, but doesn't sermonize.You'll want to pick up this book and read it. It will be a wonderfully dangerous thrill ride."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Thank you, Mr. Rosenberg, for a great, exciting book. Glad our library carries the series.

My teen son read the whole series in a week. At first, I wasn't interested in reading it, but then saw their excitement and I decided to try it. The first pages had me on the edge of my chair. Being from Denver made it fun for us, too, since we are well acquainted with geographical references, etc. We enjoyed this book immensely!

Since 200+ before me have already put in thier two cents I'll just say that you should join the rest of us and read this book.The ending is wonderful and literally makes you go out and get the next book. Since I'm reading this series \\"late\\" all of the books are published already. Thank god!! I'd hate to have to wait for the next one in this series."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Rosenberg intrigues the reader from the very first chapter with a fast and exciting opening. Written before Gulf War II (and I believe just before 9/11), his novel on the Middle East (particularly events based in Iraq in this story) reads like a contemporary newspaper. This work is the first in a series on the Last Days; each subsequent work eerily matching events in the Middle East before they happen.In each novel, though less in this first book, the middle chapters tend to not be as fast moving as the first few and last few chapters. Even so, they are all enjoyable, and I look forward to more of his books in this series.Rosenberg has also written a non-fiction book, \\"Epicenter\\" which focuses on actual news events in Iran, Iraq, Israel, and Russia, and where those events may be leading us in light of biblical prophecy. His web blog provides almost daily updates and links to such events. Rosenberg is not an alarmist, nor a typical \\"end times\\" prophet of doom. Instead, he paints a portrait of how trends in current events may in fact be the fulfillment of the Book of Ezekiel chapters 38 and 39."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"With a title like this, you know that some politics are bound to be involved, and with a title like \\"The Last Jihad\\", there better be some action. I decided to take my chances. I wasn't disappointed either. When you think of a political thriller, almost immediately the name \\"Clancy\\" springs to life. I've tried to get into Clancy numerous times, yet most of the time it fails to keep my interest. \\"The Cardinal of the Kremlin\\" was my favorite by him, but he still doesn't capture my interest too much. So when it comes to the \\"political thriller\\" or whatever you call it, I've stuck with no-namers, and Oliver North. Then I tried this. Joel C. Rosenberg wasn't what stuck out. Like I said above, it was the title. It wasn't all that bad. I certainly don't agree with those that said this was a complete waste of time. Too long and drawn out in some parts, but it left a big mark, and a lasting impression. It was worth taking the journey.To start this tale with an attempted presidential assassination was crazy. And it got wilder and a lot crazier! Who could possibly be behind that? Iraq, right? Enter Jon Bennett, friend of the president! Things are to be discussed, and nuclear war is really being pondered. The name Saddam comes into play a time or two. But it really gets interesting when you hear of \\"the four horsemen of the Apocolypse\\". Oh man! Yes, this really gets crazy, and things start going nuts! The other thing going for this is the hope of what we really don't know. This sparkles with good stuff, and it shines a bright light in the midst of a lot of darkness.Unfortunately, this isn't something that everybody is going to go GA-GA over. I liked it though, and I look forward to reading Rosenberg in the future. He certainly proved he has a knack for putting words on paper. He probably thought it was really cute to have the readers going up until that last and final page. So, what happens when you get to that LAST page? You go out and look for \\"The Last Days\\", of course! Because after this, I KNOW I haven't seen the LAST of Joel C. Rosenberg."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Very, very compelling and timely story. I notice that much criticisms here seem politically motivated.

If you can get past these unnecessary jabs then you'll truly enjoy the book.Shortly after the book starts, the reader is immersed in suspense as an assassination attempt occurs on the popular president up for reelection. With great knowledge and detail on secret bunkers and operations, Rosenberg's writing is so perfect that I soon couldn't remember which sections were real and which had not actually happened.The Last Jihad is worth the read.(A little side-note: Anyone else notice that the book begins a day before Thanksgiving while the president is seeking reelection?

Loved the Christian aspects of the book! Can't wait to read more in the series."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"My family enjoyed the plot lines and the Biblical connections that came about from time to time. I originally bought all of Joel's books (5) on audio cds so we could listen to during drive times in the car. I wanted my family to hear some background and achieve another level of understanding with regards to Iraq, Iran, Islam, Christianity, Judaism, the European Union, Israel, and the prophetic possibilties in the Holy Scriptures we call the Bible. We want them to understand why things are happening/playing out the way they are, and why which parties are involved.Joel's books do this, giving you ideas of possible scenarios with regards to actual Biblical Prophecy. HOWEVER, as soon as we finish each audiobook, we will throw them away. Why? Brother Joel obviously is using the flawed undertaking that in order to reach the \\"lost\\" in the world (i.e. non-Believers), we need to put a little sin into something Biblical in order to make it palatible. Sadly, he ignores the Bible's direct explanations that a little leaven leavens the whole loaf. For years we've watched people fall out of the God of Israel's Holiness and play fake Christianity because they were \\"brought into the fold\\" by mixed modes of worldy/secular verions of Christianity. People are brought into the fold with a little leaven, and they live their \\"faith\\" out with leaven continually existing in various areas of their lives, having no problem with the sins, having no desire to be set-apart/kadosh/holy. Everybody's a Christian, just as long as they profess to be....&lt;sigh> The violent content is a bit too discriptive at times for entertainment, though not unthinkable. FREQUENT use of the \\"hell\\" swear-word-fashion is quite uncomfortable. Finally, taking the use of \\"God\\" as slang term and in emphasis mode for emotive moments that obviously don't involve talking TO or ABOUT God Himself, is unnerving. \\"Hell\\" and \\"God\\" are used in completely unBiblical manners. Sometimes you'll \\"hear\\" both a professing Believer as WELL AS a non-Believer using these terms. Neither is acceptable in books written by Believers. I was quite embarased when it began happening over and over, and so was my family when we heard these books on audio cds. Un-charateristic for a Godly-man, such as Brother Joel professes to be.Don't buy...violence and swearing/slang/blasphemy are frequent or inappropriate."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Simple, easy reading, with no thinking required. Like reading an old superhero comic strip where the good guys and bad guys are overly obvious. However, it was entertaining like a mindless &quot;Made for TV&quot; movie.

I won't even go into detail about the advertising and supposed right wing views espoused. I shudder to think that people believe all conservatives have such a radically limited concept of how our world works.Save your money and time - try a Cussler, Clancy, or Matt Reilly instead."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This very disappointing book starts out great with a kamikaze attack on the president's motorcade, followed by an intense interrogation scene with a twist. From then on it goes pretty much nowhere, and nothing particularly exciting happens for the duration, before ending cynically with a set-up for a sequel.Rosenberg's cardinal sin amongst the many on display is to give us a hero who is utterly unremarkable and who does hardly anything interesting throughout the book. For long passages, he is not even present, and events are happening outside his control and he does not get to be particularly influential. You could take him out of the book without any real impact on the story.The rest of the characters are cardboard, and Rosenberg's writing soon becomes tedious as he pushes them around, much of the book involving \\"will they nuke Iraq? won't they?\\" He doesn't back up the political and military aspects with any particularly in-depth knowledge, as you might expect from Tom Clancy. All in all, besides the bright start, a dud."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I am amazed at the people who put their name on the back cover of this book. I am a big fan of this genre, and all I can say is that it doesn't get any worse than this book. Putting the politics aside(which even if you agree with is done with such heavy handedness as to be embarrassing) this is simply a terrible book.The plot is not interesting, the premise(that the president has this brilliant masterplan for peace) laughable, and the characters one dimensional. I plowed through the book out of respect for other reviews I'd read, figuring something would end up clicking. My only conclusion is that people will love readng something that they agree with. With so many other great authors of this genre out there(Da Silva, Flynn to name a few), why anyone would waste their time with this is beyond me.I even gave this book to a very conservative friend to see if he liked it.

Had I read the accolades on the dust jacket I would have read this book with a much more jaundiced eye, as it happened I did not.The plot is contrived, the characters one-dimensional and the lesson, hammered home relentlessly, is that the good guys can use nuclear weapons and still retain the moral high ground, indeed that we can avoid all this unpleasantness looming in the near future if we'll just get out of the way and let Bush turn Baghdad into a parking lot.I only pray that Bush never reads this."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I have to admit, this was a great read in the beginning. I was hooked on the initial assault, which served to keep my interest throughout the rest of the novel.The ending ruins this book. With no respect for human life or dignity, I found this preachy first attempt at a novel to fail on all points of accountability. I'm not going to give away the ending, but I will say that the gravity of the situation coupled with a lack humanity leaves the reader saying, \\"Really? We did that? Just like that?

Great action and scarey to think we're actually living this."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Many reviewers have called this book &#65533;timely.&#65533; That may be the reason for its success at the bookstores and among conservative readerships. However, the topicality of its subject matter has undoubtedly clouded the judgment of readers who would otherwise recognize stilted, trite prose, and awkward dialogue. Certainly, the story advances at a brisk pace that makes reading it an afternoon&#65533;s work at most; but it does so at the expense of careful construction and memorable characterization. Most disturbing is Rosenberg&#65533;s tendency to attribute animal-like characteristics to the perpetrators of the terrorism, perhaps in an unconscious expression of Redfield&#65533;s human/non-human binary. He mentions an Iraqi&#65533;s &#65533;beady, black, lifeless eyes,&#65533; and has various leaders &#65533;barking&#65533; in Arabic. The author engages also in an existential discussion on evil, and the importance of eliminating it. In her book The Origin of Satan, Elaine Pagels shows how the idea of Satan &#65533; of pure evil &#65533; has aided the condemnation and elimination of the Other, especially in the context of Judaism and Christianity. Sadam Hussein, of course, is not innocent of this logic, but neither is Rosenberg. His construction of the terrorists specifically, and the Iraqis generally, as &#65533;evil&#65533; &#65533; as only barely human &#65533; aids in the justification of their destruction. On another note, Rosenberg offends perhaps every feminist critic since Laura Mulvey in his depiction of Erin McCoy, the financial wiz come CIA operative heroine who the author continually infantilizes; he even has her sucking on a lollipop in what must be a tribute to Nabakov. In the final scenes of the novel, she proves her grit by shooting up some Iraqis, only to be referred to as &#65533;buried treasure&#65533; by the hero. Her mix of righteous violence and girlish chastity must be the fantasy of young Republican boys everywhere. Indeed, the whole novel provides a glimpse of the conservative fantasia that has for the past two years mesmerized this nation. To have an enemy that is purely evil, to have a motive that is purely just &#65533; such is the recipe for legend. It is the Republican Beowulf, and Rosenberg validates the political lassitude and psycho-spiritual conviction of many Americans with his good/bad, black/white scenario. Unfortunately for Republicans, analyzing international conflict requires more than simple binary classifications; and unfortunately for Rosenberg, writing a good book requires more than a political agenda."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I should have known when the front cover endorsement by Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh what the agenda of this book is. The action and events are great, but it feels like pro-Bush post Iraq propaganda.

The arguments of the book rest heavily on recent history, but it is an incomplete and inaccurate version of history, reinforcing myths that have led to enormous tragedy for America's victims abroad. To mention just the tip of the iceberg: Though Rosenberg echoes the present administration's desperate and pathetic assertions to the contrary, Iraq was successfully disarmed by UNSCOM (before the inspectors were withdrawn--not expelled!--in 1998), and there's every reason to believe that continued inspections can work.

In adition, Saddam is proven (remember how Bush/Cheney were so certain) to have not only Sarin and other poision gases but actual nuclear bombs with rockets to launch them. Of course, in the book the President has no choice but to launch a massive bombing campaign against Iraq again with no plan of what to do next - just like what happened.Although this is a 'book' where actual events have evolved completely differently, I am sure Christians and Republicans will love its delusions."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"If some highly-placed Republicans and conservative pundits didn't encourage the author to write this book, I'd be very surprised.

This book went to press before the war in Iraq began, so the story is set in a world where Saddam Hussein is still President of Iraq, although Osama bin Laden is dead, and al-Quaida has been completely decimated, as have many terrorist camps across the Middle East and North Africa. The War on Terror appears to over, having been won by James \\"Mac\\" McPherson, an American president whose success has made him very popular with the American people.An attempt on McPherson's life is discovered to be part of a series of terror attacks carried out simultaneously around the globe, targeting the leaders of the United States and its allies. Israeli agents uncover and thwart a plan to carry out a nuclear attack against Israel. All of the attacks are traced back to Saddam Hussein's regime. The Israeli prime minister seeks to pressure the United States to \\"go nuclear\\" on Iraq, threatening that if the U.S. doesn't do it, Israel will.Jon Bennett, a close friend of President McPherson, is brought into the picture. Bennett is a Wall Street whiz kid working on a huge oil and natural gas deal which is set to bring great wealth to both the Israelis and Palestinians. Before entering politics, McPherson and Bennett had worked closely together on Wall Street. Now Bennett has been brought into his former boss' inner circle as a senior economic advisor. And he and his partner, Erin McCoy, are now being asked to promote the Israeli/Palestinian oil and gas deal as a U.S. public policy move.Rosenberg is a Jewish-born believer in Jesus Christ, and while The Last Jihad does exhibit some faith-based subplots, the central theme of this story is the terrorist threat against the United States and Israel. The Last Jihad was originally released by Forge Books, a secular publsher, in late 2002 followed by The Last Days. Tyndale House, a Christian publisher, released the third book (The Ezekiel Option) in 2005. The following year, Tyndale House released the next installment, The Copper Scroll) while also reissuing both The Last Jihad and The Last Days. Rosenberg concluded the series earlier this year with Dead Heat, released through Tyndale House.Joel Rosenberg has crafted a gripping political thriller in the tradition of Tom Clancy or Robert Ludlum. The Last Jihad would make an excellent movie. A screenwriter could just replace Iraq and Saddam Hussein with Iran and Mahmoud Ahmadiniejad, and this story could fit into the post-Saddam world. The Last Jihad is an excellent read, and I am looking forward to reading The Last Days."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Refered to this book by a friend. The book is a thriller and gets you from the first page. It was confusing for a while because of the difference in the book and actual events. This goes away as you quickly get into the book and quit trying to make the little details fit. The story does an excellent job of presenting how people of faith(Christians) react to world events compared to one of the main characters who has no faith. the presentation is not over bearing or heavy handed. The people of faith are attractive and makes me proud of our faith."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Joel Rosenberg, a political columnist for World magazine, has written quite an amazing first novel.One of the interesting things about it is that it proves evangelical Christians can write international thrillers and get published by New York publishers if their stories are strong enough. And this one is. Rosenberg, not really a Washington \\"insider,\\" nevertheless either knows enough about Beltway affairs or has done his research sufficiently to render the world of Washington in all its tawdry splender very effectively.The author also writes quite astonishing action scenes, e.g., the opening sequence where a Gulfstream G4 crashes into the President's limo, the shootout in the former top Mossad agent's house in Jerusalem, and the sniper sequence prior to the memorial service for the secret service agents.Not everything works optimally. I felt the main character's expertise--the ability to see patterns in the most obscure details, put them together, and forcast events--could've been more effectively used in the last half of the book. Also, there's not a whole lot of chemistry between the hero and his purported love interest.But these are quibbles. All in all, it's a fine effort."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"All other items on your to-do list will have to wait once you being this book.

You can't judge a book by it's cover, right? But, with all of the positive comments that were on the book's cover it had to be good.Actually, it was better! I literally could not put the book down. I got it just before Thanksgiving and finished it with in 3 days.The plot is quite involved. Just when you think you have things figured out, there's a new twist. I don't want to give details of the plot as it will ruin the surprise of discovering the twists: just know they are there and that it makes for a fun read. One of the things that I liked about the main plot was it was so believeable. In fact, I heard about this book while watching the author, Joel C. Rosenberg interviewed on Hannity and Colmes. I heard Joel say that while writing the book, 9-11 hit and he had to do some adjusting to the plot due to how real his initial premise was to what had just occurred.The characters become your friends, just as in any good book. I liked the character development, much like a Tom Clancy novel, in that the reader seems to be drawn into a world of reality that most of us only see from the outside. How do they set up security boundaries for Presidential motorcades? How do they draw information out of a suspect that may be reluctant to talk? I have wondered about that very thing while hearing of some of the information drawn out of the actual Taliban prisoners held in Cuba. How do they get these \\"loyal\\" Taliban top aides to talk? I got an idea of how it might be done in Chapter 5...All in all this was one terrific read. If the first chapter doesn't get you hooked, then have a Urologist check out your adrenal glands. For the rest of us, lay off the caffeine. This book is a good substitute.My only complaint: It'll take Joel C. Rosenberg at least a couple of years to pound out another book..."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I don't normally read fiction, but this book has been getting so much press that I decided to explore it for myself. After the first few pages I was spell-bound -- I could hardly put the thing down! Rosenberg has a smash hit on his hands, and I, like many other readers, am eager to read a sequel.This work could be described as a combination of a Tom Clancy novel and a Jenkins/LaHaye &quot;Left Behind&quot; volume. Global crises, military action, political intrigue, compelling characters, and a conservative, Christian mindset are all present in this book. The Christian aspect by no means dominates, but as a Baptist minister I quickly noticed the two or three times it surfaced and was pleasantly surprised.Perhaps the most appealing characteristic of this fictional, future tale is its closeness to present-day reality. With the current war on terrorism, the escalation of tension between the United States and Iraq, and the development of military and communications technology, the scenario described here could very well happen.I recommend this book very highly to anyone enjoying a good fictional read. The narrative consistently moves along at a rapid pace, never once dragging. Order it, read it, and see for yourself!"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"With the U.S. and Iraq engaged in a showdown, and the possibility of a war that could see the horrific use of weapons of mass destruction, Joel Rosenberg writes \\"The Last Jihad\\", a thriller that none-too-subtly reminds the public what the price may be for not taking out Saddam Hussein.For a debut in the world of fiction, Mr. Rosenberg has done admirably well. He takes advantage of a plot that is made all the more timely by real-life current events, and has crafted a fast-paced, intriguing thriller. The action starts off almost immediately, with an attempted attack on the presidential motorcade using a Gulfstream jet. It doesn't take much time to finger Iraq as the perpetrator, and so events roll from there, as an Israeli commando operation reveals Iraq's nuclear capacity. The Israelis give the U.S. one hour to take action before they fire a nuke on Iraq. The story catapults the reader through diplomatic, military, and personal machinations that culminate in nuclear weapons being unleashed.The bulk of \\"The Last Jihad\\" focuses on the character of Jon Bennett, a well-to-do financial strategist-turned-presidential aide. Not much time is spent fleshing out the character beyond his business career - serving to provide insight into the gas-oil deal that is brought into the story as a potential peace plan capstone between the Arabs and Israel. This is a mixed blessing; while the lack of character background and development allows the reader (and author) to stay focused on the plot, the downside is that the reader doesn't care as much what happens to the character, in that the character remains distant. So, in terms of the primal \\"rooting for the good guy\\", there is no impetus for wanting to root for the Jon Bennett character. If Mr. Rosenberg intends to write other fiction, and, more importantly, wants to make Jon Bennett the literary second coming of Jack Ryan, he will need to improve upon this aspect of storytelling.The character development - or lack of it - in regards to the President McPherson character in this story is interesting as well. The reader probably learns more about him than the Jon Bennett character, and are exposed to more of the emotional rationales behind his actions in the nuclear politics he engages in. I never could figure out if Mr. Rosenberg intended for President McPherson to be a Reagan-esque character in terms of determination and resolve. To me, this character had a strong Nixonian trait about him that made him one not to particularly like one way or the other.The bulk of the story revolves around the political and diplomatic happenings, demonstrating Mr. Rosenberg's obvious depth-of-knowledge and strength in this arena. The military descriptions and story threads are less descriptive and very basic, perhaps showing that Mr. Rosenberg is not well-versed in this area. It doesn't hurt him in terms of \\"The Last Jihad\\", but again, if he is to write follow-up books, he will need to expand upon his knowledge here.As with any first-time author, there are a few threads in the story that - overtly or not - are left hanging. There seemed to be a couple of little pieces here and there that could have been tied back in to the main plot, but weren't. However, these were not omissions that took anything significant away from the overall quality of the story.The main \\"agenda\\", if you will, that Mr. Rosenberg seems to be not-so-subtly pushing in this book is that of having to deal with Saddam Hussein at once. One cannot help but ignore that he advocates removal of Hussein before he strikes out in some way at Israel, the U.S., or another ally. This message becomes more evident as the plot unfolds. As it pertains to current events in early 2003, this works just fine. When the time comes that Saddam Hussein is removed from power - and when Iraq is not as large a focus on the national consciousness as it is now - this message may not play as well.Readers with Democrat/liberal leanings may pick up this book and be turned off by the rave reviews found on the jacket from the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and Steve Forbes. They may also be turned off somewhat by the obvious conservative bent in political discussions in the story. But, if those readers are that hung up on politics, they would be well-served to avoid this book. But for those who can set political leanings aside, this book will be well worth the time.Outside of a few very minor glitches and the character aspects noted above, \\"The Last Jihad\\" is an outstanding debut for Mr. Rosenberg. He has crafted a great story that has fantastic pacing, and takes the political thriller in an exciting new direction. This reader hopes that he will write again.I give \\"The Last Jihad\\" four stars, and heartily recommend it all except those who are irritated by the reviews of conservative media figures and politicians, since they will not get past that and enjoy what is a very good story."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I have one word for this book. Wow! I saw this in the bookstore yesterday, and was caught by the great cover quote by Rush Limbaugh. I instantly started reading the book, and couldn't put it down, so I bought two copies, one for me to finish, and one for my brother. JIHAD really reminds me of Clancy at his best. And it is so relevant to today's headlines -- an airborne terrorist attack on the President, America being forced to do battle with Iraq, and even a sniper in D.C. -- Rosenberg is definitely a writer to watch."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Rosenberg's first novel is a pretty good thriller. His action scenes are fast paced and thrilling, even though he crowds in a lot of technical details about weapons. I read these scenes rapidly, eager to find out who would live and who would not.He also includes a geopolitical story line, which tends to slow the book down. When the hero sits in a on a presidential cabinet meeting my attention began to wander. This part of the story was less interesting. It was also less believable.The novel sustained my interest through to the end. The action slowed at times, but never stopped. The characters were believable enough. They were described in about as much depth as one would expect from an action novel. This first novel does not rise to the level of Tom Clancy, but it is a good start. I think Rosenberg compares favorably with authors like Vince Flynn."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"A definite page turner from the start. I loved all of the Washington insight and the intrigueing gadgets along with the captivating story! Saw \\"Sum of All Fears\\" and thought that \\"The Last Jihad\\" would make a much better movie!"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Based on some great reviews, I picked up this book. I was soon sucked into the story, riveted by the attack on the president and the ensuing global consequences. The plot zips along, the characters play their expected--somewhat predictable--roles, and the climax promised to be memorable. I was impressed with the author's ability to weave in Christian themes without sounding preachy. In many ways, this book equalled \\"Mission Compromised\\" by Oliver North.Unfortunately, the last fifty pages were a letdown. Yes, the pace kept racing, but inconsistencies detracted from my enjoyment. For example, throughout the book Rosenberg teases us with scenes of \\"the four horsemen,\\" some of the world's most feared terrorists, as they maneuver toward a deadly goal. Here's the thing: their target is not even scheduled to be in any specific location until well after the \\"horsemen\\" begin heading that direction. The sudden and abrupt conclusion left room for a sequel, yet it left me feeling rushed, as though the author built up all the questions and possibilities surrounding nuclear war, then closed the story before having to respond to the aftermath.These frustrations aside, \\"The Last Jihad\\" was a quick and easy read, with pertinent political and spiritual points. If you don't have time to dig deep into a Clancy classic, this book will more than ease your appetite."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"From this political columnist I expected a literary but unexciting political novel. I was delighted to find that The Last Jihad really delivered some great action along with the author's insight into high-level politics. If Sadaam had been allowed to keep on his path, this book tells a good story of what might have transpired. The thing that impressed me the most was the dialog--it was believable and made me feel I was reading a true account. I particularly liked the debate between the president and his cabinet, on whether or not to wage a nuclear attack on Iraq. That segment would have been reason enough to read this book.I saw some of the reviews referring to this as a \\"conservative novel,\\" but except for the book's making the president a Republican, I don't think it would strike most readers as a \\"conservative novel.\\" I'd like to think a president of either party would have responded pretty much the same as McPherson in the story.The book certainly got more exciting toward the end as the conflict came to its almost inevitable climax. I bought the sequel, The Last Days, and the newest release, The Ezekial Option, when I was one-third of the way through this book. The minute I closed The Last Jihad I grabbed the next book and am headed back to the couch right now!"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"In this book we enter a world where Iraq launches simultaneous terror attacks against Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the West. In one of the first attacks the president of the U.S.A. is wounded and he enlists a former Wall Street guru Jon Bennett to help broker a peace settlement. But the threat of a desperate nuclear offensive by the rogue state looms. The book is a fast read. It contains violence and some strong language."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"It was engaging and had some degree of suspense but I was trying to relate to real happenings and people and it wasn't coming together for me.I could put it down and I wasn't dying to pick it up again."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I'd read all the Left Behind books and saw Joel Rosenburg one night on Glenn Beck, with Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins talking about Iran and Russia, along with the great war of Gog and Magog.I picked up Rosenburg's first book, \\"The Last Jihad\\" and to tell you the truth, I couldn't put it down. My wife got irritated yesterday because I was drawn into the book's twenty or thirty page climax. The storyline sets up for the climax early on, which pulls you on to the last page. We all know what became of Iraq's dictator, Saddam Hussein, but this fictional story had much to offer. I look forward to reading more from Joel Rosenburg in the near future. By the way, this edition has a good sample of Joel's non-fiction book \\"Epicenter\\" at the end, that further explains some of the plot fueling this story (no pun intended)."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Mr. Rosenberg did okay in his first effort. While many aspects of the plot and action are implausible, the overall story is a good one. The entertainment value is high, and, after all, that is why most of us read fiction.His next book should be much better. One easy correction he can make is in describing radio procedure. Mr. Rosenberg frequently says, \\"Station One calling Station Two,\\" when, in fact, the name of the party being called should always be transmitted first, as in, \\"Station Two, this is Station One.\\""},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Rosenberg continues to amaze me by his ability to make it seem that you are in the center of the action. The Last Jihad is an exciting page turner with believable characters and End Times scenarios based on current events from a Biblical perspective. I would recommend The Last Jihad to anyone."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I will recommend this book to my friends - its well written, the story line is great and above all It incorporated strong faith on the part of the main characters. Joel Rosenberg is on my list of favorite authors. Thank you."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Just couldn't put it down. Rosenberg does a great job of creating a well thought out and in-depth political novel. This book has everything: An engaging plot, military details, secret service and FBI/CIA intrigue, flirtation with romance - all the while there flows this undercurrent of choices, morality and character. People sacrifice their lives to protect their president, their president sacrifices for the good of the American people and individuals sacrifice their lofty personal ambitions for the greater good of the U.S. and world peace.I really enjoyed how Rosenberg also used a Christian/monotheistic worldview to move this entire story along. It is not a theme until the end - when you realize that the reasons some of these decisions have been made have been because of the deeper faith possessed by some of the main players. Not to be too one-dimensional, Rosenberg's main character Jon Bennett does not possess the same faith, but like so many American's, does possess the same morality, loyalty and ethics.I also think Rosenberg does a wonderful job of looking at the future and the way technology can effect world events. Set in 2010, the surveillance and instant communications make for cool reading.If you can remember that this is fiction and that Saddam is captured and that Uday and Qusay (sp?) are dead - you will really enjoy this book. One final note: This book ends and leads directly into the sequel - so you might want to buy The Last Days at the same time."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I thought I was reading the news headlines that were already in print. I couldn't believe the book was written before the Iraq war. It was fast paced and an exciting book to read. I'm not a voracious reader but I really enjoyed the book and devoured it in 2 days. I could put the book down but only for a few minutes. It drove me crazy that I had to stop reading it the times I did stop. It very authentic in that Joel used authentic sources like drudge report and so forth. It made it feel a little more real. Well, I enjoyed it thoroughly. Read it for yourself."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I was immidiately sucked in by the beginning of the novel, which has all the intensity of a major Hollywood action picture. Unfortunately, the author cannot sustain the intensity and the ups and downs seem random. Most characters, while not flat, do not have real depth to them either.I was also thrown by several factual errors:* Hussein's sons were not killed in 1996, though this may have been deliberate choice by the author. In that case, it seems strange since it's thrown in as a background filler and does not play a major role in the book.* It's impossible for image enhancing goggles to magnify light enough to \\"burn through their retinas\\".* Israelis may speak in English with a thick accent - but hardly when they speak to each other in Hebrew."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"The book is obviously written quickly to beat the real time clock ticking over our current difficulties and impending war with Iraq. Therefore, some of the dialog is strained and hard to believe. The premise of the book is interesting and the pace is very quick, making it an easy and enjoyable book to read. It certainly is not the best book on the shelves and in a couple of years it will not be very relevant, but considering the timing and the ties to current events, it was a good read. Rosenberg obviously needs to develop his style a bit if he is to continue writing novels but he obviously has some knowledge and sources in and about government that gives his work realism. I would recommend this book if you read it NOW, before the real war starts."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This book is riddled with leaps in plot elements that require the reader to stretch the imagination beyond what should be neccessary in a &quot;well crafted&quot; novel. I also am appalled at the lack of research on Mr.Rosenberg's part. For instance, Rosenberg has F-111 fighter bombers screeming all over Iraq. Even a casual bit of research would have revealed that the last of the F-111s were mothballed in 1996. There are other errors such as when a federal agent uses a Smith and Wesson REVOLVER chambered in .45 ACP. Again, a bit of easy research would have revealed that in order to use .45 ACP rounds in a revolver requires the use of cumbersome half-moon clips- something I doubt any agent/officer would use. Mr. Rosenberg is no Tom Clancy! I'm sure Mr. Clancy must have cringed when he saw this bit of literary junk being compared to his body of work."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Joel has written four novels from his political and theological experience which are superb. I have read the \\"Last Jihad\\", the \\"Last Days\\", the \\"Eziekel Option\\", and the \\"Copper Scroll\\" and would highly recommend them for entertainment or to understand the current problems in the Middle East. He bases his work on 1000's of years old prophecies found in the book of Ezekiel in the Bible. The books reveal how it could unfold and come true. His writings have helped me understand Ezekiel better. Joel's style of writing could be comapred to a cross of Tom Clancy and Tim LaHaye."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"It will take a national fixation on this terrorism problem to obtain the results proposed by this book. Unfortunately, thanks to reckless left-leaning politicians, the dedication required to achieve results is what makes this book largely fiction."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Another great book using religious texts to provide wonderful insight into what may be going on in the world. Many of the fictional events have become actual reality!"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"A good read. But the best part is it's clean! Don't have to skip the vulgar language. That's important to me."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"It is disappointing to see so many \\"politicized\\" reviews of this book. A story should be able to stand on its own whether you are a conservative or a liberal. In \\"The Last Jihad\\", Rosenberg starts with an interesting premise about Saddam Hussein exporting terror with the help of some nefarious players. Unfortunately he fails to develop his characters enough that we actually care much about them. The lead character, Jon Bennett, is a Wall Street wunderkind recruited by his former boss, now the President of the United States. We learn a little about his formative years, and then about a few strategic moves he has used to lead his company to investment gold. As the story progresses, Jon experiences a transformation as he begins to understand why some people would lay down their life in the name of the country they love. Unfortunately, this seems to be the only reason I felt any compassion for this character.Other flaws include the military scenes depicting the use of the F-111 and the F-14 several years after they have been retired from the U.S. inventory and a Seahawk helicopter carrying a SEAL team and a NEST team (max passengers on a HH-60H is 8 with the 50 cal removed). The ultimatum issued by the Israelis to the President seems far-fetched as well.Overall I gave this book three stars. It was interesting enough to keep my interested, but flawed enough not to recommend it to others, at least not without a warning first."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Once this story got rolling, I couldn't put it down! The first four chapters have a lot of character background mixed in with the adventure, but after that you fly through this high energy, somewhat \\"intellectual\\" action thriller. The writer is obviously very educated on everything from foreign policy to politics to wall street to end times prophecy, so even the highly educated reader will be intrigued by the story, yet enough action to keep any reader on the edge of his or her seat."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"While I will admit the writing isn't the best, the story at times stretches its plausibility, and it is a little dated, this book is a thrill ride from start to finish. If you like action and political intrigue, you'll love this book. It is a lot of fun. I could barely put it down. Jumping from scene to scene without long winded chapters, it kept my attention. How can you not be kept riveted by a book that starts with an assassination attempt on the United States President, then keeps getting better. I wonder who will star and direct this movie, given that it begs to be made."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"With all the scare of terrorism today, it seemed very real and frightening. It was never boring, keeps you turning the page to find out what happens. Characters were slightly dry, but only slightly. I didn't feel I got to know them as well as I would of liked. I also recommend the sequel, &quot;The Last Days&quot;."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This is the best book that I've read. I'm not a big reader, but I was drawn into the book from the very beginning. I couldn't put it down literally. After picking it up and reading it that evening I took it to work and read it between calls. I even found myself readining it while stuck in rush hour traffic going home, and then finished it that evening.Someone has to buy the movie rights for this book! This is an absolute must buy!"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This is an excellent book. Better than Tom Clancy and Robert Ludlam in that it motors along. Most of the plot is quite plausible. Espeically the part linking IRAQ to terroists.PS....The other reviewer who posted a there is no Iraq Terrorist link is delusional."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"One of the most timely books published recently concerns an assassination attempt on the US President by Middle Eastern terrorists sent by Saddam Hussein. The fear is that Saddam has the bomb and, in a last desperate move, wants to use it against either the US or Israel. The result could be a nuclear holocaust. The President tags his friend, Wall Street wonder, Jon Bennett to be part of a negotiating team sent to Israel to get them to hold off on attacking Iraq after a provocative incident. Much is at stake including millions of lives.Joel C. Rosenberg's debut novel sets into motion a nightmare scenario which is, unfortunately, all too probable. It is the realism of the situation that is the major strength of this work. In the initial part of the book, the author shows himself to be a skilled novelist in terms of setting up a deadly situation and pacing the reader through it in such a way as to maximize suspense and virtually keep the pages flying. However, in the second half, the plot, the characters and the situation are a bit too over the top requiring some major suspension of belief in reality. It, overall, paints a bleak picture of the Iraq crisis. Let's hope this remains only a part of the fertile imagination of this political strategist and debut author."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This book was excellent! Once I began reading, I could not put it down! It arouses suspense, anger, worry, relief, and many other emotions. It also represents what the author believes would happen in a future world with Saddam Hussein still in power! I would strongly recommend this book to every human being!"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I was browsing through my local library and booked this up intrigued by the title. I LOVED it!!!! Rosenberg ranks right up there with Vince Flynn and Tom Clancy. He has a real talent and I anxiously await the sequel. I hope it is longer because I was soooo disapointed when this one ended so \\"soon\\". I was very impressed with the subtle christian ideas. They were not overly powerful but enought that a non-beliver would want to investigate more. I thought it was great that it was not in the \\"Christian Fiction\\" section of the library so that non-belivers might be more inclined to read it. Once again a great read for all people."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"As I read through this novel about a confrontation with Saddam, I had a hard time separating the fiction of this tale with the truths we all are faced with at this time in history. This is well written with a fast paced unfolding of a possible nuclear exchange that keeps you turning the pages. The eerie aspect of this book, and what you keep saying to yourself is \\"man! This could REALLY happen.\\". I think that more time developing the characters would have been nice. It would have also been nice to go longer than it did. Things seemed to develop so quickly (this isn't a complaint about the book per se, as much as it is a disappointment that it was so short).For those of you that did not have the opportunity to hear Joel's interview on Rush's show may be encouraged to know that he eluded to the possibility that he may continue the story in a future novel. This would be wonderful, given the fact that the story built up for quite a while before coming to an abrupt ending.Do yourself a favor and pick up this timely book. You will enjoy it, I'm sure."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This is a book which you will hate to put down. And when you reach the last page you are hoping that the author is hard at work on a sequel. As timely as today's headlines and as serious as a heart attack, Joel Rosenberg, has spun a plausable, scary and disconcerting look into the near future. Whether he has a crystal ball or is merely a talented writer is for the coming days to reveal. Regardless, this is a serious book which you need to read."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I read The Last Jihad in three sittings. Rosenberg's speculation of what would happen if Saddam is left unchecked is, in my mind, plausible. It's especially interesting considering that we're headed for deposing Saddam.Yes, this novel has a Christian/conservative bent, but is that so bad? There's no profanity, no gratuitous sex, and the President prays. The Christians aren't buffoons, shrinking violets, or morally bankrupt hypocrites as they are often portrayed.I had three problems stylistically with Rosenberg's writing. I'd like it if he'd lay off the name brands. Instead of \\"he picked up his cell phone,\\" it's \\"he picked up his new Motorola C4100 cell phone.\\" Once or twice, OK, but man....Secondly, enough with the food already. I don't have to know every course of every meal. I had the feeling the author is fat.Thirdly, the text is interspersed with some pretty disturbingly bad similes; \\"he spoke in a accent as thick as his mustache.\\" I don't know if he was going for tongue in cheek, but if he was, it was inconsistent with the feel of the rest of the text.Still, a worthwhile read. I hope he writes more because the pace of the story was good, and the action kept me reading. I just hope that his editors offer a little more guidance with the above mentioned problems; they shouldn't have let it go out like that, but then again, maybe they didn't have the time; they wanted to quickly get it out before Saddam is gone. After all, if he ain't there, this story is lost."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This book is a truly edge-of-your-seat thriller that you won't be able to put down. Rosenberg keeps you reading and could teach Clancy a thing or two about suspence. This book also presents a necessary warning about the danger facing the world if Saddam Hussein is not stopped now. A timely reminder that war with Iraq is certainly necessary to put down the threat Saddam poses to our nation's and the world's security."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I'll get this out of the way first: the single greatest distraction to THE LAST JIHAD is the fact that, in large sections of the prose, it is written just a touch too cinematically. You can read whole sections and see passages heavily influenced by the films of the Tom Clancy novels, the James Bond adventures, and even Fox Television's stellar action suspense series '24.' That's not to say that it's a bad thing ... I just found it occasionally distracting.However, THE LAST JIHAD deals with a real world scenario, real world characters, and real dangerous potential exploring an incredible \\"what if?\\" scenario in the Middle East. The prose is crisp and clean and reads like bullets off the page (I read it in three sittings), and the author quickly establishes premises that all support the main flow of the plot.While a couple of characters do come of two-dimensional, it's one adventurous tale that ends demanding a follow-up, and here's one enthusiastic reader looking forward to \\"THE REALLY LAST JIHAD.\\""},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Timely certainly does fit this book. Some of the scenes in the story could be right off the headlines of todays newspapers. The characters are fresh and for the most part believable and the pace of the story is breathtaking, at least through the first half of the book. I do have problems with the premise that only an Israeli/Arab coalition against Iraq can save the United States. Has our military dry rotted to the point that our survival rests on two factions that are bitter enemies? The author has spent so much time making this book work, making it seem real that such a faulty assumption seems laughable. However, it is a worthwhile read but it doesn't live up to Limbaugh's review."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This is a well written book which, in essence, goes nowhere.From a dramatic perspective it might have worked better had the author started at the end and ended at the beginning."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Joel Rosenberg has an uncanny way of writing a book and seeing it come true in short order! Perhaps God is using him to warn us? I don't know but his books are excellent."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"To sum the book up, it was an OK novel. But the reason that I gave it 3 stars was because of the use of blatant product placements throughout the novel. I am not sure if advertisers pay authors to include their products into books but I am convinced that is exactly what happened in The Last Jihad. The product placement's became so obvious that I actually went through the 1st chapter with a highlighter and marked all the product placements that I could find. I think I highlighted at least 30. Some of them are painfully obvious. The only things missing were the Trademark emblems."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"OK, would someone please explain to me the logic behind the opening sequence where an Iraqi terrorist tries to assasinate the president in probably the most difficult way imaginable... flying a plane into a moving car!!! The whole time I'm reading it I'm thinking &quot;how about just stopping the car and letting the plane fly on by?&quot; It's not like the plane can slam on the brakes and turn on a dime. Surely the terrorists could think of easier ways to do it if they tried. This soured me against the book somewhat from the beginning, but I decided not to give up on it. The rest of the novel was entertaining and engaging and worth the read, fortunately. The emphasis on Iraq as a terrorist state is perhaps misplaced, as there are other places in the world which have a much stronger record of terrorism. To me at times it almost seemed like anti-Iraqi propaganda to buttress the argument for invading Iraq. I am pro-Bush and glad to see Saddam gone, believe me, but this aspect of the story still didn't sit quite right. Nevertheless, I recommend the novel if you're looking for a good action story."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This book is awesome. It is not something I would normally read, but heard it was a good way to get an understanding of what is going on in IRAQ. This book is a must.... if you want to know what is going on. It reads so well you can't put it down !! Be prepared to drop everything, you'll want to finish the book !!"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Mr. Rosenberg has put together a believable scenario regarding a big \\"what if\\". The story being, what if America lets Saddam roam free in his own land building weapons of mass destruction. For the complexity that this situation would bring, the book is very short and lacking in many key areas.The biggest area is character development. He introduces some very colorful characters, but leaves the reader wondering about their backgrounds and motivations. One example is of the \\"Four Horseman\\". They turn out to be a integral part of the story, but why? Other than the fact that they are the most wanted terrorists in the world, but for what? Why are they so evil? What have they done and why should they be tracked more than others? Another is the traitor in the Presidents ranks. The background on his \\"backstabbing\\" of not just the President but the country as well, deserves more than just the few pages it took up.My other big problem with the story, was why is John Bennett the main character? Other than him being an economic genious, he has no political background to broker such an important deal in the middle of a nuclear crisis. I can see Mr. Rosenberg working this angle, but it does not work for me.There are some great parts to the book too. The airport scene involving Bennett is great as is the war room scenes with the President, etc. The opening attack is also very good.Overall, an entertaining book that only scratched the surface on what could be a great story (or an unfortunate outcome)."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"The Last Jihad is a wonderful thrilling read about the possibilities that exist for evil inside the United States should fail to eliminate the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. Overall, the premise is completely believable in the aftermath of September 11th. There is only one stretch that Rosenberg takes in the book, and even that one is believable in a post September 11th environment where \\"sleeper agent\\" has been forced to become part of our vocabulary.The only major problem with Rosenberg's book is that he writes like a journalist, not a novelist, and also is in need of a better editor. Many of his sentences are too short and clipped of the type that a journalist or public relations writer would write. They are not those of a novelist. However, he will hopefully improve upon that in future novels. There are also numerous strangely constructed sentences that rely on \\"and\\" multiple times in the same sentence. There's also a few grammatical mistakes in the book, obviously overlooked by the editors. A more thorough editor would have made this book a much better read."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"THE LAST JIHAD is a fabulous novel. Wow!

Get this one for sure."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Don't make the mistake I made of starting this book in bed with the intention of reading a few pages then falling off in sleep. Unlike the Clancy novels this one wastes no time with elaborate background and character building before grabbing your undivided attention. I had to force myself to stop reading it after being jolted wide awake in order to work the next day. I finished it the next day after work in one sitting. Fortunately it was Friday. The story puts you right inside of government power as Clancy does, and creates characters who are real without becoming tedious. The background is clearly and concisely presented far more efficiently than in a Clancy novel. The subject matter is so current and plausible as a war game scenario that it becomes a continuation of the Clancy tradition but much leaner and efficient. I have been wanting a Clancy novel which deals with our current war and here it is without taking up a week to read."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I read this book in one day and found it an excellent read. It is not something you will want to put down."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"The author has a good idea in mind when writing this novel. The book fast forwards the world 10 years of the aftermath of September 11, 2001 and how Iraq is making an all out effort to destroy the United States once and for all.However, this story is highly improbable because he paints Hussein and his top officials as religious fanatics. Hussein was not, nor will he ever be, a religious fanatic.Also, his protagonist, Jonathan Bennett, had such a limited role in this book, you couldn't help but wonder why so much time was devoted to him.This book obviously had a very pro-Israel slant and the author was way too preachy throughout most of it."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"If you're looking for an unlikely story populated with Saturday morning cartoon hero and villain stereotypes, &quot;The Last Jihad&quot; fills the bill. It lurches along a crude, poorly researched plot-line that culminates in well-telegraphed, brutish wish fulfillment. It's an unending drone of inane situations and dialog punctuated with so many product placements that you'll have to check the cover to be sure you didn't pick up a Sharper Image catalog by mistake. It's a howler right down there with Plan 9 from outer space."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"One only has to look at the publishing date for this novel to realize it's ultimate goal: give reason for a U.S. invasion for Iraq. Probably the best scene to illustrate this is the \\"first-strike\\" discussion where the aides to the President debate their lack of action of taking out Saddam when they had the chance. Because of this inaction, Saddam has orchestrated a world wide strike against American Allies in the Gulf and Western Powers. The opening of the novel reads well and flows evenly with good descriptions of the action. The middle of the book does drag on and on as there is endless \\"debates\\" about how short sighted we have been in the past about not realizing how powerful Saddam was. The second half does pick up to the tempo of the opening and shows that the author has the ability to entertain when he isn't trying to push and RNC agenda on the reader.Character development is disappointing though, mainly we get little tidbits here and there but nothing that allows to develop a concern for the characters when situations arise. Overall the book is decent weekend read but it won't stick with you in the long run."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This book is an excellent read! Highly recommended & entertaining! I read the book in less than 2 days and have read it twice! I recommend all of Joel Rosenberg's books, he is an excellent author!"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"The initial allure of this doomsday thriller, the way it builds a diabolical plot around real public figures and political conflicts, turns out to be its major weakness. Set in the year 2010 during the presidency of Bush's successor, the novel dazzles the reader at first with its compelling characters, knowledge of the president's inner circle, and descriptions of military hardware and geopolitical events. But like Rosenberg's protagonist Jon Bennett, who prides himself on his ability to foresee future trends, the author makes bold and unnecessary predictions about the war on terror and the situation in Iraq, many of which were almost immediately overcome by real world events. These false predictions, which could have been avoided by populating his novel with fictitious villians, end up sacrificing what might have been a powerful story in order to further Rosenberg's thinly-veiled political agenda.Another problem with the novel is the bumpiness of the plotting after the first few chapters. Instead of allowing the reader to witness these shocking events through the eyes of his core characters, Rosenberg jumps from scene to scene and viewpoint to viewpoint every few paragraphs or less. While this keeps the attention deficit types turning pages, it also renders the story telling more impersonal and disjointed than it could have been.And then there's the ending, which I can only liken to the sensation of rounding a sharp turn in the road and driving off a cliff. No time for reflection. No tying up of loose ends. Just a big unfulfilling void."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"In one scene, the President of the United States of America, in Washington, is watching a real-time infrared camera feed of a house in Israel via satellite and using that information to communicate to a secret agent where he needs to go. If that sounds plausible to you, then this book is for you. You'll probably also love the fact that the book's only black character is a man who goes by the name of Frank Oakland.I'd mention the myriad twists and turns that make this book almost vomit-inducing in its disgusting, naive portrayals of American politics, the middle east and foreign policy; I would but after reading it I took the book back to the store and insisted on a refund."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"If you like reading pages upon pages (and I am not dealing in hyperbole here...) of details about what the characters in the stories are eating, then this book is for you! I won't even go into politics here... but this book is one of the worst I have ever read. Ever. I have read hundreds of books in my lifetime, and this is one of only 2 or 3 that I have left unfinished. I made it until about 20 pages from the end, and even at that point I had no interest in either the characters or the conclusion of the story. Monumentally bad. Congrats! This author couldn't have sent this to his publisher with a straight face."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This book is silly. Any parallels to Tom Clancy are seriously misgiven. &quot;The Last Jihad&quot; attempts to be a political thriller on a global scale, but lacks character development, and suffers from a very predictable plot. It appears that the author rushed through writing and publishing this book, to take advantage of American anger following the 9/11 attacks. I was very disappointed with this novel."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I've spent the last few years working on in-vehicle navigation systems; it was new to me that GPS receivers actually transmit back and can be traced, or that anyone has actually digital maps of Iraq in a commercial product...The rest of the book is just as bad.

Absolutely riveting in detail and characters. Joel has seamlessly intertwined the past with the future, especially in the characters speech. One example that jumped out at me was when the VP in the book casually throws out the comment \\"Big time\\". I howled with laughter. I have not quite finished with it yet and this is my first attempt at a review but that is how much I really love this book. Hopefully the first complete sentence on the third page of text will be found out in the near future to be fact.This is a must buy for anyone addicted to the thriller genre!"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Okay, for starters, let me give you some reasons why you SHOULDN'T read this novel. If you don't enjoy a thrilling action/adventure/spy/secret agent/geopolitical thriller, walk away now! If you are a liberal who thinks the problems in the Middle East can be solved by negotiation with radical Islamic Jihadists, walk away! And if you don't think the Bible can possibly have anything to say about our world and the events occurring all around us, then you leave too! But if this sparks your curiosity, then pick up this or any other Joel C. Rosenberg book you can find and prepare to read for about five hours straight until you finish it! When you combine killer plot, an excellent sense for pacing and character development, and a heart for Biblical prophecy as Mr. Rosenberg has done, you cannot go wrong! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"From the opening scene until the final pages of this well-written novel, I was hooked.

Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"The Last Jihad is a political thriller set a few years into the future and revolves around the now fictional possibility of what could have happened during President MacPherson's presidency had the re-elected President Bush pulled out of Iraq before Saddam Hussein was captured. Now, in2010, Saddam attempts to assassinate the President of the United States, along with the leaders of England, France, and Saudi Arabia. Then Israel foils an attempted SCUD launch pointed at Tel Aviv. MacPherson then sends one of his senior advisors (Jon Bennett), a CIA operative (Erin McCoy), and an FBI agent (Deek Black) to Israel to attempt to convince them not to nuke Iraq. But before they reach Prime Minister Doron, terrorists again attack them.The book is and excellent combination of action and explanation, while still keeping the events potentially real. The book did get confusing due to the large number of characters, but it's not enough to deter a person from reading the book. It does leave you hanging at the end, but it is continued in the sequel: The Last Days, another excellent book by Joel C. Rosenberg. The Last Jihad is an overall excellent book and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for amore realistic fictional novel."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"The best book I have read in years!

If you like Clancy, you will love Rosenberg. I could not put it down and can hardly wait for the next installment. It slowed down a bit in the middle, but well worth it at the end. Hopefully the author does not know something we do not know because the plot is eerily current."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Not too long ago on C-Span's weekend program, Book TV, Joel C. Rosenberg stated that he was an evangelical Christian from a Jewish background and that he was a Republican. Immediately thereafter, reviews of his book \\"The Last Jihad\\" started claiming that this book was nothing more than \\"Jews For Jesus\\" propaganda.This is entirely wrong. A count of the references to \\"God\\" or \\"Jesus\\" is infinitesimal, less than last week's soap opera \\"Passions\\". Although one of Rosenberg's characters is an committed Christian, another promoted the viewpoints of the Progressive Democratic Association. True, there were three references to Biblical verses but none were out of context or put in to proselytize. All in all, I see the detractors of this book were just attempting to put forth their own agendas, perhaps without having read the book.In his writing style for this type of novel, Rosenberg is masterful. All of his sentences are concise, pristine and in no way does one ever have to double back to understand what he was saying. His style is that of Tom Clancy in which the action is tracked by jumping back and forth between various characters to show what's happening to each of them in the same moment of time. He does this sometimes with expanded scenes and other times with single paragraph scenes. This way of writing moves the plot along rapidly.Now, as to the story: this book is pure fantasy. Having been written in the year 2000, it does not take into account any of the history since then. Set in 2010, it is based on the premise that Saddam Hussein is still in power in Iraq. He attempts to assassinate the US president and that situation that leads to an invasion in Iraq. There has been some question about Rosenberg being clairvoyant as the assassin's weapon of choice is a hijacked airplane diving into the president's motorcade.It took me some while to get over the fantasy aspect of the plot but once I adjusted my thinking to accept when the book was written and ignored actual historical events since 2000, I found it a good read. I don't quite know why my mind refused to accept the fantasy of the plot for I have no problem accepting the fantasies of W.E.B. Griffin's works - but I did."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Gripping policitical suspense thriller of a Wall Street Strategist suckered into Presidential politics with many surprising insites into Mid-Eastern fanatics (some a little shallow, but fun: &quot;the 70 virgins awaiting him by Allah's side&quot;...). Some histoical Jewish lore sprinkled throughout. Joel Rosenberg could have put a little more effort into portraying Muslim's lack of fear of dying. His bio's serve as a quick way to introduce or strengthen a character's motives, but then they often stagnate. Only the hero matures a little, excruciatingly slowly, but believably so. His spies have no love life.Drawbacks: opening chapter is the worst of Clancy's technobable, strengthened later by far more elegant execution of these toys of war.Strengths: a wonderful economic and political thriller unfolding a too real picture of how the world an markets would react to the next 9/11. Excellent rationale, with a nice clash of leadership styles, quite realistic for Washington DC. It's more elegantly strung together than Daniel Silva's &quot;The English Assassin,&quot; which had similiar Holocaust ties. Almost as good as &quot;Chasing the Dime,&quot; (Michael Connelly) - but gravitates instead to the Washington/NYSE power plays. The unfolding drama is reminisent historically of the Cuban missile crisis."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This is the only way this country ever wins another war. This is why America will probably never win another war. It is sad but true. The dialogue between the Secretary of State and the President on pages 248-249 will go down in history as why America will never again win a war. We are hamstrung by our own internal disgust for ourselves and we lash out at Americans before we lash out at people who murder and target innocents. For America not to attack mosques because they are a 'religious' place is absolutely pathetic. When Al-Sadr and his followers were hiding in that mosque and massing weapons and bomb making material, we should have sent in about 4 daisy-cutters to get rid of them...instead, we 'watch' it. How long will the souls of the USS Cole, the African embassies, and September 11th cry out before we avenge them completely? Forever, I am saddened to say.Other than that, the book is riveting. If you like the DaVinci Code, you will love all of Rosenberg'g novels. Cut straight from the politics of our time, he weaves a story; line, hook, and sinker!"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I finally read Joel Rosenberg being prodded by a friend and after seeing him interviewed on FoxNews. Had to see what the hub-bub was all about.Rosenberg is a messianic Jew that has an uncanny ability to merge bible prophecy that has been taught for years and apply it into current events. He obviously has his sources about the inner workings of the military and espioniage abilities of the world's powers.He is also a great writer leaving the reader in suspense as the scene changes around the world. I literally devoured this book and I typically scold myself when I don't study and \\"savor\\" a book while reading it.Rosenberg has a hero that is part James Bond, part Alan Greenspan who happens to mingle with the President. A beautiful woman lurks in the story that is probably a romance waiting to happen. Mixing real people with fictional characters is a little risky but Rosenberg has me hooked for more books, that's for sure.Most of the other reviewers have provided wonderful observations and I can't add much more. Keep in mind that the storyline is fiction. What is scary is that it could be reality."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"It is November and the President of the United States arrives in Denver, Colorado via a motorcade. Simultaneously, a jet chartered by businessmen from Canada is ready to land at Denver International Airport, it fails to respond to directions from the control tower - instead it veers off course to attack the Presidential motorcade. During the chaos that ensues, several secret agents die to save the life of the President, who survives and is taken to a secret location while the Vice President is placed in control of the government. The President regroups with government officials to create counter-offensive strategies against this new global threat of terror. Jon Bennet, a Wall Street Securities analyst and a friend of the President's, had worked for the President during his former life as a CEO, is unexpectedly enlisted to negotiate an oil deal in Israel. Through some quirk of fate, first natural gas deposits were found in Israel, and after that ... oil. This business deal can lead to either world peace or world destruction depending on its success ... Jon Bennet and Erin McCoy, a business partner, are sent together, to Israel, to negotiate a deal for development of the oil reserves on behalf of a company. There are potential sparks of romance during this Israeli visit, as well as other explosive possibilities. Little does the world realize that at the same time, in Iraq, plans for the launch of an Intercontinental Ballistic Missle are underway ... Global events are escalating as &quot;the four horsemen&quot; who belong to a terrorist network have become fully operational, whom the CIA started tracking. World events are beginning to escalate in unexpected ways ... leading to a major potential catastrophe. But can it be prevented???This novel is jam-packed with high energy, fast-paced action that leaves you breathless as you follow each and every word ... hanging on to the edge of your seat, trying to anticipate what happens next ... It is a book you do not want to put down. It is contemporary in characterizations and events. Anyone reading the book can identify with the theme, plot and potential outcomes. The author has a superior, refined writing style making it a very enjoyable reading experience. Erika Borsos (erikab93)"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This was a really good book. It starts out with an attack on POTUS, which is almost successful. What follows is a book full of mystery and intrigue. The assasins had help from the inside, but who? The plot is traced to Iraq, which threatens the world with a nuclear weapon, and it's up to the United States to take care of the problem before Israel does.If I say much more about the plot it would ruin it for those who haven't yet read it. However, it was obviously written before the current war against Iraq, and before U.S. soldiers dispatched Saddam's evil sons to meet their Maker. Therefore, some of the events mentioned in the book won't match recent history.Initially, I was going to only give the book 4 stars because of the somewhat abrupt ending. My comment was going to be: &quot;There had BETTER be a sequel,&quot; because there were so many things left unresolved. BUT, I heard an advertisement last night for, yes, the sequel! I'm looking forward to starting it.This book is definately written from a conservative slant--a hard-core liberal might not enjoy it as much as us conservatives."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Fictional tales can affect real-world politics. Nearly a century ago,Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\" led to the passage of the 1906 Pure Food & Drug Act. Now, Joel Rosenberg's \\"The Last Jihad\\" could realistically push public opinion and the President toward an invasion of Iraq. His cautionary tale warns Americans and Israelis of what horrors could come if we remain inert for another 7-8 years and let Saddam Hussein acquire nuclear weapons. I don't normally finish a book in just a few days, but this one I had trouble putting down. Now I'm afraid it's going to be giving me nightmares for weeks to come. I can't wait to see the film version, which some smart Hollywood studio should acquire the rights to IMMEDIATELY."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I guarantee that if the author had used \\"CNN\\" vs \\"FOX\\", \\"helping the poor\\" vs \\"17% flat tax\\", Democrat vs GOP and \\"Taiwan\\" instead of \\"Israel\\" there would not be a peep about political bias. Readers are so used to the \\"mainstream\\" (LOL) view of the world that anything not following the set formula is immediately suspect. For this reason, many conservative books get undue praise; there is such a lack of diversity in the academic, journalistic and literary world that anything remotely different is seized upon like a drowning man gasping gasping for air.I had never heard of this book before spotting it in the store but I did recognize the author from the WSJ. The story was better than the plot, if you get my drift. I can't quite see Iraq as the mastermind of worldwide plotting although the nuclear stalemate is quite conceivable, particularly with Iran. The idea of round-the-world terrorism is a fact.Criticism: Choppy at times, too many minor characters who appeared, spoke and disappeared. The only one who became \\"real\\" were the hero and the Iraqi spy master. Everyone else - Saddam, Secret Service, President, female lead, terrorists, politicians - were mere fodder for the story. The action was very \\"Clancyesqe\\" with lots of technical weapons descriptions that most people skip but the \\"behind the scenes\\" action and the idea that a nuclear weapon could be used was great. At some point in the future, the US and Israel will have to face a nuclear-armed Iran who is more than willing to aid terrorism - that would be the story to write."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"You can't read just one page.

This book begins to paint a picture--drawn on his real world experience in and around the Middle East, Washington and elsewhere--about why today's events are unfolding and what may be next. Entertaining and thought-provoking! A definite must-read!"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"The \\"Last Jihad\\" is a post 9-11 right wing wet dream. Rosenberg and Cheney could have been bosom buddies. As a 'liberal'... it was hard to take some of the extreme points of view here. But as a reader, as a connoisseur of genre pulp, I have to say that at times this is a pretty good read.If you have seen \\"24\\", the \\"Last Jihad\\" has the same sort of feel. Only instead of Jack Bauer, an operative fighting against the bad guys over a single day, this book has Jon Bennett, a genius financial analyst. Bennett is also friend of the United States president...This story starts off interestingly enough. Shifting focus from one flash point to the next at a brisk pace. It gets bogged down quickly though. Once the 'real' story starts, the lack of character depth and over the top story line sets in. At times it gets a little too winded and overly patriotic. The characters often spout propaganda style inspirational musings that lack credibility as far as conversational communication goes. The action scenes are really good here. When something is happening, the pages move at a clip. When things slow down... they really slow down.What sinks this story past redemption is partly the manner in which history has unfolded. Rosenberg wrote this shortly after 9-11 and before the Iraq war. In this book he set Sadam Hussein up as a mastermind evil bad guy. Seeing as how the guy couldn't find his way out of a hole in the ground, this story lacked a credibility factor when read today.The Iraq angle could still have been swallowed if Rosenberg were on par with someone like Tom Clancy as an author. He is not. No where close. So even though Rosenberg and Clancy tackle the same sort of story, a book like \\"hunt for red october\\" is very readable while \\"Last Jihad\\" is pretty much trash."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"The writing is great in spots, the action spots. But the intrigue and the political patter are almost juvenile. The author's research seems to be good. Maybe I was disappointed because it was published after we got Iraq in hand.

If you can figure out what the main charactor does to advance the story in this book, you are better than I am. Its like the author wrote the thing in a couple of weeks and got all his media buddies to hype it before the war in Iraq starts. Particularly hilarious is the gun battle at the end where everybody is sending messages to each other on their Blackberries while the bullets fly. Right...... And the main charactor gets an email on his, right at a crucial moment in the battle, that tells him his father has died. I laughed right out loud. Hmm. Maybe its a comedy, that would explain a lot.

Apparently Rosenberg was looking for some kickbacks from Coke, M&amp;M's, Blackberries, etcetcetcetc, because they are mentioned AD NAUSEUM. That's about all I came away with after reading this book - commercials. Sure, the plot is remotely engaging, but the characters are a bit flat and the dialogue is laughable at times. I zoomed through it and I suppose that has to do with a fast-paced plot. If you're looking for a book that feels like you're being interrupted for a commercial message every 2 pages, this one might be for you.

I was excited to dive in after hearing the rave reviews from Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, etc., plus the fact that the subject matter is very timely based on current events.It was a very quick read, and for the most part it was an enjoyable read. The author effectively wove a plot that moved along quickly and was laced with suspense. I didn't want to put it down. These positive qualities are weighed down somewhat by two aspects: the strong right-wing bias of the author gets on your nerves at times (now I understand the Hannity/Limbaugh support), and the complete lack of character development that punctuate the story. The characters actually are stupid and superficial. The action is good though, and the scenario depicted is not terribly far-fetched.All and all, a good read that delves frighteningly into the possible outcome if Iraq decides to use weapons of mass destruction.

Rosenberg's characters could not be more cliched, flat and boring. His writing is bland and his pacing is aweful. Rosenberg's descriptions of high-level government officials are completely unbelievable and I was left with the impression that he knew very little about his subject matter -- government and national defense policy. Worst of all, several plot lines and major characters turn out to have no relevance to the ultimate unfolding of the plot. Bennett, for example, who is supposed to be the protagonist, doesn't end up doing anything valuable. For a successful businessman who makes millions, he comes across as rather idiotic -- in addition to stumbling dumbly through the novel without doing anything more than being passively convinced by others to do things, his secretary turns out to be a crack CIA paramilitary, completely unbeknownst to him! In addition, there are several agregious plot flaws, most notably the fact that at the end of the novel, a character with easy access to the president turns out to be an enemy agent -- why didn't this character, who dies trying to kill the president at the end of the novel, not do so right at the beginning? He had the means, motive, and opportunity, but unexplicably chose not to do anything...I hope Rosenberg didn't quit his day job.

Just look at the Oregonian paper in Portland, Oregon and their bigoted slanderous cesspool articles they print to malign Jews and Christians specifically. Can't miss it.

The portrayal of the discussion between the president and his cabinent members over the use of the nuclear option against Iraq is laughable: as if the only options were all-out city busting by using nucs against Baghdad and Tikrit vs. doing nothing. And how would destroying these two cities with nucs have the slightest effect on Saddam's ability to launch nuclear tipped SCUDS deployed and hidden in the western dessert against Israel? Much of the rest of the plot is painfully implausible, and, yes, the character development is extremely thin and stereotyped. There are a few compelling sections (such as the very beginning), and I like most of the conservative political views expressed, but on the whole this book is a massive disappointment. A key strength of the best action books by such authors as Michael Chrichton and Tom Clancy is the author's often impressive knowledge of the technical and scientific details related to their subject matter. This strength is largely lacking from &quot;Last Jihad.&quot; In addition, Clancy and Chrichton are brilliant, gifted fiction writers, while Rosenberg is just average. Believe me, I will never trust a book cover endorsement by Rush or Sean again!"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"A fast paced, page-turner. Great action sequences, believable characters, and an intricate plot make The Last Jihad an excellent thriller. If his next novel is a good we make have another Clancy on our hands.My one critique of the book (and it's a trivial one) is this: in an attempt to keep the novel \\"clean\\", and not use profanity, the author has characters use curse substitutes such as \\"freaking\\". At those moments, when the emotions in the scene run high, the use of these substitutes somehow makes the scene lose credibility. For that split second (when for example a hardened, battle worn intelligence officer is shaking down a possible terrorist in a rage and uses the word \\"freaking\\") the reader is reminded that he's reading a book and is brought out from being totally immersed in a scene.Overall one on the better novels I've read in a long while. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"To say that \\"The Last Jihad\\" is nothing more than a piece of propaganda is perhaps a bit strong. Afterall it is a solid example of the military/political thriller. What disturbs me is the underlying premise of Rosenberg's novel.Set roughly ten years from now Rosenberg depicts a post-9/11 world where the war on terrorism has largely been won but Saddam Hussein remains in power. All is otherwise right with the world when Saddam decides to start causing trouble (for reasons that I will leave for the reader to discover on his or her own). What occurs will have the world teetering on the brink of Armageddon.\\"The Last Jihad\\" is fast paced and heart stopping; from an assassination attempt on a Colorado highway, to a harrowing interrogation in the bowels of an Israeli airport, to tension filled war rooms in the United States and Israel. It reminds me a bit of the sensational Fox TV drama \\"24\\".Where \\"The Last Jihad\\" gives me pause is that it is a full-throated endorsement for going to war with Iraq at a time when our leaders are contemplating just that. For this reason I am tempted to label the work as propaganda. Rosenberg's book as been lauded by such conservative icons as Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity (both of whom provide quotes for the dust jacket) and it is easy to see why as both are in full support of going to war with Iraq NOW. The novel is a cautionary tale of what the author feels would result from a wait and see approach in Iraq. As someone who has his reservations over our current march to war I found the novel compelling, though provoking but not entirely convincing. It should spark plenty of debate.Politics aside if you are looking for a no holds barred, knock down drag out political thriller you can do a lot worse than \\"The Last Jihad\\"."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This book is extremely timely and the subject material is of very current interest. The plot seems more than feasible compared to the usual Hollywood fluff approach in handling current events. I would have liked a little more detail on the demise of bin-Laden, but the main thrust was concerning Iraq and the political machinations necessary on our side to achieve the goals being now espoused by our current administration. The author obviously has an inside track on the political level required to understand how the world works. The plot and characters are well-defined and I reccommend this book to anyone who likes both political intrigue and action-adventure."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Sadly, I bought this book based on Rush Limbaugh's glowing remarks. He obviously didn't read it very closely: I found numerous typographical/grammatical/editing errors. Even though the author shows a lot of knowledge about some of his details, and he makes every effort to put the story in a modern-day context, he is not aware that (for instance) the Strategic Air Command was disbanded and re-named the US Strategic Command in 1992. I was disappointed in his use of EXTREME unrelated detail (i.e. the construction and content of sandwiches). His understanding of how leaders in high places function in crisis mode was disappointing. I've been there and no one gets \\"cutesy\\" in times of stress such as the F-15 pilots striking their target near the end of the story. The reports on the book led me to think we had a new Tom Clancy on the horizon. I'm sorry, but Mr. Rosenberg is no Tom Clancy. His treatment of the story line was totally \\"B\\"-grade and predictable."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"If you enjoy in-your-face right-wing propaganda, this one's for you. Just the reviews on the back cover should tip readers off. Rush Limbaugh loves it, so if you love Rush, you will probably enjoy this. The story line is not bad, though the hero seems implausible, and actually not very admirable. Character development is shallow. The author appears to have technical expertise, which some will find entertaining. I'd rather have my thrillers pure, and undiluted with less than subtle Christian-right rhetoric.Lynn in New Mexico"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I heard Rush drooling over this book on his show (the author is his friend) and because I like Rush I bought the book. Talk about a dull and boring read. Plastic charactors, slow plot development, confusing story line, I almost couldn't finish it. If you have a double digit IQ, this is a must read. If you can walk and talk on your cel at the same time, stick with Tom Clancy. I am very angry at Rush for promoting this garbage, I thought he was above things like that. It spiked to number one in sales after his show, but quickly has dropped to 700. The basement is in sight.."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"You decide. Or better- save your money for something more enjoyable, like a Drano enema.Despite what I'd heard on the radio, this book was not just bad- it was awful. The characters (if you can even call them that) are one dimensional, if that. The writing is clunky and has the subtlety of an infomercial. The dialog would almost be funny, if it wasn't so painful to read. The plot (and my own masochistic stupidity) were the only things that made me finish this mess. And the plot wasn't all that great either.Idealistically, this book will make some people crazy, since it is blatantly conservative, and barely a page goes by without some hideous lecture about why Clinton did everything wrong and Republicans have done eveything right. A fair amount of this I actually AGREE WITH, but it reminds me of the propaganda films you used to see coming out of the Soviet Union in the 50s and 60s, but less clever. And just as offensive.Also, there's some pretty heavy Jesus stuff that pops up from time to time (for no apparent reason). If you this bothers you, run and hide while you still can.Well, I'd like to stay and entertain some more but I've got some periodontal surgery I've been looking forward to. At least I won't have to read the book any more."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I personally have not read this book because I purchased it for my husband who likes historical novels.

WIthout saying anything blatant, Rosenberg made every single Arab character a blindly anti-Semetic extremist, including one who cuts off people's heads without reason with a sword (??) and shoots his comrades in the face. How about some real Arab characters, real humanitarian people, who are not hateful or violent? It makes sense that Rosenberg is a journalist. He is perpetrating the same image forced by the media of Arabs who are murderous and crazy, which doesn't make Rosenberg an imaginative or realistic writer- it makes him an unoriginal propagandist."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I've never read a Rosenberg book before this one but it is so unnecessarily dragged out I could't finish.

I plowed through the entire book quickly, but only because I wanted to be done with it. I found the black and white, two dimensional quality to be simplified to the point of negligence. It is no wonder this book is touted by the radical conservative icons of Fox news. \\"Christians are good and very smart, Muslims are bad and stupid\\". Give me a break. I actually dropped the book into the garbage when I was done. The best thing I can say about it is it gave me insight into the fantasy of the extreme right-wing in America.If you wish to read something with a good deal more depth, I would recommend any of Daniel Silva's novels instead."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"Just a warning that this ISN'T the Joel Rosenberg of _The Sleeping Dragon_ fame. That one also has a non-fantasy book coming soon.On The Last Jihad, I was occasionally swept up in action scenes, but finally disappointed at the mix of characters.

When I opened the box and noticed the Rush Limbaugh blurb on the front cover, my heart sank. Really? I read on anyway.This was a good book; the action fast paced. The dialogue was funny in parts, and it was evident that the author had either access to high levels in the government or had undertaken some incredible research. The author's ability to prognosticate the use of airplanes as weapons (although Tom Clancy had done so before him) and the U.S.'s quest to go after Saddam Hussein, although in this book--surprise!--he does have weapons of mass destruction, is laudatory.If you do not enjoy Tom Clancy-like weapons' descriptions, this novel may contain too much detail for you. I also thought the president's test of loyalty of the protagonist was a little farfetched.Although I could have done without some of the right-wing rhetoric, overall, this is a very good book and I would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"After hearing the author speak i couldn't wait to read his book-it was definitely hard to put down!

Although this book was originally set before 9/11, and is fiction, the events have a strong influence to the reality of 9/11. It will be important for readers to follow the sequence of the series.

It does have some religious undertones, though."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"This first novel is very likely his very best for most readers. The novel was released right at the time of the 9/11 tragedy and the result was that it became an instant best seller because of the timing.It would be difficult to say that this was anything less than an instant classic as it is prophetic! Writers of this genre, including myself , are trying to give the readers a sense of \\" worst case scenario\\" in hopes that these warning deter us from allowing it to happen.We must give Rosenberg credit that he saw 9/11 coming while the rest of the world was blind to it.

Mr. Rosenberg gives readers a great context in which the protagonist, Bennett, is seen as the ideal international deal maker. The tensions in this book come not only from the expected criminal vs. honest citizen roles, but also from the spiritual crises that provoke Mr. Bennett's fear of losing his empire, his wealth, his power.For world peace, for love, and for duty to his country, Mr. Bennett risks everything he spent his life building. What a fantastic story!Some of the quotes are very inciteful:Pg 23--Single, six feet tall, and an obsessive runner, Bennett had wavy dark hair, grayish-green eyes, and rakish good looks. He was, more important in his mind, smart and sharp and rich--in part because he was stealthy.Pg 23--To most he was unknown. To the few who knew him outside his own company, he was underestimated. To those who underestimated him, he was considered unimportant. And this gave him precisely the element of surprise he needed to stay one step ahead of the vicious competition.I really liked this book because it reveals the power of being underestimated.Jay, of Baghdad Believer"},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I had this book recommended to me by a family member is is serving in the USMC.

What Rosenberg does is look at the Bible prophecy's and modern trends and write up a fictionalized account about what may happen soon. He has had the uncanny ability to hit some things right on the head such as terrorists using airplane's in a terror attack (which he wrote of in this book The Last Jihad) The death of Arrofat (in his second Book The Last Days) and much more (the third Book in the series is the Ezekiel Option and the forth is The Copper Scroll. Rosenberg's Books are centered upon His fictionalized cheaters; President James \\"Mac\\" MacPherson, Jon Bennett and Uzi Toting Super Model Looking CIA agent Erin McCoy; and many others. The Last Jihad a very fun read and at the same time educational, You will learn some of the important prophecy's that may soon come to pass."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"I really wanted this book to be good. Based on the hype and the endorsements, I expected Mr. Rosenberg to be the next Tom Clancy. Unfrtunately, this book falls short of the mark.Unlike other genres, the techno thriller/political thriller relies of careful attention to detail. Now everyone makes mistakes, but here are a number of glaring technical errors related to systems, organizations and weapons through out the book. Finally the book is set in a post Bush administration where American weapon technology would be in the next generation. For example the F22 and JSF systems would be operational. National Missile Defense would be in place, and progress on the digital battlefield more advanced - none of this was really considered in the book.The plot is straight forward enough. A coordinated attack against Canada, England, Saudi Arabia and America attempts leadership decapitation. The identified culprit is Saddam Hussein and the race is on to take him out. (Memo to Mr. Rosenberg: Heavy forces cannot be moved strategically overnight.)There is a subplot involving the Four Horsemen (The Four Horsemen are amongst the most feared terrorists in the world), who are tied to an iranian/Russian organization. In the post 9-11 world, I suspect there are standing orders that if you find a bad guy you nail him. I am still trying to figure out why they decided to attack the retired MOSSAD head in Jerusalem.This book does prove that you can write a bestseller without resorting to gutter language or engaging in a meaningless whirlwind romantic subplot. For that I am grateful and I wish more people would take the same tact.The debate over the use of American nuclear weapons is interesting. I fail to see where it was right wing or left wing. I think it accurately reflected the ongoing debate of whether or not the United States can ever employ nuclear weapons as a first strike option. However I would point out, Presidents cannot declare war - that is a congressional perrogative.If you can live with the inaccuracies, then spend an afternoon in a cozy chair."},{"Title":"The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)","review":"The Last Jihad could very well contain tomorrow's headlines. The setting is a few years beyond 2003 and the assumption is that Iraq was not dealt with in 2003. Much of the story centers around the U.S. president and his protection. Insight was given to much behind the scenes activity of such government security agencies as the CIA, FBI and Secret Service. In the background of the story is a \\"solution\\" to the Palestine - Israel problem which involves a massive joint oil venture. The final chapter ends rather abruptly with a nuclear confrontation.

Moving from the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks, through England's War of the Roses, to the Scottish court of King James III, the battles between the Spanish and Moors for southern Spain, the discovery of the New World on board the Santa Maria with Christopher Columbus, and many stories sandwiched in between, the novel is chock full of historical facts, medieval customs and culture. As for \\"terrifying\\"....well, yeah, there's terror. Then add a healthy dose of fantasy, a dab or two of horror, a few bites of vampire, a large spoonful of possession and a handful of black magic and still the description of \\"The Rose Demon's\\" storyline is incomplete.During the destruction of Constantinople, two Hospitaller knights were given an order - a matter of life and death - by Constantine Palaeologus, the last Roman Emperor. The Emperor gave the brothers special keys which would open a hidden chamber in the bowels of the palace. One of the keys would open the contents of the chamber, a casket. They were to destroy what lay within the box. The knights failed in their task and thus evil, of such a nature previously unknown to man, was unleashed upon the world. If Lucifer, the fallen angel, is the Devil...then he is also \\"brother and soulmate, great friend and comrade-in-in-arms\\" to the Rosifer, who also fell from grace.In the small English village of Sutton-Courtney, in 1471, seven year-old Matthias Fitzosbert was visiting his beloved friend, a hermit, in his refuge some distance away. Matthias knew that these visits were frowned upon by his parents because of the dangers they entailed, including crossing a ghost town and a dangerous forest. But the danger and his parents' wrath were worth risking because the hermit was his only friend and so kind. Matthias found him painting a luminescent rose on the wall of the desecrated church where he lived. Underneath the rose the hermit had carved strange runes. Thus Matthias began his conflicted relationship with Rosifer, the Rose Demon - a relationship which was to last all the years of his life.I highly recommend \\"The Rose Demon,\\" especially for those who are not afraid of the dark.

He emphasizes the need for response speed and short-term - as well as long-term - planning, since this new environment changes so quickly as to render the future unpredictable. He outlines techniques for getting buzz, which is now a critical element in effective branding. However, this book cannot help but be affected by the dot-com downfall: Many of its examples refer to now defunct companies, or to those who are in deep trouble (and may well be deceased by the time you read this review). Still, if you overlook the problems that come from writing during the Internet reality-warp, we [...] recommend this executive guide for its solid PR strategies, which although geared for a high-tech world, are firmly rooted in traditional method."},{"Title":"Winning PR in the Wired World: Powerful Communications Strategies for the Noisy Digital Space","review":"I purchased this book because of Don Middleberg's good reputation in the PR field. Put simply, it would be an understatement to say that this book is terrible. Three main reasons for my drawing this conclusion: 1. outdated anecdotes and examples to illustrate ideas, 2. the thrust of the book (i.e., what value you get out of it when finished) is bland and generic at best, and 3. poor writing.

While they're quite useful, I found Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired to be more effective.That said, Middleberg's work has plenty of useful ideas.

The Lilly Endowment funded Paul Wilkes, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, to study the attributes of Protestant congregations or Roman Catholic Parishes that lead to excellence. One result was this guidebook to 300 Protestant congregations. His criteria does seem to define what I couldn't have put into words myself. As I have moved around the country, I have noted that some congregations cause the Holy Spirit to stir within you as soon as you meet your first member. This book describes what these unique congregations do to reach out to others and share this knowledge of the Lord. He describes the joy the members experience as they live out their Christian lives as members of these dynamic communities. This would be a great resource for anyone looking to either find a congregation to call home or to get ideas for their current congregation."},{"Title":"Excellent Protestant Congregations: The Guide to Best Places and Practices","review":"Buy the book! The Index of Excellent Congregations contained in the book is worth the price. It provides an excellent beginning point for discovering mentoring congregations throughout the United States.Beg congregational leaders to study the best practices represented by these congregations. Urge congregational leaders to at least visit the web sites of some of the congregations. Organize a journey to visit one or more of these congregations.Paul Wilkes, with the sponsorship of a Lilly Endowment grant, has been looking for excellent Catholic and Protestant congregations in the United States. He found 300 Catholic parishes and 300 Protestant congregations. A book entitled, Excellent Catholic Parishes, profiles eight parishes, and this book profiles nine congregations.The research team was looking for Protestant churches that impact the lives of people and make a difference in their communities. These congregations are beacons of hope and guidance and examples of what it really means to be a practicing Christian today.Another key point is that they were looking for reproducible models of excellence that would act as a travel guide for the spiritual strategic journey of other congregations. They found many of them!"},{"Title":"Excellent Protestant Congregations: The Guide to Best Places and Practices","review":"_Excellent Protestant Congregations_ is a collection of essays about nine different American Protestant churches that have, in one way or another, been exceptional in their ministry, growth, and development. It follows on the heels of a similar volume about excellent Catholic congregations, but this volume is more various - reflecting the larger variety in American Protestantism. The congregations surveyed range from an urban black Pentecostal church in New Orleans, to a collection of rural Lutheran churches in Southwestern Oklahoma, to a new Generation X church in Charlotte, North Carolina. The book concludes with a list of common traits among excellent congregations, and an index of resources.Good: The author does a good job of bringing out the various aspects of success in each church. He relates the transitions in the church to the experiences in the lives of people that the congregations have touched. The inclusion of testimonies of changed lives is especially helpful for understanding the \\"excellence\\" in each church. The book is also not overly-theoretical. It is easy to understand.Bad: The author seems to acknowledge that it's harder to do a one-size-fits-all volume for Protestants, since Protestant congregations can be so different. The odds are, therefore, that a large portion of the content will have only minimal relevance for many Protestant churchmen and women. That said, it is still interesting reading.Overall: This is a very good book and in spite of the weakness it is well worth the read. The list of common traits at the end is particularly helpful material for pastors and church leaders interested in helping their churches develop ministries and grow.Favorite quote: \\"Scripture has the power to instruct, guide, and inspire. Excellent churches have not lost confidence in the bedrock of God's word. They go to it like the thirsty go to a well. This quality pervades both the churches known for their biblically based approach as well as those not known for this emphasis. These churches are introducing the Bible to a new generation of seekers for whom scripture was not part of their upbringing, showing them that this is the kind of wisdom needed for every part of life.\\"Rating: 4 stars"},{"Title":"Ether-technology: A rational approach to gravity-control","review":"Well, what can I say?The anonymous &quot;Rho Sigma&quot; (come on, it's not that hard to work out) brings us a brilliant compendium of devices and electrogravitic theory. Many of the illustrations within the book have been on a number of T T Brown websites without me even knowing it! The quality is superb, offering a balanced slice of the development of overunity and UFO physics. Anyone else know that one of Brown's electrogravitic motors provided an overunity of over 100,000:1?One or two gripes - why call the Searl Effect Generator an &quot;Ether Vortex Turbine&quot; and then describe them as if they were two separate devices in the foreword and contents of the book? Having met Searl personally, I am pretty sure that he never referred to the SEG as such.These aside, it offers some interesting details about the subject, and would be good for anyone interested in Brown's time spent with Agnew Bahnson too. Don't expect ancient lost secrets or Do-It-Yourself UFO instructions, but a savvy reader with this book will certainly be helped along the way to an understanding of the link between electricity and gravitation.

At least when it comes to the actual whereabouts of Darwin in South America. Thomson's presentation of Darwin's ideas on organic evolution is a bit more foggy, but that matters little as the main focus of the book is to retrace Darwin's anchorages in South America.The read is easy, nicely contrasting today's luxury of modern oceangoing sailboats and Darwin's cramped accomodations in the tiny HMS Beagle over 150 years earlier."},{"Title":"European Politics: A Comparative Introduction","review":"This has to be the worst, most poorly written, and hard to understand textbook I've ever read. There are numerous run-on sentences that make no sense, even when you read them five times. Bale also feels the need to put random exclamation points after some sentences. I have to read this book for a Political Science class in college and I'm afraid I'm not quite learning anything from it. If you are a teacher/professor... please don't make your students read this."},{"Title":"European Politics: A Comparative Introduction","review":"Tim Bale has written the textbook on European politics that was missing. It combines a traditional institutionally based comparative approach with one focusing on key themes and issues. It is well written and lively with many useful boxes and illustrations. It will disappoint those who are looking for a hard and dry systematic review of judiciary powers in the usual 4 or 5 states but is perfect for an introduction to European politics that aims to provide students with an overview of political life, political debates and political institutions in the diverse countries of the new EU."},{"Title":"Ashes To Ashes (Pinnacle True Crime)","review":"This is a competent enough reporting of the crime, heavy on court transcripts as the source for information. But the author never creates much sympathy for the victims, never provides insight into the killer or his victims and, stangely enough, promises to reveal many things that never even get discussed. We keep getting told certain things, like the kid was always trouble, the adoption agency should have provided support, etc, but the claims are never backed up by actual examples or slices of life. For example, if Bob Coulson was such a troubled youngster, why don't we ever get an example of what he did as a child to cause his mother anguish? There is a single example, only, dealt with in a paragraph. We never get to see or even guess what is going on inside his head, what fueled his anger, what created him as such an amoral person. Then there is the matter of the mother's diary. A big deal is made of it, one character even sits down to read it with much fanfare: yet not a single excerpt from it is used! We don't even get a summary of what's in it. There is also a book jacket refernce to the shocking relationship between Bob Coulson and his youngest sister, but other than the sister wanting to stay at his apartment one night the topic is never even dealt with in the book! Instead, it's just a dry re-telling of the facts and observations by peripheral people. It's not that the book needed juicy, tasteless details; what is lacking is insight into the human beings involved in this crime: who they were, the events that shaped them into being who they were, and what was lost when they died."},{"Title":"Ashes To Ashes (Pinnacle True Crime)","review":"This story is based on the horrible murder of 5 members of 1 family. Much of the story apparently is from the journal of the murdered mother Mary Coulson. Perhaps the thing about this book that drove me wild was the inconsistencies in referring to the black sheep son, Bob. He is called Coulson while the rest of the family members are called by their 1st names. Then at other times, he is called Bob. Yes, the author's bias is apparent from the start, but this book needed a stronger editor not only to help pull the story together, but to do some basic proof reading. I also wondered why Bob was seen coming out of his sister's bedroom in the early morning hours."},{"Title":"Ashes To Ashes (Pinnacle True Crime)","review":"First off, I had no previous knowledge of this crime, I decided to read this book because the back cover promised a &quot;shocking diary&quot; kept by Bob Coulsons adoptive mother amongst other things.Well guess what? The diary is mentioned in maybe 2 paragraphs in the whole book. You don't get any insight into the relationships of these people. You only get a quick rundown of the parents. There was a few minor &quot;scandalous&quot; behaviors, like the two sisters getting pregnant before marriage, but other than that, nothing.There was no in depth bio about who Bob Coulson was, nothing about his past, except that he was adopted at a young age. The only reason he killed his family was for the inheritance. I have no doubt that he did this awful crime but i think there was a lot more behind it. Why couldn't the author have dug a little deeper?The book was written horribly, at an extremely fast pace, and there were no &quot;shocking photos&quot;."},{"Title":"Ashes To Ashes (Pinnacle True Crime)","review":"I agree with all the other bad reviews of this book. It is well known that the author of this book is good friends with this \\"so called\\" favorite niece of Mary Coulson. This neice, Linda, never spent much time with the Coulson family & acting as if she was Mary Coulson's favorite niece is a farce. \\"Auntie Mary \\" indeed!!! The fact that this favorite niece would allow slander of the other children is outrageous. No child is perfect. They all disappoint their parents on occasion but to act as if they were all bad or awful for just being normal children is ridiculous! A third of the book discusses the courtship of Otis & Mary Coulson, their long extended background, etc. Nothing to do with the murder case itself. There are some photo's of the coulsons, the crime scene ect, but what's the purpose of the photo of Linda & her husband Tim? Why not picture's of the Mary's Parents or other relatives she speaks of? Seems Linda enjoys the attention in this case & is milking it for everything she can. She didn't know Bob, she barely new him & never spent much time with him. All of this information came either from the niece or straight from court transcripts. This author did no ivestigating of her own. Only what ever Linda told her. This so called favorite niece loves all the attention & will never get enough. What a joke this book is! It took me all of a day & a half to read this trash. I had to pick at least one star. If they had negatives, I'd pick -100."},{"Title":"Ashes To Ashes (Pinnacle True Crime)","review":"The book \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" is an under-developed typical true crime book that we are so used to seeing today.

Since they were unable to have children, they adopted Sarah as a baby and decided to adopt a three year old Robin and four year old Bob. Robin and Bob's young mother had abandoned them to children's services in Corpus Christi, Texas because she wanted to satisfy her boyfriend whose family would not be able to handle a married mother of two. Even estranged, the couple who bore Robin and Bob divorced.Their father remained in Rhode Island where they were born. The young mother never really recovered from her decision. By then it was too late, Bob and Robin spent 8 months in a loving foster home before being adopted by Mary and Otis, both college graduates, and mature to handle the youngsters. Sadly, they would be their greatest challenge. The girls, Robin, and Sarah, had their own troubles including unplanned pregnancies. Sarah's baby boy was put up for adoption before her murder and Robin was expecting a girl with her husband Rick Wentworth.Every Friday night, the family would gather together and eat out or at home as a family ritual. On this Friday the 13th of November in 1992, Bob Coulsen had done the unthinkable. He had murdered not only his parents, his sisters, and brother-in-law for the inheritance of $600,000. It's unimaginable or unthinkable for such a crime in the first place. Then the house was set ablaze as if to destroy the evidence. It was only a coincidence that it happened on Friday the 13th as Jared, the unwilling accomplice, told authorities.He never imagined his idol would carry out such an act of violence. Bob Coulsen had his share of problems but Mary believed that their love could conquer all. She wanted a large family. I doubt that she ever really regreted the adoptions of Bob or Robin. After all, Robin and Sarah turned out fine despite their problems. Bob had problems from the first day. He never got the psychiatric treatment and it is doubtful that he would have changed. Bob wanted an easy life and never having to work again. He wanted the good life. It's just awful that he went to such attempts to get a meager inheritance. His adoptive parents loved him regardless of his mistakes and errors which he never returned his love and affection simply because he doesn't know how too. He killed his parents, his sisters, and his brother-in-law, and unborn niece without emotion. This book was written years ago and I don't know if he is still on death row."},{"Title":"Ashes To Ashes (Pinnacle True Crime)","review":"I cannot express how bad this book is.

Maybe if I had a great professor that actually taught and walked us through the practice problems it wouldn't be so frustrating, but he doesn't, and it makes trying to go through the book EXTREMELY difficult.There are huge gaps in information that show up in assigned problems, which I understand can help reinforce the learning process, but there are books that do it effectively and then there's this piece of crap.The authours of this steaming pile of cow waste leave out important details that can cost a student literally hours in trying to figure out a solution only to discover that the reason for the incorrect answer is because the book failed to mention ANYTHING that might be helpful.I can't relate how many times I went online and actually looked up information in OTHER books that were 1000000 times better than this POS.An example, you ask? On the section on combining independent current sources, it mentions (in about 2 sentences) that current sources should be combined when in parallel. That's fine and dandy, but what it doesn't tell you is that when you're doing ANY PROBLEM where current is in question, you've got to add any current sources BACK in to the answer, depending on where they appear in the circuit, or you'll get garbage as a result.Is this common sense? Sure, I guess, if you've already taken the class and already understand circuit analysis. If you haven't and you don't, the authors apparently decided to leave you up s@#t creek without a paddle after robbing you blind.If you're taking an EE class and see that this is the text, check out the professor before you take it, or you'll be sorry."},{"Title":"Basic Engineering Circuit Analysis","review":"One of the reviews on this page is obviously written by the publisher. The one thing I can't stand about a technical textbook is when graphs or schematics are on one page and the explination is 2 pages later. With this book I find myself spending more time flipping back and forth between the 2 than actually studying. This is just one thing about the book that makes it hard to understand. Oh and one more thing, the &quot;Circuit Works&quot; program which you pay for the use of when you buy the text book either doesn't exist or is being kept hidden purposely, none of my classmates or the instructor has been able to access it. I've emailed the publisher twice to no avail."},{"Title":"Basic Engineering Circuit Analysis","review":"This book was awful. Concepts are confusing, examples are lacking, and most of the homework problems do not represent the material taught in the revelant chapter.This book is terrible in getting across concepts and procedures relating to a variety of problems. One or two examples didn't help me work 20 hw problems, and on top of this the solutions aren't in the back of the book. you have to go on their website to get any supplementary material (which sucks just as bad). It will take forever just to get started on the homework problems because you will have to figure out how it even related to what was read in the chapter."},{"Title":"Basic Engineering Circuit Analysis","review":"Got here way longer then it should have.

The book is poorly laid out, and difficult to follow. Concepts are spread out, and hidden in dense sections of text.

Otherwise I wouldn't have bought this book. I can get better than or as good as this book for quarter of its price. The answer to problems doesn't come with the book (not a SINGLE solution to any of the problems) so there's no way of checking if you're finding a corrent solution to the problem which is most important aspect of learning. SO WATCH OUT BEFORE YOU BUY! (As u know most science books provide a odd number solutions to check the answers to problems and teachers give even number problem for HW) The link on the book promises student problem companion, but I had to purchased it for extra 17.95$ to get it, but very few problems with solutions (5-6 problems per chapter) were offered. In other words I am ripped again. So every moment I use this book I smelled a greed for money. The website for this is confusing and unhelpful and resources that seems useful are priced. In the end I would recomment anything other rather than this book for someone who is serious about studying electronics."},{"Title":"Basic Engineering Circuit Analysis","review":"Like the title itself says, this is an introductory book on Circuit Analysis. In the first year of my engineering graduation, I used this book for the subject of Basic Circuit Analysis and found it to be extremely helpful. I think I can even say that this book made my life a lot easier, since the author - J. David Irwin - did a very good job on explaining concepts and circuit analysis basic methods and laws very clearly.The book is very well structred, objective and and the subjects are easily understandable for the reader with little or none electronic circuit knowledge: every chapter starts with an introduction and a list of helpful topics which the author named &quot;Learning Goals&quot;; then, everytime a new concept/law/method is introduced, the author tests the reader to see if he did comprehend what has been explained to him by presenting him with very basic exercices, &quot;Learning by Doing&quot;; the author also provides the reader with &quot;Learning Hints&quot; on a regular basis, which can be interpreted as algorithms to solve certain problems or simple hints for the reader to do the exercice correctly, avoiding typical mistakes; at last, when a resonable amount of concepts have been introduced, the book features many &quot;Learing Examples&quot; with resolutions (note that resolutions can be of an extreme importance when the reader cannot understand how a certain problem is solved).Basic Engineering Circuit Analysis covers everything that a book of this kind (introductory book) should cover, and even more, all in a clear way: basic concepts (quantities and electrical elements), resistive circuits (where the ohm and kirchhoff's laws are introduced), circuit analysis techniques (nodal and loop analysis), equivalent circuits (superposition, th&eacute;venin and norton's theorems), capacitance and inductance, first and second-order transcient circuits, AC steady-state analysis, magnetically coupled networks, steady-state power analysis, polyphase circuits, variable frequency network performance, the laplace and fourier tranforms (and applications to circuit analysis - e.g. bode diagrams), two-part networks and basic semiconductor circuits (diodes and transistors).In my opinion, this is an excelent book for everyone who wants to study the basics of electrical circuit analysis. I highly recommend it for that purpose."},{"Title":"Basic Engineering Circuit Analysis","review":"the book is very confusing, the author jumps around without any coherent orderelectronics is learned by cumulative knowledge , builing knowledge on top of base knowledge/principles, and more knowledge on top of thatbut the way this book goes, you have to learn it all separately, and then waste your time trying to put it all together into a coherent wholeproblems are useless too"},{"Title":"Basic Engineering Circuit Analysis","review":"I feel like this book was very nicely put together.

Michael Carlebach offers up a comprehensive, wonderfully-illustrated history of tintype photography in WORKING STIFFS, OCCUPATIONAL PORTRAITS IN THE AGE OF TINTYPES, a 2012 Smithsonian Institution Press release.Prior to the tintype process, photography was limited to the upper class and to photographic studios. Tintypes, on the other hand, could be snapped and processed quickly and inexpensively at various locations such as fairs, carnivals and other social gatherings. Consequently, the working classes latched on to tintype photography and laid their money down for family portraits, pix of 'Billy Yank' in his new uniform and what-not.Carlebach's book presents over 80 tintypes highlighting people and their occupations. These images were especially appealing because they included long-gone occupations such as iceman, barrel maker, city storm drain cleaner and, my favorite, skating rescue team. I was also fascinated by the snobbery and criticism engendered by tintypes, such items being regarded as \\"low class\\" and unworthy of \\"true\\" photographers.Having little knowledge of tintypes, I found WORKING STIFFS informative and entertaining. It provided a balanced, insightful overview of the subject and complimented that with delightful images of long-ago workers, anonymous in name yet obviously proud of their trade. Recommended."},{"Title":"Working Stiffs: Occupational Portraits in the Age of Tintypes","review":"This book is worth the purchase for the images alone.

To fully understand his point of view and critics you need to cover the early writings first, so that you won't form a wrong idea what Marxism is about, like most people usually do."},{"Title":"Early writings","review":"This collection of Karl Marx's early writing represents, in my opinion, some of the best material Marx ever wrote. This is a wonderful collection that includes translations of the early Paris Manuscripts from 1844 and Marx's notorious essay \\"On the Jewish Question.\\" Since the latter essay is frequently misunderstood, I'll focus this review on the subject of the Jewish question.In \\"On the Jewish Question,\\" Marx takes issue with Bruno Bauer's assertion that the Jews in Germany during the 19th Century should seek political emancipation and equal rights in Germany by renouncing Judaism. Because Germany was a Christian state during this time, it was Bauer's contention that the Jews could not receive civic and political emancipation as Jews within a Christian state due to two mitigating factors: one, the natural egoism of the Jew, that is, the notion of the Jews as the \\"chosen people\\"; second , the tendency of the Christian state which permitted Jews to isolate themselves from other citizens of the state. In other words, Bauer reveals the contradiction behind the Jewish demand for emancipation in a Christian state. It is theologically inconsistent for the Jews to demand both equal political rights as well as the right to exclude themselves from the rest of the community which takes Christianity as the foundation of the state.Because church and state were not separated in 19th Century Germany, Bauer concludes that the Jews needed to renounce their faith in order to become true citizens. By renouncing religion, Bauer assumes that the secularization of the German state will result, thus allowing for both Jews and Christians to exist equally as citizens politically emancipated from religion.It is Marx's contention that when a state emancipates itself from religion, man remains an egoist. Man does not become a citizen of a realized political \\"state.\\" What Bauer did not understand is that an \\"atheistic\\" state, or a state emancipated from religion, still allows religious belief to exist in the private sphere. Because Bauer was thinking within the confines of a Christian state, he felt that the secularization of the state would be sufficient to accommodate both Jews and Christians as equal citizens of the state. Bauer did not understand that the emancipation of the state from religion would still leave intact religious belief within the realm of civil society.For Marx, true political emancipation involves the recognition of man's \\"species nature\\" as opposed to his egoistic life as it exists in civil society. While bourgeois society purports to distinguish the rights of the citizen (i.e., the general concerns of all people as members of an abstract state) from the rights of man (i.e., the liberty of men to worship and to dispense of their private property as they see fit), Marx claims that such a division acts as a faade for the justification of bourgeois civil society AS the state. It is the rights of man as a bourgeois, not as a citizen, that is considered true and authentic. True human emancipation should liberate man from egoism, not preserve it.For Marx, alienation is overcome only when men recognize their species life, or the fact that, while all men are unique individuals, they remain part of the human whole. In other words, humans do not exist as individual monads apart from others. When egoistic action is valorized by civil society, our view of nature becomes fragmented. This fragmentation results from the objectification of nature as the source of property to be privatized, accumulated, or dispensed of at will. Furthermore, the labor of other men is objectified as capital to be bought and sold regardless of the physical and psychological well-being of the worker. This objectification may be overcome only through the recognition that humans exist in communal activity with others.In the United States today, political egoism runs rampant. Right-wing political cults like Mormonism celebrate greed as divinely sanctioned. Climate change shows the libertarian ideal of the \\"isolated individual\\" able to do his thing without regard to others to be a complete lie. Republicans who preach the \\"divine community\\" of the family are caught with their pants down (literally) in truck stop restrooms pursuing their egoistic sexual needs with strangers. What's even more terrifying is that these people aspire to political control. We should all heed the words of Marx to understand the psychology of these people and do everything we can to keep them from the levers of power."},{"Title":"Early writings","review":"This is a collection of writings from Karl Marx (1818-1883) from the period of 1833-1834, when he had gotten married, and worked for a series of radical newspapers. The works include \\"Critique of Hegel's Doctrine of the State\\"; \\"On the Jewish Question\\"; \\"A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right\\"; \\"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts (1844),\\" and more. The book also contains a 50-page Introduction, which places the works in their historical context.He identifies the task of his time as \\"the ruthless criticism of the existing order\\" (pg. 207). In \\"On the Jewish Question,\\" Marx (whose Jewish parents were secular and assimilated) sarcastically states, \\"Money is the jealous god of Israel,\\" and \\"Exchange is the true god\\" of the Jewish people (Pg. 239). His own atheism is boldly stated: he argues that man makes religion, religion does not make man; religion is \\"the opium of the people\\" (pg. 244), and that atheism is \\"a negation of God, through which negation it asserts the existence of man.\\" (Pg. 357)He states that the right of the landowners \\"can be traced back to robbery.\\" (Pg. 309) He defines communism as the positive supersession of private property as human self-estrangement, and \\"the complete restoration of man to himself as a social... being.\\" (Pg. 348)One of his most famous quotations is included, from \\"Concerning Feuerbach\\": \\"The philosophers have only INTERPRETED the world, in various ways; the point is to CHANGE it.\\" (Pg. 423)While these writings are not a particularly useful \\"Introduction\\" to Marxist thought (theThe Communist Manifestoremains that), they're useful for interested students to want to follow the development of Marx's ideas over time."},{"Title":"Early writings","review":"Part of the function of this compilations inaccessibility, on which other reviewers have commented, is the nature of the translation. For instance, although I have read several translations of \\"On the Jewish Question,\\" I found this translation to be the most difficult.

Excellent choice I believe."},{"Title":"Early writings","review":"As someone who thought he had a relatively good grasp of what Marxist philsophy is comprised of, it came as something of a surprise that this text was so incomprehensible. This was the first actual Marx I have ever set out to read. I believed that _Early Writings_ might a good place to start (you know: start at the beginning, as they say). At any rate, I would encourage someone who is a novice at this sort of thing to start with another book. From the very start I had a difficult time determing exactly what Marx was getting at. The first 200 pages are a refutation to a Hegelian concept of the state. If you are not familiar with the writings and ideas of Hegel, you will not want to read that particular work. The second half of the book is more approachable, but not what I would term &quot;accessible&quot; by any means. I would recommend this only to people that already have extensive knowledge of Marx's terminology and belief systems. Without this prerequisite, you might as well be reading Latin."},{"Title":"Early writings","review":"This book gives the reading a kind of &quot;before they were stars&quot; approach.

Shaking her head at the Bakker/Swaggart/Roberts scandals, she said, \\"The devil really won that round.\\"\\"How do you know it was the devil that brought them down?\\" I asked. \\"I have the impression that maybe God had had about enough of their shenaningans.\\"But that's about the extent of my stone-throwing. I end up feeling pity for these people. And feeling horrible for the millions who poured their millions into these lavish lifestyles. My great grandmother could have been referred to as one of Bakker's \\"Granny Grunts,\\" the elderly ladies he always beseeched to fess up with the cash.I could see through Bakker even as a kid and felt sorry that my great grandma couldn't. If anything, I think the PTL scandal made her realize where her real devotion should have been: on the savior mentioned in every PTL sales pitch, not the bawling, over-dressed con artists pleading for dollars for that big water slide in their amusement park.Charles Shepard, the author and reporter for the Charlotte Observer, was the perfect person to write this book: he'd been covering Bakker for years and seeing scams and abuses up close for a long time.Definitely worth your while to read."},{"Title":"Forgiven: The Rise and Fall of Jim Bakker and the Ptl Ministry","review":"This fat but interesting book about the rise and fall of Heritage USA, Jim Bakker and his strange episodes with Jessica Hahn (among others) should serve as an excellent guide to what can happen if a single person gains too much control of an organization.

In Section 2, she describes eleven themes that organize commonly reported practices. Eastman does not claim to be comprehensive. She selects works that link development and succession, that address why succession planning often fails, or that describe successful practices. Despite its apparently general scope, her selection is overwhelmingly corporate - only two summarized works deal with the public sector (prisons and the federal government). Most of the work applies to organizations that are large enough to have HR departments and may not be applicable to smaller organizations. But it is an excellent introduction to a broad slice of the research on the growing field of leadership succession."},{"Title":"Doctors and Other Casualties","review":"This collection of short stories (ranging from 15 to 100 pages) was surprisingly good.

These scandals are usually presented as cheap titillation rather than meaningful history, but Anna Clark's \\"Scandal\\" is something of an exception. Cleark takes the unusual approach of suggesting that public reaction to a number of sex scandals in Britain from 1760 to 1820 played a role in altering the British Constitution and changing the structure of British society. According to Clark, these scandals paved the way for democratizing Britain's stratified class structure, while also changing the role of women in society. As the scandals were not intended to effect change to the structure of British society it is no surprise previous scholarship has not considered this possibility. Yet Clark makes the case that these unintended consequences indeed fostered that change. Clark's approach is unique, not just for suggesting this early manifestation of agency in the form of public opinion, but in touching on issues of sexuality and gender, and how these changes were the means to effecting change.While many of these individual scandals are relatively well known in British history, they typically are not interwoven into a comprehensive narrative arguing they were agents of structural change. Clark's writing is at its strongest in the chapter dealing with Edmund Burke and the Begums of Oudh; a complex brew of differences in gender, culture, religion, class and power. This chapter illustrates the benefit of focusing on the complexly interwoven threads of a society rather than on one strand. The biggest complaint is that there is a lack of a common theme or thread between the scandals. As a result the book reads more as a series of vignettes than as a coherent whole. Clark organizers her book in a typical chronological manner, which is a bit disappointing as it likely would have benefited from being organized by themes or topics. Despite the slightly salacious title and subject matter \\"Scandal\\" likely has limited appeal outside of history, gender studies and sexuality. Clark's book goes a long way towards proving that the structure of both Britain's government and society were changed and influence by public opinion and that public opinion had the potential to effect structural change in a society where the elites were often divorced from the opinions of the lower classes. For all its flaws \\"Scandal\\" makes a compelling argument."},{"Title":"Boris Karloff Presents Tales of the Frightened","review":"This small, unobtrusive paperback contains 124 numbered pages, and 26delightfully spooky and wonderfully terrifying stories. Each story is preceeded by a full-page, on which is written only the title of the story, and whose story it is, (for instance, \\"The Man In The Raincoat\\" -- The story of Sylvester Dodge, \\"The Deadly Dress\\" -- The story of Delores Martinez\\", are the first two.) Each title has, after it, \\"The story of...\\", and is written in such a style as to make the reader believe that these strange stories actually did occur.I am privileged to have been able to watch the TV show \\"Thriller\\", starring Boris Karloff, when it first appeared on TV. All of the stories are told in the same matter-of-fact, easy-to-understand, yet chilling manner, with which Mr. Karloff introduced the stories on his TV show. Many of the stories start with a question in the first few sentences, which invite the reader to suspend disbelief, and become involved -- totally involved -- in the short stories, (none of them over five pages in length), given. For instance, the first paragraph of \\"The Graveyard Nine\\", (The story of the Ravenswood Rangers), goes like this:////Terror knows no one peculiar country, no native ground. Nordoes it discriminate against men because of their race,color or religion. Terror has invaded all countries, allhomes, all professions.....and possibly, therein lies thelawful fright of Terror. Now, would you ever believe thatTerror could infiltrate upon the placid, green fields ofbaseball? Come, sit yourself beside me, and look out uponthe playing field, while I tell you the eerie and uncannyhistory of the Ravenswood Rangers...a baseball team likeno other.////Into each story, the reader thus is drawn. The print is large andwell-spaced, the stories short, and ....shuddery, and to the, er...point.Yes, these stories are just MADE to be read by those in the Baby Boomgeneration and later....as they are each short enough to be read through, even by us -- we who have, all too often, had our attention-spans shortened, and often, almost obliterated, by constant exposure to ten minute segments between tv commercials. No -- there is NO excuse, and (yipes!) just about no way out. Once a pe4son starts reading one of these terrifying and, (for the moment, anyway), totally believably real stories, one must, perforce, continue for the three or three and a half more pages, till the end of the tale. And then, mayhap...start another?It is stated on the back cover that Boris Karloff recorded the stories in this book, TALES OF THE FRIGHTENED, on Mercury Records. So, if you cannot read the print, or the candles or electricity blow out, or are just too frightened to hold the book open and read it....you still vcan know these stories, if you wish!None of these stories is diappointing. All will give you thrills and chills....and perhaps a bad dream or two. I wish more of them had happy endings...but they all do make you think. Expanding one's consciousness by reading of things most probably undreampt-of by most people, is the \\"raison d'etre\\" for most ghost stories, as far as I'm concerned. And there is most truly, much \\"food for thought\\", in this slim volume!The text here is by a gentleman named Michael Avallone, but I am quite sure that Boris Karloff himself must have given Mr. Avallone much inspiration on how the tales are to be told, and, perhaps, the very stories of these tales, themselves. True or not, they all have the knowing, laid-back style I remember so well from Mr. Karloff's spoken words on \\"Thriller\\". When I first saw the show, in fact, I was SO young I knew nothing else about Mr. Karloff except that he was the host of this TV show. He seemed to be very intelligent, and very much the gentleman....and I had no idea at all why my parents were apprehensive about my watching him, and his show. My paperback copy states the original date of copyright of this volume as 1847...hah, hah, little joke there! No, no -- the real original copyright date is given as 1963, by Lyle Kenyon Engle, 1963 was also about the time that the \\"Thriller\\" program was on TV. A later copyright date, 1973, is above the 1963 date, and seems to have superceded it. Underneath is a message stating, \\"This book is.......\\" Well, maybe I won't tell tell you the exact words, but it does say whether this is a fiction or non-fiction book!All in all, a small, perhaps overlooked classic of twenty-six terrifying tales. Because of the copyright dates, a reader can be sure that this is a \\"PG\\" rated volume -- gore is kept to a true miniumum, and descriptions of same is left mainly to the reader's imagination. Sex is even less in evidence -- it is allurement, and the beauty of a woman which is described here, not the sex act itself. There is no need, of course, for prolonged sex or violence in a book like this. Terror and trepidation are largely left up to the reader to imagine. To me, this is all for the good -- expanding the imaginationm and allowing a reader to draw pictures in his or her own mind, of what is happening, are what stories like these should do. Or -- as I once descibed the difference between modern, all-too-graphic movies, and the old-fashioned kind, \\"There are horror stories -- and then there are horrIBLE stories!\\" These are DEFINITELYsimply horror stories. And all of them are good ones!In his last movie, Boris Karloff played an ageing horror movie actor. A young man, making present-day \\"R\\" and \\"X\\" rated horror movies, told Mr. Karloff's character, \\"YOUR MOVIES REALLY BLEW MY MIND!\\" Mr. Karloff's character looks, slowly and disapprovingly, at the young man before him, before summing up his, (and paranthetically, my own), feelings in one, magnificient word: \\"OBVIOUSLY\\"! (Yayyyyyyy!!!! Thanks Mr. Karloff!!!!)A good horror story, well-told, leaving the reader and the reader's imagination to fill in the details. No excess blood. No excess gore. Just a story that allows a person to think on good, and on evil, and why there is a difference, and what that difference is. In stories, and in titles like: \\"You Can Take It With You\\", \\"The Phantom Soldier\\", \\"Say Good Night To Mr. Sporko\\", \\"Portrait In Hell\\", \\"Terror In The Window\\", \\"The Barking Dog\\", \\"Terror In The Window\\", \\"The Barking Dog\\",....and many others, there is much to think about and ponder on. As you read these stories....and ever afterwards, as well!p. S. WARNING: Read them yourself, before giving it to a super-sensitive child -- or adult. And be SURE to read the copyright page first....which tells the real truth, as to whether these are merely fiction stories, made from someone's imagination,...or not!"},{"Title":"Lemuel Smith and the Compulsion To Kill: The Forensic Story of a Multiple Personality Serial Killer","review":"Overall, well-written book with good insight into Smith's personality(ies), the people involved and the crimes themselves. Foley very clearly did a lot of homework and was even able to get in the good graces of Smith himself. Far better than your run-of-the-mill true crime book.My biggest personal complaint is a lack of impartiality. Foley obviously believes that Smith had multiple personalities and, at one point, even writes as though Smith and his alter ego both got into either side of a car to attack a woman - borderline cheesy. The chronological flow of the book is poor at times and you get lost as to which event occurred first. Clinical details like exact dates are sometimes missing but I'll concede I may be too picky on that front... All of those complaints amount to one star so the book is definitely worth getting."},{"Title":"Lemuel Smith and the Compulsion To Kill: The Forensic Story of a Multiple Personality Serial Killer","review":"Lemuel Smith and the Compulsion to Kill is the true account of a serial killer who kept the cities of Albany, Schenectady, Colonie, Amsterdam, and Saratoga on high alert for almost two decades. Lemuel raped, stabbed, sodomized, strangled, bit,andmangled most of his victims. One victim was particially decapitated. The book graphically details the murders committed by this one man who claimed to have more than one personality.The author, Denis Foley, documents the crimes, with careful attention paid to all the details that encompass bringing a criminal to justice. Many police agencies, departments, and jurisdictions collaborated jointly to end the wrath of Lemuel Smith. As a result of total team work between the cities involved, Smith's arrest, trial, and conviction occurred, to the relief of thousands of people in the Capital District of New York State.Foley makes certain the reader is aware of the leg work and incredible effort that was put forth to bring Smith to incarceration."},{"Title":"Lemuel Smith and the Compulsion To Kill: The Forensic Story of a Multiple Personality Serial Killer","review":"Having grown up in this locale and having known the killer, though not well, the book was very chilling, indeed.

The CD is useless. The author demonstrates a great knowledge of what he is writing, but has not presented it in an engaging and coherent form. The most important concepts are mixed and buried throughout the book and must be reconstructed by the reader. The reader does develop a feel for how complex international tax avoidance is and an understanding how excellent advice could cost hundreds of dollars an hour. The summary of it is, there are some legitimate opportunities for legitimate companies conducting legitimate businesses. However, most schemes while skirting the letter of the law violate the spirit of the law and are therefor, illegal. The temptation arises with foreign governments in search of hard currency, willing to hide activities from the IRS.

Brad's voice sounded creepy and her smelled different then the sent that Paulette knew. Paulette could not see so but she could still smell and hear. Paulette did not know what was happening!This book is so good. There was not one part in the book that was bad! It was the kind of book that once you start reading you cannot stop! R.L writes a lot of books! This book one of the many the many of the Fear Street, Series.I would recommend this book to people whom like to read Fear Street and also mystery!"},{"Title":"Into the Dark (Fear Street Series #49)","review":"This is a great book.

Paulette is instantly enamored of Brad, but her friends are not so quick to trust him. Rumors of a troubled past follow Brad and it doesn't help when Brad's personality seems to swing to polar opposites. Paulette doesn't believe the rumors about Brad, but when a robbery occurs at the local pizza shop her beliefs about Brad's innocence are put to the test. All of the eyewitnesses accuse Brad except for Paulette, who happens to be blind. Can she trust her senses? Or must she give in to the evidence that Brad isn't who he seems to be.Overall the story is easy to read and the writer does a good job of piquing our interest in both Paulette's struggle to overcome people's conceptions of her blindness and the events surrounding her relationship with Brad. The book is meant to be suspenseful and is mostly successful at maintaining that mood. Though it is not one of R. L. Stine's scariest works, there may be parts in the book that are too intense for some readers. The book seems rushed at points and some details seem to be left out in the interest of keeping the book to a length reasonable for an adolescent attention span.The book causes one to examine the concept of not devaluing a person simply because they have a disability. Paulette is shown to be a very independent person who does not like to be restrained because of her disability. Though her friends and parents sometimes remind her of her blindness and express concern for her safety, she is never really left out or excluded from anything socially. However being excluded is a concern that is always present in her thoughts, and she is always conscious of how she thinks people will see her. This concern leads her to try to prove herself, and causes her to respond to situations in a manner that anyone might consider risky. I may potentially use this book to illustrate the idea of the value of a person to my secondary education students. I believe it might help them understand that when they encounter a person with a disability, they are actually encountering a person who happens to have a disability and not just a \\"disabled person\\". Some may argue this as semantics, but the truth is that when we choose to emphasize \\"disabled\\", we sometimes have difficulty really seeing the person and their value."},{"Title":"Into the Dark (Fear Street Series #49)","review":"I reccomend all of the teenagers to read this book or any other R.L Stine's Fear Street's books.

The first important thing to understand is that while Cook and Crone, both reputable scholars, put forth a carefully argued thesis here, their view is very much the minority view among non-Muslim scholars of Islam. The controversial element: while Muhammad was likely a real person, an migrant who founded a movement around 622, most other elements of early Islamic tradition, including the revelation of the Quran and the central role of Mecca, are likely invented traditions fabricated in the latter part of the seventh century.While it is difficult to imagine that Islam as we think of it was invented after the conquests (circa 633-650), the Cook/Crone thesis is not without hard evidence. For example, coins with Quranic verses differ from the official version sixty years after it was supposedly standardized by Uthman. Some early non-Muslim sources - of very limited quantity - do seem to support a radically different story than the standard one. The fact that the tradition was not written down until well over a century after the fact certainly calls it into question if it is contradicted by other evidence, however sketchy.One element of the thesis I find interesting is the argument that the break between Muslims and Jews took place not in the late 620s, as Muslim tradition claims, but after the conquest of Palestine. Only then, so the argument goes, was the focus of Islam reoriented toward Mecca from Palestine. I find this interesting because it would throw a great deal of light onto how exactly the Muslims managed their amazing conquests with so much apparent ease. That Christians and Jews in Palestine and Syria were unhappy with Byzantium is widely known, but this thesis adds much to that point."},{"Title":"Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World","review":"The historic interpretation of the Koran is, for political reasons, still in its infacy.

A very essential text in understadning the history of Islam and its founding.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World","review":"Briefly, the authors put aside the Muslim sources in their entirety as unreliable. The void is then filled by the earliest non-Muslim references to Islam. In the authors view, the non-Muslim sources can be trusted in their entirety, which are then used to reconstruct Islamic origins roughly as follows:Islam developed from a messianic sect of \\"Hagarenes.\\" Muhammad united the Arabs around the concept of One God and preached that being the descendants of Abraham, the Arabs were the rightful heirs of Palestine. The members of this sect were called \\"muhajirun.\\" The \\"hijrah\\" was not from Mecca to Yathrib (Medina) but from Arabia to the \\"Promised Land,\\" in which Jews participated. Muhammad was alive when the movement's messianic figure, Umar, entered Jerusalem in 638.The Jews welcomed the new invaders, though the Christians deemed them barbarians. After a while there was a break-up between the Arabs and the Jews, the former asserting its distinct identity by emphasising that theirs was the true religion of Abraham. The Arabs accepted Jesus as Messiah but denied his death and Davidic decent for hating the cross.Muhammad was first aligned with a number of non-Biblical prophets, then to a \\"prophet like Moses,\\" recipient of a new revealed book. This is when the Quran was hurriedly composed as Muhammad's scripture, probably at the end of the 7th century. The notion of the hijrah was replaced with that of \\"Islam\\" and the believers came to be known as \\"Muslims.\\"The Arabs began looking for a new holy city, while still controlling Jerusalem. They needed a sanctuary associated with the grave of Ishmael. Eventually, in Abdul Malik's time, they located one in Mecca. Thereafter, Muhammad's links with Jerusalem were severed and the date of his death was adjusted to a period prior to the conquest and the hijrah was transformed into an emigration from Mecca to Yathrib.The above is the gist of Hagarism. In New Testament studies, the Hagarism enterprise would be similar to rejecting the entire New Testament w(and all Christian sources), replacing them with the few existing non-Christian fragments, which are uncritically/creatively used to revise history.But there is no reason to suppose that the non-Muslim authors were any better informed on Islam, or more \\"balanced\\" than Muslims, particularly when they were probably unfamiliar with the Arabic language, having no first hand knowledge of Arabia or even an interest in Islamic history. Why should we expect non-Muslims to have possessed detailed accurate knowledge on Islam at this very early stage? As late as the Crusades many Christians believed that Muslims worshipped idols and Muhammad!The authors are \\"critical\\" - hyper-sceptical - only in dismissing Muslim sources. At work is a strong prejudice which causes them to reject all Muslim sources in toto since Muslims cannot be trusted. Hagarism has been rightly dismissed and harshly critiqued in the scholarly circles over the years.Defending Hagarism, someone said that some early non-Muslim sources appear to present a \\"radically different\\" story from the standard one. It should be noted that Crone's student, Hoyland (\\"Seeing Islam as Others Saw It\\"), has published an exhaustive survey of the earliest non-Muslim references to Islam. He concludes, in sharp contrast to Crone/Cook, that these sources CONFIRM rather than call into question the traditional Islamic accounts.It was also said that Hagarism is based on some \\"hard evidence,\\" not withstanding its almost universal rejection. The hardness of the evidence can be gauged from the fact that the authors no longer endorse Hagarism. Unfortunately, many unfamiliar with scholarship, such as the openly hostile anti-Muslim reviews below, are quick to promote Hagarism without realizing that the authors themselves have dismissed its revisionist claims.Khan reports: \\"However, what distinguishes this book is the fact that its authors ... no longer subscribe to its critical findings ...\\"About Crone: \\"She [Crone] was even more candid in repudiating the central thesis of the book. She agrees with the critics that the book was \\"a graduate essay.\\" The book was published in 1977 when the authors lived in England. \\"We were young, and we did not know anything. The book was just a hypothesis, not a conclusive finding,\\" said Crone. \\"I do no think that the book's thesis is valid.\\"\\" [...]Crone recently acknowledged we know more about Muhammad than about Jesus and that: \\"...we can be reasonably sure that the Qur'an is a collection of utterances that he [Muhammad] made in the belief that they had been revealed to him by God. The book may not preserve all the messages he claimed to have received, and he is not responsible for the arrangement in which we have them. They were collected after his death - how long after is controversial. But that he uttered all or most of them is difficult to doubt.\\"[...]It was also said that coins with Quranic verses \\"differ\\" from the accepted Quranic text. But as Whelan and Hoyland pointed out, these are secondary changes - introduced to fit the sense. The accepted standard text is deliberately adapted in minor ways to emphasis particular themes, a common Muslim practise. Whelan says, \\"...even inscriptions of much later dates, when there is no question that a \\"canonical\\" text of the Qur'an had been established, embody such variations.\\" (\\"Forgotten Witnesses\\")Recent archaeological discoveries have AFFIRMED rather than called into question the traditional Islamic accounts. Neuwirth acknowledges:\\"As a whole, however, the theories of the so-called sceptic or revisionist scholars ... have by now been discarded ... New findings of qur'anic fragments, moreover, can be adduced to affirm rather than call into question the traditional picture of the Qur'an as an early fixed text composed of the suras we have. Nor have scholars trying to deconstruct that image through linguistic arguments succeeded in seriously discrediting the genuiness of the Qur'an as we know it ... \\"\\"Structural, linguistic and literary features,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to the Qur'an, pp. 100-101I recommend Hagarism, but only so that readers know how not to be bad \\"historians.\\""},{"Title":"Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World","review":"The religious texts of monotheistic religions form an intersecting field of study. For a starter, the historicity of the Christian bibles is so much in doubt hence it leads to legitimate questions about the exact dates and the identity of the authors. And the fact that all the \\"prophetic\\" books of the old testament were shamelessly written long after the events they claim to \\"predict\\" have happened, is all but too obvious except for the utterly ignorant.The Koran itself may be open to scrutiny, about its authorship, the language it uses and many other aspects.The two authors \\"Crone & Cook\\" have simply done nothing except parroting the questions that real scholars have had about the historicity of biblical texts and tried raising the same questions about Islamic history, without the slightest modification that is warranted due to the totally different historical backgrounds. For that reason they had to ignore all existing scholarship and to exclude all historical evidence except what they determined valid if it served their thesis. In most cases even this selectiveness in choosing the sources is not enough, they have to twist the meaning, use their own interpolation of the narrative to come up with the results they seek.For example, after quoting for almost a whole page an \\"Armenian Chronicle\\" supposedly written in the 660s and ascribed to Bishop Sebeos, which even according to the authors, and I quote :\\" This version of the origins of Islam is an unfamiliar one. It is also manifestly ahistorical in its admixture of Biblical ethnography and demonstrably wrong in the role it ascribes to the Jewish refugees from Edessa. This role, quite apart from its geographical implausibility, is in effect chronologically impossible ..... This need not however invalidate the picture which Sebes gives .. \\" (page 7) !!!!This quote is but one example of the level of \\"scholarship\\" that has gone into the book.Furthermore, in the preface to the book the authors claim that the book will raise the eyebrows of the specialist, won't be accepted by a \\"believing Muslim\\", even disliked by a \\"Muslim who has lost his religious faith but retained his ancestral pride\\". Well let me add that the book is an insult to any reader with a sense or understanding of scholarship and history, after all, historical research is not a fishing expedition where we dig for flimsy and uncorroborated sources simply to try to prove pre-conceived ideas and hypotheses.Their hypothisis would be nothing short of laughable if it were not for the fake mantle of \\"scholarship\\" that the authors cloak themselves with. Furthermore, it is appalling if \\"Hagarism\\" reflects the level of \\"scholarship\\" in this field, since at best, the book does not move past the polemics of the religious fanatics of the middle ages."},{"Title":"Maxwell's Mountain","review":"I am seven and a half years old, and i really like this book. i think it is a good book because it teaches kids how to be a mountaun climber. my brother who is 3 liked it too. we liked the ending, and i thought it was funny."},{"Title":"Maxwell's Mountain","review":"I am a Kindergarten teacher who was thrilled to read Maxwell's Mountain to my class.

The pictures are absolutely beautiful; the explanations range from poignant to extraneous. I have to admit, there were points when I wanted to roll my eyes, wondering if the author was over-thinking things just a little. However, I also walked away from this book with a new-found appreciation for my Korean roots.The national character of Koreans are often compared with Italians - Koreans, too, are passionate, down-to-earth, hot-blooded people. We do not have the appreciation for the delicate or subtle (which the Japanese are famous for). My mother once matter-of-factly explained to me when I was younger that this was because Italians and Koreans are both peninsula people (I never understood how this played such a large part in defining a people, but it seemed to make sense at the time).Nevertheless, this book highlights - perhaps to a point of almost caracaturizing - that other side to Korean nature. For instance, the author points out in one page that rice must be filled past the brim to be considered &quot;full&quot; - an observation that rings true with the Korean nature of hospitality and generosity. It was an idea so ingrained into my head that I had always taken it for granted until it was pointed out to me!This book is a great coffee table book, to be digested a few pages at a time. It presents Korean culture in a beautiful light - one that should be appreciated but also taken with a grain of salt. Imagine if someone 500 years from now writes a book about 20th century American artifacts and expounds upon the shape of a coffee cup and how the curvy handle suggests the unity of life - yeah, that would seem kind of silly too..."},{"Title":"Things Korean","review":"From the moment I opened it, I was engrossed in the serious descriptions of cultural items and the significance they represent to its members.

The translator (not author) felt the need to inform readers that many Koreans disagree with the author's interpretations. It seems to me, as a Korean, that the prose style and content were inauthentic in tone; inaccurately representing the mindset of the Korean people. Koreans are a pragmatic people not prone to attach elaborate ceremony or philosophical meaning to every day objects, and as such are diametrically opposite to the Japanese. The book is full of philosophical musings and personal memories without (for me) historical or sociological proof, description or context."},{"Title":"Things Korean","review":"I was mesmerized by the pictures and bought it instantly.When I sat down to read it, however, I was dissapointed.

He becomes Aleisha's guardian, and has the first time ever experience of raising a child. We watch, with him, as she grows from a frightened child to a confident, loving and outspoken young lady. For someone who hasn't changed in 4000 years, the opportunity to see his beloved child grow out of clothes, learn to play the piano, and gain a growing knowledge of the world (including an acceptance of his true nature) is an unique experience. But Germany and the world around them is changing as well, and eventually tragedy strikes."},{"Title":"Tempting Fate","review":"This book, the fifth in the series about the vampire Franz Ragozy de Saint Germain, was originally intended to be the last of the series. (It says so, in the \\"about the author\\" section in the back.) Of course, there are roughly a dozen more out now; Yarbro keeps getting new ideas for the character, beyond what she'd originally planned. This is unquestionably the best written of the first five books in the series, but be warned: do not read it unless you are in the mood for tragedy. It is powerfully written, and captures all too fully the trauma that struck all too frequently in that time and place; \\"The Sound Of Music\\" this most assuredly is NOT. (\\"Hotel Transylvania\\" was set in prerevolutionary France, \\"The Palace\\" in renaissance Italy in the time of Botticelli, \\"Blood Games\\" in imperial Rome at the time of Nero, and \\"Path of the Eclipse\\" during the Mongol invasion of China; this is set primarily in Germany during the period between the world wars.)There is little of the feel, all too evident in the first three books of the series, of the cheap Gothic Romance; the characters are very real, and so are the events (in at least two cases, a little TOO real for my taste, but I can't reasonably fault the author for that; the setting and period would not have been done justice had everything turned out well.)For those unfamiliar with the series, the Comte de Saint Germain is a vampire who has \\"lived\\" since approximately 1500 BC; he has many of the typical features of the stereotypical vampire; he doesn't age, is difficult to injure, and needs to drink blood to survive. But unlike the stereotype, he doesn't kill with his blood-drinking, and blood itself is not sufficient; there must be an emotional connection as well, and the less emotional connection there is, the less satisfying the blood is. He can be killed by severing the spine or destroying the brain; other wounds are painful, but ultimately superficial. He is susceptable to sunlight, but less so than many vampires; he doesn't care for it, but hardly bursts into flame on exposure. Essentially, he sunburns easily. Similarly, he cannot rest unless it is on his native soil, and cannot cross running water. All of these prohibitions, however, are alleviated by the expedient of wearing his native soil in the soles of his shoes, using it in the foundation of any home he builds, and filling his mattress with it, so he CAN, in fact, be seen in broad daylight in the Mediterranean summer on shipboard.The character is an unmitigated hero, not the antihero of most vampire fiction; wealthy, urbane, kind, generous, most worthy of emulation. Still, he's a bad man to cross. The series as a whole is highly recommended, and this book is powerfully written, if EXTREMELY unsettling."},{"Title":"Tempting Fate","review":"This is the fifth book in Yarbro's long-running St-Germain series, and it's one of the best. All of Yarbro's standard touches are here: the well-researched historical background (pre-WWII Germany), the narrow-minded brutality of most of the human characters, the horrors they inflict, St-Germain's involvement with a lonely woman, the danger that forces him to flee, the emotional losses he experiences, etc. etc. But there's another twist to this book: the immortal vampire becomes a father when he saves--and raises--an orphaned girl.This presents us with a somewhat different view of St Germain than we get in the other novels in the series. Normally, the Count lives among humans and even loves a select few, but always knows that he will eventually be forced to move on. In this book, he loves in a way that he hasn't allowed himself to before. That, in combination with the more recent time period of the novel, makes the inevitable tragedy that much more poignant."},{"Title":"Tempting Fate","review":"An extremely enjoyable book. What makes this story so good is St. Germains's poignant relationship with his ward Laisha. Against the backdrop of WWII, this non-stereotypic vampire travels through Europe protecting and helping the humans he has taken under his wing. He's a tragic figure with fine sensibilites. His ongoing but no longer requitable love for Madeline de Montalia, his tenderness toward Gudrun, and the way he cherishes Laisha all contibute our understanding of the seemingly enigmatic Count. I was very disappointed that the author chose not to develop the relationship between Laisha and her &quot;Papa&quot;."},{"Title":"Tempting Fate","review":"Le Comte de St. Germain is a much more real, more interesting vampire than any written by Anne Rice. This is vampire literature for the intelligent reader -- be sure to read Hotel Transylvania by the same author."},{"Title":"Tempting Fate","review":"I received the book Tempting Fate by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro about the Count St. Germain from the Russian Revolution through the rise of the Nazis in Germany. It is quite long and very detailed. It seems to drag in places, but it has kept me entertained for weeks so far and I'm only 2/3 through. I received it in battered, but readable condition."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My mother used to read me a chapter a night of this book when I was about eight. I didn't get it. For reasons lost in the mists of history, I picked it up on my own in my 20s and found, to my delight, that I couldn't put it down. Since then, I have bought, read, and reread everything Austen ever wrote, and was a member of the Jane Austen Club back in the early '80s, loooong before she became so fashionable.What I've learned from my frequent readings of her works is that each time I read them, I get a little more than I did the last time. Her language appears convoluted to us, yes, partly because she wrote with the voice of her time and partly because we are probably like, you know, as inarticulate a people as ever lived. So do we denigrate Shakespeare or Chaucer for their voices?The themes of Austen's works are all similar - they all relate to the difficulties of women finding their own places in a rigidly structured society in which women were defined strictly by the men in their lives. In fact, when I visited her burial place in Winchester Cathedral, I was surprised to find a 6-foot marble slab fully engraved with a lengthy narrative about her, until I realized that there was NOT ONE WORD about her writing - she was described and defined strictly in relation to her father and family. So she definitely knew whereof she spoke; in her time, there was no life for a women outside of marriage, and the frantic attempts of parents - and the girls themselves - to marry off their daughters, which appears funny to us in our more enlightened age, is actually painful and somewhat pathetic. (Almost as pathetic as the efforts of many women today to find their own rich, indulgent Mr. Darcys... especially in light of their many other options.)One of the characteristics of Austen's writing that I find most interesting is that while she writes in great detail of the lives of her characters and their immediate surroundings, there is not one word about the greater world. I doubt that the word &quot;London&quot; appears in any of them except briefly in &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;; they all take place in small villages somewhere in the middle or south of England, and rarely wander further than the distance of a post-lunch walk. The novels were written at the end of the Napoleonic era and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, so there was plenty of upheaval, social and otherwise, occuring all over England and the Continent, but nary a whisper of it ever rears its ugly head in her works. She holds her magnifying glass very close to her own garden gate; her perspective is entirely microcosmic without being claustrophobic - that's part of her genius. She can turn over a rock and document the frantic scurrying underneath it in its own terms, drawing no inferences from the activity under the rest of the tree. Good? Bad? I don't know, and I think it doesn't matter - but there is probably not a better, more detailed, or more honest picture of time and place in all of English literature.I am torn between being glad that students are exposed to literature, and sorry that the teaching of it is so pedantic that all the humor and magic of great books is buried. I only hope, for those who were force-fed on Austen and others of her ilk, that they will pick up these works on their own later in life and derive from them the pleasure that is there for the asking. Meanwhile, I strongly recommend periodic infusions of all of Austen's works, of which I believe &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is the most accessible."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I enjoyed this classic totally. I thought the way Jane Austen developed the characters personalities was incredible. I have reread it many times. I am amazed at how much an author can get across without the overuse of sex and violence (that we see way too much of today). I have also enjoyed her other works Emma and Sense and Sensibility. I have not read the others.I have found the Pride and Prejudice movie from A&E; with Collin Firth to be one of my favorite movies and I think is an excellent addition to have. The Annotated Pride and Prejudice is very helpful and enjoyable by David Shapard. The World of Her Novels by Deirdre Le Faye is also very helpful though at times seems a bit heavy. It gives you a real feel for the era and thus the settings of the book.A word of caution. When you enjoy something you don't want it to end. Of the countless spinoffs of the original I totally disliked one and am in the middle of another. Mr. Darcy takes a wife is unbelievable and totally devoid of character. Seems there are sex scenes on almost every page in the beginning. I grew disgusted. The account of things from Darcy's point of view by Pamela Aidan has been enjoyable. I am only half way thru the first book, however.The Annotated Pride and PrejudiceJane Austen: The World of Her NovelsMr. Darcy Takes a Wife: Pride and Prejudice ContinuesAn Assembly Such as This: A Novel of Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman (Fitzwilliam Darcy Gentleman)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The \\"truth universally acknowledged\\" that begins Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of the best opening sentences in English literature; its irony, subtle and caustic, perfectly sets the tone for the novel, which is about the manners of courtship and the classist attitudes toward marriage in Regency England. The message Austen is conveying is that the rules of the marriage game are, at least to the propriety-conscious gentry, more interesting than the romance that leads to marriage.The novel's heroine is Elizabeth Bennet, the second, and the wittiest and liveliest, of five daughters in a middle class English family. Her mother, a simple and silly creature whose greatest desire in life is that her dowry-deficient daughters should marry well, is ecstatic when she learns that a wealthy single young man named Mr. Bingley has moved into a nearby house; she imagines him a potential husband for one of her daughters. Bingley turns out to be charming and friendly, but his friend, Mr. Darcy, also wealthy, single, and young, snobbishly appears to consider himself superior to the Bennets.Jane, Elizabeth's older sister, falls in love with Bingley, but Darcy tries to discourage his friend from courting a girl of a social status lower than his. Elizabeth and Darcy develop a strangely flirtatious relationship that is partly affectionate and partly adversarial, provoking the jealousy of Bingley's attention-starved sister, who is attracted to Darcy. Elizabeth must also fend off the affections of her cousin, a clergyman named Mr. Collins who is amusingly persistent in his marriage proposals to her; fortunately, her rebuffs finally cause him to marry her less attractive friend instead. Collins shamelessly panders to his patroness, the haughty, imperious Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who practically demands that Darcy (who happens to be her nephew) marry her diminutive daughter, and Elizabeth had better not get in the way.A charming young soldier named Mr. Wickham, whose father was employed by Darcy's father and who became Darcy's father's ward after his own father's death, enters the story. To Elizabeth he claims that Darcy is withholding money from him that is due him; Darcy responds that Wickham is a freeloader who is not entitled to any more money than he has already gotten. Wickham risks damaging the Bennets' reputation when Elizabeth's youngest sister Lydia, who is as prattling and frivolous as her mother, impetuously decides to elope with him.If the \\"pride\\" in the novel is Darcy's self-regard, the \\"prejudice\\" is Elizabeth's initial opinion of him as an insufferable snob, because by the end she learns that he is quite honorable and charitable after all. He reveals to Elizabeth that he was raised by his parents to feel superior to the lower classes, but her willingness to stand up to him and his conceit has taught him modesty and humility and endeared her to him. It is this transformation of character, similar to a gender role reversal of \\"The Taming of the Shrew,\\" that distinguishes Austen's novel as a special achievement of 19th Century English literature."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is truly a classic, the book is the apex of Ms. Austens writing. The characters are so vivid and they stay with you. The heroine Elizabeth Bennett is such a modern thinker and she is resolute and always true to herself. Ah and Darcy, he is such a great creation; at first glance, distant, shy, seemingly full of pride. The way the book evolves into one of the great love stories in literature is wonderful, it's a jouney everyone should take. Even if you have seen the great A&E version or the new Kiera Knightly version, you still should read the book. Ms. Austen is a great writer and though the two afore mentioned films are well done, they still can't match Ms. Austens proes, it's such a shame she died so young and we did not get to see her writing evolve, to think she died in her thirties a spinster, I suppose it takes someone like that to write such an uplifting, romantic book and not be, dare I say, cynical about romance and waiting for that one love...maybe she found her Darcy after all."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves; vanity, to what we would have others think of us.\\" Jane AustenI let my own foolish pride, my own ignorant prejudices; deter me from ever picking up a Jane Austen achievement until about a month ago when I finally decided to give her a shot. This classic novel was definitely not on my \`must read' list, but somehow, someway, it landed on my lap one afternoon and I decided to at least take a quick peek at it while no one else was looking. After all, a man's man like myself (whatever that means nowadays) has no time to read early 19th century Chick Brit Lit., let alone a sweet, love story like this one. Especially during football season! I could almost hear Bukowski's ghost laughing at me when I opened up the first page and read those unforgettable first lines regarding man and marriage. However, I forged on, just Jane and I, and when it was all said and done - I can't believe what a fool I've been all these years! Yes, this classic is a thing of beauty. And like Jane's main protagonist and narrative voice in the novel - Elizabeth Bennet - I too learned a valuable lesson about not judging a book by its cover. Isn't evolution great?Don't make the same mistake I did. I love classic literature, but for too long now I avoided such greats as the Bronte's, Wharton, Cather, et al... because of my foolish male ego, my ridiculous machismo pride. My biggest regret though, was avoiding Austen all these years. Now, I may not go out and rent the movie anytime soon (of course the wife made me promise that I would watch it with her after I introduced her to \\"Scarface\\" the other night), but I will definitely be purchasing some more of Jane's classics (Emma, Persuasion, Mansfield Park, etc...) and if they are anything like this pleasant surprise, I am going to be one happy camper.Never a dull moment, never a page not worth perusing, simply put - Austen is awesome!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Miss Jane Austen (1775-1816) was born into the home of a clergyman at Steventon Rectory, She is the gem of all English authors in the realm of domestic romance and comedy. Jane needs a few middle class and wealthy families living in a rural setting to set her genius afire. Pride and Prejudice published in 1813 is justly the most famous, liveliest and perfectly plotted of all her few novels. You must read Pride and Prejudice if you have any claim to being a well educated person. The book is the grandmother of all the thousands of books that have been set in the Regency period featuring a love story between a young lady and a rich Byronic hero. None of these books can match Pride and Prejudice in its witty dialogue and insights into the human heart.The main characters are:The Bennet Family-Mr. Bennet is a fuddy-duddy bookworm of a clergyman. He is a poor father more interested in spending time in his study than it helping raise his rambunctious girls.Mrs. Bennet is a fatuous fool. An ignorant, self-indulgent, flippant idiot she has one goal-getting her five unwed daughters wed in prosperous matches with the local gentry and soldiery.Jane Bennet is the oldest \\"Miss Bennet\\". She falls in love with Mr. Bigley. She is an innocent, sweet young lady.Elizabeth Bennet is the novel's heroine and the most delightful young woman in all of English fiction! She is witty, wise, lively and beautiful. Elizabeth is probably based on Jane Austen. Her love is for Mr.Fitzwilliam Darcy whom she is preudiced against due to what she perceives as his rudeness to her; his suppposed effort to break up the affair between Jane and Darcy and his putative mistreatment of soldier Wickham.Lydia and Kitty are younger daughters who are man-crazy, brainless daughters. Lydia elopes with the cad soldier Wickham.Mary is the bookworm daughter who is made fun of by Austen for her overly serious demeanor.Charles Bingley-the love interest of Jane Bennet.Fitzwilliam Darcy is the prideful scion of great wealth who falls in love with Elizabeth. He resembles characters in such fictional products as those penned by Samuel Richardson; Fanny Burney and women authors enjoyed by the young Jane Austen.Hilarious minor characters include the odious clergyman Mr. Collins who weds the impecunious Charlotte Lucas. Charlotte is on the verge of becoming an old main so she weds the ludicrous Collins. Collins had earlier proposed marriage to Elizabeth but had been refused.Lady Catherine DeBourgh-Darcy's aunt she is cruel and hateful to everyone she holds in disdain. She is one of those old dragons which populate the pages of great classic English fiction.The novel was written during the period of England's life and death struggle against Napoleon but there is no mention of the nation's affairsAusten keeps her keen but restricted focus on the lives of her ordinary people living in the retired village of Maryton.Many famous novelists list Jane Austen as their favorite author. No wonder this is true! Janeites have adored her beautiful writing and well crafted stories for generations! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. This was the first English classic book I read while getting my University degree. Pride and Prejudice was a part of my English Literature. What began as a course syllabus, ended as a love affair with English classic, specially books by Jane Austen.This book strengthened by belief that love withstands everything. The characters of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are so excellently chalked out, that it makes us fall for them instantly. The magic of this book is amazing.This book lead me to buy and read all Jane Austen's classics.Must read for all who love to read.."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was a little nervous when I first decided to put this on my summer reading list. The book was 367 pages of text, close together, justified and not written in easy language (i.e. modern English). I was optimistically hoping to finish it within a month.But I really liked the movie with Keira Knightley and wanted to see how closely it compared and if it was as good as the movie.Two weeks later, I am done, and I am pleased with the ride.Plot:Mr. Bingley, an eligible, wealthy bachelor, moves nearby the Bennett family, who have five unmarried daughters. The Bennett family must secure good marriages for their daughters since they will inherit nothing when their father dies. Romance is in the air between Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingley, while the first sparks of love appear between the proud, wealthy Mr. Darcy and the exuberant, Elizabeth Bennett.Good:There are so many good parts to this book! I don't quite know where to begin!The characters are believable and real. Elizabeth is a well rounded character. She starts out proud and prejudiced against Mr. Darcy but as she learns of his true quality is not afraid of changing her mind. Mr. Darcy was sweet, opinionated, and equally prejudiced against Elizabeth's \\"poor connections\\".The plot was wonderful and well paced. It kept me on the edge of my seat (although it was not an action book); I couldn't wait to see what would happen on each page.I enjoyed the arguments between Elizabeth (and her fiesty personality) and Mr. Darcy (stiff and proud). The quips they came up with! The chemistry between the two was perfect!Lastly, I enjoyed how the author emphasized (via Mr. Bennett) to marry for love and not for money or connections or the like. This is something very much beyond her time (as many marriages in the late 18th century were arranged).Bad:Well, this is being exceedingly petty, but the language of this book makes it difficult for a modern reader to fully understand the nuances of what Jane Austen is trying to say (the notes at the appendix help with this, however).Dialogue/Sexual Situations/ViolenceNone. Talk is made of how Lydia and an officer run off to live with each other without marrying. None.Overall:Sweet. There is no better word for the free-spirited, witty romance between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I would have to say this is the best, purest romance story I have ever read (besides, maybeThe Princess Bride). The movie does a fabulous job with the book, but the book is even more enjoyable than the movie (if you can imagine). You will not be displeased with this one."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm a recent newlywed who decided to raid his wifes bookshelf and this was the first book of hers that I picked up. Wanting to be better read and enjoying the movie &quot;Sense and Sensibility.&quot;I recommend to anyone that is curious but apprehensive of Austen like I was to see a film based on one of her books. You will hear the use and cadence of victorian speech which will, in my humble opinion, make her books more accessible and easier to read. This is the first Jane Austen I've read and I am now bonafide fan.This is one of those stories where the destination is not important but the journey is. Within the first ten pages, the stage is set. The two headstrong protagonists, Miss Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy cannot stand one another at the beginning of the book. Sparks fly and meet with typical results. The characters are distinct and memorable. Mr. Bennet, Elizabeth's father, was one of my favorites. Anyone who is an admirer of dry &quot;british&quot; humor will find themselves in stitches. It is the first book in a very long time where I found myself laughing out loud and on more than one occasion.A moderately quick read for those used to victorian prose. I for one am glad that I got over the &quot;girly&quot; stigma that's usually associated with Jane Austen. It has made me consider other books in my wifes arsenal I normally would not have otherwise.I will, however, pass on her &quot;The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot;Great book. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I never thought I'd have a favorite book or author until I read Pride and Prejudice. It is, by far, the most beautifully written love story in literature, in my opinion.Miss Eliza Bennet is the second eldest daughter of an English gentleman whose estate can only go to a male successor upon his death. Because he and Mrs. Bennet are unable to conceive a male child, it is the best course for the girls to marry and marry well. The great advantage the girls have is that they are beautiful, with the eldest girl, Jane, being the most beautiful of them all.The Bennets live in Longbourn, a small village just outside of Meryton, a quaint little town. The story begins when Mr. Bingley, a very amiable and wealthy young bachelor, decides to lease an estate in the area. At a ball, Mr. Bingley introduces his best friend, Mr. Darcy, another wealthy bachelor, and his sisters to the local society. It is here where Mr. Bingley meets the Bennet girls and starts to fall in love with Jane Bennet, and it is also here where Mr. Darcy meets Elizabeth. Elizabeth immediately dislikes Darcy for several reasons but mainly because he insults her by first refusing to dance with her and then by saying, with Elizabeth within hearing distance, that he isn't in the habit of asking girls, who have been rejected by other men, to dance.Elizabeth is a complex character, a young woman who is wise beyond her years, reserve, has a dry sense of humor, friendly but very cynical of her world and of love. In contrast, Jane is sensitive, likes to think well of people, very friendly, and somewhat fragile. Bingley's personality is a perfect complement to Jane's. He's friendly, generous, somewhat nave and looks up to Darcy. Darcy is brooding, quiet, reserved, prideful, and yet loyal and protective of his friends and family.The story progresses to where Darcy discovers his growing attraction to Elizabeth, despite his best efforts, and proposes to her. Because of his social status and wealth, Darcy expects Elizabeth to say \\"yes\\" to his marriage proposal. To his surprise, she not only turns him down, she also tears right into him: His haughty behavior, rudeness, and his part in driving Bingley and Jane apart. Yes, Darcy had been up to no good in breaking up Bingley and Jane. This sets the stage for heartbreak, courtship, scandal, intrigue, and reconciliation and finally a happy ending for both couples.Jane Austen paints her characters and their dialogue with such splendidly crafted sentences, such as \\"I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\\" She takes time to enrich the story with picturesque descriptions of each setting, and describes each character in such a way that you easily understand the layer of complexity in each. For example, Elizabeth dislikes those who she thinks are vain, but yet she prides herself in her ability to read people's personalities and they're like. Wickham, the protagonist in this story, is, on the surface, well-mannered, kind, and has a \\"good face,\\" but is really a liar, thief and a gambler.I highly recommend this book. I've read it numerous times and there's always something new to discover with each reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"it is a nice book for all age group."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This Book is just the kind of book that I like.

Although the book's official theme is marriage, it is also a statement on human behavior. The problems suffered by the characters are the result of their own folly, and no one else. The love story woven into the book is also wonderful, as it shows the characters concerned getting to know each other's positives and negatives before committing, instead of simply jumping into bed as the characters of modern novels do. This book is smartly written, with much humor. It is lighthearted and easy to read, although it was written over 200 years ago (the first draft of the book was written in the late 1700s, but not published until after 1800). I highly recommmend it to a reader of any age. It is, as Elizabeth Bennet would say, a &quot;happy thought, indeed.&quot;"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It feels a little strange and even presumptuous to review Jane Austen online. I was prompted to do so when reading other reviews dismissing Pride and Prejudice as nothing more than a silly romance and a relic of a bygone era.It would be silly to suggest that the social mores and manners that Austen skewered are unchanged. Young women are no longer dependent on a husband simply for food and shelter, and I have no intention of spending my life in a drawing room trimming hats and sewing screens. But it would also be silly to suggest that Austen's tale offers nothing to the modern reader. Even in our enlightened age, young women in indelicate situations are pressured by their humiliated families into unfortunate marriages. Manifestations of social standing may differ, but money, education, and other modern expressions of social class still play more of a role in the choice of spouses than most of us would wish to admit. And to this day, young men and women alike are mortified by their families in public situations, justified or unjustified.To fully appreciate Austen's sense of humor takes a bit of effort on the reader's part, but once acclimated to the language the hilarity of the book becomes apparent. Pride and Prejudice proves that classics need not be dull; Austen had a lively and sharp wit. If you are truly put off by the language, and don't get the humor, it's actually worthwhile to find a good production on video and rent it. The BBC version produced in the 1990's is long, but a very faithful and extremely well-cast adaptation that does an excellent job of translating Austen's humor onto the screen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this novel. It has everything you could possibly want in a book. Love, hate, comedy, and more. Every time Lizzy and Mr. Darcy are in the same room you can expect some kind of comedy. Lizzy's bizarre family (not counting Jane) would drive any man away.If Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bennet were real I wouldn't be able to understand how he could possibly stay married to this rude and ill-mannered woman. But since they're only characters in a book I would have to say that they are a perfectly matched couple. Each one posseses what the other does not.If you can get past the old English that Jane Austen wrote in, this is a great read and a wonderful romantic comedy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I always love reading about romance in England. Especially in the 17th &amp; 18th century. This book was no exception. Jane Austen dwells deep into human nature. How Elizabeth's pride is damaged, when Darcy refuses to dance with her &amp; becomes prejudiced against him by Mr. Wickham. How Darcy slowly finds himself falling in love with Elizabeth. All this is potrayed marvellously by Jane Austen. I loved it so much that I've read it about 5 times till now!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My mother has been trying to foist this book off on me for years, but I always resisted. I thought that the stodgy language, Victorian morality, and melodramatic romance would be tiresome and trite. I could not have been more wrong. I instantly fell in love with Elizabeth Bennett, the young heroine of this novel and the \\"prejudice\\" referred to in the book's title.Of course, the \\"pride\\" is the insufferable Mr. Darcy, who looks down upon Elizabeth, her four sisters and her ridiculously self-absorbed mother. However, what begins as outright animosity between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy blossoms into appreciation and finally true love. (I hope I didn't spoil the book for anyone, but if you didn't see the ending coming, you need to read more!)The language in this novel is terse, elegant and hilarious. Elizabeth can tell anyone off in such a way as to make the object of her wrath want to shrivel up and fall off the planet, all the while using beautiful language which contains not one bit of profanity. The characters in this story are also lovable and hilarious even with all their flaws: the narrow-minded and antagonistic Mrs. and Mr. Bennett, the cunning Mr. Wiccam, and my favorite of all characters--the youngest sister Lydia.The language contained in this novel is not an obstacle to reading it but is instead an absolute delight. If you have any sense of humor and romance whatsoever you will fall in love with these flawed characters and their absurd predicaments. Definitely a quick and enchanting read that made me laugh aloud!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austin, is a story of how a girl learns that the outward appearance can be deceiving. In this story many believe that a young man is quite awful. The two main characters, Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy, end up effecting each others lives and changing their ways of seeing. Jane Austin's story truly tells a story with many turns in the road.With great surprises this book is not easy to put down. When things happen sometimes the least expected people are the ones who are helpful. I found this an enjoyable story with a few exceptions.Although I didn't really mind the style of writing it may be confusing to a reader. The reason is because of the style used when the book was written. In some parts it was easy to lose concentration, but it would grab my attention again.This was a wonderful story and perhaps one that would be best to read over and over. Not all people would enjoy this book. I found that it told a good story that gives the message to never judge a book by its cover.This book may be considered a love story. It truly told how being prejudice doesn't mean you are right about someone. The lesson learned in this book should be a lesson we all know about so maybe we can save ourselves from making the mistake of judging one another."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a classic love story. When I first decided to read it I had no idea that it would be such a good book. The love conflicts between the characters really make you think about how important getting to know someone is before you marry them. It also makes you realize how much your views on someone can change when you are forced to become close to them. After reading Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice, I realize why it is considered to be a classic. You can imagine that you are Elizabeth, or you can imagine you are watching as Jane Bennet and Mr. Bingley fall in love. I recomend this book to people who would like to read a wonderful and emotionally stimulating novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is quite possibly the best book ever written. The plot is as real today as it was when it was written. The characters are strong and vivid. Its like stepping back in time to a place you've never been. If you enjoy the book, A&amp;E and the BBC made a wonderful mini-series adaptation of the story starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. Also for a more modern take on the same premise, read Bridget Jone's Diary by Helen Fielding."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen knew what she was talking about, way before a time were women had many rights. Her characters in this book are witty, charming, and well spoken. Her characters are well developed and the interaction between chacters are better then watching any movie, you are hooked from page one."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You are going to read many a review of Austen's PRIDE & PREJUDICE [P&P;] wherein the author of said review will, with great superciliousness, state that this novel is NOT just a chick book, NOT just a piece of fluff, but instead a work of such great sociological importance that its message cannot be ignored. I'm here to tell you different. P&P; is most DEFINITELY a chick book, ...This isn't to say that P&P; has no value to its readers. Certainly it must or English instructors would stop putting \\"OPTIONAL: AUSTEN OR THUMBSCREWS' on their syllibi. But what IS its value? The great moral lessons it imparts? Its grave lessons in proper deportment? Of course not. P&P; retains its value simply in being a good read. This is perhaps the most finely crafted love story of all time. Without the aid of a tip sheet from Harlequin, Austen manages to hit all the high points of a typical romance [excepting the lamentable lack of a sex scene], & still provide enough social commentary & moral/ethical guidance that even the most unromantic among us cannot but be interested. It is in this manner that Austen has for years been able to fool Academia into believe that her work is anything but a sweet little love story, albeit a decidedly complex one.Novels are read for different reasons. Some novels are important, and they are knighted with the celebrated title of \\"literature\\", and though no one truly knows why, or what makes them good literature, there is the vague idea that such works much teach you something. That nebulous idea of imparting some great knowledge or insight into our existence is imperative-it's one of the 3 miracles needed for a work to achieve the saintly shroud of \\"literature.\\" Some novels are just ..., but are read by the masses on the sly, tucked into their laps as they ride public transportation; the half-dressed, windswept maiden & man or the bloody, dripping knife on the cover safely hidden from view. Austen's P&P; truly fits in neither of these categories, though its square peg can be stuffed into \\"literature's\\" round hole with little abrasion. It is simply an ESSENTIAL novel, a must read for every generation, owing to the fact that it is an excellent story. It doesn't have to teach us anything. It simply has to be entertaining, and PRIDE & PREJUDICE is, to the utmost degree."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a wonderful look at the customs of marriage, love, and financial and social status in Regency England. It's message, that love is more important than financial gain, and that first impressions aren't always the best to base attitudes on, still ring true centuries later."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have been hooked on this book since I was 15 and read it for the first time. I have read it at least once a year since then and just hope for my Darcy to find me as well.The movie first got me interested in reading the book, but I must admit that I much prefer to read the book to watching the movie (although Colin Firth does have a lot to offer). I am always in suspense to see if Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy will come together and I am always so glad when they do.Read this once and then read it again, and again, and again, and again..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was not on any of my school reading lists so I did not come across it until I was almost 30. I am now 50 and have probably read it 10 times and seen every version of it on film...twice. It is a becutiful story of women and human nature. I have never had a problem seeing the Bennetts as my contemporaries. Anyone who reads this book will immediately recognize these characters and their situations. Women may be more independent today, but there are still women who seek marriages simply to validate themselves or their lifestyles. Not only have I enjoyed this book, I have learned from it. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book, it's funny in some spots and I can really relate to Elizibeth. I have always been closer to my dad, and very outspoken. She was for her time."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A mother's driving force is getting her five daughters married quickly; it hardly matters to whom. A suitor proposes, is summarily rejected and marries someone else within days. A woman doesn't like men but wants to get married anyway. A sixteen-year-old runs off with a man and doesn't marry him right away, much to the chagrin of both her parents and sisters. A mother has no use for her daughter's suitor but happily accepts him into the family because he is wealthy. The less money a family has, the more important it is that all their daughters marry and quickly. If the family lives in the country, they must work harder to get these daughters married. Sound like your favorite sitcom and/or your favorite cousin and her family? Well, it's Jane Austin's timeless PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. I recently reread this comedy of manners that I hadn't read since high school. Here we have much ado about getting the daughters married. Even though we in the U. S. have lived through the 60's and the &quot;Women's Movement,&quot; sixty percent of law students now are women, and many things have changed about the way young women are brought up and what they do with their lives, I still saw a lot of families I know here. Everything changes; yet everything remains the same.Everybody points out what is so unique about this novel as well as the rest of Austin's works. She does very little to place them in any given time. They are quite wonderful in what they don't tell us. Austin doesn't give us a lot of specificity about a lot of things. For example, The Bennetts are always entertaining yet we don't know much about what they eat other than &quot;venison&quot; or &quot;meat.&quot; While people often &quot;color&quot; when they blush, the only color named in the entire novel is blue; Wickham may wear a blue coat when he gets married. The young women often play music but we are never told the names of the pieces they play. We do know that Elizabeth plays rather badly. I kept thinking that these young girls have too much free time on their hands. They need more hobbies or part-time jobs. Of course young women of a certain station in Austin's day didn't work.The ironic first line of the novel is well-known: &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.&quot; With that great opener, we are off and running.Parts of this novel will make you smile; others will make your laugh. My favorite character is the father, Mr. Bennett, who is quick to see and point out his wife's and others' foibles but never sees his own."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I downloaded the illustrated Kindle version of Pride and Prejudice for free from Amazon. Thank you Amazon! This is one of my favorite books and one that I have re-read several times and will read again.OK. So you know this isn't a bitch and complain session and that I am appreciative of the freebies I have gotten from Amazon. So here it goes, the good, bad, and the suggestions.This illustrated version of Pride and Prejudice - offered by Amazon - is beautifully formatted for the Kindle. It is attractive and appealing and like most Kindle books is a pleasure to e-read.The only problem that I can see - or actually CAN'T see - is the muted e-ink illustrations or the text below each illustration. Even when I zoom in on the illustration, though I can see the illustration better, I still can't read the writing :( I have a Kindle DX (larger Kindle), so this must be a serious problem for people with regular 7 in. sized Kindles.If the e-ink problem with the nine illustrations were solved, I would gladly pay .99 cents for a copy of this partially illustrated book. If the problem were fixed AND each of the sixty-one chapters were presented with one of the Brock illustrations, I would gladly pay $9.99 for the e-book. And please don't tell me to buy the newer, smaller Kindle because the e-ink is sharper. I have tested it out at the store, and though somewhat sharper, it is not sharp enough to make up for 60 year old eyes when e-ink is muted.Any way, I will make due with this freebie from Amazon and keep searching the web site from time to time for the improved edition:)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice was published in 1813 in three volumes, the customary presentation of a novel in the early 19th Century. Penguin Press has provided Kindle owners with a wonderful enhanced version of the novel preserving the three volume format without attempting to standardize or modernize the text.The Penguin book is presented by Juliette Wells, Enhanced E-book Features Editor. It is edited with an introduction and informative notes by Vivien Jones. The result is a very readable yet scholarly treatment of the novel, with a biography of Jane Austen, 19th Century reviews of the book, descriptions of how to make tea and Jane Austen's eating habits, and much more.The last time I read Pride and Prejudice was in 1966 in an English literature class in college. I challenged the professor's choice of reading material as completely irrelevant given the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement and protests on my college campus, San Francisco State. It was a pleasure to reread the book with the wisdom of age supplemented by the excellent notes throughout the three volumes. Kindle owners can, with a spin of the wheel and a click, read explanations of the semantics of the vocabulary used by Austen, consider content interpretations, view illustrations of fashion, learn historical dance steps, and see period architecture.The focus of the production, of course, is the novel with its themes of first impressions, pride, vanity, seduction, feminism, prejudice, sexism, fatal attraction, society, intellectual domination, morality, etiquette, marriage, heritability, class structure, the family as a purposeful unit, and personal happiness. I highlighted many passages and notes to read again and enjoy. One example is from Volume 1 when Darcy says to Elizabeth, \\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.\\" Another example of my highlights is from Volume 2 when Elizabeth states, \\"The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense.\\" And here is an example of an explanatory note I highlighted from Volume 3, \\"e3. Elizabeth's determination here matches her effort throughout the novel to pursue what she considers to be her own happiness; compare her response to Mr. Collin's proposal of marriage in chapter 19.\\" The novel, notes, and other features allow the reader to experience the historical context of the first edition.Before reading Pride and Prejudice, I reread James Joyce's Ulysses on my Kindle with Don Gifford's Ulysses Annotated paperback book as a guide. It would have been a better reading experience to have this excellent source integrated with the novel. Penguin's enhanced e-books with built in reference features will be excellent for new publications of classic novels. I learned a great deal more about Austen's novel in the convenient Kindle format than I did 42 years ago in college. Hopefully, I'll be able to add many enhanced Penguin classics to my Kindle Library."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This edition has a nice binding and the illustrations are charming. However, the margins and type are both too large and the result is a 476 page book which is awkward to hold. The preface by George Saintsbury is one of my least favorite of any P & P edition I have read. Overall, I'm glad to own this copy, but I often read my Penguin Classics paperback copy instead."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"While this is an abridged version, very little of the story is really lost. This reader gives each character his/her own distinctive voice. The reading is lively with excellent pacing. I have had this on cassettes for a few years and have worn out the tapes from listening to them so much. I am now buying the CD."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There are numerous errors in this Kindle version of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Most of them are simple copyediting mistakes but occasionally dropped words entirely change the meaning of a sentence.This is NOT the way to experience one of the greatest novels in the English language. Amazon says that you save $3 and change by downloading this free Kindle version but what you lose is much more than that.This ebook should be replaced. Students should consult a professionally published version (Penguin, Oxford University Press) before writing papers or using quotations."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I adore and revere Austen and this book is, for me, the pinnacle. It's such a masterwork of the English language, so richly layered and textured and such a sharp observation of the society in which Austen lived. Read only at surface level, it seems little more than a sweet romance but when the text is examined deeply the mastery of Austen becomes apparent.Was Austen a feminist? I'm not entirely convinced of this but what I do know is that she was keenly, keenly aware of the way her world worked. She knew that the only power a woman had was to charm and flirt until she captured herself a rich husband. A woman did not have the power to seek her own occupation and a sharp and educated mind was not exactly appreciated. This is why Austen and her most bewitching heroine Elizabeth are so very subversive. Austen's creation, like Austen herself, bucks the convention of the time and is determined to see her life played out on her own terms. She will not settle for anything less than love and though that may seem simple to today's reader, it was anything but in an age when money and status meant everything. Elizabeth is not perfect. She makes mistakes and she is judgmental at times but her greatest strength is her determination to be true to herself.And yet even though Austen makes such a strong case for independence of spirit, she is also kind to those who bow to convention. Though Elizabeth's dear friend Charlotte makes a choice that initially seems extremely repugnant, it is easy to see that, really, Charlotte is simply doing what she must to survive. It is not that Charlotte is any less true to herself than Elizabeth, it is simply that she is rather more practical and pragmatic. She sees her situation in a very clear light and, in the end, chooses what is for her the lesser of two evils. I think that Austen respected this as well. Being brave and forging a new path is not for all of us.As for Darcy, he is also a product of his time. He behaves in a way that society feels a man should. At a very young age he must deal with gross abuses of his father's trust and a rather horrific betrayal of his family's kindness. He is forced to shoulder responsibility at a time when his peers may have been busy gambling and chasing skirts. There are few in whom Darcy can confide and he holds his cards so close to his chest that he must shut out others who could perhaps be of assistance to him. Though his wealth and status seem to suggest that he is above the slings and arrows of society, it turns out that this assumption is a naive one. Darcy is no more free to do whatever he likes than Elizabeth is.What makes this book so satisfying is that the hero and heroine triumph over their adverse circumstances. At heart, Austen was a romantic. She clearly had hope that the narrow confines of her world could stretch enough to allow for happiness and self-fulfillment. She believed in the power of love to conquer some very daunting obstacles and she believed that love could help people grow into a better version of themselves. I think it is this optimism that makes Austen so appealing to her readers."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable. The Enriched Classics edition is also nice because it includes footnotes explaining some of the language and/or references that were well known at the time but confusing today's readers.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were a few times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I originally read this for my sophmore English class, and didn't enjoy it too much because of all of the analysis we were required to do. I re-read it the following summer and discovered it makes much better leisure reading. I'd say the ideal audience is obviously female (considering the main character is the fiesty heroine Elizabeth Bennet), of any age.Even though it is a classic, it still manages to be quite a page-turner, with unexpected plot twists and witty dialogue. The most enjoyable aspect of this novel is watching the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy develop. I've read the book several more times, and each time I find myself anticipating their eventual confession of each others' feelings for one another. Although the ending of the story is predictable, it is how this ending is reached which makes for an interesting read.The book is largely character and dialogue-based, so I'd shy away from it if that isn't your thing. However, to any classics-lover, this book is a must! I'd also highly recommend viewing the BBC mini-series (the one featuring Colin Firth as Darcy, and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth) to fully experience the Georgian England setting. But, trust me, you won't want to simply ditch the book to watch the movie version. Nothing can quite compare to Jane Austen's original writing."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Like all the other jane austen books i loved this one just as much. jane austen is famous for her characterisation and this book proves it to you even more.elizabeth bennet and mr. darcy intertwined into their own fixed judgements and opinions make this book not just a must read for its witty satire and humour but for its indepth understanding of true love. eliza,prejudiced ....Darcy, too caught up with his high society unfold their true character gradually making you enthralled and wanting more.mr. collins the cousin, catheran de bourgh his patron bring out the best in subtle humour.mr. and mrs. bennet, both of them a class apart...their uniquely opposite personalities creating sparks. the four sisters: genuine, bingely:awesome...the story i leave for you to unravel. you'll love it to the best of your ability.trust me; you're caught. you won't be able to get your hands off it. its the work of a great woman and a great writer, a true genius who to me is just as equivalent to shakespeare. but then thats just me.a book that shows us how two minds can eventually meet and harbour friendship and love.

It is a page-turner even though I know how it ends. I wish to find its equivalent in contemporary literature."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a great book full of love, scandal, humor, wit, and drama. Whether you are young or old, I am positive that this novel has an aspect of interest that will catch your attention right away. Set in an 18th century English society, Jane Austen does a fantastic job of adding comic relief and wit to a society where men have almost ultimate control. The estate of the Bennet family is entailed to Mr. Collins, so the five Bennet daughters must find suitable husbands if they wish to have a home or property in the future. The book revolves around conversation and thoughts the characters have about each other. Austen never gives a complete physical description of the characters, so the reader is left to make an opinion on each character based on their first impression of them. This style of diction and syntax eventually leads to the discovery of a major theme: do not always trust your first impression of someone. Irony is another common device Austen used in the novel. The Bennet's second daughter, Elizabeth, and Mr. Darcy end up falling for each other despite every obstacle that was thrown at them. Problems with social status, money, Mr. Darcy's pride, and Elizabeth's refusal to settle on a man caused drama in the beginning stages in their relationship. The novel's ending proved that one should not judge a person on a first impression and that true love truly can conquer all. Those facts will always make to novel relevant to current times, contrary to those who call the novel out of date. Read this novel and fall in love!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A classic!

And I can't count the number of times I've read it since then! Jane Austen is a wonderful writer... Lizzy is an amazing character to follow and fall in love with. Mr. Darcy... so dark and mysterious and stern. I love reading about the social and societal customs and ideals... it's so very interesting, so different from life today. No matter what mood I'm in, I can flip to Pride and Prejudice and feel warm, cozy, and content within minutes. Favorite book of all time. Weeeell.. Pride and Prejudice is in direct competition with Harry Potter.. for the spot of 'favorite book of all time.' But it's definitely right up there.

At first, she thinks he is prideful and prejudiced. But after knowing him, they kinda fall in love...I am doing a book cube project on this book, and this book is completly AMAZING!!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A mother's driving force is getting her five daughters married quickly; it hardly matters to whom. A suitor proposes, is summarily rejected and marries someone else within days. A woman doesn't like men but wants to get married anyway. A sixteen-year-old runs off with a man and doesn't marry him right away, much to the dismay of both her parents and sisters. A mother has no use for her daughter's suitor but happily accepts him into the family because he is rich. The less money a family has, the more important it is that all their daughters marry and quickly. If the family lives in the country, they must work harder to get these daughters married. Sound like your favorite sitcom and/or your favorite cousin and her family? Well, it's Jane Austin's timeless PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Here we have much ado about getting the daughters married.Everybody points out what is so unique about this novel as well as the rest of Austin's works. She does very little to place them in any given time. They are good because of what they don't tell us. Austin doesn't give us a lot of specificity about a lot of things. For example, The Bennetts are always entertaining yet we don't know much about what they eat other than \\"venison\\" or \\"meat.\\" Wickham may wear a blue coat when he gets married. The young women often play music but we are never told the names of the pieces they play.The ironic first line of the novel is well-known: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" With that great opener, we are off to the races.Parts of this novel will make you smile; others will make your laugh. My favorite character is the father, Mr. Bennett, who is quick to see and point out his wife's and others' foibles but never sees his own. Somehow it seemed Jane Austen anticipated the future when much of her character's behavior would be seen as folly, though we certainly have follies of our own today."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's works are always engaging, entertaining, heart-warming, and funny. So well written and so much more true romance than any dime store novel ever could attain to be. The only downside is that this copy seems to have some glitch where it will double a sentence and place that 2nd sentence a few paragraphs later but it's in a way that it's obvious it doesn't belong there. The only thing I could figure was that in the hard copy there is some book print style picture with a quote from the book under it as would be typical in many books of this type and that in the kindle version it just doesn't show the picture."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved the book, a well-known English classic, and felt compelled to give it a good rating. I do have one criticism of the eBook format for this particular edition. While I was reading through the book I noticed, more than 100 times, that the book was inappropriately formatted. There were new paragraphs where no paragraphs should be (...Mr. (praragraph inserted) Darcy...), this was only a minor distraction, but it did become a bit annoying, and it is an easy problem to fix. Paragraph insertion also took place between sentences, this became especially confusing with paragraph long dialogues. Great book, but the formatting needs a bit of work"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The Collins classics version is outstanding. It's inexpensive ($6 or so when I purchased), though compact it is very legible. The paper is thick enough so that the font on the other side doesn't show through. Binding is tight though the spine gets bent quite a lot even after one read through. What I particularly enjoyed was the Collins classic English literature dictionary in the back. It includes many outdated or no longer used terms and words so that you don't have to reach for the computer if you don't really know what an 'entail' is or what 'persnickety' means. But it is a compact, standard mass market paperback size, and that's my one beef.As for the novel. Classic English literature is amazing, and this novel is one of the cornerstones of the 19th century English literature scene. Along with Dickens and the Bronte sisters, Austen's novels seem to capture the lives of the English in these times. Though Pride and Prejudice deals mainly with the wealthy, or at least the privileged class, we get to see a wonderful story unfold. Like the title states, this story deals with the pride of one character and the prejudice of another. Many peripheral plots unfold and help add to the overall story while the main plot moves along quite well.It's a novel that is often placed on reading lists in school, though I feel that in reading this in my early 30s that I can really truly grasp the emotions and trials of these characters more completely. If you read this when young, then do yourself a service and re-read this novel. It's amazing! Then watch the Colin Firth BBC series."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Absolutely amazing! Probably my favorite book ever, and that's a lot coming from an English major. Most would agree it's Austen's best work."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A classic for a reason.One has to concentrate on the verse.

This is that book. Clever, compelling, and wonderfully crafted - P&P is the very best of Jane."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"That's probably one of the most famous opening sentences of a novel, along with Moby Dick. Pride and Prejudice is also probably one of Jane Austen's most famous novels. I certainly liked it much more than Northanger Abbey. It is the story of Elizabeth Bennet, who lives with five sisters, and an odd pair of parents at Longbourn. Her mother is constantly scheming about marrying off her daughters to wealthy young men, so when Netherfield Park is let to the rich Mr. Bingley, she is very excited indeed. (Mr. Bennet's estate will be entailed away from the immediate family upon his death, so at least one of the sisters has to marry well to provide for them.) And Mr. Bingley brings his very proud friend, Mr. Darcy. The book is about the courtships, and, of course, has many twists and turns. Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley, Mr. Wickham, and I suppose, the detestable Mr. Collins (who the estate will be entailed to) are the main men of the story.I really loved this one; it had humor and wit in it, and great characters. I enjoyed Mr. Bennet and his sarcasm very much, though Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are really too silly sometimes. So stupid. And of course, Elizabeth. She is really a very smart and spirited young woman, who will not be ordered around. I also watched the 1995 TV series from BBC, and I must confess, Mr. Darcy...never mind.Anyway, all the characters were well portrayed, and while the TV series is wonderful, it doesn't quite have the subtlety of the conversations in Pride and Prejudice itself. The TV series did have excellent casting though; all the Bennets, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Collins were portrayed very well. (Yes, I suppose this is sort of a double review.) I would say though, that Caroline Bingley should have been a little prettier; she was just hideous, and Mr. Bingley was kind of silly-looking. But everywhere else, they did very well.Back to the book. As I said, there were many twists and turns which made this one a thoroughly enjoyable read. And really great characters. Though she is certainly less descriptive and florid than Dickens, Austen still manages in this one, to portray everyone extremely well. Mr. Collins really is detestable, Bingley overly-cheerful and positive, and Darcy stiff and stern (though he has his reasons, of course.) Mrs. Bennet is an extremely foolish woman, as is Lydia, the youngest Bennet. The pride and prejudice of the story refer, I believe, to Mr. Darcy's pride and Elizabeth's prejudice (though it is certainly debatable.) Mr. Darcy is very proud indeed at the beginning of the story, and Elizabeth's prejudice prevents her from seeing his true character for a while.I will just add that I read the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition from 2009, and while it has a very nice design, it does not have any analysis or introduction, so if you want that you'd be better off reading the Penguin Classics regular edition or Oxford World Classics. However, my Penguin Classics Deluxe edition arrived slightly damaged on the spine, which was a disappointment.[...]"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Can you imagine a more classic tale of romance?You are immediately transported back to the 19th century--I want tobring this book with me every time I travel to the English countryside.More than any other novel, this story really captures Austen's wit.Books these days are so lackluster in comparison, and it's becomeso incredibly hard to find a hero to live up to Darcy. I'm never, everbored when I pick this up--even on the hundredth read!PLEASE give this one a shot if you haven't already--you won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Blame Jane - Austen that is - for The Marriage Plot: the idea that a woman's ambition and happiness rests solely upon marriage to a man; and that she is free to use any means to land her man, including to a great degree: gossip, deceit, and deception. In addition, she need not worry that he is not the ideal man, for she can mold him into what it is she wants because he is witless--putty in her hands. Unless he is a scoundrel, who turns the plot upside down on an unsuspecting nubile. Cheers, Mr. Wickham.Nora Roberts owes Austen for her fortune and success. Austen was the pioneer that many other romance writers have followed. Not only writers, but including real girls and women for, apparently, centuries, right on up to today; and is responsible for much of marriage's misery (sometimes for some people.) For some, I know, The Marriage Plot works.Jane Austen was a young, little (Actually, I don't know if she was little or what she looked like - but I do know she had one fine imagination.) twerp--writing wishful fantasies in her attic about things she had little experience with, having never been married, or \`properly in love,' or, \\"\`violently in love.\\"' Thank goodness she didn't write sex scenes.Oh Miss Bennet, no not you Jane, or you Mary, or her niece, or the other sister, or her cousin, or his cousin - yes, you Elizabeth, the creature that is Mr. Bennet's daughter, or should I call you Lizzy? Eliza? The writing is often confusing and redundant and nothing happens but gossip and sideways conversations - which is probably accurate for the times. It certainly is today. So there is that. If Austen were alive today she might be a stand-up comic. She's funny, and if you can muddle through the bad writing - amusing and entertaining. I struggled to finish the book, but then I'm not a fan of The Marriage Plot nor bad writing. Nevertheless - five stars because she was way ahead of her time - a true pioneer."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I LOVE the movie so I decided to finally read the book. It's great! Beautifully written. I downloaded it to my kindle. It has quickly become a favorite of mine."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What sets this work apart from many others is that the story is so well focused that one does not lose track of any of the main characters. Really, there is no need for sequels because all the loose ends are tied up. For that reason, Austen has given us a remarkable masterpiece.I will not go into the plot, you need to read it, but just know that this book is at one time a fanciful and a serious examination of the lives of women in the neoclassical era."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was one of the remaining Austen novels I have not read (Northanger Abbey is the other one). Emma, Mansfield Park, Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion...loved them all. So I figured it was about time I pick this one up off my shelf.Boy, I was not disappointed! It almost felt like coming back to an old friend, even though I have never read P&P; before. But I know the story very well, having fallen in love with the BBC series. And I loved it. I loved it so much that I don't know what to say. It is that good. And it is jumping right up to the top of my all-time favorite lists.It's witty - I love the early banter between Mr Darcy and Elizabeth when Jane is recovering from an illness at Mr Bingley's home. It's funny - Mr Collins just cracks me up, and you just have to laugh at Mrs Bennett's scheming. Almost 200 years later, it is still a page turner. And as much as I love reading classics, I would not describe most of them as a page turner!It is also a comfort book. I can't help but love almost all of the characters, despite their flaws. Immersing yourself in the novel is like having a cup of tea with an old friend. It's a joy to read, and I am positive that over the years I will be reading it again...and again...and again."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was so interesting! I sat reading and could hardly put it down. It has great suspense which I truly enjoyed. I am a romantic and anything that ends in true love is great. However most of the language (old English) can be challenging to read initially but you eventually get used to it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was maybe 10 or 11 years old. I came across it in my elementary school library, and was hesitant at first because the title suggested similarity to Crime & Punishment (let's be frank, Dostoevsky simply cannot appeal to a relatively normal 5th grader). I was way off base in this assumption, and have been smitten with P&P ever since that first reading. The story & characters never get old, and although some adaptations & variations are enjoyable to read, nothing can ever be quite like the original. If you haven't done so yet, read it. Please. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a complete masterpiece. I was very disappointed at myself for not reading it sooner. I will recommend this book to anyone who loves reading. Everyone should read this at-least once."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book. Reading it after I saw the movie helped me make a mental movie of what is going on as I read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you- are over 20s- want to have a girlfriend- can't understand womenthen you must read this book.Also it is free for a while. ;)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I don't know what took me so long to read this book. I loved it. While most of my friends would not see how funny this book really is or understand the romance of it, I found it one of the best books I have ever read. Obviously."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book lives up to what it is supposed to be--a classic love story. I can easily identify with and like the main character, Elizabeth. Throughout the book, I find it's easy to sympathize with her when she's embarrassed by her family or angry with Darcy. I feel her love for her sister. And, of course, I feel her anger and dislike for Darcy and the feelings of attraction and love that start to take their place. This is a love story. If you want to read a love story, read this book. If you're not interested in that type of thing, then pass this up. I promise you, though, that if you're interested in reading a simple love story, then this is a great one."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"But I'm going to read it now and find out--have just in fact borrowed the book itself this minute from me local library where Pat, a woman as it turns out and a reference librarian to boot, procured a paperback edition from the stacks and placed it right beside me here at the computer which I have to use now in the library coz I don't yet have a box of rocks installed back in the hut. I do have a clock and a radio though. And a calendar too although strictly speaking that particular item is made out of paper. I do believe that I am going to bigly dig Pride and Prejudice in any case, hence the bold five stars. Well for starters it's considered a classic, innit? Plus I am very favourably disposed towards this writer on account of having read and thoroughly enjoyed some years ago the very bleeding brilliant Persuasion. That truly is a lovely book that is and an abiding pleasure to read. The BBC made a great film version of Persuasion too so they did, in the middle 90s and not long after I savoured this memorable novel for the first time, with deeply satisfying turns by Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. That little flick still strikes all the right notes for me. And so happily on to P&P."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is the unabridged 1945 Hardcover (cloth) Book Club edition - which means it's just as great as it should be, since it IS Pride & Prejudice, but also that the book club-iness makes it not as valuable as it looks. This version has full page colored pictures of the characters through-out, and has that traditional deckled edge (uneven cut pages - makes it easier to turn pages imho).The book is a cute love-story about Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy set in that classic early 1800's English period where manners and one's dictated social existence means far more than independence and general happiness. You HAVE to take into the account the current society of the time period / location to understand the predicaments. The story is witty, albeit wordy but still very enjoyable even after ~200+ years.THIS is the version I was looking for, hard cover, ancient looking and good quality! Perfect for my personal PHYSICAL library! I have the Kindle version and yes, that comes with a huge amount of spelling errors and paragraphs broken up mid-sentence. BUT the Kindle edition is FREE a good deal of the time so you end up getting what you paid for... ;)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Firstly, I've changed the page count. With the additional notes and whatnot, the book is the number of pages first listed. The story itself is the number in the parentheses.On to the review! I'd always loved the Pride and Prejudice movie; the one from 2005 (I've never seen the really long one). I automatically fell in love with the story, just because I'm such a romantic and found everything about the characters and story so incredibly sweet. Finally, I dragged myself to Borders and forced myself (slash my mother, because I'm broke, hahah) to finally buy the book. I was not disappointed. I love old-fashioned stories, with old-fashioned language and learning about how they did things way back then. It's entertaining on all levels! Mrs. Bennet, though, could drive any sane person crazy, but she's leveled out by Mr. Bennet and her two sensible daughters, Elizabeth and Jane.The love story between Darcy and Elizabeth is priceless; I can see why this book is considered such a classic. However, this isn't a book to be recommended to someone who doesn't like lengthy descriptions and can't really translate nineteenth century speaking into modern day language. You will not understand a thing that is going on. If you read young adult romances and nothing else, this isn't the book for you. For the more mature teenager and adults who love a classic, read on!Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"P & P is one of my favorite books.

I knew the story really well, from all the movies, etc. But I really enjoyed reading it, especially for as cheap as it is on amazon!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"[...]Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen has got to have one of the best male characters of all time, Mr. Darcy. I won't go into detail about the plot, it's a tried and true story, done many times in many forms of movie, I'll cover just a few here. But Mr. Darcy is the epitome of men. A specimen worth lusting over, he is the type of man that all women secretly want. Tall, handsome, and true, he is arrogant, prideful (or not prideful? That's for you to decide), and conceited. He's the type of man that although confident, will make you feel like once he takes you in his arms, you are safe and loved forever. There are many wonderful reasons to read this book, but I believe Mr. Darcy is the main reason women have been reading it for generations.Besides Mr. Darcy, my next favorite characters are Lizzie and her father, a relationship worth noting. They have an affection and understanding betwixt them that is both endearing and enviable. He understands her in a way that most don't and does his best to protect her from her worst enemy, her mother, the one who is always trying to give her away to the first available man. He is commendable. The other daughters are not as noteworthy, obviously Lydia is meant to be childish and annoying and it comes across well. Someone should have slapped that child silly. I almost wish two characters, Mary, the middle sister, and Charlotte, Elizabeth's best friend, had gotten more play. I understand Charlotte was there to represent the many women out there that are sensible and marry for reasons other than love, and so we need her, but it didn't seem fair she got the short end of the stick. And poor Mary, who just wanted to shine in her own way, whether through her demurely moral comments or her piano playing, and was often ignored or rebuffed. I think she had merit and would have liked to see her end up with someone. Alas, it was Elizabeth's story, and more so Mr. Darcy's and so we must focus on them. I absolutely loved it and it was just another example of Austen's genius.[...]"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was a nice, romantic novel with lovely descriptions allowing you to transport fully into the story. There were ironies and plenty of opportunities to dwell on the intricacies of the characters. Books today are rarely written with the depth of language and description found in Pride and Prejudice.

I only purchase the Barnes and Noble collection for my classic books because they look nice together on shelves and have interesting introductions."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Best novel ever!! And this one is the perfect size to tote around while on vacation or commuting. It is very small, but still easy to read. I really like the satin ribbon bookmark that is attached to the spine. I'd check out all of the novels in the mini gramercy collection and snatch up the titles you like. I hope they come out with more!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've read this book twelve times, and I will never get bored with it. I'm hoplessly romantic, and I love the different conflicts, the interesting and independent characters, the plot twists, and the happily ever after at the end. Elizabeth Bennet is an independent, youthful, clever, and witty young woman in the eighteen hundreds. She is my favorite character in the novel, and has a wonderful spunky nature that keeps the book alive. The characters are fully formed and realistic, from beautiful Jane to the hilarious Mrs. Bennet. This is, by far, the best Jane Austen book ever published, and recommend it very strongly for anyone starting to read eighteenth and nineteenth century literature."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have no right to review Jane Austen. I give this book 5 billion stars."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is probably the most classic romance novel of all time. I get shivers every time I re-read it and fall in love with the story over and over. While I love most of Austen's other books, this is the one I return to at least once a year."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is truly a love story classic. I enjoy all of Jane Austen's work, but this one has always been my favorite. It is beautifully written and has a wonderful ensemble of characters that give real life to the story. Their loss is your loss, and their joy is your joy.A must to read and cherish forever."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In high school, my enjoyment of old European art was always hampered by my gratitude that I'm not any of these exasperating people or in any of their stifling situations. I felt so blessed and superior that I escaped sitting around mending bonnets all day, waiting to go on a walk- how boring and pathetic! Upon rereading this years later, I was able to let go of these old prejudices and more objectively view the characters in the situation they were in. That was when I realized Austen is a genius: I saw how much she understands and subtly, humorously conveys, and how little I'd understood before. Now I actually consider this to be a work of rationalist literature, in addition to a brilliant romantic comedy.In my previous reading, I thought that the only intelligent, reasonable character was Mr. Darcy, and that everyone else's problems was brought on by their own idiocy, of which their unjust hatred of the virtuous, blameless Mr. Darcy was only further evidence. This time around, I realized that he caused some of these problems himself. Mr. Darcy's arrogance caused problems he could've easily avoided by being slightly nicer. Instead, he prided himself in his bluntness and in his own virtuousness, thus causing people to resent him, because who likes someone who thinks he's better than you, even if he actually is? Similarly, Lizzy demonstrates all of our tendencies to like and be less questioning of information coming from someone who flatters us. This causes us to have errors in judgment and believe things we would otherwise be more critical of. Mr. Darcy shows an amazing ability to step outside personal biases and view things from other's perspectives- a rationalist romantic hero! Austen understood the female wish: a rich, moral, loyal man completely rational about all things, except for his irrational love for his weird woman."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Truly one of the best stories of all time. Pride and Prejudice will always be a classic. Bravo Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you like romantic classics you do not need my advice...if not do not read this book!

I did not find the plot particularly interesting, nor the characters particularly engaging. Then why give it four stars?Because, dear readers, it is perfectly possible to not enjoy something and still hold a great deal of respect for it, and there are very few reviews that acknowledge this fact. Personally, I have never been particularly interested in domestic drama of the 19th century, but this is an important work, and should be read on that merit at least. Many readers seem to forget that at the time of writing, women did only have the choice to marry, and for an upper-class young lady, marrying a rich man was her only option. After all, she could not work, because there was a universal horror of being \\"in trade\\" (witness Mr. Darcy's extreme rudeness to Elizabeth having relatives who actually worked). Mrs. Bennett, shallow and stupid though she was, did have a legitimate reason to be worried, since the extremely sexist inheritance laws meant that she and her daughters were to be turned out of their home and onto the charity of relatives the moment her husband died. Small wonder that marrying each of them off was her only concern.Even if one can not enjoy the book, modern women can still look back with a thrill of horror over this idea of being birds in gilded cages - being essentially the property of their fathers and husbands, with nothing to do but stack up \\"accomplishments\\" (see Mary Bennett). Jane Austen recognized the whole thing as the barely disguised slave market it was and wrote biting criticisms, smuggled into stories about romance and marriage. And that is why, though I do not enjoy her subject matter or her writing style in particular, I hold the greatest regard for her as a writer and would recommend the book on technical merit and historical interest in the very least."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What a wonderful book! This book was even better the 2nd time and now that I have brushed up on my P&P, I will hopefully be reading Mr. Darcy's Obsession next month. I love the book, \\"pride and prejudice\\" it's a wonderful story about a family in the 1700's and the classes of society. Reminds us how different things were. Has a Dramatic story with a beautiful classic love story intertwined. If I was to chose a modern day version of this book it would be Bridget Jones Diary, because she is in love with the man who is not who he seems to be, despises another man who she sees so wrong. Ends up falling in love with the man she thought of as a horrible man. What a great read. I also love my new book light! Target 9.99 was the best investment ever. I was surprised I was able to finish this book while we had company here, but with a few sleepless nights I breezed right through this book. I give this book 5 stars"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have to start off by saying that the book description here is awful. Will sister Jane marry Mr. Bingley? Will the arrogant Lady Catherine de Burgh's intrigues be foiled? WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO SISTER LYDIA?Who cares?!Unfortunately, that's actually not that unfair a representation of the book's contents. I read it well over a decade ago, maybe just out of high school, and that would about sum up what I thought of it then. I thought I should give it another chance, though---and to be fair, there is a bit more substance (and style!) to the novel than that. It did take me a while to get into, though---it is rather dry for stretches, and nearly every character is not just unsympathetic, but almost intolerable. But by the end, I was very interested in the fate of Elizabeth, who was the only almost wholly likable character.Thematically, I have mixed feelings...on the one hand, it's nice that Elizabeth wants to marry out of affection, and not just for reasons of family, connections, wealth, etc. This comes out especially in her conversation with Lady de Burgh toward the end when the latter comes to exact her promise not to marry Mr. Darcy (which was the best part of the book). However, you still have to kind of wonder whether Elizabeth would have fallen in love with Mr. Darcy and wanted to marry him if he weren't quite so wealthy...when one of her sisters asks her when she started falling in love with him, she replies, \\"When I first saw the grounds at Pemberley!\\" (Mr. Darcy's estate), or something to that effect. She is joking, of course...but maybe not entirely.Also, I found it depressing how almost every other female character in the book made connections based primarily on those reasons of connections and such, or worse...Elizabeth's friend Charlotte accepts the proposal of a man she clearly doesn't love (just two days after he had proposed to Elizabeth) and who is utterly obnoxious, just to gain a bit of security; her sister Lydia is basically forced at the age of fifteen to marry the biggest scoundrel in the book, whose own consent to marry the girl is bought off him for an exorbitant blackmail bribe by Mr. Darcy (who does this for love of Elizabeth---how is this supposed to be a romantic gesture again, exactly?). Of course, I realize Austen did these things as foils to contrast with Elizabeth's own case, but to me it was still rather unpleasant and somewhat undercut the romance of the story.But the main storyline involving Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is nice, and there is a lot of genuinely amusing wit in Austen's writing (particularly in the character of Mr. Bennett, who you have to wonder why he married the incredibly annoying Mrs. Bennett in the first place---Austen pretty much just chalks it up to a youthful mistake on his part). On the whole, worth reading once, or maybe twice if you were too young to appreciate it the first time around, but I doubt I'll be revisiting it again...at least not for another couple of decades!Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I doubt I'm saying anything here that someone somewhere hasn't already said... but, here it goes! In my own opinion...Perhaps one of the best books ever written, Austen takes us into 19th century rural England, where a woman's primary duty was to marry and marry well, since inheritance was out of the question. This novel tells the classic story of the rich, eligible bachelor, Fitzwilliam Darcy, who could have anyone he wanted, and young, but outspoken and bold Elizabeth Bennet, the second eldest of five girls who's family lives fairly well but ranks rather low on the social class spectrum. Hence, it's expected that she would marry should she be offered a reasonable and comfortable home, regardless of how she feels.Elizabeth Bennet may be one of literature's best heroines. Her complex and genuine character, her honesty and courage to remain true to herself regardless of the situation, makes her a lovable heroine, and one that can be related to regardless of time period. And let's admit, she is just downright witty. Darcy, while mistakenly perceived as proud and arrogant, turns out to be one the most gentlemanly and courteous men, a kind soul and romantic heart once he lets down his guard and exposes his true self. His qualities are ones women still crave to find in men today.The characters, realistic and well-rounded, the accurate portrayal of 19th century British social life and setting, and Austen's superb writing creates a masterpiece full of romance, pride, social status, family values, and prejudice. This timeless romantic tale is one of the best love stories of all time, a true classic! I absolutely adored this book!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was a good book. I loved the movie and liked the book more because I got to know more about the story throuogh the book. The only problem that I had was the style of the writing. It was a little hard to read and understand, but they did have a glossery in the back of the book that told you what everything ment that you don't understand."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"P&P has a well-deserved spot amongst the classics. It's insightful, humorous, poignant and impeccably well crafted. As an astute observer of human nature, Austen was a genius at creating characters.

Especially so after seeing his BBC movie \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (or maybe it was the other way around). Anyway I loved that movie. I watched it so many times it made me want to read the book. I bought a hard copy edition but never took time to read it, just kept watching that movie. Kindle had a free edition, I said what the heck and I loaded it. Knowing the story already, I delved into the book. Happy was I to see that the movie was almost totally in sync with the book! I absolutely love the story. The \\"prejudiced\\" Lizzy reluctantly falling in love with the \\"proud\\" Darcy, and the Darcy who had too much Pride to get over his Prejudice towards her \\"lowly connections.\\"I will read it again definitely; it's got to be my favorite book, especially in the classics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Two hundred Years this book has been around & still a bestseller. Sure the language is verbose & flowery , But Never has one book spawned hundreds of cookie cutter wannabees. Nothing will ever compare to the wonder that is this book. Jane Austen was a people watcher,I'll bet. As a writer, Jane Knew how to get under the characters skin to bare their souls of what mattered to them. What still matters to us.It was a satire of the times. Middle Class Women had to marry well because if they didn't they would be homeless or working at the lowest of jobs.So,alot of times they married the first dude that asked them to dance.I think Jane saw how unhappy the women surrounding her were in marraiges without any common ground or affection.She also explores the intricities of marriage and how differant personalities date and eventually marry. For some love for starts like a raging fire only to evaporate in middle age, for some love seems to elude them for no good reason ,and for others it comes softly at the strangest time. Some couples are dear friends, some roommates,others HAD TO GET MARRIED.Above all ,Ms. Austen shows us that Love can be savage,beautiful,tragic ,sudden,brutal,frightening,awkward,exciting,mysterious and confusing. That, my friends will never change.If this isn't enough reason to read this book, At least check it out for Lizzy Bennet and her well meaning,goofy mother, who loves playing matchmaker. Even though she is bad at it.Lizzy is everywoman. The men want to date her and women want to be like her."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book...it is a look into the window of how people use to behave in such a comical fashion."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Dearest Readers of the century first and twentyith,I prooffer my highest and most esteemed recommendation of this fine book. Be not intimidated by formal British writing style of nearly 200 years ago, the occasional serpentine sentence, and words not oft' seen since the SAT exams (if at all). You will be highly rewarded with a most engaging story, skilled character development, and above all, acerbic wit. I trust you will be as delighted as this reviewer to have the felicity of reading this book.Very truly yours...P.S. Any 21st century western female reading this book will likely be as relieved as I am that we no longer live in a society where property conveys automatically to men, and women are totally dependent on men for their support. It's easy to understand why one character married for money and security only, and why the protognist's mother was completely obssessed with marrying off her daughters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a great read and Jane Austen is a gifted writer whose development of likable characters will be enjoyed for still more generations. It is hard at first to adjust to the language of the 1800s but is well worth the effort. Once the story begins to unfold you will not want to put it down. I also highly recommend Mansfield Park also by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

Give the gift of reading to all people you hold dear, it is a gift they will cherish forever!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Kindle owners hopefully are aware of the wealth of free editions of the classics which are available through Feedbooks and other sources.I obtained a copy of P&P; from feedbooks originally and while it was easy to get and the price was right, the overall quality of the text is not great.

Also,I prefer the A & E adaptation of the book(Double DVD). The version with KEIRA KNIGHTLY is o.K, but the former adaptation has actors that are more creditable as their characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is probably the most well-read book written by Jane Austen.The story revolves around the Bennet family that has five daughters, and a mother seeking to get them married to rich men. Elizabeth Bennet, the energetic and charming second daughter, is the main focus and heroine in the novel. She meets rich and stuck-up (or so she thinks) Mr. Darcy at a ball, starting a very interesting, and tumultuous relationship. Upon their first meeting Elizabeth and Darcy lets prejudice cloud their impression of each other. And later on, both were too prideful to correct the other's wrong assumption. Hence, the title Pride and Prejudice.This novel can be aptly considered a classic since readers have always been fascinated with the in and outs of the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy. But other than the captivating story line, Austen also writes wonderful descriptions depicting the 19th century life of people in England. Even though her description without dialogue may seem long, her subtle humor makes it lively and interesting to read. Seeing its success, it is hard to imagine that Pride and Prejudice was rejected by publishers initially.Armchair Interviews says: If you have not read this book, you are missing out on a great novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable. The Enriched Classics edition is also nice because it includes footnotes explaining some of the language and/or references that were well known at the time but confusing today's readers.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm sure there are a multitude reviews on the actual story of P&P;, to which, I'm sure, I can add very little. I will, therefore, just say that this is one of my favorite books. I read it several times a year. This is, without a doubt, one of the best novels ever written.I mostly wish to comment on this particular edition of the book (Robert Frederick Ltd.). I just bought it, today, at the local used book store. I already have another copy and decided that an illustrated edition would be a nice addition to my book collection.The hardback book is of fair quality. I'm not sure if this book originally came with a dust jacket or not, but this one doesn't have one. There is a picture of a man and woman, dressed in Regency period clothing, walking on a wooded path. I'm sure, if there is a dust jacket, the picture is probably the same.The spine is a bright pink color and the title on the cover is surrounded by a bright pink oval.Inside, the pages are made of good quality paper. There are black and white illustrations. They are well drawn. There is a picture placed above every chapter heading, either of a scene from the previous chapter or the forthcoming one. There are also pictures placed randomly throughout the book.I would say this book would make an excellent first copy for a young girl."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The book Pride and Prejudice was a book about love and its consequences. This book tell us about the life of people on the 19th century in England, how they lived and how they felt. It also shows a true story of love, how sometimes pride can be stronger that the love that people feel, and marry for love and not for social status which happen to woman very often back then. Elizabeth Bennet is the second oldest child on her family. She is a strong, intelligent, and a beautiful, independent girl, she makes good judgments of others and must live with the consequences of her prejudice.

It could happen anywhere, to anyone, at any time. Which is why I related to it, I could see what happened in the book could very likely happen in my time(and I wouldn't mind it happening to me, ;).)Also, I like the strength of Elizabeth's character.

It appears that both these characters had a little bit of both...Anyway, the characters were very believable, with feelingsand emotions that were surprisingly accurate.Everyone came out a winner in the end. I particularly likedMr. Darcy's reactions (or actions) to Elizabeth's retorts to his proposal. In all cases, they were both right in their own ways.

The first time I read it, I was amazed by the eloquent but simple writing of Jane Austen. The second time I read it, I was astounded by the way the charactors were portrayed. The third time I read it, I was blown away by the plot, and the rich detials and descriptions that surrounded her story. Since then, every time I read it I am more and more captivated by the certain truthfulness and plain exertion of human nature. The writing is of incredible quality. I would say that this novel is one of the best I have ever read, second only to Les Miserables."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After reading this book I thought that if the early 19th century had soap operas, they would be a little like this. I thought I was going to be bored but I was quickly proven wrong. The best parts of the book is when Elizabeth is around Mr. Darcy (you'll see why). I found Mrs. Bennett (Elizabeth's mother) to have a sort of comic role(you might agree with me). And the juicy secrets revealed later in the book will have your jaw wide open. By the end of the book you'll fall in love with the charactors and you might be tempted to read it again (I know I did). There is a reason why this is Jane Austen's most widely read and most loved book: It's just entertaining reading!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The story is a little bit complicated at the beginning because of the many protagonists introduced but in the end it is quite remarkable and gives you some insight into the life of the English landed entry.When you have read this book and and also understood its content, you will agree that it has been worth reading even if it is only for the language used. Since I have really enjoyed it, I would give it top marks."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I want to recommend you this novel,\\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Have you ever heard \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Jane Austen\\"? I read it two times, last year and early this year. It's very interesting for me to read this book.Jane Austen lived small village so her view about world is limited and her works mainly deal with marriage. A model example is 'Pride and Prejudice'.There are many character in the novel. Many man character and woman character enter the story. At first, each person misunderstand each other but they remove misunderstanding and finally many man and woman character fall in love each other. The story is happy ending.Many character point the other man's mistake but they don't know their mistake. They realize that they made a misunderstanding, they begin to know themselves mistake. I think many people make a mistake like the character's mistake. I also the same so I read this novel and realized many things. I presume that maybe the novel teach you many things.The novel show character of realism. Generally realism literary work explain everything in details. 'Pride and Prejudice' is the same. Writer explain everything very detailed so people said that realism literary work is limited people's imagination. I don't agree with that because I think that the more detailed writer describe, the more detailed we image. For example, if the writer describe like that \\"There are a table and chair and a flower vase and so on.\\", I can image like that \\"maybe the table color is black and chair color is same, and.. maybe the flower are rose and forget-me-not. So I think realism literary works can make us more imaginative, just my opinion.I recommend 'Pride and Prejudice'. I'm sure that you'll be intersted in this novel and Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I cannot even hope to do justice to how well written this book is. For the reasons already stated here by others and many more I love this book! I have read it a good 10 times and I never seem to tire of it. Through a stroke of genius that is purely her, Jane Austen has created timeless characters that manage to capture your heart. The witty banter between Darcy and Elizabeth is always engaging and never fails to bring a smile to my face. Read this book. It is a must for everyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen, in her novel Pride and Prejudice, contrasts characters through a battle of social conflict. Elizabeth Bennet, a young woman of lively character, strives against an equal adversary, Fitzwilliam Darcy, a man well endowed by fortune. As the two haughtily battle wits, Mr. Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth, further complicating the story's intricate plot; while Elizabeth's sister, Jane, falls for Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy's best friend. Mr. Darcy's pride against Elizabeth's social standings and Elizabeth's unfounded prejudice against Mr. Darcy's seemingly snobbish habits form a classic tale of romance and humor.The intricate twists of fate intertwine the lovers in their conquests, defeats, and humbling of character. Mix-ups in the tale create a humorous love story with a relish for varied characters undoubtedly human in their emotions and actions. Austen vividly illustrates contrast in social class during the Regency era while exposing human flaws. Characters such as Mrs. Bennet, Lydia and Mr. Wickham warn the reader of the mishaps caused by characters unscrupulous in their wayward actions. Yet as the story unfolds, one cannot help but fall in love with this tale of a man and a woman beset by emotions they fall victim to."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is my favorite Austen book. I was even slightly dissapointed when I read Sense and Sensibility because it didn't come close to Pride and Prejudice. The well developed characters and plot and emotions of P&amp;P (as Austen refered to it)soar above her other novels. Although I did enjoy Emma and Northanger Abby quite well.However, I have read the Jane Austen Book Club, a new book, and I would just like to NOT recommened that book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen has started to write this truly accurate novel before she reached the age of twenty-one. It is remarkable the way she brought off the mercenary and ignorance of the people-a common criticism of the 18th century.I can assure that those who have a taste for the classic and the romantic are going to have such a pleasant reading as I had.What I've found most interesting was the constant presence of an utterly charming, engaging and fast 'war of wits' among characters.It certainly has a great theme and we can still see its content applied in todays world. Pride and Prejudice was elegantly-written by Jane Austen and I can say that it was very worth it as well as inspiring to me reading this novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It doesn't get better than Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Whether you're the hopeless romantic or you just love the classics, you're going to love this book. Though I am only sixteen, I consider myself to be moderately well-read. I love reading, and, when I am between books, my life feels desolate and empty. One day, while in the most barren pit of ennui, I picked up Pride and Prejudice at my mother's recommendation. I do not ordinarily like my mother's taste in reading; her favorite books tend to be very dull, but so deep was my boredom that I succumbed to her suggestion. I wasn't displeased with what I found. I fell in love with the book at the first sentence. I brought my beloved book to the dinner table, to my classes and late into the night. I love everything about it. I love the characters; especially Elizabeth Bennet! I love the Victorian vernavular which works so well for this particular novel. I love the scintillating plot and the suspense created by knowing that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy should be together but their pride and prejudice (hence the title) are temporarily keeping them apart. The language that the novel is written in might be a little more difficult to read than contemporary literature, but once one gets accustomed to it, it makes the novel even more pleasurable. I cannot imagine Elizabeth or Darcy or Bingley or any of the other characters speaking any less eloquently; it would ruin the whole experience! The flowery language completes the whole effect of reading a Jane Austen novel. If a disgruntled female reader put down Pride and Prejudice, pick it back up! I strongly suggest it because it may prove to be tedious at first but if read again, it would probably read more easily. I can offer no suggestions to the male reader, however, because generally this book, in ever essence, is a female novel. I am not saying that men would definetly not enjoy it; I'm simply saying that I have yet to meet any male who has not addressed this book in a very vehement manner. I simply love this book in its entirety, and I know it won't be too long before I pick it up again. Jane Austen surely knew what she was doing when she wrote this one! Her Pride and Prejudice will always have an honored spot on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I purchased this edition of Pride and Prejudice based on the assurance that the hard returns in the edition had been fixed. This is not the case - every sentence has a hard return - a large space or gap between it and the next sentence. It is quite annoying to read and I will be tossing it off my kindle and going with another version. My first kindle disappointment."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is precious to say the least. I'm reading Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice as if it's hot off the press in 19th Century England. It's easy to read as the words are not too small but your eyes still have to adjust a little at first. It has a lovely pink pattern all over the book, which makes it gorgeous, simply gorgeous. It fits very nicely into any medium size hand-bag, which makes it perfect for \\"on the bus\\" reading. Even if your not a reader, and your styling your room in a classic style - place it on a vanity table!! If you love classics, you will love and appreciate reading a classic in this little pocket book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen did a wonderful job of keeping the reader interested (I read it in 5 days)and never lets the reader down at the end. The anticipation of seeing if Lizzy will end her 'prejudice' against Darcy will keep you glued to your Lazy Boy. Between the self absorbed Mrs. Bennett to the stupidity of Mary, and Lydia, Austen creates a fun chemistry A story where you can see your family in and want to give advice on every page. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It took some adjusting to get used to the 19th Century writing style - authors were much more subtle then (and there were different societal norms). Once I did, I was richly rewarded with this tale of mistaken intentions. For those of you on the edge, take the time to appreciate the style, you wont regret it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I hesitate to assign such titles but this is my favorite book of all time. Austen is so witty and subtle that each re-reading garners more laughs and more cringes as the Bennet family unconsciously embarasses themselves in polite society. Darcy is an ideal, a supremely satisfying hero for the headstrong, opinionated, and likeable Elizabeth. The A&E miniseries adaptation is also excellent (a nice excuse to curl up on the couch for several hours on a rainy day), as was, to my surprise, the later Keira Knightley version."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I often think Pride and Prejudice is mistaken as merely being a well written Mills and Boon romance novel-when in reality it is a penetrating social commentary on class, gender and human nature interspersed with Jane Austin's actualy quite cruel, barbed wit and humour. Every time you read this novel it renders a different interpretation and a myriad of observations. It is a bit sad that people sometimes dismiss this as chick lit and can't see past the frocks, ribbons and stately homes. However judging by the amount of reviews it is clearly well loved. Jane Austin is a genius of a writer her other novels are also very good, incorporating many issues of the time. Her humour, and wit is particularly stong in \\"Emma\\" and \\"Mansfield Park\\" studies many social issues of the time such as slavery, poverty and class."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was supposed to read this in high school. Didn't happen.Then I was supposed to read it in college. Again, didn't happen.It's about a bunch of girls sitting around a drawing room, right? Probably noteworthy from a historical perspective, but what does it have to do with me, or with the 20th or 21st century?Everything, it turns out. And strangely enough, I should have seen that just from the title: this is about how pride and prejudice make us blind to the things under our noses. It is about how, in our closed mindedness, we sell others, and consequently ourselves, short. And it is about how we deny ourselves happiness in this asinine fashion.Notice that I don't say \\"this is about how Elizabeth, the heroine . . ..\\" Certainly Elizabeth is guilty of the sins that form the title of this book, but Austen cleverly allows us to make the same mistakes as Elizabeth does, and being human, we make them. Admittedly, we come around to the truth quicker than Elizabeth does, but I think that that only makes it more obvious what our mistakes have been. We sit, watching Elizabeth agonize over truth, wondering if this careful, intelligent, strong young woman will ever figure it out, and we reflect upon ourselves: where have we been proud? Where have we been prejudicial? Whom have we sold short, and what has been the result?So there is a moral, but equally important is that neither the story nor the author preaches to us. We are free to draw our own conclusions, though what those conclusions are is obvious, for most anyone with half of a brain.Of course, all of the good moral in the world is useless without a skeleton of prose, but how marvelous this prose is. I would say that the novel is worth reading for this prose alone, even without the moral, but the two are not even intertwined, they are the same: Austen's genius is to show us Elizabeth's life, and convince us that it is a mirror of our own life: 200 years later we're still making the same mistakes, celebrating the same victories, living the same lives, and it's always nice to read about ourselves.So yes, it's about a bunch of girls sitting around in a drawing room. And it has everything to do with the here and now.(A little aside, for those who wonder: how did I ever read this book? I read somewhere that Patrick O'Brian's (author of the Aubrey/Maturin books) favorite author was Jane Austen. Even more, I read that the comparison of his work that most pleased him was to Jane Austen's work, so I figured that there had to be something to this author, after all - and not just something from the point of view of high school literature class.)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is Jane Austen's best book. The characters in this book you remember and love forever. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's love story you will never forget. This is a must read classic."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Definately not the same typical, humdrum, shallow plot. I thought Elizabeth Bennet to be the perfect...heroine?!? She was playful, quick witted, funny, and certainly not without her faults! I don't want to give any hints to future readers, so I'll just say that Mr._______ was...well, I can't find the words to fully describe, so it will be up to you as the readers to find out yourself! The book was realistic and I thought the eighteenth century English language to be fully enchanting. I think my most favorite parts were when Elizabeth refuses to marry Mr.Collins, her cousin (YUCK!), and her discussion with Lady Catherine deBourgh! I was literally sitting at the edge of my chair while reading certain parts, and I must admit, falling asleep at others (though these parts were short and well worth it)! The ending was absolutely wonderful, to say the least. READ IT!!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is great. At times it is hard to understand because in Austen's time people spoke differently but it is funny in some parts and overall, it is a very well-written, definetly must-read novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I thouroughly loved this book because it was captavating but simple to understand, not a lot of thees and thous."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is by far one of the best books I've ever read. Its sooo good - wonderful plot, climaxes and overall a real pageturner. I recommend this to everyone especially girls between the ages of 13-99."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Truth be told I had a prejudice against the book even before opening it. I thought it was to be a boring novel with little to keep my attention. To my surprise I could not put it down. The characters had great charisma and appeal. The tension created between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy was wonderful, and kept the audience on edge. I have the utmost regards for this novel. I cannot say enough about this book. It was excellent, a true treasure."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"P&amp;P is a necessity. Those who haven't read it yet: get it"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was very fun to read! The dialect was puzzling in places, but it was so different from some of the twentieth-century authors who write with slang and no culture at all. Jane Austen created a tale that is very sweet, very smart, and very imaginative. I love the characters Elizabeth and Jane Bennet with their witcisms and mistakes and exclamaitions. I would recommend this book to anyone, even my sister who doesn't read books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There is no wonder why this was the story You've Got Mail was based on! I also agree that Colin Firth himself is worth watching the movie, but the fact that it is so true to the novel is incredible! Trust me, if more stars were available, I'd use them. Austen is awesome!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I also saw the movie first and I was so impressed. You can read thic book regardless of your age, sex, and interest. This book is always in my mind after I have finished reading this book and I really adrmire Jane Austen. I think I became a fan of Jane Austen's. I also read Emma and Sense &amp; Sensibility but I think this is much better than that. Also you must see the movie. Though it is 8hours long, you won't regret at all. I promise."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book has well earned it's reputation as wonderful, but I would be much more inclined to place it in the romance section of the library than alongside Civil Disobedience and Wuthering Heights. Hold on, don't turn red just yet. My reasoning is such: this book was well thought out, much considered and had a depth of plot and characterization that I thought was approaching immaculate. The title was appropriate: this book is about pride and prejudice IN RELATION TO HAPPINESS, and only that. Austen dosn't go farther; she dosn't explore the depths beyond treading the seashore of what COULD HAVE been. We were only allowed to \\"dip our toe in the slough\\" for forty or fifty pages, until pride was rebuked, the truth was told and love recovered. Something more is required of a book than following the realms of happiness. \\"Suffering - perhaps that hasn't been properly looked at.\\" A classic must give something more, but this was a wonderful, heartfelt read! Put it between sessions of Bronte and Dostoevsky!For those who have read W & P and Pride and Prejudice: Tolstoy killed Andrei - Austen should have killed Darcy! Oh, dosn't Darcy reming you of Andrei??? Darcy's taller, but - PERHAPS - Andrei's pride is under more control. lololA Good Readshe who is no longer the Angel of Music"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Large print is great. But the book was not edited well for spelling errors. Examples: Sophas(sofas), chuse(choose), teaze(tease), shew(show), croud(crowd), staid(stayed), shewing(showing), any thing(anything), any body(anybody), every thing(everything), uncontrouled(uncontrolled). These errors occured over and over again. It was pretty annoying."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've read Bridget Jones's Diary by Helen Fielding several times, and my favourite part in it is when Bridget meets Mark Darcy for the first time and mentions: 'it struck me as pretty ridiculous to be called Mr Darcy and to stand on your own looking snooty at a party'. She talks about Mr Darcy a lot, and it made me even more curious, so I decided to read the novel.I haven't been disappointed at all."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love Jane Austen, especially Pride and Predjudice and Persuasion. Come on, this is for readers with brain, you must un-der-stand the characters and not go like 'i dont see the point, bla bla bla blabla.....' Those who say the book is boring , go writing yourselves. You dont have Jane Austen's brain. :p:pThe books funny, the plot is interesting and you learn a lot with this book. :)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was surprised to read that a previous reviewer expected to find P&amp;P &quot;too boring and feminist&quot;. I wish it was either more boring or more feminist. It was so witty and well-written that I couldn't put it down. But I felt uncomfortable with the underlying assumption that a woman's ultimate fulfillment is to marry a rich and gorgeous man. Of course it has very strong female characters, and was a very progressive novel for its time. The fact that it is still so popular makes me wonder how far we have come. I preferred Eliot's Middlemarch - a similar type of novel with a more balanced view of female ambition, morality and emotion."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was difficult for me to read. The main drawback is the English (the real English they use in England) or maybe it's my lack of sophistication. The story of five daughters, seems like something for a teenage girl. There always seemed to be gossip and people really concerned about how others saw them. Maybe that's what makes Liz the main character standout. This story did not have enough action or masculine characters for my taste, but I understand it's a classic. The wahines must love Mr. Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I totally agree with the reader from NY who didn't like the novel(maybe it's something in the NY water). I didn't find any of the characters particularly interesting or the writing style very engaging; in fact, this was one of the few books I had to force myself to finish. All the characters were very pretentious, only caring about how you looked and what family you belonged to. After I finished this book I read JANE EYRE, fearing that I would have the same negative experience. But I cannot say enough about how great a novel Jane Eyre is, and I would recommend anyone thinking of reading P&amp;P to pick up Jane Eyre instead."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Never in a million years would I've thought that I'd enjoy a romantic comedy about a bunch of restoration period British richies, but this is a great book.

Elizabeth find one person in particular that she will never court, Fitzwilliam Darcy, or will his charming ways find their way into her heart.This book is suppose to be humorous. I did not find anything funny or remotely interesting, well until Darcy came along. In all truthness I can not see how this book has gotten so many other books based on the characters of Darcy and Elizabeth. I don't get it. I wish I did. I wanted to like this so much more than I did. All I could see the book is about is dancing and gossip. It reminds me of a older version of Seinfeld because it was about nothing. I did not give diddly squat about anybody in this book. Yes it is written pretty and well done but I had no connection to the people.You are probably wondering why I would give any stars if I dislike it so much but the truth is certain moments caught my attention and as I said it is written pretty. I only thought it to be okay maybe a little less than that."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Honestly folks, did you really enjoy reading this book? After paragraph after paragraph of needless description and rhetoric, one must scrounge up what's left inside their brain after it being destroyed by Jane Austen's pointless circumlocution to dig up what was actually said in modern English.

I made a list of a dozen or so and have had mixed results so far.I think that my expectations were too high, I was expecting something like Jane Eyre, which I loved. Unfortunately I found 'Pride and Prejudice' a little too frivolous for my tastes.Perhaps if I had known what I was getting before I started I would have been less disappointed? It felt like a fluffy romance novel, which I do not in general care for. I love a good love story, part of why I loved Jane Eyre.Maybe if it had been called 'Pretty Girls Out Husband Hunting' or 'Lydia Lands In a Jam' or something equally silly I would have known what I was in for.Maybe this wasn't the best first Jane Austen novel to read?I'm not sure if I will be reading another.Okay, I know that 655 of you loved this and many of you will have to give me a negative vote because we don't agree...So, let the negative votes begin *winces*."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I purchased this recording (read by Lindsay Duncan) through the iTunes store (something I will not be doing again), on the understanding that it was an unabridged recording.

Despite the clever rhetoric, the plot and characters are simply too shallow, predictable and archetypical.

Disappointing because I loved the movie \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" (with Kate Winslet, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman), so I thought I would like the author.And yes, I do love Dickens.

I also think Elizabeth is great heroin. the only thing I didn't like about the book is that the famly is so worried about the father dying and he doesn't even die. So what was the use of worrying. I also feel that Jane Austen was a great author and really wrote what womwn felt during the time when very few women wrote. What do men know what women feel. What gave men the right to write when they don't even know what women felt during that time. But I feel now that women and men are egual.

Don't bother."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had to read this book in my Final Year at High School and I didn't like it one bit, Now it is 25 years later and I re read it and I still didn't like it the second time around. This would have to be one of the most overrated novels ever published and in no way deserves it's title as a so called \\"Classic Of Modern Literature\\". The plot concerns a mother, Mrs. Bennet whose sole purpose in life is to see her daughters married. That's it. End of story and yet Ms. Austin takes several hundred pages to repeat this Theme Ad Nauseam.One has to remember that this book was written in a time when the only four things to do at night were get drunk, sleep, read or make love and some people did all 4 of these things in one lonely night!!!Ms. Austin takes full advantage of this and decides she has a story worth telling which is without plot, believable characters or any hint of suspense or excitement. As the writer Mario Puzo once said \\"Why would anybody with a Beach House and a VCR choose to read Proust?\\"Amen to that.Throw away your sleeping pills and try to read this book instead."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had to read this book for my english class because my teacher believed that it would make us better students all around. Am I the only person who thinks this book is overrated? I mean, seriously, it's a entire book about whining, elitism and vapidity. It gets tiresome, even before you finish it.It's too bad there's no zero star rating."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I HATED THIS BOOK. I READ IT IN HIGH SCHOOL, ABOUT 9 YEARS AGO AND I STILL REMEMBER HOW MUCH I HATE THE PUFFY PATHETIC NARRATIVE OF WHINY WOMEN IN WANT OF HUSBANDS. It is with deep anguish that I note that there are books on how to teach this book in classes, thereby continuing the legacy of pain to innocent students of this day and age."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book may be considered a &quot;classic&quot; but it isn't. It may deal with &quot;emotions&quot; and &quot;the human spirit&quot; but it lacks the qualities of true literature. To be blunt, the book is boring. There is too much description and not enough meat. The story seems to be leading somewhere, and when you get there, you wonder why you took the journey in the first place. I plead to the human race not to let writers get off this easy by writing such unfulfilling books. Skip Bronte and read Hemingway or Poe."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"this book was poorly written and i had trouble getting over the first page! i woke up after 10minutes and then realised that i had fallen asleep! i would recommend ppl to keep away from such a horror~ it hasn't got the right to be called a 'NOVEL'. i prefer lord of the flies. it's much more riveting~ now that deserves 5* rating"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"it's boring. Piece of advice for everybody who's forced to read this: buy CliffsNotes. This book is not worth wasting your time on. Believe me, I was open minded and wanted to like it but I could not read more than 10 pages. My mind started thinking of something else every third sentence. So again, save your time and sanity and buy the CliffsNotes version."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"this book was poorly written and i had trouble getting over the first page! i woke up after 10minutes and then realised that i had fallen asleep! i would recommend ppl to keep away from such a horror~ it hasn't got the right to be called a 'NOVEL'. i prefer lord of the flies. it's much more riveting~ now that deserves 5* rating"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I may be trying too hard to read a classic book.. I thought P&P would be a good start since they just made another movie on this book.. but I was wrong! the book was boring and plotless. Sure nowaday women are still searching for Mr.Perfect like Lizzy was. But today's women have to deal with much more complicated life problems and worries while searching for the right guy.. The whole book was about drawing room,dinners, and occasional conversations with some ladies urging Lizzy to get married. I better off stick with the modern love stories with real people problems. Glad women have grown so much tougher since the old days."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"They just don't make stories like this anymore! So well written for the era into this day.

I love this story and am very happy to have it on my phone. I've already read it once. Download was easy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've always loved this book, from the moment I had to read in high school, and every subsequent reading thereafter.

I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"a book everyone should read if they havent. A love story anyone would enjoy.

Pride and Prejudice is by far my favourite novel and I love the movies too, but this kindle edition was killing me.What's with the caps lock where italics should be? I imagined everytime there was a caps Elizabeth would be screaming. It was just irritating.Also, there were a few errors here and there.I recommend buying the paperback or hardcover version of Pride and Prejudice if you really get annoyed by errors like I do, but overall it's still for free, and let's face it, Mr. Darcy in print is good no matter what."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It was different reading this book which I must have read nearly 30 times..this is my first experience reading it via my kindle.

It's easy to see why this book has inspired so many other authors to draw from it and adapt the story to give it new spins... it's almost an archetypal \\"boy meets girl\\" story, including the wrinkles at the beginning that make them think they are all wrong for each other, when it's all just a matter of perception.Highly recommended, to anyone that reads!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Really enjoyed reading this book and would encourage others to read it. The classic books are part of history so please share this book and other classic books with family and friends."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Like all the other Jane Austen books I loved this one just as much. Jane Austen is famous for her characterisation and this book proves it to you even more. Trust me - you won't be able to get your hands off this classic that is still entertaining to read today. A book that shows us how two minds can eventually meet and harbour friendship and love. YOU WON'T REGRET IT."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a classic novle , I have watched its film and also been impressed by the love story.

There is no turning back now; LOVE MY KINDLE and LOVE that I purchased Pride and Prejudice for it! The writer, Jane Austin really knows her stuff and knows how to capture a reader! I would reccomend this book highly!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is considered the Jane Austen masterpiece and is one of the most popular books of English literature and I can see why. Jane Austen paints a gorgeous picture of what life for a woman in 19th century England was like. Her characters are beautifully developed and the main character Elizabeth is how I would hope I would be if I lived in that era. Smart, a freethinker and not afraid to show little gumption.This is one book that I will read again and again throughout my lifetime. I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I can understand why this is considered a classic of literature. I saw the movie first and then just read it. The story is more for women, I think, but I confess I got into the drama once Darcy and Elizabeth started interacting. I could have done without some (or all) of the sisters, but I guess they were an essential part of the novel to show what silly girls were like in those days."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"pride and prejudice must be the best book i have ever laid my eyes upon~! .. i was in suspense all the way through the novel. i would recommend this novel to everyone that has the ability to read. i think it is really romantic how elizabeth and darcy start to realise their love for each other. i would like to experience love like that some day too.. i am planning to make a jane austen fan club. if u are interested in joining please contact me on my email add: ilovejaneausten@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you've ever been in love this book will certainly make youfall in love all over again. I've read it so many times for so manyreasons that it's impossible to express all of my feelings. This book should be mandatory reading for all teens. Many people have a hard time dodging love's pitfalls. This book helps in understanding that love is a game. There are winners and there are losers in this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read Pride and Prejudice and imediately fell in love with it.

Definately worth all of its praise."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austens wonderful understanding of people and the common failure and missunderstandings that plague our world are elequently put together in this classic book. Her obviously well-educated writing and her smart wit keep you reading. I think you come away smarter just by her style and amazingly exact portrail of human emotions. It's definatly a must read for those who seek to understand themselves and other better as well as enjoy a great story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved the book, it is before its time. It is a satirical satire in to the landed gentry of England. Austen is saying, through the wonderfully witty and Beautiful Elizabeth, that women have a place in society. Absolutely brilliant"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've just recently started reading classics, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed Jane Austen's novel, and what a pleasure it was to read. I was fascinated by the little details of the characters' lives."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a look at times and customs from a point of view not available in books by modern authors."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always loved classic literature, and belive Jane Austen to be one of the best classic authors! &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; and &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; are my two favorite books of all time. I think Austen was brilliant in this book because she is able to write so well about (and let's face it, fellow Austen fans--) such a mundane story line! The plot is very simply the story of five un-wed sisters and their very normal life at trying to get engaged. That's all there is to it. Why, then do we find this work so intoxicatingly enchanting? It is because of Austen's brilliant way with words...her descriptions of her witty heroine and handsome hero.If you like this book, I highly recommend reading Emma by Jane Austen and my other fave-- Jane Eyre. :) I give this book six stars!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Although I picked up the book for a 12th grade English class, Jane Austen captivated me with her polished dialogues and intricate descriptions. Pride and Prejudice is more than just a love story between Darcy and Elizabeth, and Bingley and Jane. It is a satire of a society in which money is the driving force behind love and social status means everything. The story is set in England and focuses on the four Bennet daughters, primarily with Elizabeth Bennet, who is the second oldest daughter. She meets Mr. Darcy at a ball and detests his pride. Although he is very rich and quite handsome, she is certain that Darcy thinks he is above his company, and that disgusts her. But although she is drawn to him by hate, the hate turns into love through a series of events and dialogue. Austen uses rich dialogues to form her comedy, and in the end a reader will not only learn that love can conquer all pride and prejudices, but he will also laugh at a society full of arranged marriages and love based on what a spouse could bring to a marriage. This book is a &quot;classic&quot; for good reason. Austen's diction is exquisite, somewhat challenging, but after a few chapters, she has the reader hooked. Although picked up for a 12th grade English class, I know I will pick up it up again and will pick up some of Austen's other books. I would recommend this book to other high schoolers that need to read a classic for school, but also to people of any age looking for an excellent piece of writing."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I like when that what I read is realy interesting. I must say that Jane Austin wrote about life in England in the begining of 19th century. Lots of my friends think that it is'n actual at the moment, but I think it is nesesery to now how live people 200 years ago. I like her books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a wonderful book with a wonderful theme that is a good lesson for everyone to learn. I loved all of the characters and even if I didn't love their actions, I loved the artful description of them. Though in the beginning I really did not like Mr. Darcy, by the end he was one of my favorite characters along with Elizabeth. The ending was great and I was very satisfied with it. It had a great plot and kept me looking forward to the next part. Another great thing about, while it was described wonderfully, it was not confusing and I was able to follow the story the whole way through the book. I also thought that the whole time period back then, though it had many bad aspects like a great rift between the very rich and others, was still a great time period with manners and etiquette that we in this time are lacking. Overall I really loved the book and am looking forward to reading other Jane Austen books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is almost 200 years since \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was first published. It ought to be the equivalent in literature of those faded, dried flowers that used to be found pressed between the pages of the old family bible. Instead it is redolent of freshly cut flowers still carrying a sprinkling of morning dew.The freshness and the perfection of form are certainly astonishing. Jane Austin is as good as story teller as ever picked up a pen, knowing exactly how to construct plots, and what incidents and dialogues to detail in full and what to briefly summarize. Her \\"world\\" is small but intricately constructed. Every characteristic, quality and idea has a precise and fixed value, all being ranked strictly and sternly according to decorum, logic and morality.Despite its architectural perfection, however, a recent re-reading reveals one or two construction features that are questionable. How could it be, for example that Fitzwilliam Darcy could have such a dragon for an aunt? I also wonder about the friendship between Darcy and Bingley. How did it begin? It is obviously important to each, but we are given nothing of its history.Jane Austen lived long enough to see this book published and enjoyed amongst her own family and a small readership. Her mother entertained family members with it, reading it, in Jane Austen's estimation, a little too quickly. Distinguished British actress Lindsay Duncan reads it with perfect timing and inflexion in this highly recommended audio tape format, which presents the novel in an unabridged version of just over twelve hours."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You may have heard that literature is an example of the time and place during which it was written. Pride and Predjudice is such a book. While many think of it as a serious book, it is actually quite humerous. Austen's portrayal of love and marriage is a perfect example of how it should be. From marraige-obsessesed Mrs. Bennett, to the intelligent Lizzy to attractive Fitzwilliam Darcy, the book is a masterpiece! This is one book that I could (and have!) read over and over again. I challenge someone to tire of it! If you are looking for a classic, witty and all around fun book, this is it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read this book only very recently. It is truly an excellent piece of literature. It is a story of appearance and reality. The author, Jane Austen, uses extensive and challenging vocabulary. The words flow off the pages. Sometimes, I read the same passage three or four times to fully understand what it was trying to convey. The main character, Mr. Darcy, is extremely proud. He is selfish and rude, until he meets Miss Elizabeth Bennet. But, Miss Bennet is far below his social standing. It is interesting to see how the characters change in the book over time. If you want a challenge, have some time, and love good literature, this book is for you!"}]`),j={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},L={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],B={key:0},E={key:1};function W(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",L,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),b(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",E,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",B,"See more"))],8,M)):p("",!0)])}const C=u(j,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-8c54ccc7"]]),J=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/57.md","filePath":"quotes/57.md"}'),q={name:"quotes/57.md"},R=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(C)]))}});export{J as __pageData,R as default};
