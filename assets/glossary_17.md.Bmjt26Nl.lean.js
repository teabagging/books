It was obviously done hastily and not with the same warmth and passion of the previous ones. I trust that she has seen the error of her publisher's greediness and will present our Mitford friends in another volume with the warmth and passion she is so capable of giving!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"All of us who love Mitford (&quot;I KNOW I've been to this town, I just can't remember where it is...&quot;) bought this book sight unseen. We love Jan Karon, we love Mitford and we would have bought anything to learn more about Father Tim and Cynthia. I will never be this careless again! Jan Karon and her publisher saw a way to make money and they took it. It's damaged her reputation with many of us. Like many reviewers, I am a librarian and will not recommend this book. I hope SHE reads these reviews!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"To say that this newest Mitford book has confused me is too simple a statement. Beyond the vague details and sketchy facts contained in the body of the work, the syntax in which this wedding story appeared in the overall scope of this series leaves devoted readers trying to remember which events had happened at the time the wedding occurred and which had yet to unfold. Hadn't Dooley already bonded with Cynthia? Or was he still surly and unforgiving? Reading this installment had the exact opposite effect of the others--it made me tired and addled where the first five have been a balm to my soul every time I have lost myself in them. Sadly, this one will most likely not be revisited as often as the first five. I look forward to the next trip to Mitford, whenever Ms. Karon is ready."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I'm sorry, but the point of this book is . . . ??? Talk about disappointed. Ms. Karon held my interest for five books and I (and my friends) looked so forward to the sixth. The first thing I noted about the book when I purchased it was the width of the margins, top, bottom and sides. And then I noticed it was also double spaced with lots of little frills between breaks within the chapters and several almost completely blank pages between the chapters. &quot;Ah, well,&quot; I thought, &quot;they say 'less is more'.&quot; Wrong! It took me a couple of hours to breeze through the book, skipping over large portions containing quotes (such as every verse of the hymn that Dooley sang for the wedding), the archaic wedding vows we've all heard a thousand times, and portions of scripture that the wedding couple would quote back and forth. Pa-leez!! For the life of me, I can't figure out why Ms. Karon wasted her time, the readers' time, and the publisher's paper and marketing budget. Perhaps the book should be renamed, &quot;The World's Best Reference Book for a Perfectly Boring Wedding.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Having read (and thoroughly enjoyed) the other books in the Mitford series, I went straight for the hardcover this time---my mistake. Borrow this one before buying; it's geting mixed reviews for good reasons. You'll love it if.......you're tremendously sentimental .......you're a multi-tasker (It jumps from character to character w/o developing any adequately.) .......you're wealthy enough to shell out hardback novel prices for a novella .......you're not a perfectionist (Where do you put this book on the shelf? It's marketed as another sequel but actually fits within others in the series.) .......you don't mind a book w/o compelling action or definitive plot .......you won't mind the, admittedly benign but nonetheless uncomfortable, discussion of sexual pleasure in a marital counseling contextA Common Life has all the substance of a pre-June marketing scheme aimed at wedding-gift buyers. The publishers didn't do enough to let readers know this is an &quot;extra&quot;, not the &quot;next&quot; in the series. For those of us expecting more (and better), we'll think twice now before handing over our next quarter of a hundred dollars. For all we know, book seven may appear at the height of back-to-school shopping season and wallow just as sentimentally, exploring everyone's delight over Dooley's furthering his education. This book is a departure from others in the Mitford series; for me, there's no appeal."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I always wondered why the wedding story wasn't covered in its proper place. Obviously Jan Karon didn't want to write about it and this is even more evident in this book. It is a brief look at the wedding without any real depth into the characters or insight into the many events, decisions and thoughts that led up to the wedding and could have included the wonderful citizens of Mitford. Each book in the series has gotten shorter but this one at 185 very skimpy pages seems to be nothing more than a way to exploit the many fans of Mitford."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I received an email from Amazon to let me know that Jan Karon had a &quot;new&quot; book out in the Mitford series. I should have read the reviews before ordering. Rather than a continuation of the series, this short story disguised as a book, goes back to between the second and third books. What a ripoff."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Loved almost the entire Mitford Series. But, had a hard time finding this one, finally found someone who had a used version, not in the box. Disappointed, but really wanted the book. Least favorite of all. Nothing new in this book, except filling in the gap to actually read about the wedding between father tim and cynthia. Short (only four cd's)... and still $44.00! even used, not in box. If you can't find this one... you don't need it. Go right on with the rest of the series.This was a very disappointing book. But, I thank the seller anyway, this was an almost impossible book to find in Audio. Checked book stores direct, Amazon. Finally e.bay. This made Jan Karon and her pubishers a lot of cash w/little effort."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"This mundane novel is something that would appeal to my grandmother..simple, quaint, well written.

While A Common Life is not as long or as in depth as her other Mitford novels, it still maintained that downhome sweetness and comfortable, cozy feeling that I've come to expect and love in these books.A Common Life tells the story of Father Tim's acceptance of the importance and neccessity of Cynthia in his life. After proposing, the couple encounters the typical problems, jitters and joys that most engaged couples do. And as expected, the whole town of Mitford is getting into the celebration: Hessie Mayhew is in charge of the flowers, Esther Bollick is waiting for her invitation to bake the cake, and Uncle Joe is busily searching for the best joke to tell at the reception. And of course the wedding couldn't come off without at least a small hitch -- at 10 minutes after starting time, Cynthia is nowhere to be found...Jan Karon has written another pleasing and endearing story. It is written in the same beautiful, classy way as the others, and any Mitford fan will consider this novel to be a wonderful addition to the series. Having said that, I can see where some readers could be disappointed if they were reading the books in order since A Common Life (#6) does not continue with the story where #5 stopped but instead goes back in time to between #2 and #3. However, despite which order you read it (and I recommend #6 after #2), I believe A Common Life is a treasure and perfect as a gift for any engaged or newly married couple as it celebrates a wonderful and simple romance. Looking forward to continuing on with the third book in the series. I know I won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"No,it isn't long enough - hence 4 stars, not 5 - but it is a sheer joy for what it is. As a Mitford-addicted reader and tape listener I approached with trepidation hearing the tape read by anyone but Jan. Dana Ivy is superb and captures Cynthia especially with new shades of color cast on this fascinating character. The complexity and challenge of what it means to make a marriage commitment is genuinely explored through Father Tim; we learn more about the Mitfordites through vigniettes connected to their own marriages or love stories; Miss Sadie is ALIVE again; Dooley's singing, so eloquently done by Dana on the tape - all are joys. The simple reiteration of the Gospel and how to find spiritual wholeness - for me,the heart of all Mitford books- is there in power.A COMMON LIFE is a lorgniette-view of characters about whom we have come to care during the single event about which we would most like to know every detail. The book delivers - but we'll never stop wanting more, because Jan's storytelling gift has made room for itself permanently for so many."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"My wife and I have read each of Karon's Mitford books aloud to each other over the past few years. This is one of the better ones.One thing I enjoyed about this book is that several different characters narrate it. In the other Mitford books (thus far) everything is narrated from Father Tim's perspective. But here we are privy to the thoughts and observations of other well-known characters, such as: Esther Bolick, Uncle Billy Watson, and Mayor Cunningham. I think this change of structure works well for this particular installment. It gives us a fuller view of that most dramatic of events: the marriage of a beloved old bachelor. Let's face it; if it were up to Father Tim to remember the events surrounding his wedding to Cynthia, we wouldn't have much to work with because he had too much going on around him.This book is slimmer than the others, perhaps offering less story than fans are used to. One compensatory value might be that it has a nice two-color interior design.I recommend _A Common Life_ to fans of the series mainly on the virtue of its unique structure, giving voice to other familiar characters"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I think the bad reviews on this site are based on disappointment -- and a misunderstanding of what this book is. This is not a continuation of the Mitford series, but rather a novella (that means it's short!) about the engagement and marriage of Father Tim and Cynthia. I thought the story was lovely -- I especially appreciated seeing a more vulnerable side to Cynthia... we learn things about her that we didn't know before.I'm sure that Jan Karon is under great pressure from her publisher to write MORE, MORE, MORE Mitford books, and they would like to have one a year from her. Well, she won't do that; she can't do that. So we wait longer between books and receive stories of astonishing depth and quality. This novella reminds us how desperate we are for the next in the series.I have to admit that I think the publisher's price and the packaging are a bit deceiving -- the double-spacing and wide margins feel like an attempt to pull the wool over our eyes. But don't blame Jan Karon -- she is like her character, Cynthia Coppersmith... she agonizes over her deadlines and worries that her work isn't up to her readers' expectations."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"To enjoy Jan Karon's writing, you have to be somewhat of a romantic at heart or at least believe that a place like Mitford could exist. To enjoy her latest &quot;A Common Life&quot; you have to believe in the fun and excitement of a small-town wedding, and the love of two people pledged to marry. This book would make a great gift for a bride, and Jan Karon has done a good job of helping the first-time reader feel welcome in Mitford. For those who love Mitford, this book fills in the gaps between Father Tim and Cynthia. Just enjoy this book for what it is: an affirmation of true love and marriage, and a pleasant visit to Mitford! I too look forward to the next installment of the Mitford series, but I am glad that Jan Karon went back to fill in the wedding story details."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"...which is why I went right out and bought &quot;A Common Life: The Wedding Story&quot;. It matters little to me the length of the book or the size of the margins. It's a visit to Mitford, renewing acquaintances and visiting old friends. The confusion regarding the subject matter and length is a bit of a puzzle to me. First of all, the subtitle of the book is THE WEDDING STORY - that seems pretty clear, and Jan Karon told us it would be a novella, which is exactly what it is. Of course, I would have loved for it to be longer but I felt that way about all of the books. With a writer like Karon and books like the Mitford series, nothing is ever long enough. So I joyfully accept this lovely book for just what it is...a glimpse at the wedding of Fr. Tim and Cynthia. I especially loved the fact that she shared some of the thoughts of the characters we've grown to love: Dooley's apprehension regarding the marrage, Hope Winchester's thoughts on her &quot;...once-ardent crush&quot; on Fr. Tim, Absolom Greer's enduring love for Miss Sadie, and dear Uncle Billy's method of staying awake during the ceremony - deciding whether or not to have mustard on his ham! Thank you Jan Karon for this small, yet delightful return to Mitford. Please take us there again soon and let us see what transpires next with these wonderful characters you've created."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I shouldn't have read the reviews which bemoaned this Mitford volume before reading. It added some trepidation about a forecasted letdown.The forecast appeared to be true for awhile, in fact for the first 99 pages. Then, with the letter Father Tim wrote to Cynthia delivered by his dog, I was captivated again by this witty, wordsmith and creator of the Mitford life which so many have found refreshing reading.Touching is the sentiments expressed here, the sudden shift of their jitters about marriage, shifting from Tim to Cynthia. Further, her love of his being glad in his own skin is truly a characteristic more should seek in themselves, mates and friends.The getting locked in the bathroom with the broken knob was a suprise twist (actually, this happened to me recently locked behind a second story stairwell, when the knob broke off in my wife's hand, and forced the door to be kicked down so I could attend the Voters' Meeting already late for.)She is so apt and tying in on the preparation and thoughts of key Mitford characters before and during the wedding service. Loved Uncle Billy thinking of whether to have his ham with or without mustard!This again is superb literature in my estimation and is certainly up to the level and regard I'm use to from the author. Looking forward to her future offerings."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I enjoyed the whole Mitford series as a delightful and enjoyable escape. Therefore I was disappointed after reading Karon's latest. It was entertaining and was a satisfying completion of the series but it could have been included in the previous book instead of stretching it into another book. I read the whole thing in a couple of hours. The pages of this book had wide margins and was obviously straining to fill enough pages to make a book. I don't like feeling that an author is taking advantage of her public. Having said all this, I still enjoyed finishing up the series with the marriage. It was sweet and left me with a warm fuzzy feeling."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"You have given us just a taste for a bit more. After finding myself immersed in the first 5 books of the Mitford series this book filled in a part of the story that I truly feel I missed out on. Written as an episodic adventure, we find out the circumstances behind the proposal and marriage of Father Tim to Cynthia. Karon, with her loving touch has also given us a glimpse of characters that we have long since grieved for in the earlier novels. It was a joy to have them back in the world of Mitford even if only for this book.Though shorter than the original books, it is written with the same warmth and grace that we have come to know from this author. From the moment I started chapter one I had a huge grin on my face with every page I turned. I do wish we had been privy to the reception since I am greedy for any time spent in Mitford. The last chapter, spent on their honeymoon in Maine and entitled, &quot;The Beginning&quot; more than solidifies the idyllic love that these two people share. Again I say, Thank-you Jan Karon.

And then I read it.I devoured the book in less than four hours (a new record for me, even with my propensity for speed-reading!). I loved it! From Father Tim's breathless proposal to his inability to even tell his dog about his marriage plans to Cynthia's doubts and fears to Dooley's misgivings, it held me enthralled, just as the first five books did. My only disappointment was that the book, by necessity, couldn't be as long as its predecessors. Oh, and I would have liked to have seen Edith Mallory's response to the nuptials! Oh well, you can't have everything.Bravo Jan Karon- another job well done!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I loved her other books but feel this book was put together just to have another book.

I, as a reader before me suggested, would recommend that those reading the series check this one out from the library."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"At first I was a little confused when I began this book, because I was expecting book six. Hey, why are we going backwards?! Once I got into it, it turned out to be a very nice read, especially if you were dying to know what happened at the wedding. Short but sweet (I read it in a little over an hour, but I'm fast) Karon once again showed her talent for touching our hearts with universal emotions."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Don't bother to buy this book if you are waiting to see what happens next! This is not the continuation of the fifth book, but simply a review of past events. Very short, quick read that probably could be skipped.

While I have found all of the Mitford books to be sweetly compelling, A Common Life is my favorite so far.Father Timothy Kavanaugh, the lifelong bachelor, has finally decided to commit his life to his vivacious neighbor, Cynthia. He thinks that his feelings of worry about his relationship will be over upon making this decision - but Father Tim is so very wrong. There is, after all, a wedding to be planned!The good folk of Mitford proceed with all of their usual flair. Cynthia is subject to showers and teas, while Father Tim gets a good dose of advice at his favorite diner. There are the usual decisions about flowers, songs, and attendants. Yes, all of this is commonplace - but that is the beauty of Karon's writing. She infuses these decisions, gone through by all engaged couples, with a grace and candor that is rare.I read several chapters of this book with tears in my eyes, impressed by the gentleness and true love of the characters.

The book was short and had no interesting story lines. We all knew that they were going to get married. I expected more."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I just finished reading A Common Life yesterday afternoon. I knew this book was supposed to be a novella about the events leading up to Cynthia and Father Tim's wedding. So I had no preconceptions that it would be an in depth story about the characters. For those who know and love the characters, they are already deep in our hearts and we remember them daily.I found myself finding out little &quot;tidbits&quot; of information about the characters I loved. I realized how important Uncle Billy's jokes are to him - that they are what make him who he is. He showed this in how much time and effort he spent trying to come up with the perfect joke to tell at the reception.I knew that Father Tim and Cynthia loved each other, but found an even deeper understanding of it throughout this book.I smiled and giggled over Louella and Miss Sadie going through the catalog - trying to decide on what dress they would wear for the big day - their enjoyment and excitement leaped out at me.I enjoyed reading about out how Uncle Billy met his Rose and how Louella met her husband.I found myself touched by the tizzy Esther went into when she feared they would not ask her to make her famous orange marmalade cake for their wedding.I enjoyed so many things about this book. I felt it let me see inside some of the more &quot;minor&quot; characters that are not as fleshed out in the normal books. I found out things about them that made me feel even more in tune with them - their fears, their doubts, their hopes.I eagerly wait the next ones that are due out this fall."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"An uncommonly beautiful novella which goes back in time to sketch the wedding of Father Tim and Cynthia Coppersmith. The author takes us along this time, and the reader is permitted a kind and gentle glimpse into the minds and thoughts of many of our Mitford friends. A fascinating departure from the story telling of Mitford, we learn first hand of Dooley's unvoiced fears, Cynthia's own transition, and watch as Father Tim falls right off the cliff of independence and self sufficiency, and into the valley of late life romance. The reader will also learn who harbored a secret crush on Father Tim and who was late to wedding!Any lover of the Mitford books will appreciate the glimpses and insights this little book provides, but IT IS a novella, and not one of the long visits to Mitford we have to wait so long for! Actually, the second reading was more pleasurable than the first, since I took time to savor. The reviewers seem all over the place here - but mostly divided between those who knew what to expect, and those who didn't. So read up on the reviews and then virtually visit Mitford...

Rather than carrying the story of Father Tim and his wife, Cynthia, forward, this book is a return to the story of their wedding. After reading this slight effort, I came to the conclusion it was written more for its marketing than its literary value. I think Ms. Karon wants this book to become a stand-alone gift book for weddings, much like the Dr. Seuss book on age is a perennial best-seller as a graduation gift. But if you aren't already a fan of the series, this book won't mean anything, and if you are a fan of the series, this book is a disappointment. If Ms. Karon wanted to write a wedding book, why didn't she write about Dooly's wedding and move the story along?

Details provided in this book could have been included in a previous book of the series; A Common Life was too wordy and too religious giving this reader the impression it was written to fulfill Jan Karon's contract.

I found it suitable for my 2 yr old, yet it is not too young for a 4-5 yr old.The story shares the fears and concerns of a little boy whose mother is pregnant. The author skillfully manifests the boy's concerns into a surface worry that he doesn't have room on his mom's lap as her pregnancy progresses. Obviously, this is a manifestation of his fear that she won't have time and/or attention for him, but it's not played up. I really liked this approach, as most pre-schoolers have an indirect way of expressing or understanding their fears. It helps me as a parent remember that my child's concerns might show up in subtle ways.Very well illustrated. I also liked that the characters weren't white. It's hard to find children's books that aren't about mainstream white families.

I also thought it did a good job showing the older child how things will be changing while mommy is pregnant and after the baby is born. Although my son seemed to enjoy the story, he does not request to read the book very often."},{"Title":"Will There Be a Lap for Me?","review":"This is a very sweet book, addressing some of the insecurities kids are likely to have when a new sibling arrives. My daughter likes to hear it at bedtime."},{"Title":"Will There Be a Lap for Me?","review":"I read this book with my 3 1/2 year old. I am expecting twins and she has been the only child/grandchild for a long time. This book opened up some conversations and made it easier for her to talk and ask questions. She wanted to know if I will hold her again after the babies are born and be able to play with her )I have been on bedrest). It also gave me a great idea to have a special project for her and I after the babies come. We are going to buy some ladybugs and watch them grow in her bug farm. The mom in the book takes time out for her son to hang a birdfeeder."},{"Title":"Will There Be a Lap for Me?","review":"We've used this book as we prepared for three different births at our house. My son, who was 1-1/2 at the time we were reading it to him, loved it. The portrayal of the changes in Mom during the pregnancy and the fact that she is busy with the baby afterward helps prepare the children for the reality of a new sibling. The book reassures children that they are still important to Mom, even if her lap is full, and that she will still make room for them."},{"Title":"Will There Be a Lap for Me?","review":"We live in the country, and don't have a lot of exposure to other ethnicities or ways of living. I bought this book because it was about adjusting to a new sibling, and I'd heard that it showed breastfeeding as well. But I was delighted to see such a wonderful book showing an urban way of living - riding on the city bus, and an African American family; a male baby sitter. I don't think the author was consciously trying to be 'different', but I think this book is great because so many children's books seem to assume that all children are growing up in suburbia (or even in the country), and that's simply not true.The book covered the subject matter very well, too. I think it helped prepare our oldest daughter (3) very well for the arrival of her baby sister."},{"Title":"Will There Be a Lap for Me?","review":"VERY SWEET. IT REASURES AC HILD THER EWILL ALWAYS BE ROOM FOR THEM. LOVED IT"},{"Title":"Will There Be a Lap for Me?","review":"As a reviewer, it's challenging to pan a book showing a positive representation of African American families and also shows a natural portrayal of breast feeding. Unfortunately, Corey has left no other choice. The plotline leaps from Kyle enjoying his mother's lap to her stomach growing bigger, and suddenly the matriarch disappears without warning and returns with a baby boy. There is no reference of Kyle being the big brother, of preparation for how things are going to change at home. The watercolor and colored pencil illustrations are fuzzy and don't contribute to comprehension of the overly formal text. The end is equally disjointed-Mother goes from being neglectful of Kyle to suddenly returning her attention to him because the baby is asleep. Rather than comforting children that they will remain an important member as their family grows, this book may have the reverse affect on the preschool audience. For a more positive portrayal, parents may want to consider Mercer Mayer's charming \\"The New Baby\\" or \\"How to be a Big Baby...by Me, the Big Sister\\" by Sally Lloyd-Jones."},{"Title":"Will There Be a Lap for Me?","review":"If you like this book, I recommend \\"On Mother's Lap\\" by Ann Herbert Scott.

Giants like; Thelonious Monk, Erroll Garner, Elvin Jones, Nina Simone, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and so many others paint images of pointedness, beauty, intellect and feeling. The reader really gets an insight into the personalities and lives of these wonderful people that are the lineage of the only true American art form. I really recomend the book to anyone, from the person who has had one passing thought about jazz artists to those who dedicate their life to the art form, or any artform. This is, as they say, the real deal. I am humbled by Mr. Taylor's wonderful work and, in my own way, feel love for each of the unique artists that he interviews. Thank You Arthur!"},{"Title":"Notes and tones: Musician to musician interviews","review":"Notes and Tones is distinct in its highly synergistic dialogue. The fact that Arthur Taylor was a serious [Black] jazz drummer, with a familiar professional and personal relationship with many of the interviewees, resulted in wide ranging discussions marked by unguarded sincerity. Certain themes are touched upon numerous times [the Black Power movement & the need for jazz musicians to unite and practice cooperative economics], which while perhaps dating the book, nevertheless provide a telling contrast to the current state of affairs in the music world in general, and the social concerns of the U.S. Black community specifically. This clearly was a labor of love, and the insights shared by these iconic figures consistently inspire me to make the most of my time and efforts in whatever I'm pursuing, every time I read from the book."},{"Title":"Notes and tones: Musician to musician interviews","review":"A genuinely fascinating collection of interviews with some of the most important jazz figures of the 1950s-60s. (It's worth the purchase price just for the goofy, entertaining exchange with Dexter Gordon which opens the book.) Not only do you get an unusually intimate sense of what some of these brilliant musicians were/are actually like in &quot;real life,&quot; but the book is particularly interesting--and frank--about the subject of race, in the jazz world and beyond. If you love jazz, don't miss this book."},{"Title":"Notes and tones: Musician to musician interviews","review":"I bought this book as a gift, and the reaction was just what I had hoped for. The recipient, a musician, loved it! I hope to borrow the book in the future."},{"Title":"Notes and tones: Musician to musician interviews","review":"Arthur Taylor is well known to musicians and people who follow the music. There are 29 interviews of artists many of whom are innovators. This expanded edition contains more interviews than the first book, although i have not seen the former. I'm not sure that this book is still available. Mr Taylor mentions over 200 interviews; hopefully these are not lost and will be published by a music scholar like the incomparable Steve Coleman. There are candid discussions of the ever recurring police brutality and other racism, corruption of the music by imitators and the industry, and drugs. Many artists speak candidly, because they trust Mr Taylor. Readers will be excited to find that Mr Parker (Yardbird, Bird) was influenced by Don Byas, Buster Smith and Lester Young. It's interesting to note that in regard to Yardbird, Benny Golson (not interviewed) has said we were all moving that way. The book is a must for young musicians, because there are pathways elucidated that can allow the younger ones to follow the course of the innovators. By that, i mean contrary to what one often reads, steps in music don't occur in isolation and musicians learn from those who came before and contemporaries but also other instumentalists and vocalists. This music didn't come from the church, Jelly Roll or Louis individually. Although \\"jazz\\" music represented a departure from western music, it was not as far as some think, because the old masters, such as Beethoven, could improvise. Improvisation has been largely lost by \\"classical\\" musicians and seems to be disappearing among young \\"jazz\\" musicians. Yardbird excelled in improvisation. The musicians interviewed seem to be consistent in disregarding the comments of critics, something i learned years ago. The thing missing from the book is the other interviews; the book is not written in a novel style."},{"Title":"Notes and tones: Musician to musician interviews","review":"This book is a great collection of musician to musician interviews.

A.T.'s questions were intelligent, pointed and insightful. I loved the interview format. It gave the musicians an even wider canvas to paint on. The no-holds-barred and candid portrait of Black life should be a book to cherish for ages to come."},{"Title":"Notes and tones: Musician to musician interviews","review":"This collection of interviews is a treasure trove for curious musicians and music lovers, and students and researchers of African-America culture during the twentieth century.For non-musicians a little about the author, Art Taylor, is in order. He was one of the most prolific and highly regarded drummers of his era. He was highly sought as a studio drummer and consequently appeared on a significant number of jazz albums recorded in the 1950s through 1960s. He was important enough to merit a place in Bert Korall'sDrummin' Men: The Heartbeat of Jazz The Bebop Years.The fact that Taylor was friends and colleagues with the musicians he interviewed gives this book an intimate feel. Each of the subjects come across as completely at ease and trusting, saying - perhaps - things that they would not tell other interviewers or journalists.On the other hand, Taylor does not have a ready list of interview questions that will be consistently asked of all of the subjects. As such, it can be difficult to spot overarching patterns in views, as well as to spot contrasts between and among the musicians in this book. Personally, I love the way the interviews were conducted because Taylor's personal knowledge and friendship allowed him to elicit absolute truth and honesty.Questions ranged from thoughts on other musicians to how some interviewees felt about the Beatles, to the use of electronic instruments in music. Regardless of the variety of questions that Taylor asked, one topic was constant throughout each session: race. Remember that the twenty-nine musicians interviewed represented some of the best and brightest contributors to America's true art form - jazz - which was a product of African-American creativity. The answers from the majority were consistently in agreement.Normally there is no such thing as a spoiler in a non-fiction book, but if I were to reveal the trends of answers it would be tantamount to providing one. I do, however, encourage you to use the Look Inside feature at the top of this page and first look at the table of contents to see who was interviewed, and second, use the Surprise Me feature a few times to get a sense of the questions asked, and the responses.For readers who wish to use this book in conjunction with African-American cultural studies or as jazz musician biographers I highly recommend checking outParis Without Regret: James Baldwin, Chester Himes, Kenny Clarke, and Donald Byrd, which adds yet another viewpoint to four great African-Americans (two of whom are writers and two who are famous jazz musicians.)Finally, if you want my personal recommendation for an album on which Art Taylor is featured, it would beThe Ultimate Jazz Collection."},{"Title":"Web Standards Programmer's Reference: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and PHP","review":"This is a great reference book for beginners...

In doing so, and aiding its growth, has been the use and development of several languages. Naturally, Schafer starts with the language that birthed the Web - HTML. Actually this needs its dual (\\"twin\\") on a server, http. But Schafer discusses http in a later chapter devoted to CGI.Hopefully, you should be able to appreciate that HTML is simple. In fact, of all that the book discusses, HTML is the simplest language. Several initial chapters walk you through HTML. It must be stressed that mastery of HTML is needed to make sense of the rest of the book.The later languages either extend the scope of an HTML file, or they generate the file, roughly speaking. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) lets you easily factor out common definitions that are used across multiple web pages, where you can imagine that each web page corresponds to a file storing it. Schafer explains how to use CSS to simplify management of a set of HTML files. A centralised way to set common fonts and the like. More robust.But HTML is a declarative language. Good, because laymen can more easily understand and write such languages. It's easier to say what should be done, than how to do it. But for the times when you need more expressive power on the browser, Schafer offers JavaScript. A procedural language that actually has nothing to do with Java. [The coincidence in names was a marketing ploy.]Schafer does not ignore the server. CGI is given, as the first generation attempt at server side code. Its limitations spawned the use of Perl, PHP and Python for easier parsing of user input and generation of new dynamic pages.Each of these languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Perl, PHP and Python) is often the subject of its own book.

It is not a must have and if I had been able to scan the book before buying I would not have purchased it. While I agree some of the information is interesting (not altogether new) it is dated and has information that is in direct contradiction to information published since its original publication. The book has a 1963 copyright. Accordingly, the information on vehicles, guns, bows (all the bows were recurve and compounds with faster arrow speeds were not even invented!), and other equipment such as treestands, etc. is very outdated (as readily seen by the pictures). Some information is never outdated such as where to aim when shooting a deer and how to field dress a deer so it is good to read again.Information on how a deer's eyes work and their other habits does not seem to be up to date (for example there is no discussion about the sensitivity to ultraviolet light). I found a much more detailed discussion of scrapes and rubs in \\"The Advance Deer Hunter's Bible\\" by Weis (sp?) althought that book was also a little dated (1993 I think).There are better books out there and much better articles in many of the magazines that hit the stands during hunting season.

The happy ending is when he helps his friend (the bus which breaks down) by taking the children home.Thomas is obviously thrilled to be able to help the children. What a warm, sweet message to give to the young readers!This is an \\"I can read it all by myself Dr. Seuss Beginner Book\\", and it's written as though a young reader should read it, in very short, choppy sentences (\\"My name is Thomas. Watch me push! Watch me pull!... Stop or go. Help or hurry.\\"But the actual words used are not those that the true beginning reader will be able to read on his or her own. (station, somebody, coaches, Clarabel, bridge, should, friend, passengers, etc.) It's fine to have very simple sentences for the beginning reader; or to address the book to the not-such-a-beginner-reader. But this book seems to take the worst combination; dumbed down story with too-hard words.That said, my children really enjoy this book; the annoying aspects only seem to annoy me. And, of course, their opinion is what really counts.

It is never mentioned where exactly this class trip is and hard to tell by the way they are dressed. What is portrayed is how much fun it would be to be the train that takes the kids on the school trip. Before they depart the trains, known as Henry, Thomas and James are scrubbed so their engines are shiny and bright. \\" The train yard is ready.\\"Thomas the Tank Engine is all excited when the children arrive wanting them to see him push and pull. But it turns out that Thomas the Tank Engine has work to do on his regular branch line, which makes him sad as he would rather have fun taking the children on their school trip. \\" Sir Topham Hat has an idea. Do your job, Thomas. Then hurry back. You can take the children home.\\" This sets the train in motion to rush about his regular routine just so he can take the kids home. What this shows in my opinion is Thomas the Tank Engine slacking off on his duties just so he can have fun. This is not a good message for my son to learn at this point in time.Instead of the happy Thomas the Tank Engine content on his rides he is sad and thinking of hurrying back for the kids instead of focusing on the task at hand and gets upset when he has to wait for his loads and obstacles along the route. His face is red as he is riding up a hill and over a bridge and then through a tunnel. All the while the coaches Annie and Clarabel are reminding him to hurry back so they can take the children home. If they are late another train will do the job. Up ahead Thomas sees Bertie the Bus broken down, but first he ponders whether he should stop and help or continue on hurrying to get to the station before another train to take the kids home.My son was able to read through Thomas the Tank Engine and the School Trip several times, but it was boring for him since he knew the ending. He also had many questions like where the kids were going on the trip and why they were all dressed in the same clothes. The last page is a green background that makes the text hard to read for my son also. He also wanted to know about what age the kids were on the school trip. It was hard to tell but they appear to be older like ten to thirteen perhaps.For kids who are fans of Thomas the Tank Engine they will like the book.

Why, the local school children are going on an outing.Well, as we know, Thomas loves children and he very much wants to take them on a ride, but he has work to do on his branch line. Sir Topham Hatt tells him, however, that if he finishes his work fast, that he may take the children home. Thomas works hard to accomplish this goal, but is thwarted by fate, sheep and cows.

The drawings show Thomas up close and with lots of facial expression. The print is large and clear. (I don't need my spec's. LOL) But......Here is where I have to disagree with the publishers. They say that children from \`preschoolers to grade 1' should be able to \\"recognize familiar words and sound out new words with help.\\"I've included some text above so you can judge for yourself if the level is appropriate for your child, but in my opinion this is not at kindergarten level.Five Stars.

He writes well with style, grace and wit, and he gives a lot of interesting information about how various animals and plants came to be incorporated into the America landscape and enterprise.From apples to kudzu he details which aliens have been a boon and which have been a sorry bust. In the case of kudzu (Pueraria lobata, which I saw for the first time in a Louisiana swamp a week before hurricane Katrina hit), \\"It Seemed a Good Idea at the Time\\" (title of one of his chapters). That was before people realized that kudzu completely blankets \\"whatever it grows on in a smothering welter of leaves and vines\\" strangling trees and other vegetation to death. (p. 161)Also not a good idea was the introduction of carp into America's waters. Leland opines that \\"Most fishermen and environmentalist regard its widespread introduction...as a disaster...,\\" although there are some, including the Carp Angler Group, who have a different opinion. Similarly, people differ about whether it was a good idea to bring the starling (one of the birds mentioned in Shakespeare's works) to America since it is now considered \\"a dirty, noisy, gregarious, and aggressive\\" bird that has displaced native species. Perhaps the worst of the \\"it seemed like a good idea at the time\\" species is the gypsy moth, brought to America as a possible silk worm. Leland goes into some detail about \\"well-intentioned dreamers of silken fortunes\\" in the chapter, \\"A Sow's Ear from a Silk Purse.\\"But these deliberately introduced species are relatively benign in the public eye compared to those that have freeloaded their way into our land and have more or less taken over in ways that we cannot control. The German cockroach, the Norway or brown rat, and the tumbleweed (surprisingly not native to the land of the cowboy but from Russia (with love)--oh, you deluded Sons of the Pioneers!) are three that Leland zeroes in on. He also has a few words to say about the American cockroach (probably not American--also called the palmetto bug) and the Oriental cockroach. Here in southern California we have all three, the German, the American and the Oriental. The German is the ever so prolific one that lives indoors in apartment houses and restaurants the world over, while the larger American and Oriental tend to live outdoors. I sometimes find one of the latter in my house dried up and dead in a corner or in a drawer, having wandered in and found nothing to eat and no moisture.An introduced species that is perhaps an even bigger pest here in the southland is the Argentine ant, which Leland unaccountably does not mention. I recommend he take a study on it. There's enough material there to write a book and then some. Once the Argentine ant (small and black with only an occasional tiny bite) sets up shop inside the walls or under an establishment such as an apartment building or a college dormitory, it is there to stay.What Leland does so very well in this book, and what makes it superior to some other books I have read, is integrate the alien species into the historical and cultural experience of the American people. In his chapter, \\"Out of Africa,\\" he details \\"How Slavery Transformed the American Landscape and Diet.\\" I had to laugh when I read that watermelon is not native to America but comes from Africa, as do peanuts and Bermuda grass, sesame seed and of course the cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) also known as the black-eyed pea. I had to laugh because I recalled Randy Newman's satirical song encouraging Africans to come to America in the early days of the republic for \\"the sweet watermelon and the buckwheat cake\\"!Naturally, it is not in any way surprising that many of our foods come from other lands since most of the world's cuisines have found a home in American. Rice is not native, although the so-called \\"wild rice\\" is. Wheat comes from the Middle East as most people know, while potatoes are native to the Andes in South American.In the chapter \\"Cowboys and Their Alien Habits\\" Leland recalls the familiar story of how the horse was once native to America but had gone extinct here before Columbian times, and then was accidentally reintroduced by the Spanish explorers after which it revolutionized the Plains Indians' way of life. (p. 92) Also alien are the cowboy's cattle, including the Texas longhorn; and if we go back far enough even the \\"Indians,\\" the so-called native Americans are not native. Sad to say many of the true natives, like the giant sloth and the cave bear and the great mammoth went extinct coincidental with the arrival of the first humans from across the Bering Strait.The only problem I have with this book and others like it, is that there is never enough. The way plants and animals have moved around the world and the way they have changed the lives of people is a continual source of fascination. Leland's fine book adds to the reader's pleasure while not sating it."},{"Title":"Aliens In The Backyard: Plant And Animal Imports Into America","review":"We've all heard tales of the dreaded zebra mussel, rampant purple loosestrife, or prolific European starling, but if you think exotic species are the exception, even a quick browse of Leland's entertaining compendium of aliens will set you straight. You can't step into your backyard without treading on interlopers, like the favored Kentucky bluegrass.From the hallucinogenic properties of hemp, morning glory, datura and more; to attempts to cultivate the silkworm; to rats, cockroaches and disease, Leland's essays offer an entertaining history of facts, rumors and squabbles on an exhaustive number of alien species. Whether purposely (often to rid the place of some other unwanted interloper) or accidentally introduced, aliens have long thrived in their new home and many have come to be considered natives.A professor of English at the Virginia Military Institute, Leland (\\"Porcher's Creek: Lives Between the Tides\\") writes with wit and a certain wicked relish, and his research is dizzyingly thorough. But the sheer width and breadth of information is overwhelming. This is a book to keep, to dip into again and again a chapter or even a few pages at a time, so as to have some hope of retention.With chapter titles like \\"Out of Africa,\\" \\"Cowboys: And Their Alien Habits,\\" \\"It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time,\\" and \\"Bioterror: Older than You Think,\\" Leland makes an appreciative and entertaining case for the melting pot."},{"Title":"Aliens In The Backyard: Plant And Animal Imports Into America","review":"There's a lot of information in here, most of it presented in a nicely readable way. I did fade out a bit over the medicines and drugs; those you hear so much about.

One lesson to draw from these stories of where people's enthusiasms have led is to beware of the next great idea a politician or potential reformer is dedicated to promoting.

It was then I learned about a lot of obscure creature that had invaded the US in ballast, on plants, in clothing, and on wood, rock, sand, and just about any commodity or personal effect. The invasion has not stopped, but it is often not even known to be going on by the general public, except in some high profile invasions such as the Asian tiger mosquito!John Leland, in his \\"Aliens in the Backyard: Plant and Animal Imports into America\\" presents us with many (but certainly not all) of these imported organisms, from starlings to Russian thistle and from dogs (first brought in by Native Americans) to anthrax. Some of these introductions changed history as they destroyed or interfered with crops, or were of medical importance. Smallpox, unknown in America, was used to kill Native Americans long before anyone heard of a virus by transferring contaminated blankets to the intended victims. Both diseases and destroyers of crops had their effects on armies and the outcomes of wars, as well as the physical and economic health of the hemisphere.Despite a few irritating typos, I found the book to be basically accurate and I learned a few things as well, such as the fact that all species of human lice were already present in the New World when Columbus landed. Typhus may have been here as well.This is one of those eye-opening books that should be read by everyone, especially if you are concerned with security. We don't need terrorists (although they can help things along) to cause major impacts on society. Nature and our own mobility can do it as efficiently or even better! We should also keep in mind that we, who evolved on the plains of Africa, are aliens to the New World as well!

The author is a hand-wringing church-lady with a distorted view of culture, gets many facts wrong (John Cage didn't live in California for example), laces his sharp as a butter-knife observations with snarkastic comments in a cringe-worthy attempt to appear sophisticated, and pulls tin-foil hat nonsense from nut job sources such as Robert Larson Christian ministries...much of the book made me howl with laughter but I'm sure this was not intentional.How could Inner Traditions have published this book?

There are interesting details about Chinese and Asian music, but the anti-African stance is both irrational and blatantly racist. It reports absurd rumours as if they are facts, for example that the Soviets were secretly financing western music as they 'knew' it would cause capitalism to collapse.

These 'conservatives' just like the fake money preachers on tv are under the same degenerate hypnotic effect of music as everyone else.

Tame's analysis of 20th-century classical music is completely one-sided, with examples carefully selected to support his point of view. Here's his view briefly summed up: All 20th-century music is a heap of unholy garbage. The problem is that he focuses only on the most avant-garde and radical composers (Schoenberg, Cage etc.) Where do composers such as Bartok, Prokofiev, or Messiaen fit in his analysis? They receive no mention. For Tame, the 20th century was simply a diabolical parade starting with Debussy and ending with cacophonous rock. I agree completely with Tame that atonality and other radical developments are unhealthy and anti-musical; but there is more to 20th-century music than the ten most avant-garde composers! In a false dichotomy, he places the avant-gardists on one hand and on the other hand such unabashed traditionalists and romanticists as Rachmaninoff and Vaughan Williams, whom he absolutely adores. In short, his picture of music in the 20th century is skewed and dishonest. Yes, great music was produced by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and all the old masters of western music. But great music was also produced in the 20th century - music of emotional depth, intellectual acuity, and (often strange) beauty. So Tame does not care for 20th-century music. Fine; but why does he have to smear all of it with a kind of moral depravity?Many of Tame's conclusions are wild, and some are positively bogus - none more so than those concerning one of the founders of modernism, Igor Stravinsky. For example, his assertion that Stravinsky had a lot in common with the rock-and-roll culture because of his \\"degenerative\\" lifestyle. Can we have some evidence to back up this assertion?! Pretty soon he's ridiculously comparing poor Igor to the Rolling Stones. Again, Tame concentrates only on Stravinsky's most radical (for its time) work: THE RITE OF SPRING. Tame seems to think that this is the only thing Stravinsky wrote and focuses on it to the exclusion of all his other music - an attitude I associate with the musically unsophisticated. What about an assessment of Stravinsky's later music, which shows a strain of conservatism and a concern for the musical values which Tame upholds? There is a real difference between the Stravinsky of THE RITE OF SPRING and the Stravinsky of the SYMPHONY OF PSALMS; but in his desire to paint him as a barbarian radical, Tame neglects to give a textured picture. In addition, Tame's statement on p. 97 that Stravinsky touched virtually all of the \\"New Music\\" styles is very misleading; to my knowledge, he did not turn late in life to computer music! Stravinsky's religious faith and his general classical Christian outlook get no mention. And pardon me for mentioning it, but anyone who thinks OEDIPUS REX is mockery of opera is not playing with a full deck of cards. Can anyone take this author seriously?I think we have serious reason to doubt the musical expertise of a writer who writes the following phrase: \\"[The music of THE RITE OF SPRING] reaches such a crescendo of hedonistic abandonment...\\" Anyone with a high school education and/or an elementary musical training knows that a crescendo is a climax, not the building to a climax. Please, savor that marvelous little sentence. It tells us a lot about the author."},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Music: The Transformation of Self and Society through Musical Energy","review":"Mister Tame writes a provocative book.His research is excellent and he brings forward interesting topics that should be at the core of the teachings of music theory. But...His analysis is weak and one sided. Contemporary music brought about a much needed discussion on spirituality, allowing for great religion to be viewed in their similarities.Music is an art that use sound and non-sound and can not be defined by acoustic principles of tones although it may use this element.The study of Tones (as differentiable angles) and resonance should be studied from kindergarden to universities. It is important and that could really change the world for the better.The judgement pronounced on many musical work is shallow. He doesn't understand the true function of music and he is accusing many of materialism while himself seem trapped in that cloud.Any way, a book worth being read!"},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Music: The Transformation of Self and Society through Musical Energy","review":"The book starts with some history of how some people and powers dealt with music, since, as we all know, music has the power to influence our emotions. Duh, nothing new here, but then Tame goes on to stating as fact his own narrow religious world view. He writes that our \\"materialist\\" world has given us music that is devoid of spirituality. Is music the chicken or the egg? Yet critics have found every new musical idea to be atacked as immoral, the same for all art. He ends with a few lines from the Sex Pistols as proof the world is going to hell in a handbasket. And this Intro is the best part, it's all downhill from there into primal mysticism and worse.For example, this comical contradiction he claims is self evident: religious belief is not superstition but \\"some form of Higher Truth\\" at the core of all things. In other words SUPERSTITION!The book is out of print and has countless used copies for sale for a good reason. Save your two dollars for something else."},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Music: The Transformation of Self and Society through Musical Energy","review":"The intention of this book is in the right place. It's a wake-up call to society on the destructive effects of modern music, and conversely, the healing power of the more traditional forms.The author discusses 20TH Century classical music (the &quot;New Music&quot;), jazz &amp; rock, Indian, and Chinese music, and discusses the physiological effects of music. His discussion about Chinese and Indian music is fascinating, and he seems fairly objective here (not in being strictly factual (he includes the oriental theories and myths in the material), but rather that he is able to discuss this music without passing esthetic judgement.)His discussion of the &quot;New Music&quot; and Rock/Jazz is much too one-sided. I totally agree with him that early jazz (the blues) and rock are particulary destructive (stand back and examine the lyrics to most songs... I rest my case.) I would also agree with the author that the atonality of most 20TH century &quot;classical&quot; music, not being rooted in the physics of the harmonic series, is also very destructive. (As he points out, this music is so universally disliked that in practice it's not so destructive -- because few people listen to it.)However, there are several inaccuracies in his critique of 20TH century art forms, and he argues his case with the fanaticism ......... that I find most unattractive. He is also quite fond of circular reasoning.As one example, he criticizes composer Steve Reich for having imitated the rythmns of african drumming in his music, claiming that Reich is somehow re-enacting barbaric voodoo rituals in his music. Yes, it's true that Reich's inspiration comes his study of African drumming, but to claim that Reich is consciously (or unconsciously for that matter) attempting to create music suitable for voodoo is absolutely ridiculus. (For one thing, drumming is part of all African ritual, both voodoo and more constructive uses.) In his section on rock, he compares the incessant drumbeat to a shaman's ritual, and notes that rock drummers can sometimes move into a trance state during their performances. Yet, that's the whole point of shamanic drumming (the trance), and that's part of the healing, not the destructive, power of the drum.He spends a page deriding Wendy Carlos' &quot;Switched on Bach&quot; recordings, yet for that whole page, he never really explained what made them bad, except that they were synthesized (so that makes them bad?) and that they made a lot of money. His scathing criticisms about the use of computers to compose or teach music are really unfair and miss the point entirely. Computer composition in the 70's were really about AI experimentation - I'm sure nobody thought that computers would actually compete with a human composer!His main complaint about Jazz is it's over-sesuality. I would agree with him here, after re-listening to some of my (instrumental) jazz recordings. Yet so is the Isolde Liebestod from Wagner's &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot;, yet he holds Wagner's music in high esteem. (as well he should :-) For some people, sensuous jazz would be healing. For others it is unbalancing. Yet the author seems unable or unwilling to provide a more moderate view of music."},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Music: The Transformation of Self and Society through Musical Energy","review":"I see that some of Tame's opinions on \\"new\\" music and jazz/blues etc. have angered some of the earlier reviewers, and I do agree that in a few cases he might be a bit harsh in his perspective while boosting music that is not that much better. However, in general, I believe his perspectives to be right on, not out of the mind of strict repressive fundamentalist, but out of the mind and heart of a being who is witnessing music as it really is, and is not afraid to use his discernment with a bigger scope than most might. This book gives important insight into music, and regardless of your orientation to music, it will give you a much deeper perspective, and I recomend it to all of you. His perspectives are greatly needed, and his discernment is in most cases very good. If more musicians read this book and took it to heart, we would at least find ourselves in the midst of a more mindful, selfless, and intelligent music than we would otherwise."},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Music: The Transformation of Self and Society through Musical Energy","review":"This book is interesting, I will give it that; however, there are many problems I see in it, a few of which I will list here.First, the author appears to be coming from a premise of a combination of spiritualism, mysticism, and a dose of Christian theosophism. There are distinct underlying premises and presuppositions about human nature, morality, and the spiritual that clearly will have an affect on any discourse on the power of music with relation to humanity.Second, multiple logical errors and fallacies are made, including false dichotomies and mixing correlation with causation (or, you might say, symptoms and causes). For example, when discussing ancient Chinese civilization and the alleged practice to listen to the music of various regions to assess the country's unity, it is alleged that the music was the *cause* of the unity or discord, rather than simply a symptom. A plausible and logical argument could be made that the music (along with diet, dance style, clothing, and a host of other cultural idiosyncrasies) is simply a symptom of the relative discord or unity, but not the cause.Third, a variety of factual errors are presented. For example, there appears to be no evidence that Tchaikovsky committed an \\"honor\\" suicide - that is simply theorized, but entirely unproven. Or, as another example, the fake Priory of Sion list that included Debussy has (in 1993) been shown/admitted to be a hoax. Other hasty generalizations that could very easily be seen as factual errors are references to the character and relative morality of classical and romantic composers, the alleged goal or aim of these composers (altruism, spiritual enlightenment, betterment of humanity, etc).Fourth, there are many, many unfounded, non-cited, non-referenced, and quite broad assertions about everything from composer's lives to music history to music influences; some of them are clearly faulty according to known music history. For example, the idea that classical music almost solely was based on music from the church is simply not true; there was much secular music (all dance music!) throughout the ages, and there were entire classical forms (the dance suite) based on them, and their influence on other classical forms is quite evident. Furthermore, much folk music was incorporated into classical music before the 20th century.Fifth, the assertions of inherent morality of a given music genre tends to be drawn from the way the music was used; however, it is overlooked that much of the classical music before the 20th century was not only used for, shall we say, seedy purposes, but much of it used references or depictions of immoral behavior as part of the entertainment; for example, many operas deal with extramarital sex, trysts, murders, the occult, and the like... and not only the ones towards the end of the 19th century.To summarize, I have found the book to be very entirely based on a mystic worldview, and get the sense that the author wanted to make his point before knowing whether or not the evidence supported it. Furthermore, the faulty logic, factual errors, bad reasoning, and apparent lack of knowledge of music history make it hard to take the author seriously. If you do read this book, I would suggest you fact-check much of what the author says, and not be confused when the author confuses or misapplies terms."},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Music: The Transformation of Self and Society through Musical Energy","review":"Music is the language of the soul, perhaps even more powerfully so than is poetry. This book opened my eyes to the realization that there is much more to music than &quot;entertainment&quot;. In one sense it is true that &quot;we are what we eat&quot;, since our bodies are composed by the substances we partake of as food. But, most of us do not realize how we are influenced at the psychological or soul level by the music that is a part of our lives. After reading this book I understand that Music is one of the most powerful forces in the shaping of our destiny and personalities. This may sound like &quot;too much&quot;, but, I may suggest that you reserve such a judgment until after you read it!"},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Music: The Transformation of Self and Society through Musical Energy","review":"I have not studied music formally, but for many years have been listening, and have taught myself how to read, write and play for the piano. I very much enloyed Mr. Tame's book for several reasons. I believe it to be clearly written (which unfortunately is not a general trait of music writers) replete of the writer's love of music, and with enough wit and irony to punctuate his justified disgust over many forms of modern music. What I liked, however, most about the book was the effort he spent in trying to prove his belief that it is music that more influences culture than the converse. The case he makes for this, whether or not one agrees, is compelling. Especially when one observes what has become of the music that sprang on this culture about a century ago, and how contemporary music of this type is affecting those who listen to it. If one takes only a moment to observe the general effect that punk, rap, and the various forms of heavy metal, have on their respective listeners, I think one would see that it is generally negative. Indeed, if noise, anger and brutality encouragement are not the trademarks of such music, than what are the trademarks? And how could such messages not have a negative impact on an impressionable minds exposed for several hours a day to them? I think in his book Mr. Tame expresses valid concern over the disasterous impact that much of modern music is having on its listeners, and society overall. And I believe his concern is more and more justified as the new millennium approaches."},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Music: The Transformation of Self and Society through Musical Energy","review":"Anyone who is interested in leading a spiritual life should read this book.

Tame's book does us the favor of beginning us thinking and investigating and being attentive to music's influence.I agree with several other reviewers who contend that in certain arguments, justification for critique is not forthcoming. Thus four stars instead of five."},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Music: The Transformation of Self and Society through Musical Energy","review":"This book sat on my shelf for many years, unread. When I finally began reading it today, I was disgusted by the holier-than-thou attitudes.Speaking of Buddy Bolden as one of the first jazz musicians, the author is unable to say anything meaningful about his actual music. Tame instead discusses the heavy drinking and syphilis which led to Bolden's commitment to a state institution, and then casts a pall over the whole genre by stating that Bolden's degenerate biography \\"set the pattern for all that jazz was to become and result in.\\" Critics that are unable to describe anything specific about the actual techniques of music are a dime-a-dozen, and predictably, Tame focuses here on the personal life of the musician rather than the music itself. Tame's comments about jazz are insulting to anyone who has played and/or listened to jazz. Not all jazz musicians have substance abuse problems or social diseases: I played jazz for over 4 decades and have neither, thank you. And if some musicians have bad habits, that is their business: listen to the MUSIC, damn it.Perhaps it is the improvisational component of jazz that upsets Tame. In the twentieth century, improvisation had for the most part become a lost art in academic and art music circles, even though it was known that many composers such as Mozart, Bach and Beethoven could improvise with a facility that rivaled their compositional abilities. Jazz musicians have a common vocabulary and a common if unspoken etiquette for musical interaction. Even more importantly, they have a solid aural tradition; and in the course of their learning process (often a largely self-taught one) they learn much of what they know by imitation and memorization, without the use of written scores. The free-flowing, spontaneous musical result of such an education clearly poses a threat to someone as obviously anal-retentive as Mr. Tame.I studied 16th century counterpoint with the famous music educator and scholar Douglass M. Green. He once pointed out to me that, during his tenure at the Eastman School of Music, he noticed that jazz musicians often were better at writing counterpoint (both 16th and 18th century) than their fellow students who only had a classical background. The clear connection between the melodic content of classical counterpoint and modern jazz improvisation belies Tame's implications that jazz is simply a late-arriving aberration.A glance at the index of this book reveals the extent of the author's expertise regarding jazz: jazz great John Coltrane is not even mentioned in a book published 18 years after his death.Another troubling aspect of this book is the liberal sprinkling of homophobic comments. The author tells us that the ancient Greeks started playing too many notes without enough substance, degenerated into homosexuality, and then the whole civilization fell into ruin. He describes Tchaikovsky's downward spiral as the result of his sexual preference, without even considering the possibility that societal attitudes and mores that push certain behaviors into the shadows may be the real problem.As another reviewer pointed out, lumping Stravinsky's marvelous \\"Rite of Spring\\" in with John Cage's music constitutes a critical brush-stroke that is much too broad in its dismissal of most 20th century art music.Like a eunuch in a harem, David Tame is just another critic who knows how it's done, sees it done every day, but cannot do it himself.

This author and others believe that portions of Shakespeare's works were written by at least two other people. The actual identity of the author(s) will forever be a mystery. However, Fields does research and travels to England to answer some of the questions and gives ideas on who he thinks the actual authors really are.The book is interesting and enjoyable. There is an author interview available on the Larry King Live web site.

He shocked the Baltimore-Washington D.C. audience with the comment that Wm. Shakespere of Avon was not the author of the beloved poems, sonnets and plays. Since then, I have had real interest to find out the facts of the case. When reading this tomb I did satisfy that long time urge to know but figured out the real author before the end of the book and put it down. Lots of repetitive facts and situations, including those commenting on the sexual preferences of the many suspects, that in itself was a real hoot! But alas, there will never be a common conclusion for the question \\"Who is the real William Shakespere?\\""},{"Title":"Players: The Mysterious Identity of William Shakespeare","review":"A lot of books about Shakespeare are written by people who wish they were the bard and they shower you with heaps of unnecessary verbiage. The great thing about this book is that it is written by a laywer, Bertam Fields, who succinctly tells you everything we actually know about Shakespeare, offers you the various theories about who really may have written the plays and finally serves up his own conclusions. The author doesn't try to jam any particular viewpoint down your throat. He's great! There are probably some inaccuracies and flaws in this book that \\"Shakespeare-is-the-Straford-man\\" proponents are going to pounce upon, but I would argue that it's impossible for anyone to write a biography that doesn't get a few facts wrong, so give Bertram a break. If you haven't read a biography on Shakespeare this is a good place to start!"},{"Title":"Players: The Mysterious Identity of William Shakespeare","review":"The question of the real Shakespeare is one that won't go away. Every time the issue is declared solved/dissolved, it resurrects, and this amusing summary of the evidence concerning the identity of the playwright of the plays versus the man from Stratford is provocative and hard to rebut. As proof of this I tried to avoid the book, and to leave the matter to rest in my mind, but curiousity got the better of me, with skeptical consequences. Perhaps it will pass, but... The problem starts with the attempts to go further and speculate about someone other than the Shakespeare we know, so-called. The question is dismissed at insane, puerile or crackpot, but the standard history faces some serious anomalies, of dates, composition, ability, education, knowledge exhibited in the plays, especially of overseas places such as Italy. Once this evidence is collated in reasonable fashion sans the standard crank-headedness of many such works, the total is unsettling. Many things don't add up, starting with the facts of the known Shakespeare's early circumstances and education, the speed of composition, and ending with his wills and the complete absence of commentary on his death. This peculiar situation of authorship bathed in semi-anonymity, where most contemporaries left biographical detail and records of passage, doesn't make any sense on its own terms, but doesn't prove anything certain either. But the suggestion remains of a mystery person unaccounted for, to resolve the contradictions staring out from the facts. But it seems, then, the mission was accomplished, that we may never know.Unlike many treatments of this subject, this one tends toward presenting the difficult facts, and letting them rest, and the result tweaks the enigma the more."},{"Title":"Players: The Mysterious Identity of William Shakespeare","review":"This is truly an execrable book. This is a waste of perfectly good trees for no good reason. For those knowledgeable about the Shakespeare authorship issue, the book is nothing more than a half-baked synopsis of other more scholarly works. Both Stratfordians and Oxfordians can join in chorus to dislike this misbegotten creature. For those who are unfamiliar with the authorship issues, it must be an incomprehensible meringue of unrelated facts, dates, names, literary allusions, associations and whatever else the author can throw in to this horrendous mess.Judith Regan must have owed the author, Bertram Fields, (\\"widely regarded as the most prominent entertainment lawyer in America\\") some big-time favor to publish this vainglorious train wreck. Possibly this widely regarded prominent entertainment lawyer did her some big-time prominent favor and Judith had Regan Books put out this big-time prominent stinker. (It's a contest to see how many pejorative adjectives can be used in one review.)The book has no bibliography. Apparently, this lawyer never read one other book worth noting in a bibliography. On the other hand, names seem to drop out of nowhere. Concerning, the Earl of Oxford, the author mentions Joseph Sobran, Charlton Ogburn, Barbara Burris and Roger Stritmatter, but somehow fails to mention what books they wrote. The Oxford chapter reads like a high school condensation of Ogburn's \\"The Mysterious William Shakespeare.\\" Good lord, does the author have to ape Ogburn's title? Noticeably missing are references to is Diana Price's \\"Shakespeare's Unorthodox Biography\\" that settles who Shakspere was once and for all, and makes this exercise in literary flatulence unnnecesary.While written by a lawyer, the book seems to lack any sense of legal terminology or standards of proof. He writes of Oxford, \\"Of course, there is nothing we can consider \`proof.'\\" This is so strange. Usually lawyers talk of evidence, both direct and circumstantial, which when presented to a jury persuade a jury. No lawyer usually says that the fingerprints on the gun are \\"proof\\" of anything. This like everything else in this woe-begotten piece of dreck is over simplification to the point of absurdity. Neither the Stratfordians, nor Oxfordians, rest their case on one piece of evidence as \\"proof.\\" What they say is that the circumstances and all available evidence point to their candidate.Whatever the innumerable faults of this child of vanity, labeled a book, at least he got one thing right, \\"Oxford's life, education, knowledge and accomplishments seem a far better fit with Shakespeare than do those of the Stratford man.\\" Hooray, one solid conclusion.However, we have these gems. \\"Oxford died on June 24, 1604, apparently of the plague.\\" Then later he contradicts himself with \\"at least some of the plays were written after 1604.\\" Since these two statements contradict, this Detective Clouseau never considers that maybe Oxford did not die in 1604.Oxford did not die in 1604. He disappeared and retired to Mersea on the English Channel, near Oxford's Hedingham Castle. There Oxford finished his last two works as Shakespeare, both acknowledged to be among the last, if not the last: the Tempest and Shake-speares Sonnets. His other work was the creation of the King James Bible. Oxford had extensive knowledge of the Bible as shown by the literary references in Shakespeare and the underlinings in his Geneva Bible in the possession of the Shakespeare-Folger Library. Thus, the greatest works of literature, the works of Shakespeare and the King James Bible came from the hand of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.Paul Streitz(...)"},{"Title":"Players: The Mysterious Identity of William Shakespeare","review":"If you are a scholar, start with Brenda James' \\"The Truth Will Out.\\" It is heavily footnoted and well researched.If you are a Shakespearian novice flying to England (from the states) with time for leisurely reading, you could do worse than Bertram Fields' soft cover. It reads quickly, and you will be brought up to speed with the current arguments regarding Shakespeare's identity.Both James and Fields come to the same conclusion: the real Shakespeare had to have been university educated, a continental traveler, multilingual, and of royal descent. It was rewarding to have first read James who identified a man who met the requirements, and then to read Fields and realize how close he came without being able to come up with a name.It is clear that an actor with a fifth-grade education alone could not have written these plays. Reading James, Fields, and others regarding the authorship question will make you appreciate the Shakespearian plays even more. I would have enjoyed university western literature so much more (30 years ago) had I been aware there was even an authorship question. I would have read the plays more closely looking for my own clues. And that's the importance of books like Fields and James, keeping students (of all ages) excited about reading.(By the way, it is interesting that Harold Bloom has written a book on the authorship of the Book of J, of the Bible, but has not written a book on the authorship of the Shakespearian plays. Or if he has, I am not aware of it, and I would welcome a reference.)"},{"Title":"Players: The Mysterious Identity of William Shakespeare","review":"I give this work two stars-- not based on my own reading, but after having just viewed Mr. Field's appearance on Larry King. To my dismay, neither Mr. Fields or Larry King acknowledged the fine scholarly works that already exist opposing the \\"Received Theory\\" of authorship. Mr. Field's comments on the program suggest he has not read other works such as Joseph Sobran's excellent \\"Alias Shakespeare.\\" Although Sobran was not the first to postulate the Oxfordian view of authorship, he has gone far beyond other all other writers on the subject, and has made a great many original discoveries in support of the Earl of Oxford as the real Shakespeare. Sobran's discoveries can be found both in \\"Alias\\" and on Sobran's web page. Sobran's works are both pleasant and exciting reading, and they demolish the alternative theories which Mr. Fields presented on King's show.

The key to the author's conclusions is that the writer had to be Cambridge educated. The prime suspect(s) are then presented in excellant detail. A must read for anyone who is intrigued by this mystery."},{"Title":"Players: The Mysterious Identity of William Shakespeare","review":"If you're really interested in the Shakespeare authorship question, this is a terrible book to start with. Fields seems to have simply taken claims that he found in various anti-Stratfordian works and organized them into something like a narrative, though it's difficult to tell, because he provides no bibliography and only rarely mentions other authors. (Even when he does mention another writer, he is often confused; thus, the index contains separate entries for \\"Charles Ogburn\\" and \\"Charlton Ogburn\\", though both references should be to Charlton Ogburn.) For the most part, Fields accepts these anti-Stratfordian claims at face value, even though many of them can be shown to be either flat-out false or blatantly misleading.For example, in his conclusion (p. 281), Fields asks, \\"And, if Shakespeare was the Stratford man, why do Henslowe's records fail to list any payment to him for his plays, at least some of which played at Henslowe's Rose?\\". But as Irvin Matus pointed out more than a decade ago in *Shakespeare: IN FACT* (a book Fields does not appear to have read), Shakespeare's plays only played at the Rose in 1592-94, when Henslowe was not recording authors' names; by the time Henslowe started recording payments to playwrights in 1596-97, Shakespeare was with the Lord Chamberlain's Men, Henslowe's chief rivals in London, and there is no reason to expect any mention of Shakespeare in the Diary.On the same page, Fields expresses amazement that no examples of Shakespeare's handwriting survives other than six signatures, concluding that, \\"Evidently, not a scrap exists; and it would not be unreasonable to conclude that not a scrap ever existed, or that, if the Stratford man left writings of any kind, someone set out to eliminate them.\\" This displays an astounding ignorance of the extreme rarity of theatrical manuscripts from Shakespeare's day, and the rarity of any handwriting from middle-class people such as Shakespeare. The only handwriting that survives from Christopher Marlowe is a single signature; the only handwriting that survives from the prolific John Fletcher is a signature and a few words; no certain example of John Webster's handwriting survives, not even a signature. Evidently Fields would conclude that these men could not write either, or that there was a conspiracy to destroy their writings; if not, he is displaying a rather distressing double standard.On the next page, Fields repeats the well-worn anti-Stratfordian chestnut that \\"no one spoke out on the death of the Stratford man in [1616]\\", and asks, \\"Where were the outpourings of grief that followed the deaths of even lesser-known writers?\\" Here, again, Fields exhibits a rather depressing ignorance of the historical context. In the early 17th century, only socially important people such as noblemen (and sometimes church leaders) received printed tributes immediately after their death; tributes for lesser folk such as playwrights circulated in manuscript, often for years, before sometimes making their way to print. There were a great many manuscript tributes to Shakespeare after his death, and the most widespread of these, William Basse's poem, specifies in its title that \\"he died in April 1616\\". The first datable tribute to Shakespeare in print appeared in 1620, four years after his death, followed by the tributes in the First Folio three years after that. The seven years before the printed tributes in the First Folio was, by far, the shortest such period for any English playwright up to that time; the first printed poetic tribute to Francis Beaumont did not appear until 13 years after his death, and the first to John Fletcher did not appear until 14 years after his death.This is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the inaccuracies to be found in this book. Fields does appear to believe what he is saying, but readers should be warned not to take any of his historical claims at face value.Dave Kathmandjk1@ix.netcom.comThe Shakespeare Authorship Page"},{"Title":"Players: The Mysterious Identity of William Shakespeare","review":"After reading a couple of chapters of this book, I noticed many inaccurate statements and decided to check the author's references for the authority for these statements. I discovered that there is no bibliography or chapter notes of any kind. How can someone purport to write a serious historical commentary, especially a pursuasive commentary on a highly debated subject, without listing any sources?Continuing this theme, you will note throughout the book that the author, when criticizing a Stratfordian view, often states that the Stratfordian view is possible, but \\"there is no evidence\\" to support such view. The author, however, feels free to make various anti-Strat statements which he fails to back-up with any credible evidence. In other words, he goes out of his way to state that viewpoints contrary to his are not supported by evidence, and then proceeds to make his points without citing to any specific evidence.If your are truly interested in this subject, and want to read a book that is actually well researched (and actually contains a bibliography), read \\"Who Wrote Shakespeare\\" by John F. Mitchell. Don't waste your time with this book."},{"Title":"Players: The Mysterious Identity of William Shakespeare","review":"This is not the right book for someone new to the Authorship debate to pick up. It isn't really an Authorship book at all, but a meta-Authorship book. Fields has evidently read many of the available books on the subject and seems to have written this book in order to present his own, detailed collaboration theory. But first, fancying himself an impartial judge, he reviews and weighs the basic evidence he has read about for the major candidates: the Stratford actor, Oxford, Marlowe, Derby, Rutland, even Queen Elizabeth(!). The problem with this, the bulk of the book, is that he isn't really setting forth the evidence in enough detail for the reader to judge, but just mentioning enough so that he can give his own verdict on it, and his verdict on almost any given piece of evidence is \\"well, that doesn't really prove anything one way or the other\\". This routine gets old fast; and for newcomers there isn't enough meat to start forming their own conclusions. There are other, better books to start with. (Michell's \\"Who Wrote Shakespeare?\\" and Williams' \\"Sweet Swan of Avon\\" are fun and you really ought to start with anti-Stratfordians; then you'll be ready to get the Stratfordian's answer to Michell's question from a book like \\"Shakespeare, In Fact\\" by Matus.)However, Field's book has one redeeming feature, for people who have already immersed themselves in the debate. In the last 15 pages or so, he presents his own detailed story of how the plays and sonnets got written. It's just a theory, but it's plausible at face value (assuming you're not a Stratford absolutist!), and if true, would provide answers for some of the questions surrounding Shakespeare that have bothered the anti-Stratfordians. But more important than whether it's true, it's an interesting theory, and will send you back to the plays and sonnets with something new to think about.And that's the whole point of the Authorship controversy, really - it's a invitation to read Shakespeare closely; to learn about his time period, its theatre, its writers; to discover why and how he became the revered Bard; to see how the changing world has changed his works; and to understand how our own prejudices and misconceptions confuse our little minds about the little we know about Shakespeare the author, even while we feel we understand and love Shakespeare the works."},{"Title":"Players: The Mysterious Identity of William Shakespeare","review":"Here's a warning, kids: Don't wade into scholarly debates in fields you have not mastered, regarding matters (i.e., literature) in which you have no competence.

Well, the typical anti-Stratfordian performance."},{"Title":"Players: The Mysterious Identity of William Shakespeare","review":"This is nearly a great book. For 26 chapters Mr. Fields writes well and then loses it in the last chapter.In Players, Mr. Fields investigates the identity of William Shakespeare. While doing so, Mr. Fields divides the world into Stratfordians (those who believe the man from Stratford actually wrote the plays) and \\"anti-Strats\\" (those who believe someone else actually wrote the plays). In my experience most serious scholars--and I do not consider myself anything more than an amateur Shakespearean scholar myself--don't really question that the man from Stratford wrote the plays and, despite my lowly status, I place myself firmly in the Stratford man's camp. On the other hand, many amateur Shakespeareans--Mr. Fields is, after all, a novelist and entertainment lawyer--love the conspiracy theory and the search for an alternate identity for Shakespeare.All that being said, Mr. Fields has written a wonderfully fascinating and readable account. His experience in the law serves him well as he sifts through the available evidence and fairly tries to give points where points are due to both the strats and anti-strats. There are some inaccuracies but he does a reasonable job. In the last part of the book he weighs the evidence for some of the most popular \\"real Shakespeares\\" from the obvious (Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford) to the ridiculous (Queen Elizabeth). For the most part, I felt he presented the evidence reasonably well; mainly because he stood back and let the evidence speak for itself without making too many judgements.In the last chapter, however, he makes a case for the plays being written cooperatively between Oxford and Shakespeare with Oxford supplying the bulk and the rustic Shakespeare providing those parts that would please the groundlings. When Oxford dies in 1603, he has left behind a number of mostly finished plays that his son-in-law, Stanley, reworks with Shakespeare and gradually releases. Along the way, help and advice is gotten from people ranging from Marloe & Jonson to Francis Bacon. Whew! At one point, Fields asks how Shakespeare can be the author of these plays since so little written evidence points to him. I would ask Fields how such a magnificent conspiracy between so many important people could be perpetrated without a single piece of written evidence (a letter, someone's journal) pointing to it.I have to admit, this last chapter threw me for a loop and colored my enjoyment of the rest of the book. Like most \\"unmasked conspiracies\\" it is fun to read and exciting in its intrigue but the fact is (and at least Fields admits this) it is likely we will never know for sure. However, I am of the type that believes the burden of proof lies on the anti-strats (to borrow another phrase from Mr. Fields). Works of genius are, by definition, created by a genius. A genius is someone who reaches far beyond what is expected or typical of the time. Say whatever you want about how Shakespeare's upbringing and experience could never have prepared him to write these wonderful plays. Barring incontrovertible evidence, I find it easier to believe that the Stratford man somehow had the ability to rise above his experience and create these works than that a conspiratorial group effort managed the same.But read the book and decide for yourself. It's worth it."},{"Title":"Players: The Mysterious Identity of William Shakespeare","review":"To get at the heart of the Shakespeare controversy one needs a first class intellect for a guide and alas Mr. Fields does not possess one. Thus he seems to miss a thorough knowledge of the era and often interprets things without the appropriate context. He also clearly lacks a working knowledge of the theatre. He is a lawyer and here constructs a rather sloppy brief. For me the largest flaw is the simple one of not acknowledging until the end of the book that the burden of proof is clearly on the anti-Strats to prove their case (something he mentions but promptly ignores). After all if I say Mr. Fields book wasn't written by him but by a shadowy conspiracy of forces (Mark Fuhrman perhaps?) I dare say that any rational person would say the onus would be on me to prove my case not the other way round - that Mr. Fields must prove he is in fact Mr. Fields.The romantic in me would enjoy some grand conspiracy behind Shakespeare however a bit of diligent research shows how ludicrous the notion of anyone but the \\"Stratford\\" man as their author truly is. The idea that the notoriously nasty pens of people like Greene or Ben Jonson wouldn't have made snarky remarks about such a subterfuge is plain silly. As is the idea that this conspiracy would have gone on long after the death of whatever claimant has passed away.Genius comes in odd packages (and not apparently in ReganBooks) and people should just deal with it and not waste their time in such addled fantasy.

It only fuels an \\"us vs them\\" mentality that seems more political than intellectual. Despite its flaws, particularly lacking a bibliography and notes on primary sources, \\"Players\\" at least attempts to be fair to both sides of the question without being zealous. Other writers have tried to cement their positions in historical concrete where there is only plaster paris later to be undone by other writers. The real point that Fields is trying to make is that each side of the Shakespeare authorship question has their strengths and weaknesses, and the jury still has yet to see enough evidence. Other books have assumed their position correct and have painstakingly made their argument with a kind of biased analysis. This book at least comes from the perspective of looking at known facts of the period relating to Shakespeare (assuming that Fields' scholarship is legitimate and thorough) and analyzing them in terms of several possibilities. For example, Fields shows much of the documentary evidence indicating that the man from Stratford was heavily involved in investing in the theatre companies that performed much of the Shakespeare canon, as well as his involvement as a performer, facts often minimized by anti-Stratfordians and Oxfordians. However, sometimes the author does draw a conclusion or two without explaining his reasoning. For example, Oxfordians have often pointed to the statement \\"...the first heir of my invention...\\" used in the dedication of \\"Venus and Adonis\\" to mean the first use of the name \\"Shakespeare\\" as a pseudonym. Since many of the plays had already been performed at the time of this publication, Oxfordians have discredited the notion that the word \\"invention\\" meant Shakespeare's first written or published work as assumed by Stratfordians. Fields asserts that \\"invention\\" probably doesn't mean the first use of the pseudonym but fails to state his reasoning and what the meaning of the word might be. He simply goes on to another subject. Nevertheless, I think the work overall brings a new angle onto the Shakespeare mystery that has been lacking. With the exception of the book \\"Who Wrote Shakespeare?\\" most books are ardently written from one side or the other with much ferocious zeal and portray the other side as either being dogmatic or snobbish. This book at least attempts to do neither. But there is a third issue. Fields is an entertainment lawyer in Hollywood, not a literary scholar or historian by trade, which shows in his lack of citing source material adequately. I will also say that his writing is at least above average for one working in Hollywood. The other question remains: when will a professional historian of academic stature successfully tackle this problem?? So far, in the last few years, it has been mainly those outside of academia who have written books on the subject. Academicians have steared wide of the authorship question asserting that there is no question that the man from Stratford is Shakespeare. They still write large 700-page tomes that continually use phrases such as \\"he must have been a law clark\\" or \\"his heretofore undocumented trip to Italy\\" and so forth.

Since the 18th century, the skeptics have kept close pace with the believers, and for understandable reason. There is a paucity of known facts on the man from Stratford's CV. Surely if he was the greatest English playwright we'd have more knowledge about his life and death. And what about those signatures? He can't even spell his name the same way twice, how did that country bumpkin write HAMLET or THE WINTER'S TALE? No way! What would that hillbilly have possibly known about courtship politics in Italy and Bohemia, he never left England, and there were no books that could have filled him in. Could he have learned the Latin and Greek he needed at Stratford Junior High, I don't think so, but thousands of allusions of classical literature pepper his corpus.Besides, there were literally dozens of brilliant, upper class and good looking men all over Elizabethan England who might have written those works with more probability than the Stratford schlub. These include Francis Bacon, the eccentric philosopher; the Earl of Oxford, Edward de Vere; the playwright Christopher Marlowe, who was known to have written for the theater and whose murder might have been faked to allow him the psychic space to go on and improve his craft as \\"Shakespeare.\\" Even Elizabeth herself might, everything else being equal have been the playwright, for she was well known as a stylist and could wield a pen with the best of them; perhaps only sexism has kept her towards the bottom of the bookies' chart of suspects.Fields picks up each piece of evidence and examines it, both pro and con. The First Folio gets most of his respect, and he comes down hard on the point that, if someone else was Shakespeare, why did the First Folio, published shortly after the death of the man from Stratford, credit him with having written all the plays and poems? Were its editors in on some hoax? Wouldn't that be a little weird, indeed Masonically extravagant? If they were just patsies, innocent dupes, why prolong the charade past the point of the death of the real author? (Oxford, for example, died in 1604 for sure.)

It is a must read."},{"Title":"Financial Warnings: Detecting Earning Surprises, Avoiding Business Troubles, Implementing Corrective Strategies","review":"I have read many books dealing with forecasting financial problems. This rates with the best. I found it especially useful to incorporate the authors'suggestions into a financial spreadsheet which highlights with color to indicate when the stated numerical criteria has been reached. The only shortcoming may be that there is no comment on Z-Scores or similar indicators."},{"Title":"Financial Warnings: Detecting Earning Surprises, Avoiding Business Troubles, Implementing Corrective Strategies","review":"As a Georgia Tech Finance MBA, I have taken 3 courses from Dr. Mulford and 2 from Dr. Comiskey. Why so many? They are both outstanding teachers and dedicated professionals who infect their students with a passion for the critical and skeptical study of financial reports. The book Financial Warnings forms the backbone of a course in which we learn to produce a firm's Sustainable Earnings Base (SEB). From there it is easier to value the firm and to predict future earnings surprises. The book takes a very practical, methodical approach, and is based upon real-world financial research and surveys of lenders. Earnings management, fraud, undervalued liabilities and overstated assets are some of the interesting topics covered. Complex issues are explained thoroughly, in a very smooth writing style. Well Done!"},{"Title":"Financial Warnings: Detecting Earning Surprises, Avoiding Business Troubles, Implementing Corrective Strategies","review":"i think this is an excellent book which explains well how a person can dissect financial statements and attempt to uncover misreporting. i would like to know if there are other books such as this. i've also read Quality of Earnings, written over 10 years ago... if you have any suggestions please write (thanks)."},{"Title":"Financial Warnings: Detecting Earning Surprises, Avoiding Business Troubles, Implementing Corrective Strategies","review":"The book is an excellent treatise which provides the readers a systematic framework for figuring out whether the books have been manipulated or if the accounting has been aggressive, through finding out non-recurring items in the income statement and balance sheet. I have tried other books but, they just do not compare with this treatise. The book uses a systematic step-by-step approach which introduces the reader to how to read the fine print. This book should be invaluable to finance and accounting professionals, and also to amateur investors, who would be willing to do a little research into the company books.For those who not lucky enough to attend Dr. Mulford's class, this book should do a great job."},{"Title":"Financial Warnings: Detecting Earning Surprises, Avoiding Business Troubles, Implementing Corrective Strategies","review":"This book provides a detailed description of what to look for when analyzing the financial earnings of a firm. I found it extremely informative and easy to read, especially since I am not a guru in accounting. The sequence of chapters provides a step-by-step method to determining if a firm will issue a negative earnings surprise prior to it actually occurring. The logic behind this is based on surveys with banks as well as personal insights from both authors. Ultimately, a sustainable earnings calculation is performed which allows you to evaluate a firm on a level playing field."},{"Title":"Financial Warnings: Detecting Earning Surprises, Avoiding Business Troubles, Implementing Corrective Strategies","review":"Although this book looks outdated but I am sure it sounds loud and clear especially when we are so hot-headed about the Internet Age and Knowledge Management and in most cases have forgotten about what are the Warning Signs we have to watch for particularly when we are opting to invest in a new stock of the new age.The Author is a respected scholar in the field of Finance and I admire every book of his and has spent the money to have every book he has written but most of all, I feel this book is the best.

Contains synopses of disease process, typical tests for diagnosis, and basic nursing assessments and interventions. I am doing a clinical nursing internship this summer and needed something compact for my briefcase, yet containing good info to refresh me on the diseases and illnesses I was encountering in my patients. This book fills the bill. My prof loved it too. The spiral binding is nice rather than a glued binding, but needs a bit of redesign as the back cover falls off. I just sewed up the openings with some fishing line to solve that problem. Highly recommended addition to your working library."},{"Title":"Become a Personal Chef: An Introduction to the Industry","review":"Being the only book I could find on the Personal Chef industry, I purchased this book with high hopes of learning more about being a PC. I was disappointed to find this book lacked substance, was poorly edited, and left out important information.While this book gives an adequate overview on several different aspects of the business, it doesn't go much into detail. For instance, the author gives a short summary of the 3 major PC associations but provides nothing that I couldn't get for free by going to each of the association's websites. And while one of the chapters claims that \\"Marketing is Key\\", he doesn't give specific tips how to market this particular type of business - what is the primary demographic and where is a newbie most likely to find business? This is very basic information that would be invaluable to someone looking to start a PC business.Another problem I had with this book was the editing. There were some comments that just didn't make sense. For instance, the author explains that a bi-weekly service means you cook once every 2 weeks and a monthly service is when you cook once a month, but goes on to say, \\"Some clients will select a bi-weekly service but only have you cook once every four weeks.\\" Huh?The author encourages membership with one of the PC association and wisely takes a neutral position on which has more to offer. However, he does not give the reader any advice as to what to look for and what questions to ask. The biggest ommission is information on creating a website for the business. Is it necessary? If so, what type of information should you provide and how much information given up front is too much?This book would be good for someone with little or no business experience and just wants some general information. But keep researching the internet and interviewing established PCs if you are seriously looking into building a PC business."},{"Title":"Boudoir: Creating the Bedroom of Your Dreams","review":"For anyone who feels the need to create a space that is just for them to restore the soul, heart and mind, this is the book for you. It is filled with not only wonderful pictures showing examples of lots and lots of different Boudoir styles, but also instructions on &quot;How to Achieve the Look&quot;. It has detailed instructions on both the fabrics, colors, textures and feel to what is needed to achieve each look. There are more styles of Boudoir than I ever imagined! So many ideas! The book is written in a beautiful poetic style and is so inspiring."},{"Title":"Boudoir: Creating the Bedroom of Your Dreams","review":"THis book basically covers a variety of styles with which a young woman might want to decorate her bedroom. For example, &quot;Eco Chic&quot;, French 17th Century, Modern, Retro etc. Some of the pictures here are really nice, particularly the Dangerous Liaisons and the Boho look, but unfortunately they felt it necessary to include photographs of models lounging in the rooms, something I found a little bit twi and annoying. The other problem is that this book seems targeted at young women, however the decoration suggestions of some of the rooms are quite high budget, for example Louis 15th style chairs, and so might not be appropriate for the average 20year olds income. Otherwise the book is quite good fun and I'm sure fulfils its main purpose...to inspire."},{"Title":"Boudoir: Creating the Bedroom of Your Dreams","review":"This book is so pretty to look at!

It covers all the products,trends, uses of products and solutions and even describes where the influences of each period come from. It does not have a 'how-to recreate...' section or photographs, but this is not what u want anyway. It helped me in every way when I had to research a period for a job or my assessments. I think it is a must have for every person involved with make-up, beauty etc."},{"Title":"Fashions in makeup: From ancient to modern times","review":"I've checked out the 1972 version of this book so things may have changed between volumes--my only complaint would be that there are no color photographs, and make-up is all about color!After reading many books on the topic of historical make-up, costume and hair styles, this is the most comprehensive coverage of the topic. It covers every culture of the world for the past 5000 years, everything from the materials cosmetics jars and makeup were made of in ancient Egypt to today's trends. What you may find yourself marveling about is how little things have really changed!Despite its incredible detail, Corson's writing style is vivid but scholarly--it's such a relief to have a fun topic so thoroughly covered in an engaging way.

Could it be a Kindle issue?"},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"I do not intend to review content here. This new edition is so full of typographical errors that sometimes the reader will have to intuit what the author really wrote. It is clear that the proofreaders of this edition were not actually reading; they were simply following the little red lines under the \\"misspelled\\" words. This has resulted in some truly bizarre apparent statements by the author, unreproducible here due to copyright laws. Disclaimer-- I have not purchased this book, merely checked it out of the library."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"The author's preface is dated 1886. Biblical scholarship has changed a lot since then, most notably with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Nag Hammadi library. Many of Rev. Edersheim's conclusions will have been refuted in the 130+ years since this book's original publication.For me, the author was at his best when he was dealing with _facts_, such as the details of Jewish life and society in Palestine during the time of Jesus. Unfortunately, being an Anglican priest, he cannot resist the temptation to preach - so he spends pages upon pages telling us what the story MEANS instead of just telling the story. I enjoyed his exposition on the parables in Book V, but most of his preaching was tedious and overburdened with Victorian-era sentiment.Edersheim also argues incessantly (with other Bible scholars whom he often names in the text or the footnotes) in favor of the authenticity, earliness, and \\"Jewish origin\\" of the gospel of John - a position which to me seems indefensible. He also insists on \\"harmonizing\\" the gospels into a single continuous narrative while also insisting that all four are literally, factually, and unerringly TRUE. This approach does not hold water, and watching this otherwise talented scholar & historian flounder through a mire of faulty logic and circular reasoning has only strengthened my conviction that the Victorian dream of a \\"Gospel Harmony\\" is an unreachable goal. Edersheim must undergo strange intellectual contortions to hold to his belief that the gospel writers 1) never made mistakes, and 2) never made stuff up. In one passage he points out Luke's specificity of historic detail as \\"evidence\\" of the truthfulness of his tale, and a few pages later points out Matthew's vagueness & lack of detail as proof of his veracity. You can't have it both ways!! Edersheim never gives the Classical/Antique era's writers any credit for imagination & inventiveness. Furthermore, he seems to have no understanding of Non-Christian myth nor how good stories are told.The book is huge: 1,491 pages, not counting the index and the Roman-numbered pages in the introduction to both volumes (bound together in this one enormous edition but retaining their two separate paginations). As other reviewers mentioned, there are lots of typos, and the old-fashioned prose often bogs down. I felt every one of those 1,491 pages. This book took way too long to read ... but ultimately I'm glad I read it. It's a treasure-trove of information as well as misbegotten opinions. It is probably something that should be experienced by anyone who's got the interest in the subject matter, and the patience to turn that many pages - but its flaws are too numerous for me to award it more than 3."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This book was recommended by my pastor and because I wanted to know more about Jesus I ordered it and will order another to give as a gift.

I haven't had the time to read this book as of yet, but will be doing so in the near future.

I encourage anyone who wishes to purchase books or other items to go to Amazon first. Their prices are always surprisingly affordable with the economy as it is and we have yet to have any complaints as to the excellent condition everything we have ordered through them has come. Amazon is our first place to shop for top quality and price. Thank you Amazon. Keep up the good work."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"When you are tired of the endless controversies in current Biblical scholarship, when you're worn down from the specialist studies of language in this or that gospel, or the cynical books that claim to expose this and that redaction, when you want merely to exist in a rich, vital, eloquent literary world, securely based in scholarship itself, in which Second Temple Jerusalem comes to life, in which you can see Nazareth as if you were there, in which you can feel the pulse of the commerce and communications, and pilgrim crowds of the time of Christ -- then pick up this book. Dip into it by subject or time period. And you'll love it. Of course it was written by a believing man with a great generous soul. But it's thoroughly documented, and has immense and timeless insight to offer on many subjects. For some, it might be a rich corrective to the mini-series, and movies about Jesus which portray his surroundings as so meager and primitive, with no sense of the grandeur of the Holy City, and the complexity and variety of the village life that Jesus might have known. Jesus didn't live in the Stone Age as motion pictures and documentaries would have one believe. He lived in the busy world of Augustus and Tiberius Caesar. And this book embraces that period with vast wisdom and knowledge. It is outdated, yes. But the period in which it was written (late 1800's) is no doubt partly responsible for it's profound simplicty and overwhelming charm. Happy reading."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This classic work is a goldmine of information about the context of the Gospels. Many of the events and sayings in Jesus's become even clearer when we understand the widespread Rabbinic teachings of His day. Edersheim's insight into the famous \\"Thou art Peter\\" is most interesting -- yes, Jesus was speaking Hebrew but he DID mean to distinguish petros and petra, because these names had also been incorporated into Hebrew and Aramaic. It's also very important to see how Jewish writers interpreted Messianic prophecies to see that the NT writers were following accepted procedure.For something more modern, I recommend Dr Arnold Fruchtenbaum's books, especially Messianic Christology."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"While somewhat outdated, The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah remains a magnificent reference to the historical and cultural setting to the days of Jesus of Nazareth. Although written some 70 years prior to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Edersheim's great work still offers highly valuable information and insight on the Gospels and related events. One of the more striking features of the book is the appendix list of 400+ Old Testament passages which were tagged by the ancient rabbis as being messianically applied. An absolute must for anyone who wish to study the Jewish expectations of the Messiah surrounding the days when the Nazarene Carpentar walked the Earth. Place this vintage masterpiece in your library, and you will find yourself going back to it time and time again."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"I was given a copy of the above referenced book as a birthday gift in 1990. I began reading it in 1992 and completed it within 3 months. I picked up the book again in 1998 and have read it, in its entirety, at least once a year since then. I truly consider myself more then a casual reader of this magnificent work! That being said, my review...For the believing Christian, this is a must read. For the skeptic, consider yourself remiss to overlook this book and for the Non-believer, this work will renovate your thinking. Edersheim has put together a true masterpiece herein. His depth of research on the subject matter is totally comprehensive. A commitment of 7 years, in almost complete solitude, was made to the writing of this book by he and his daughter.Literally thousands of footnotes, drawn from nearly every major Jewish writing of the time, are listed on the pages of this book indicating the intense discipline and scholarly effort enforced by the writer. An impression of truth and trustworthiness almost overwhelms readers as they have literally noted in conversation with me as I have passed this book along to many friends and acquaintances.This book is a bon-a-fide \\"best effort\\" to set before it's readers the daily foot steps of Jesus of Nazareth so that His words and works may bring us to an understanding of Jesus The Messiah that will blaze with a brightness that will light every other understanding.Finally, to put oneself to the task of completing this book is an undertaking. However, as noted by Edersheim himself, we are called to look upon Jesus with intent and resolve before we will see him as the \\"God-Man\\". ( St. John 6:40)"},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"Alfred Edersheim's heritage as a Messianic Jew gives the description of Jewish culture in &quot;The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah&quot; an authenticity that a non-Jew would be hard-pressed to duplicate. The culture of Israel during the Roman occupation comes alive in Edersheim's writing in a way that goes beyond scholastic study by blending his own Jewish heritage, archeological fact, and keen spiritual insight. Any serious student of the Gospels or the Epistles would benefit from the insight of Mr. Edersheim because so much of the imagery in the account of Jesus is steeped in the culture of Israel as it progressed from Abraham to Herod. Used as a reference, &quot;The Life and Times&quot; is indexed according to verses and events and gives Bible studies the context for the illustrations of Jesus. Read as a book, Edersheim is ponderous, however, a contiguous reading would give a person a consistent Hebrew framework which the New Testament fit into 2000 years ago. &quot;The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah&quot; has become a fixture in my library which, second to the Bible, is now a standard starting point in my study of Jesus, the Messiah."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"In Bible school I had to use this book as a resource in writing several papers.

Lots of information on early Judaism, carefully footnoted from primary sources. In the footnotes, lots of arguments with other scholars, chiefly German (as was typical in the late nineteenth century). Some of author's weighing of evidence will have been challenged in the 100+ years since this book was first published, and new sources will have been discovered; new archaeological sites too. But this is still a good starting-point, if only for the quantity of early sources that are collected in one place.2. Florid prose.3. This reprint edition has more than the usual number of typographical errors. Most of these are harmless, but sometimes they change the sense. E.g., on p. 304: \\"We are _not_ in some measure prepared to follow the worship on that Sabbath in Nazareth\\" should read \\"We are _now_ in some measure prepared...\\""},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"While I have only started the book, I have read Edersheim's other works and found them to be of great benefit for Bibical insight.

It includes submission to Emperer Tiberius Augustus in Rome as well as the cruelty of Pontius Pilot. If interested in biblical history it is a book at I would recommend.

He lived from 1825 to 1889.His best known work is The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah. As he said, he took seven years to complete this project. He isolated himself and devoted full time to his writing with only his daughter Ella as his researcher, proofreader and inspiration. This is indeed a tribute to a devoted daughter and skilled researcher in her own right.The volume of 1100 pages is not a devotional book. It has many devotional thoughts, but this is a scholarly work with historical details filling every chapter. You can tell by reading the extensive research and writing ability which into this tome.If you want to know about the times in which Jesus lived and glimpses into His life, then this book will be a good one for you. For example:The Gospels present a great deal of tension between Jesus and the religious leaders over rituals and the Sabbath. Edersheim explains this controversy where Jesus rejected the numerous ritual rules for everyday life and especially for the proper observation of the Sabbath. By the time of Jesus the religious authorities had created a burdensome system of do's and don'ts that even the devout hard a difficult time following. The Jerusalem priesthood was corrupt and the cleansing of the temple by Jesus was more than just a simple act.In addition, you are presented with graphic descriptions of the Herod Dynasty. King Herod and family left a bloody mark on Judaea before and after Jesus. It was a bloodline conceived in the worst possible elements of human nature. The Herods sought to build a second Rome in Judaea.If you have a serious interest in this subject, then I recommend this book to you.

I find it exciting to sense Jesus being brought to life in beautiful English. It is a little daunting to bounce back and forth between the author's references and the text but it is well worth it.

It has some good insights into the life of Jesus, and it will help pastors and teachers of the Word in their search for information that will preach.The book has some weaknesses that keeps it from being the top contemporary resource on the life of Jesus. Number one: The book is not easy to read. It is technical and tedious, and demands alot from the reader.Number two: Edersheim operates under the assumption that everything he knows about Talmudic tradition was also true in the first century, and we simply do not know if this was the case.Number three: The scholarship in this book is more than a hundred years old. I think the best features of the book are the preaching tidbits sprinkled throughout the volume.Having said all that,I think that if you are looking for the best Jesus biography, you'd be better served with Jesus and the Gospels by Craig Blomberg. The scholarship is recent, the prose is engaging, and the volume compresses an amazing amount of information in its 450 pages. Buy that book, along with Darrell Bock's Jesus According to Scripture and Ben Witherington's The Christology of Jesus, and you should have everything you need."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"Alfred Edersheim is a scholar of unique perspective. He was born and raised a Jew but converted to Christianity as a young man. He provides insight into Jewish history and background to the gospel narratives like no one else I've read. A couple of problems with this work though, it can be very hard to reference. When searching for a particular parable or passage you have to search through the chapter headings one by one to see if you recognize the content. Furthermore, Mr. Edersheim is so unbelievably wordy it can be frustrating waiting for him to get to the point, but this is typical of late 19th and early 20th century biblical expositors. Overall this is a must in any self-respecting theologian's library."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This edition is not the complete text.

One cannot fully grasp the message of the New Testament without the type of knowledge that comes from Edersheim."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This book is so much more than I expected!

Well he was certainly correct.Alfred Edersheim has an eloquent way with words in his explanation of the Gospels.

I couldn't stomach Harris' overt sexism, and annoying attempts at humor at the beginning of each paragraph in the AIO. The ISC2 Official guide simply made me want to stab myself in the eye with a fork - too dry. I couldn't read that book for 10 minutes before falling asleep. Now regarding this book: It had the correct amount of information and level of detail. It's moderately dry also, but come on, this is IT Security, not your favorite murder mystery novel. It came with a very decent CD that was well-worth the price alone. Now here's the disclaimer: Not one of these books is going to give you all you need to pass the exam, so pick at least two, so you get plenty of coverage. The exam is 50 percent knowledge and 50 percent logic, so be prepared to take plenty of practice exams and read the questions slowly and carefully on the real exam. If you master this book and do that, you'll be a CISSP. Good luck!"},{"Title":"CISSP : Certified Information Systems Security Professional Study Guide, Third Edition","review":"I took this book out from the Air Force Technical Library and found it to be extremely well-written, concise, and an excellent introduction to the field of computer security. When reading this book I felt that the author had an excellent understanding of the material presented and focused on the most important aspects of the subject matter. I have not taken the CISSP yet so I can not comment on how relevant the material is to the exam (as most people know the CISSP is mostly about work experience anyways - not something you learn from a book).After reading this book I then read the Shon Harris CISSP book I can tell firsthand that this book (Stewart's) is of much better quality. The Shon Harris book shocked me at its lack of structure (many topics are covered multiple times and simple security/network fundamentals are repeated so much that I wanted to scream - literally), extremely simplistic and foolish examples, and very poor quality of writing. After reading both books I have much respect (professionally) for Stewart and very little for Harris.As for the comments about typos - I did not notice any major typo in the book that took away from the presentation of the material. (So ICMP was misspelled once - who cares?) Overall I thought the quality was much better than the Harris CISSP book (which, itself, has loads of typos and incorrect quiz questions - don't get me started). Overall I would highly recommend this book to others looking to gain a firm understanding and grasp of computer security while preparing for the CISSP exam."},{"Title":"CISSP : Certified Information Systems Security Professional Study Guide, Third Edition","review":"I think \\"Dogger is very unfair on his review\\".

It does not even make sense for a block cipher to be derived from a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA.

Unfortunately, no such errata exists and I highly doubt it will ever exist. I also noticed some errors, not enough to worry me though.The book is a reasonable early read to familiarize yourself with the CISSP exam content. The questions are not up to typical Sybex Certification Book standards - just not well written. Sybex Certification books are normally fantastic and very well edited.I also read the Shon Harris All-in-One book. The Shon Harris book is extremely well written and has an unbelievable number of really well thought out CISSP questions to practice on. The text in her book is superb - well worth reading the whole book.

At the same time, I noticed a few typos and inaccuracies, which was very unfortunate. That was why I gave it 2 stars instead of 4 that it deserves. At the end, it did the job, and I passed the exam, although, after reading this book, I reviwed a few CBK domains I was less familiar with in the Official (ISC)2 Guide. Unfortunately, none of the books I checked, including a more expensive Harris book and moreover, none of the cheap overviews like the Passport book, provides a 100% coverage of the material that is tested. Therefore, unless you have a real IT-related experience, you may be caught by surprise at the exam, no matter which book(s) you used.

I'd buy from this seller again."},{"Title":"CISSP : Certified Information Systems Security Professional Study Guide, Third Edition","review":"I must admit a soft spot for Sybex (and Ed Tittel) study guides, having used them extensively for Microsoft exams. This book follows in that tradition, providing a good balance between detailed explanation and comprehensive coverage of the exam topics.The bundled CD is useful. I raced through the 250 flash cards in an hour, which is good for jogging the memory. The four bonus exams, of 75 questions each, are good, but are not as difficult as the real thing. These exams provide grades broken down by each CISSP exam domain, which is excellent for identifying topics for revision.One book can not guarantee coverage of all CISSP exam topics, particularly given the long list of references on the CISSP suggested reading list. I also skimmed through a friend's copy of Shon Harris's &quot;All-in-One&quot; exam guide. I would still rate this book higher, but Harris's book covers some topics in more detail then the Sybex book. The \\"All-in-One\\" practice exams are more difficult, though some of the questions are not clearly worded.The biggest disappoint I have with the exam preparation experience is with the CISSP's ten domains. The examination questions are based on 'good exam fodder' from topics in the ten domains. The topics lean towards an academic approach to security, rather then knowledge needed by a working security professional.The other references I would strongly suggest to help to gain a security brain, as well as a high exam score include: Stephen Northcutt's \`Inside Network Perimeter Security', Ross Anderson's \`Security Engineering', and Syngress's \`Special Ops'. Maybe I should take one of the SANS security exams, which are much more practical in nature.And best of luck with the exam!"},{"Title":"CISSP : Certified Information Systems Security Professional Study Guide, Third Edition","review":"As I took the CISSP exam, I kept thinking, &quot;he really knew what he was talking about.&quot; If you were to know this book backwards and forwards, you would do well on the CISSP exam. However, this text suffers from a problem common among learning manuals -- if you didn't get a good sleep the night before you will be nodding off after only a few pages. It reads like a dictionary. Also, the summaries and tables were lacking in both quality and quantity.After having said that, I have to admit that this book probably helped me the most out of the four I used to prepare for the exam. While Shon Harris' second edition of the All-In-One guide was much more readable and memorable, the content probably wasn't quite as good. Therefore, these two books probably tied as the ones on the top of my list were I to go through this process again."},{"Title":"CISSP : Certified Information Systems Security Professional Study Guide, Third Edition","review":"I purchased and used both this text and the Shon Harris book. The text here is dry reading but very informative. As I got closer to taking the exam, I used it primarily for the practice exams and then used those to identify my weak areas. The practice exams give a very good breakdown by domain area of your strengths and weaknesses. I agree with another reviewer that the Shon Harris book is easier reading. If you are relatively new to the material and teaching yourself, you may want to go with that book as your primary text. However, if you are already pretty familiar with the material and knowledgeable about the technical aspect of networking, then this book would probably provide you more useful material. Both are outstanding texts but one is more useful than the other based upon where you are starting from."},{"Title":"CISSP : Certified Information Systems Security Professional Study Guide, Third Edition","review":"Ignore \\"Dogger\\" review.

Stewart, et alCISSP Study Guide - Eric Conrad, et alThis book is full of contents and is written in a way that you can read it and not get bored or feel overwhelmed by the amount of information, it covers all aspects of the exam but is not divided in ten chapters (one per domain) as most CISSP preparation books, instead, is divided by topics that can cover more than one domain at the same time and in this way you can grab more concepts and correlate them in a different manner.The book also comes with a CD that has the pdf version of the book for those that like me prefer to read on a laptop/tablet/kindle instead of carrying a 900+ monster, two mock exams (not quite close to the real thing) and some flashcards to help you review the basic concepts of every chapter"},{"Title":"CISSP : Certified Information Systems Security Professional Study Guide, Third Edition","review":"This resource alone will not deliver someone, especially one without rich networking experience, into a mastery of CISSP knowledge. However, it, in conjunction with the experience required to sit for the exam in the first place, should suffice to pass. (It did for me, a 4-year.) It is crisp, sets the right tone for the actual exam, and does not lie. You do not waste time with unnecessary verbiage--I appreciated this.The exam engine questions are very good, though before I sat for the exam I was annoyed at some ambiguity, and verbal \\"gaminess\\" (e.g., \\"Select the most false answer to the following non-question: what is not a secure protocol meant to possibly secure...\\"--you get the idea. One wonders whether they are being tested on how well they find their way through a maze of multiple negatives.). This apparent fault was redeemed by the much larger degree of ambiguity and gaminess found in the actual CISSP exam questions; so these practice exams turned out to be nice prep for that very reason."},{"Title":"CISSP : Certified Information Systems Security Professional Study Guide, Third Edition","review":"I have read through the Shon Harris book (4th ed), the Official book, and this Sybex book (4th ed.). This book is definitely the best of the three. The AIO book gets too cute, too verbose, and too irrelevant in some parts. Shon Harris likes to expound upon subjects that have no relevance to the exam. A CISSP book should focus on what matters to pass the exam and that's it. More in depth information should be gleamed from other places. Extraneous information only serves to obfuscate the information that really matters. Then there is the official CBK book from ISC2. That book should be promptly burned in a bonfire. It's too difficult and dry to read to be of any use.The writers of this book seem to be very knowledgeable of the information at hand. They are able to elaborate and connect the concepts together. For example, Shon Harris throws multiple definitions out there without explaining the relations among them. Some times it felt more like a definition book than anything. Compare the cryptography chapters between the AIO and this book. Harris' book is by far the more in depth with definitions after definitions thrown in there. However, this book's chapter actually helps in the understanding of the concept, building on the knowledge. More words doesn't necessarily convey more information. This book also comes with flash cards and two 250 question practice exams. I recommend reading both the AIO book and this one. But if you have to pick just one, I recommend this one over the AIO."},{"Title":"CISSP : Certified Information Systems Security Professional Study Guide, Third Edition","review":"I picked up this book and the Shon Harris book as primary study resources for the CISSP exam. I thought this book was far superior to the Harris book for a number of reasons including readability and usefulness of the subject matter coverage beyond the exam. The Harris book had all of these little 'cute' italicized sayings when introducing many topics and they were either confusing, not cute or distracting. Example - \\"Trust and Assurance: I trust that you will act properly, thus I have a high level of assurance in you. Response: You are such a fool.\\" What the heck? As I read each book my initial take was that the authors for this book were more experienced than the Harris book, and I quickly put the Harris book down. I do a lot of consulting and I thought this book had some chapters that would be good reference for higher level managers that aren't strong technically. Bottom line - I passed."},{"Title":"CISSP : Certified Information Systems Security Professional Study Guide, Third Edition","review":"I purchased both this text and the Shon Harris text to prepare for the CISSP. If choosing between the two, I would recommend Shon Harris. Her book is longer and often wordier, but her examples are better, the topics are organized by domain, and there are few errors.First the Pros:1. The material is solid and mostly accurate (one of the other reviews pointed out some glaring errors)2. This text includes some material not in Shon Harris (Son Harris includes material not in this text as well)3. Provides a different perspective to the CISSP exam materialNow the cons:1. My biggest complaint was that the chapters are not organized by domain. I found this to be very annoying, especially when trying to focus on domains I am weak in.2. The fifth edition's index often does not match the actual location of topics within the text. I suspect the page numbers were not all updated with the new edition. This makes it difficult to look up specific items in the text. The index is also not very comprehensive. Some topics in the book are not listed in the index."},{"Title":"CISSP : Certified Information Systems Security Professional Study Guide, Third Edition","review":"I just received word two weeks ago that I passed the CISSP exam and I give credit to this book for helping me out. I read the book once, I reviewed my hi-lites once, and I took a couple practice questions. The book covered roughly 99% of the questions asked in the exam; there were about 3 questions relating to what a newly hired security manager would do that I don't believe was addressed in the book.Another thing to note is that the book is only 724 pages long compared to 1108 pages for the Shon Harris book. It's more concise. I bought the Shon Harris book because everyone swore by it, but I found it long and verbose. I also didn't like her interpretation of drp and bcp as she talked about this subject from a security perspective. So after reading the 1st two chapters of the Shon Harris book, I stopped and bought the Sybex book.I don't believe one person can truly be an expert in all ten domains and be able to effectively interpret and communicate all ten domains in one book. In contrast, I love the fact that this book is a collaborative effort of three authors. I haven't had a chance to take a look at the ISC2 book, but as I am involved with ITGI and ISACA, I would believe that their book is collaborative in nature as well."},{"Title":"When Is Perfect, Perfect Enough? (Raise the Flag)","review":"This is the moving story of Shannon, one of a group of close friends who stick together through everything and love each other a lot. In the story, Shannon believes that she has to be perfect to make up for the way that her sister acts (this chick is horrible--through the beginning of the book, she is at a Christian boarding school). If that isn't enough, Shannon is also anorexic. This story, though fictional, is a great story of friendship and togetherness, one of those books you curl up with and read by the fire. Rue has woven together yet another wonderful tale!"},{"Title":"When Is Perfect, Perfect Enough? (Raise the Flag)","review":"Though I am not super religious, I have found over and over when it comes to being honest, insightful, and dead on, Christian novels do the best job.I highly related to the main character Shannon, whose life is being controlled primarily by her mother. Her father treats her like a little kid and doesn't respect her opinion. As her life spins out of control she tries to remain in control by not eating.The author does a wonderful job in making Shannon a totally believable character. I related to her thoughts of the need to be in control and the way she avoided social situations so she wouldn't have to eat.The only complaint I would have about the book is that it seems that Shannon was at a pretty low weight. I'm not sure what her height was because the author never mentions it, but it seemed that unless she was pretty short she would have been hospitalized.But it really was an awesome book.I also recommend Ashely and Jenn, if you want another very insightful story."},{"Title":"When Is Perfect, Perfect Enough? (Raise the Flag)","review":"\\"When is Perfect Perfect Enough\\" is a young adult Christian novel. This book is the sixth in a series. This story appears to have began in book five (which I haven't read), but the things that have come before this regarding Shannon's anorexia and her sister's misbehavior are summarized at the beginning of this book. Certain events from books four and five regarding Ira are mildly spoiled in this one.Of the four books in this series that I've read, the other three seemed to push events to extremes to increase the suspense. This one felt more realistic to me in terms of it being a situation the readers are more likely to encounter (in person or in a friend) and in how the characters reacted to the events. All of the characters were more rounded out and complex in how they dealt with problems, and we got to know them on a deeper basis. I liked that. I also liked how her friends were involved and how they learned how to help her.The Christian element was mainly some God-talk (\\"we'll pray\\" and \\"God loves you\\"), and God was credited for helping Shannon make progress. There was some \\"he cussed\\" style bad language. There was no sex. Overall, I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Maggie's Man (Maximillian's Children)","review":"I you want a short, sizzling and suspenseful romance, you should read &quot;Maggie's Man&quot; by Alicia Scott. It is the first in the &quot;Maximilian's Children&quot; series and a great way to start the series! Maximilian fathered three children during his life with three different women, Maggie and her brothers C.J and Brandon. Each of them gets their story. Maggie is a shy and reserved woman with a kind heart and a thirst for adventure in her life, but she did certainly not expect to be kidnapped by an escaped convict. Cain was accused of murdering his girlfriend six years ago. Now he seeks revenge and wants to bring the real murderer to justice. First frightened and then increasingly fascinated, Maggie becomes his hostage and later his accomplice. The attraction between them is palpable, and both are fully fleshed characters. Cain was a great and very sexy hero, and not in the least a cold-blooded kidnapper! Maggie is adorable in her efforts to impress him and appear seductive, you cannot help liking her. All in all, a great read!"},{"Title":"The wrong side of the sky","review":"British thriller writer Gavin Lyall has largely fallen off the map and this is a shame, because he wrote some tight, atmospheric thrillers. \\"Wrong side of the sky\\" was the first and is still a good read, despite the many years since it first appeared (1961). Lyall had served in the Royal Air Force in the Middle East in the 1950s and put a lot of knowledge into the book, which tells the tale of two down-on-their-luck pilots who -- thanks to convictions for gun-running -- have no chance of making it into the big time. The two are slumming around in the Middle East, flying beat-up planes and taking dubious jobs from dubious employers, when suddenly they learn about a chance to make a huge amount of money. To do so they need to discover a cache of jewels on board a plane that crashed many years ago. I won't give away any more, save to say that the book keeps up the suspense to the end and doesn't cut any corners. Nor does it engage in the cheap surprises and ludicrous plot twists of the kind that spoil so many thrillers these days."},{"Title":"Moving from One to Ten","review":"The text follows the pattern of number-adjective-noun.Since the subject matter deals with a family moving, it might be good feeling reflection for a child who is in a similar state."},{"Title":"Wanderers eastward, wanderers west","review":"Wow! This was such a great book. It may be hard to find, but it is definitely worth it. I bought it after reading FOREVER AMBER also by Kathleen Winsor.This book is very in depth about the human psyche. It follows the lives of several people for about 20 years. It takes place during the second half of the 19th century in Montana and New York City. I learned so much about this time period as well as what life was like \\"out west.\\" She has great historical details. It is a bit slow at times, but you still can't put it down. This is not a book that ends happily ever after, or that ties everything up in the end. It is as real as real life. The characters are multi-faceted with multitudes of various feelings. I just cannot describe how good this book is. It's been about a year since I read it and I still think about it often. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Wanderers eastward, wanderers west","review":"If you are a fan of great, imaginative and well researched writing this book is for you. The novel is set in two different locales..New York City and Montana. It cleverly recounts the events in the lives of various individuals who inhabit these two areas. Ms. Winsor gives us fully \\"fleshed out\\" characters with distinctive qualities and personal traits that intrigue us. You find yourself wanting to know more and more about what's happening to each of them. The authors way of advancing the storyline and leaving reader with little \\"cliff hangers\\" at the end of selected chapters, keeps you reading until your eyes literally burn from lack of sleep. This is a book you cannot put down.....and you don't want to."},{"Title":"Wanderers eastward, wanderers west","review":"And you're not going to know what that quote means until the very end of this door-stopper sized book! This one starts in 1861 and tells the parallel tales of Matt Devlin as he begins to carve a new life in Montana, along with that of his brother-in-law Joshua Ching in New York as he winds his way to great fortune through the manipulation and financial downfall of others. Matt, his brother Pete and their partners and eventually his sons are involved in the early days of mining the Montana Rockies, first gold then silver and finally digging to the depths of the inner mountains for the remaining treasure - copper. The early boom towns grow and die, although one town long thought dead begins to grow and change as does the landscape surrounding it - Butte.On the other side of the country, Jason's wealth grows and he becomes one of New York's elite rich and marries his daughter Susan (Suky) into one of the \\"old\\" families short of cash. The story carries them through the financial disasters and depressions of the time, as well as intertwining with Matt's children with his. That's about as far as I care to go, beyond that I'd be writing a full length book report and you know I don't do that. Suffice it to say, this book is packed with plenty of extramarital affairs (but no bodice ripping, I promise), sneaky stock dealings, railroad barons, roaring mining towns, scandalous actresses and mistresses, the cigar smoking cussing Lily in her men's clothes all intertwined with Morgan Devlin as he reaches for the huge wealth buried in the mountain he must destroy to reach the copper inside it.Although I wouldn't call this one an action packed, can't put it down until you know what happens next type of book, it was still entertaining for those like a big fat (and I do mean fat) book packed with plenty of history and intrigue and colorful characters. Just be warned, there are a lot of characters and the story switches back and forth quite a bit between Montana and New York so if you don't like a switching POV or if you're looking for a book with star-crossed lovers, a pure and saintly hero and heroine who get their HEA in the end, this isn't the book for you. For those of you who read and loved her more famous book, Forever Amber you might want to give this one a whirl. 4/5 stars."},{"Title":"Wanderers eastward, wanderers west","review":"While I can't say I enjoyed this book as well as \\"Forever Amber\\", Ms. Winsor does introduce us to a 20-year span of the early living conditions from the West to New York. It's an informative historical long novel with diverse characters that sometimes drags a bit and I wouldn't call it a page turner.At the end what she had written pretty much sums up the book: \\"If a man owned a good lead, knew his business, was persistent and energetic and had his fair share of the American mania for work, there was no possible way he could fail\\".There is no \\"real\\" ending, and I would have hoped for a follow-up book to finalize the lives, successes and failures of the expanded families and to continue with history after the train finally came to town!"},{"Title":"Wanderers eastward, wanderers west","review":"I am a huge fan of Forever Amber and wanted to read more of Kathleen Winsor. This book was a disappointment because I thought it disjointed, constantly switching back and forth between a group of families out West and a family in the East.

It's a terrific novel!"},{"Title":"Wanderers eastward, wanderers west","review":"This is a great book if you like historical novels. After finding it in my Nana's basement as a girl, I lost it. I never thought I would find another copy. I mentioned it to my boyfriend, and he tracked it down at this site as a birthday surprise. What a great present, it will never leave my possession again."},{"Title":"His Lordship's Mistress","review":"Jessica O'Neill had mortgaged her family's horse farm to the hilt in an effort to buy time for the stock's reputation to become known to the fashionable world. With 2 brothers to take care of and her parents both dead, Jessica was at her wit's end. To make matters worse, the kindly neighbor who held the deed to the farm, died and his heir was a lecherous creep. Jessica knew the only way to save her family was to marry him, but she just couldn't make herself do it. Jessica takes to the London with a vague idea of employment and falls into the idea of going on stage. Because of her beauty, speaking voice and creativity, Jessica gives fabulous performances, and her legion of admirers grows. Jessica is so unique that she eventually captures the admiration and attention of the handsome, wealthy Earl of Linton. Soon he convinces Jessica to move in with him and become his mistress. Both fall madly in love with each other, but Jessica especially realizes that the Earl of Linton can look as high in the land as any peer and his family would never approve of an actress.Really, what makes this book so wonderful is the focus is almost totally on the relationship between Jessica and the Earl. I love a romance where the couple are featured constantly, and the rest of the story is just used as a backdrop. You can see the feelings grow between Jessica and Linton and you can absolutely understand why each other falls in love. When she is on her game, Joan Wolf can say more in a couple of sentences than most authors can do in pages of descriptions. I have always been amazed at her understated writing style which simply sparkles with feeling and emotion. I quite love a great number of Wolf's romances, but this is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"His Lordship's Mistress","review":"To me, this was the quintessential Regency romance. The weight of society, the tender affection, the impediments to true love. Saying this book has no plot is like saying Moby Dick is a book about a fish. The construct (young woman forced to take to the stage in order to save her beloved home) sounded trite in the brief description here, but the main character's actions are made clear and admirable and the love she shares with the hero is delectably real. There are no lost letters or crossed wires; they must simply and honorably overcome the very real barriers to their happily ever after. I also appreciated lots of timely references to politics, international relations, and economics of the period. Great!"},{"Title":"His Lordship's Mistress","review":"This is a typical Joan Wolf regency plot, in that the hero and heroine face some very real life issues and obstacles to their love. It is in the vein of &quot;A Difficult Truce&quot; and &quot;Highland Sunset&quot;. If you like those, you will probably like this one. One of my favorites because the hero and heroine are both people of great character and personality."},{"Title":"His Lordship's Mistress","review":"This book was originally released in 1982 - it was very racy for the time period in which it was relased. I have read Joan Wolf's books for years and this is one of my favorites. I'm delighted to be able to purchase this as well as her other Signet books as e-books.Jessica is determined to save her family's horse farm for her brother. They have lost everything and she is determined to care for her family. Instead of accepting an offer from a replusive neighbor who has inherited the mortgage on her farm, along with her neighbors estate, she decides to earn the money in the only way she can. She will go to London, accept a role as a minor actress in the theatre and become the mistress of a wealthy patron. She would rather pick the man, she will give her body to than become the wife of a man she hates. And there begins a tale...Jessica becomes the hit of London and accepts the Earl of Linton as her protector. He is a wonderful gentleman who respects women and treats his mistress with courtesy. She sets the price for her 'services' and plans to save everything she receives to pay off the mortgage, then she will return home with a inheritance from the 'wealthy relative', she is supposed to be visiting.This is a wonderful romantic story, Jessica is a very independant woman but she is not headstrong or foolish, she makes a plan and sticks with it. I admire her determination! She didn't look for someone to rescue her family she did it herself and she was aware that her choice would ruin all her chances of marriage for the future. This story doesn't have a lot of silliness and poor decisions that so many books have now. This is a woman who knows herself and is willing to make sacrifices for her dreams. I love it!These books were the step-up from Georgette Heyer and Barbara Cartland, the sex scenes are not graphic or overly explicit."},{"Title":"His Lordship's Mistress","review":"Ok, I am officially adding Joan Wolf to my \\"will buy on sight\\" list of authors. Happily, because they are so old, the Kindle versions are only $4, which is within my impulse-buy range.This book features a remarkable heroine. When she is financially ruined by actions beyond her control, she looks cooly at her resources and decides to make a go of raising horses. And she works her ass off. And then she encounters another problem and needs to pay her mortgage off right away, and it is at this point that most Regency heroines enter into marriages of convenience and happily fall in love with the guy.Jessica, on the other hand, decides that she is unwilling to make the bad bet her mother did, and she would rather explicitly than implicitly sell her body. It is a very clear and rational decision.\\"The world would condemn such a course of action, she knew. But then she had no intention of letting her world know what she had done. And Jessica, who had highly ethical but unusual standards, found the idea less distasteful than swearing to love, honor, and obey someone she hated and despised.\\"So she lies to her family and goes to London to take to the stage and become a kept woman. In the way of books, she is an amazing hit, and I think the experience of this book would be improved if you've ever watched Shakespeare, but mostly she lands the protector she was looking for.And then of course she falls in love with him, and vice versa. But there are some pretty obvious impediments with an earl marrying his mistress. Complications! Heartbreak!Through it all, I never lost respect for either character. I thought they were both people I would like to get to know, and they deserved each other. It's a good feeling.Read if: You enjoy romances that have more-realistic depictions of growing relationships and economic constraints. You appreciate people with a sense of duty and responsibility.Skip if: You don't like romances. You would rather pure froth with no Corn Laws or enclosure discussions.Also read:Civil Contractfor a poignant and nuanced romance about a man in the same tight spot.More Joan Wolf!"},{"Title":"His Lordship's Mistress","review":"Loved this book.Lady Jessica Andover needs money to keep her beloved home after her stepfather has frittered away all of her money. Thanks to a governess who has a love of literature and Shakespeare and, who today would be considered a vocal coach, Jessica has a deep and abiding love and understanding of dramatic literature and the voice to move people.She embarks on a desperate scheme. Telling her family a great fib that she is going away to visit friends in Scotland, Jessica instead goes to London and using the name Jessica O'neill, becomes an actress with an eye to actually becoming a well kept mistress to some wealthy man.Jessica's scheme works only too well. She becomes an overnight sensation and she catches the eye of the Earl of Linton.She becomes his mistress, and to the dismay of his friends and family, they can see the two become even more deeply involved than is wise. What else are well meaning friends and family are supposed to do? Interfere for everybody's own good so that Linton doesn't ruin his life.At first I thought Jess was a little too high on herself. And to be fair, she realized how arrogant and wrong headed she was about her feelings of love and marriage. But over the course of the story, I absolutely came to enjoy Jess.And then there is the Earl of Linton. Yummy hero. He and Jess fall in love and begin to realize because of her having been on the stage that they may not be accepted by polite society if they marry. Linton is determined but Jess is more pragmatic.She decides to save him from himself with heart wrenching results.The love affair was so lovely to read about. these were two people who absolutely adored each other. The emotional upheaval when they realize they possibly can't marry is the stuff that romance novels were made for.Lovely, lovely read!"},{"Title":"His Lordship's Mistress","review":"I wasn't sure about this book at the beginning. The premise was a stretch, but once the hero and heroine meet it becomes a beautifully written story. There isn't a lot of action, but what this book has is a well written relationship. I felt this book was one of the best written in terms of feeling and believing the strength of the love between Jess and Phillip."},{"Title":"His Lordship's Mistress","review":"His Lordship's Mistress is a typical short regency of about 200 pages. Some authors can manage to cram quite detailed plots and characters into this short format, but not in this case. This is a very shallow novel. Jessica Andover, who is 20, is left financially in a bad way when her step father dies. She has Winchcombe, a property, plus the care of two younger half-brothers. Her character comprises of the usual cliches of young, beautiful and fearless. She sells of her tenant farms (I found that a bit hard to swallow, no responsible gentleman farmer at the time would have done such a thing, also she is underage and yet her guardian, a kindly neighbour lets her do as she pleases.) In addition, she mortgages what is left of the estate to the kindly neighbour. This is so she can have the money to breed horses. So of course we know see her openly dressed in breeches in front of her conservative neighbours training horses (very historically unlikely). Her kindly neighbour dies, and a villain who wants to marry her inherits. He threatens to foreclose on the mortgage if she won't marry him. But don't worry, Jessica is fearless, she knows exactly what to do to save her property and herself. She will go to London and find a rich protector and be a mistress. Luckily, she has a beautiful Shakespearean speaking voice, thanks to her governess's training. So of she goes to London, gets a moneylender to lend her money by mortgaging her property (um, thought it was already mortgaged...) walks into the best theatre in town and of course instantly gets hired on the spot as a leading actress and yes, she instantly becomes the reigning toast of London. She becomes a rich lord's mistress and you can guess the rest. No problems for Jessica ever."},{"Title":"His Lordship's Mistress","review":"Book description:Jessica O'neill's stage career made her the toast of London society. But no one suspected her true identity as a high-born young lady risking her good name to save her family from total ruin. And when the handsome Earl of Linton approaches her with an offer she can't possibly reject, jessica must learn to play a wealth- hunting wanton to the hilt- and avoid falling in love.....I was expecting so much more from this book since it had one of my favorite themes of the heroine as a mistress to the hero before the inevitable marriage, but there was nothing exciting about this book, on the contrary it was quite boring. The hero lacked personality and the storyline did not have that spark I was hoping for. If you like laid back romance without alot of serious conflict, then you might appreciate this book more than I did."},{"Title":"A complete record of the John Olin family,: The first of that name who came to America in the year A.D. 1678.

However, there is no indication that this is a CD and NOT a book, until you receive it."},{"Title":"The Imperial War Museum book of war behind enemy lines","review":"In order to give an accurate portrayal of this work, it's contents must be analyzed separately. Its information pertaining to the Long Range Desert Group, SAS, and so forth is engaging, accurate, and comprehensive. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the sections pertaining to the Chindit expeditions of General Orde Wingate. In these chapters, unlike the rest of the volume, much information is ignored, and very few sources are cited, astonishingly few considering the mass of information held at the Imperial War Museum itself pertaining to Wingate. As an example, Bernard Fergusson, Chindit column and brigade leader, is cited as a source, but it is not his earlier, more accurate work Beyond the Chindwin that is cited, but a later book, wherein his own personal recollections have been altered due to prodding by the Official Historians. Similarly, Shelford Bidwell's unbalanced book, Chindit War is a source, while there is no mention of the firsthand accounts by, among others, Chindits Peter Mead and Mike Calvert, not to mention historian David Rooney's illuminating works on the area. Instead, the take on Wingate is not dissimilar in any concrete way to the Official History by S Woodburn Kirby, a work which is decidedly, and unprofessionally, biased against the work of Wingate and his men. Still, all in all, the book is a valuable and readable resource for those interested in war behind enemy lines in World War II, with the exception of the Wingate information. Caveat emptor."},{"Title":"Knowing Jesus Study Bible, The","review":"This is a fantastic Bible! I've been through all 365 devotionals and I've read every single letter of the in text thoughts. It tries to point out intricacies that might not be otherwise noticed by the casual reader (for example: the incident between Tamar and Judah that created David's family line) because you read something in one book and five books (or more) later, the significance is revealed. I highly recommend it. It is the NIV translation, which may be a stumbling block for some people, but the NIV is probably the most supported translation in the world. I recommend that you get the softcover version because it is only a one year devotional Bible, so you don't want to spend too much on it. However, it's something you'll probably want to keep for a long time."},{"Title":"Knowing Jesus Study Bible, The","review":"I have owned this Bible for about 10 years. This Bible helped bring skeptical me to faith, primarily because of the several pages in the front of the bible showing the hundreds of places prophesy referenced in the old testament was fulfilled in the new testament. After studying these references, I was soon unable to deny that no mortal human could have possibly fulfilled all the prophesy that Jesus fulfilled. My church reads from the NIV and this is still my everyday and bring-to-church bible. I don't understand another reviewer who said that because this is a one-year study bible, that after a year you'll want/need another bible. This is a genuine bible and is timeless. This bible also has beautiful pictures throughout. I would highly recommend this bible.

Today I'm 232 days into the study, which means I've just begun the New Testament portion of the readings. Jesus and his coming have been pointed out daily throughout my reading of the Old Testament, but I didn't realize how much the anticipation for His story--His coming--had built until today. I've read the Bible many times, but this renewed hunger for Christ feels as fresh as when I first accepted Him more than 20 years ago. I highly recommend this study Bible, both for brand new believers and for those who sometimes feel their Bible studying has become more task than pleasure."},{"Title":"Knowing Jesus Study Bible, The","review":"I have owned this book for about three years now.

It also makes the old testament relevant to young people because it relates it to Jesus. There is just one thing wrong with it: It uses the New International Version of the Bible -- one that I have serious prioblems with -- for it's text. If Zondravan comes out with this Bible using the New Revised Standard Version, I would order this one for our youth group, middle school Sunday School, and Young Adults group.

Lydia is a strong-willed, well-defined character, who it is impossible not to like. The way she tells her story, using words that are at the same time elegant and eloquent, but achingly, forcefully human, is entrancing and makes time just fly by as the story goes on. As it does, it becomes increasingly clear that what is important here is not the plot itself, but the incredible young woman who serves as a narrator. The book's title, \\"A Ring of Endless Light\\", is not only the name of a poem by 17th-century author Henry Vaughn, referenced throughout the novel, but also a perfect description of our protagonist. It is impossible to know her and not fall in love with her.In a word, perfect."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This book was much differant than I expected it to be. When my friend told me about it I figured it was just another one where the girl likes the guy and of course gets the guy in the end. Now it was somewhat like that, but she (Vicky) also faced other meaningful tough events.The beginning of the book was odd to me but by the end I was really enjoying it. The book started in a funeral and slowly set up what all was going on. It took me awhile to really understand all of the charactors, but it made the book better.I suggest this book to people who want a fun intersesting read. You also can't mind having a poem recited now and than. A Ring of Endless Light was good and I suggest it to almost anyone."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This is my favourite book (hence the title).

Even though she is confronted with many conflicts, she learns to deal with them with the help of her dolphin friend, Basil, whom she can communicate with. In the end the conflicts are resolved and she looks on life with a different outlook, and i think that if you read this book you will too!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This isn't L'Engle's books about Meg or Charles Wallace, but about a girl from a rather normal family called Vicky Austin. There's a number of relationships and deaths - everything is described well. I also like L'Engle's style of writing that comes out sometimes, like in the very last page, with no commas or periods.After I read this I was like, 'woah,' and I felt a little dizzy (perhaps it was because I read it in the car). I read it about three times and every time it touches me. It is a MUST read."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"A Ring of Enless Light is a really really good book!! It's about a girl named Vicky Austin (she's also in other books before this one by Madeline L'Engle) who comes to the island for the summer to spend time with her dying grandfather whom she really loves. She's in the middle of three boys, Zach - sophisticated but troubled; Leo - who really likes Vicky and just wants some romance; and Adam - who gives her a chance to work with dolphins!!!! This is a really good book about dolphins and a girl who is really easy to relate to!! Madeline L'Engle wrote it really well!! READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Dolphins have taught us many new ways of communication, thinking, and learning about what's around us. But to Vicky Austin, dolphins have taught much more. The lesson they teach her is something that she will never forget. A lesson that takes most people a life time to discover; something that has baffled scientists for years. The lesson of life and death.Vicky has a gift. A rare ability, that comes with her beautiful sense of poetry. She can communicate with dolphins. And because of Madeleine L'Englepoetic and descriptive writing style, Vicky's blessing seems to come alive. This is one of the most powerful elements of the book because it has such an effect on the reader's view of the plot.Another contribution to the novel's effectiveness is the characterization. L'Engle does a fine job of creating diverse and interesting characters that almost anyone can identify with. Take for example the character Zachary. Zachary is your average \\"bad boy\\" stereotype. But because of Zachary's luxurious but troubled childhood, this characteristic that he seems to have is really a mask that only Vicky can see through. Zachary's character plays an interesting role in the book by teaching Vicky that some people are not always truly as they seem.Packed with detailed descriptive writing and interesting plot elements, A Ring of Endless Light is a must read. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a desire to read a heart-warming tale of self-discovery. Read it and experience for yourself the beauty of the sea."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Vicky Austin is at a confusing time in her life.

Lastly, there is Adam, a friend of her older brother. He gives her the opportunity to help with his secret dolphin experiment, to which she becomes an important and indispensable asset. This becomes a life-changing experience that ties in to her unforgettable summer at Seven Bay Island. I loved this book by Madeline L'Engle. She is my favorite author and this is my favorite book.

The idea of &quot;light&quot; and how one displays their own light varies greatly from character to character.

Vicky is an inspirational young woman not because she's a heroine in the traditional sense: superhuman and all knowing, but rather because she's painfully and gloriously human. At times she is a typical teenage girl wrestling with issues about boys, school, family and growing up. At others she is mature and wise well beyond her years. The charachter of Vicky Austin is still a role model to me in my adulthood! A Ring of Endless Light, although seemingly about death, is really a celebration of life. Death, whether it be sudden, tragic and unexpected or the natural end to a long happy life, is celebrated as an integral part of life whether it be that of human, dolphin or sparrow. The lesson learned is to focus on the living, indeed, on the glass half full rather than half empty. Madeleine L'Engle's books have had a tremendous impact on my life and have taken a part in shaping the woman I've become. In this and many of her other books she has shown me how to glory my tribulations, for from tribulations comes patience, from patience, experience; and from experience, hope!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This story is one of the authors best.

In addition to all of these problems, she also has three different guys who are wanting her attention. Her problems keep mounting, and yet, Vicky Austin still manages to befriend a pod of dolphins and continue in her poetry writing. An EXCELLENT book about growing up, Madeleine L'Engle continues to amaze me with her insight into various aspects of life. The plot is very logical, and its no wonder that this book got a Newberry Honor Award. The characters are life-like, the imagery is excellent, and I would recommend this to men and women of all ages. Her creativity and poetry use cause people to think about what they believe religiously, what the meaning of family is, and the choices that one has to make on a daily basis. The three guys that Vicky is around all the time seem to portray three of the four different aspects on life, with Vicky portraying the fourth.

I connected with all the characters, especially Vicky. This is a wonderful, moving story that could only be topped by L'Engle herself."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This is for sure my favorite book. I read it for the first time in sixth grade and have been reading it every year since then. As a teenage girl I can relate to almost everything in the book. It made me feel like I wasn't alone. If you you haven't read it run to the nearest store and pick it up. I cherish my copy like gold!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I read this book a couple of months ago, and LOVED it! I like dolphins a lot from reading &quot;Animorphs&quot; so the cover attracted me. So I read the back, and the part about Vicky's grandfather being sick urged me to buy it. Some of the parts were only OKAY, but then at the end, with the darkness and light and death and all that, well, it just made up for the parts I didn't like. All in all, this is one of the best books I have ever read, and am almost positive will ever read!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I read this about 9 years ago and the effects 9 years ago still happen today. If you're looking for a present for a young girl, this is definitely the book to buy. I still treasure mine."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I've had this on my shelf probably since I was the intended audience: there are pages falling out and the cover is creased. A story about a young woman on the edges of romance, of self-discovery, having to deal with her grandfather's dying, her parents becoming *people* instead of just her parents, and her changing relationships all around. The poetry is really good, the imagery excellent; I can feel the atmosphere she describes and fall into the scenes easily. I reread this book at least once a year - keep it on your bookshelf for yourself as well as any passing youngsters of appropriate age/reading level."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"When I got this book for Christmas and saw the jumping dolphins on the cover and vaguely remembered some sort of corny disney movie I inwarly groaned. I thought for sure it was going to be 300 pages of heart warming boredom all about frolicking with cuddly dolphins.It suprised me by being a very good book with lots of deeper meanings in it. How to deal with the death of a friends father and her grandfathers illness? Or what to do about the reckless rich boy who had attached himself to her?I ended up liking the main character and the book.It is a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"What a beatiful,well written book! This is about Vicky Austin who finds herself wondering why being a teenager is so hard. After a treasured friend dies,the attention of three boys is set on her. Zachary is a sophistacated,troubled boy who is mixed up about life. Leo is the deceased man's son who is an old friend aching for comfort and romance. Adam is a boy who treats Vicky like a little child when she is ready to become a adult, but he also offers her a chance to work with dolphins.Now I should mention that this book is very much a book for all of you dolphin lovers. Vicky feels she can talk to them when she meets a male dolphin called Basil. The dolphins are very good friends and even help her save her brother's life. Also, if you have a liking of poetry, this book is for you. This is a beautiful book!!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"As a fifteen year old girl, I often find myself slipping into the void of fluffy girly novels (The Princess Diaries and the likes), and while these are quite enjoyable, they lack substance. L'Engle writes with a passionate pen, and her prose draws you in. Though it is not the easy, quick page turning pace that is found in many of the \\"Young Adult Novels\\" today, it is neither dense nor boring. And yes, there are boys (three of them in fact), but they're not the main attraction in this novel, though they are very involved. This is the book for you if you either a)enjoy L'Engle's other novels or b)are looking for an escape from the day to day superficial, seemingly meaningless droll of teenage life."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This is one of the most lyrical books I have ever read. The story centers around Vicy Austin, a teenager facing many difficult issues.After the death of family friend Commandor Rooney, Vicky Austin is feeling insecure about ehr world. The Austin family has come to live at Seven Bay Island for the summer because her grandfather is dying. In the meantime, she is confronted by three different boys: Leo, who is Commandor Rooney's son, wants more than friendship from Vicky. Zachary is a troubled teen who has a lot mroe layers than it seems. And Adam is a friend of her older brother John who turns out to be a good friend...and perhaps a little more. Adam introduces Vicky to dolphines, and vicky discovers she can communicate with them telepathically. This revelation means that adam wants her to help with his reaserch. Adam has a past of his own, which makes him reluctant to own up to his feelings for Vicky. The entire book is about dying,and the reason we are all here, plus many, many other things, but it is written so well that it is like poetry. In fact, Vicky is a poet, and the book is scattered with poems with lines like: \\"The universe is part of this one cryThat every life is noted and cherished,And nothing loved is ever lost or perished.\\"After a child dies in Vicky's arms, she reaches a conclusion about death and life that will bring tears to your eyes.This is an amazing story. Its ideas are timeless, and the dolphins play a huge role. Vicky is a mature character and the entire book is unforgetable. If you are smart, you will buy this book."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"In A Ring of Endless Light, the emotional and poetic Vicky Austin is nearly sixteen, and is facing her grandfather's impending death. This book is among L'Engle's best, and will surely touch each and every reader. As you discover the beauty of life through a clan of peaceful, joyous dolphins, you will feel the burden of death as it surrounds Vicky and threatens to consume her. L'Engle shares an understanding of life and death so wise and unique, that it will linger in your memory forever. Her captivating poetry contributes graceful clarity. Vicky Austin is certainly a character everyone can identify with. The descriptions are stunning, the development is smooth, realistic, and vivid, and the story is unforgettable. It's sure to become one of your favorites."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I absolutely love this book! Although it is in a 9-12 reading level, I find that it has a lot of adult concepts; non-linear time, spirituality, the relationship between life and death, and higher intelligence in animals and telepathy. This book is very thought provoking as well as dramatic, and I found myself meditating upon the themes expressed in it. If you like spiritual themes, dolphins, or just a touching story, you will love this book."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I'm an adult reader, who read this book when I was a lot younger, I can honestly say I didn't know how much difference this book made in my life and in the way I view death until my mother died. It left a lasting impression of hope and faith."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This book is unquestionably my favourite in the Austin series. The other books in the series are The Twenty-Four Days Before Christmas, Meet the Austins, The Anti-Muffins, The Moon by Night, The Young Unicorns, and Troubling a Star. A Ring of Endless Light contains some of my favourite poetry, as well as being written in clear, natural, effortless prose. The issues it deals with, such as faith, life and death, and the nature of God, are never oversimplified, and there is a refreshing absence of a narrow, didactic viewpoint. This book clearly deserved its Newbery Honor Book status. Ever since I finished reading this book, I have wanted to swim with a dolphin, and was encouraged to read Henry Vaughan's poetry for the first time."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This novel begins and ends with death, but Vicky Austin celebrates life. L'Engle's sensitive portrayal of adolescence struggling to accept death rings true. Vicky is, as always, an open and honest narrator. This novel probably shows us more of her development as a character than do L'Engle's other novels, and we are also treated to a lovely setting. Vicky finds joy even in the midst of great pain, in the last summer she knows she'll have with her grandfather, and she teaches us by example a productive and mature method of dealing with death. L'Engle's drawing of the grandfather is exquisite, and as always, her characterization of the Austins gives me supreme faith in humans' ability to form close, wonderful bonds. Note: I read A Ring of Endless Light just after my own grandfather passed away and after I got engaged; this book helps me grieve and gives me hope. Plus, L'Engle's science has always intrigued me (Arm of the Starfish, Charles Wallace's mitochondria and farandolae), and the dolphins are fabulous."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I picked this book up the other day with the intention of just giving myself some light reading, but I was certainly not prepared for the emotional impact that this book had on me! I've rarely read anything so moving or powerful. The characters are compellingly drawn; you don't just read about Vicky, you become Vicky, with all of the struggles that accompany growing up and experiencing friendship, love, and loss. This book celebrates everything beautiful and good in this world, where such things often go unnoticed in the midst of all the darkness, fear and confusion that seems so prevalent. Uplifting in every sense...you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This is one of my favorite books ( like all of Madeline E'Lengle's books ) The language and point of view were excellent and the main character's feelings were beautifully portrayed. I, however believe that 9-12 years is to young a reading level and recommend it for an older audience. I recommend all of L' Engles books but beware of the age levels, they change dramatically from book to book."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"A ring of endless light is one of my favorite books. I have read it over and over again, because it is so good. It is sad, touching, and shows death in a new perspective. Madeleine L'Engle is a brilliant writer and while reading the book, you feel like Vicki Austin. All the problems she is having as a teenager makes you think. I think that everyone should read this book because it teaches a lot. I love the book!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This book was soooo good! Vicky Austin is growing up and facing a world of death, her poetic mind and soul pull her out with the help of her oneness with the dolphins. Everytime I read it I feel like I get more and more out of the book. Her poetry speaks truth the morals they preach are ones to follow for life and her life as a normal girl facing the toughest situation in her life is portrayed gracefully and wonderfully L'engle has outdone herself in the honest touching life giving book"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I really enjoyed this book, even thought it was set in acompletely different time period, many things that happened were very similar to life now. To have a million things thrown at you all at one time can be a very hard thing to handle, especially at a young age. Figuring out life and death is something that I think everybody does, but are not usually that successful. This book also helps you realize that sometimes you just need to get away and be just you for a while. That is something that takes many people a long time to learn. I truly enjoyed this book, and others by the same author."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This book was very well written! It allways had someting interesting going on. The author used alot of symbolism. The beginning was a bit slow but once i got into it i relly enjoyed it. the charaters were well developed.

Vicky went through the same boy problems that i am. i wish that i could communicate like she did with those dolphins. i am not a fan of L'Engle but this book blew me away. it shows that death can impact us all and that the pretty boy isn't always the best. i am so glad that she wrote this book! it is profound and is for all ages not just children and teens."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I have to say that if you are looking for a GREAT book this is it!

I am telling you, you MUST read this book!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"How do you even begin?! This book is so beautiful...so full of life...so eye-opening. How does Madeleine L'Engle do it?? I loved this book. Normally I don't like books about death, so I didn't think I'd like &quot;A Ring of Endless Light&quot; very much. But this book is not about death: it's about life! Life at its strongest and most beautiful. Even while Grandfather is dying he's teaching us a valuable lesson about life, and how to live it to get the most out of it. I may sound preachy, but it's hard to capture the overall feel of this book. It amazes me that Madeleine L'Engle can write this stuff, when I can't even begin to grasp at it in a measly review! Anyway, read it, and read it again, and again, and again, and again...."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This book is about Vicky Austin and her troubles with growing up.

This book is one of the many books by MadelineL&#65533; Engle. This book goes along with the Disney movie called A Ring of Endless Light.I read this book after I saw the movie. Everybody should read this book because it is a great book because it has dolphins and I love dolphins. I also love horses. A character in the book, Vicky, can communicate with the dolphins. She is visiting her grandfather on Seven Bay Island. Vicky Goes to Second Bay Stables to ride horses. It is a Newbery Honor Book.In this book one person dies, and a female dolphin gives birth to her first pup (a dolphin baby). One of the characters can talk with the dolphins so they can communicate.

One day Vicky goes to meet them , and she figures out she can talk to dolphins telepathicly. Also 3 people die in the book and her grandpa has leukemia.This book is about how confusing it is to be a teenager. The moral of the story is people die and that&#65533;s life.

Because it practicly has no plot and it&#65533;s very bad."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"DO NOT I repeat DO NOT read this book if you are NOT a girl under 16 years old. I am a 35 year old man and I read this book and thought it was a parody but it isn't.

There are so many reader comments here that this is probably redundant, but I wanted to contribute my feelings on this wonderful book. Madeleine L'Engle writes with amazing eloquence and sensitivity about the struggles of a teenage girl growing up filled with seemingly unresolvable feelings of joy and sorrow. There is something for everyone to relate to in Vicki's struggle as she experiences tragedy and sadness and must find her way back to the light. L'Engle paints an enduring portrait of Vicki and her wonderful, human family and friends. I will always have a copy of this book on my shelf."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I really loved this book. I relate to Vicky Austin completely. In this book she has to deal with many life and death situations that mold her future. Coming to accept death she is made a stronger person. But in a way known to only a few of us that have expierienced what she has. Her feelings are made very clear and distinct. It made me feel I was living right along with her in the book.

I felt for Vicky, as I was reading, because I knew,that my grandfather was going to die, just like Vicky. It was hard to deal with because, like Rob, I was younger when it happened. I absolutely loved the parts where Vicky worked with dolphins. I love dolphins too, although I have never worked with them. I like the way Vicky handles her life. She seems to have everything under control. She can hold on when her insides are tearing apart. That is why liked this book so much. Thank you Madeline L'Engle, this was a story that you couldn't put down. I rate is a really good nine!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This was a great book.

I am a 9th grade student and have just compleated this book in my English class. This book deals with just about everything. Death, dolphins, mixed emotions, relationships, and some science fiction (like ESP). This book is about Vicky (the main character), and mainly her relationships with three boys, and it mentions death frequently. Vicky is an &quot;almost 16&quot; year old that has to deal with her grandfather slowly dying, her siblings growing up, 3 relationships with 3 different people, and lots of other things. I can't really describe it. Let's just say it's one of those &quot;read it to belive it&quot; kind of books. This book will amaze you. A must read!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This is is by far one of my favorite novels by L'Engle. I find that it gives you the capacity to think about what the world would be like if you were someone else. The book covers things that happen to many people around the world, but it also touches on things that don't happen, but no one can say are not possible."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"A Ring of Endless LightBy Madeleine L'EngleBook ReviewIn Madeleine L'Engle's A Ring of Endless Light, main character Vicky Austin discovers many new aspects of life in a single summer. She is sixteen and already holds many responsibilities. Vicky becomes paralyzed with a fear of death when a close family friend is buried, and even more so when a small child dies in her arms in a hospital waiting room. She eventually discovers, however, that death is simply another part of life, and through new friends and a strong family Vicky stays tough and helps others cope.A Ring of Endless Light is engaging and well written, conveying highly believable emotions to the reader. L'Engle uses poetry and metaphor in an effective manor to express the cruel wonder of the world. Vicky's relationships with her family and friends were believable as well, and overall the format of the book really worked nicely and made you want to continue reading.In the story, Vicky participates in a study her brother's friend Adam is doing on dolphins. These sections of the book were intriguing, because Vicky has the ability to communicate with the dolphins themselves. This kind of communication seems to be a theme throughout the book, but in a spiritual more than \\"science-fictiony\\" way. The ocean also works its way into many of the strongest metaphors of the book, as the house the Austin's stay in is right on the coast.Vicky struggles with relationships throughout the entire book, which adds to the believability of the plot. There are three different \\"young men\\" in her life, all very different. There is Zachary, the wealthy yet troubled boy who wishes to show Vicky a life of country clubs and expensive banquets. Then there is Leo, a sad, slobbery child at heart with more needs than Vicky knows how to attend to. Finally there's Adam, the educated older friend who works at the marine biology station. The three are all connected to her, and most need more than Vicky has to offer.Overall, I found A Ring of Endless Light to be an expertly crafted work, filled with tangled emotions and interesting twists. Love and death entwine each other, and only by reading the book can you find which feelings overcome others. I would recommend this book and others in the series to anyone looking to go on a roller coaster ride of emotions that are not their own, but striking just the same."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"A young girl named Vicky overcoming grief as her dear friend Commander Rodney's [demise] occurs.

I'm 22, and I just finished reading this book today and I couldn't put it down...

I am definetly keeping this book and giving it to my future daughter."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I have read books by Madeline L'Engle before, but this was my very favorite book of hers. I couldn't put it down while reading it because of all of the excitment of unexpected events. I still think strongly that it is better then the disney movie, \\"A Ring of Endless Light,\\" ans it is almost a different story.This amazing story takes place on and island off of New York where fifteen year old Vicky Austin, an amiable funloving girl is visiting her beloved grandfather, who sadly has leukemia. She is visiting with her younger siblings Susie and Rob, her older sibling, John, and her parents. In the beginning of this book, Victoria and her family are at the funeral of her friend Leo Rodney's father.

While the book goes on, Leo wants to be Victoria's boyfriend. Zachary trys to win Victoria's heart,and Adam just wants to be friends. However, this is not as important as the amazing discovery Victoria makes while working with dolphins at the lab with Adam.

This is a story about grief, maturity, decisions, but most of all about the joy of life. Vicky Austin is just a girl - albeit a mature one with a real depth of soul - who as she matures into a young woman must start making some real decisions and learning some real lessons. Like most of Madeleine l'Engle's books the story occurs in a glorious natural setting.As a teenager I wanted with all my heart to be like Vicky and to meet someone like Adam. And what girl wouldn't want to swim with the dolphins?A splendid affirmation of life and love, this book is timeless."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I loved this book so much.The characters such as Leo, Zachary, and Adam are so much like the boys from my last summer. My favorite character would probably be Adam. He was so into dolphins but did not understand how grown up Vicky was. You should see the movie too on the Disney Channel. Not the same but still good."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This book is awesome!It is about a girl named Vicky Austin and her family visit seven Bay Island to be with her dying grandfather.While she is there she notices she is the attion of 3 different boys.

Before, I had only read Many Waters. I was so impressed with Light that I went to the library and checked out all the books L'Engle wrote that were available. I already finished the Time Quartet(Time, Door, Planet, and Waters) and I am now reading An Acceptable Time, one of the books in the O'Keefe series. I also have the first book in the Austin series, Meet the Austins. I love all the books, but Light is so incredible, it made me want to cry and laugh at the same time."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"In Madeleine L'Engle's fourth book dealing with the Austin family, Vicky Austin must juggle the demands for attention by three very different young men while also struggling with the fact that her grandfather has leukemia and probably will not survive the summer. Vicky's talent for poetry and her nonverbal communication with dolphins at sea give her the strength to endure this trying time in her life. This is a very touching novel which leaves the reader feeling hopeful that all difficult times and grief can be overcome with the help and love of others dear to us. I would recommend it for grades 6-10."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"The book was amazing.

Although all of Ms. L'Engle's books are superbly written, &quot;A Ring of Endless Light&quot; is my all-time favorite book. The dialogue and setting descriptions are captivating. The talented way she wrote in 1st person allows the reader to understand who the &quot;real&quot; Vicky Austen is while feeling like they're part of the story, and getting inside the character's thoughts. The way Ms. L'Engle opens the character's thoughts to the reader seems, to me, to resemble the way dolphins' thoughts flow to Vicky. Indeed, &quot;A Ring of Endless Light&quot; is a &quot;must-read book.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I love this book because it never focuses on one thing, suprises pop up out of the blue. Vicky has a strong will and refuses to compromise herself. Her connection with the dolphins is enthralling. Worlds of stability, money, power, and charm all crash together, and Vicky rises from them like a phoenix rising from the ashes."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I absolutely adore this book. I am fifteen, and out of all L'Engle's books, this and Troubling a Star are my favorites. Vicky is a girl who reminds a few people (like me) of themselves, and alot of people of a friend, or someone they'd like to be or get to know. I love all of the Austin Books, though I recommend this one for a 13+ age range to really appreciate it, and understand the power to L'Engle/Vicky's words.Also, L'Engle's descriptions of dolphin-human communication are, to this marine biologist wannabe, fabulous. You would think she's a marine biologist!!! (is she??) I am fascinated, and they make me love science and the ocean even more than I already did."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This is my all-time favorite book, a superb story about life and death. Both of these are very complicated themes and L'Engle brings them down off the pulpit into REAL LIFE. She shows that there doesn't have to be a concrete answer for everything and that letting go is really the only way to cope with losing someone. Every time I re-read this book I get something more out of it. It's inspirational, realistic, poignant, and enjoyable all at once. Another great point about this novel is that each character is complex. Vicky reveals her shortcomings as well as her strengths; so does Adam, and their interaction is so realistic as a result. For someone Vicky's age, it's great to finally read about someone I can identify with. If you've never read Madeleine L'Engle before, this is a fine place to start. This is a book that should be re-read as many times as possible. Get it now!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I read this book when I was 8, by accident. I found it when my brother got me A Wrinkle In Time, another great book by L'Engle. Sure glad I found it. I'm still a devoted fan. The book hooks you instantly, because you fall in love with the Austin family. I don't know, it's like you become one of the family, sharing it's joys and sorrows...The book teaches you a lot of things and makes you interested in learning more. It's like a day of school, cleverly hidden within. It's a deep book; and you might not catch everything the first time around, but that makes it all the better the second time. I would recommend buying the hardback versions. After you read a paperback so many times, it starts to fall apart. And believe me, you'll be reading it more than a few times!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This book is wonderfully written and I highly suggest you read it. I could relate to Vicky's feelings and loved the way she reacted to the dolphins and how they reacted to her. I enjoyed it and it really made me think when I was finished. I wanted it to keep going. You should read it."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Wow! An exciting novel almost anybody could love. I definetly recommend any of the Austin series for all ages of reading. Great job Madeleine!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This book is one of my favorites. It's a complex story that grows and blooms throughout. This book made me laugh, cry, and most of all think, and I think that's important. It is very detailed and interesting. The characters are all very complex, much like real people. As I read this book I sometimes forgot that I wasn't there.I highly recommend this book for people of all ages."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I will always have Madeline L'Engle to thank, to some degree, for my love affair with reading. This book in particular, though, has been one of my dearest favorites of hers; it fits in neatly with the Emily of New Moons and the Little Women categories of young writing women who enlighten the rest of the world with their inimitable take on life.Time spent with Vicky Austin as she navigates being 15, a writer, and seemingly surrounded by death and change would initially seem to be overwhelming; but it is such a life affirming book throughout that you can't put it down. The mystical charm of the dolphins, the great family relationships, and the great use of poetry and prose makes reading the book a welcome pleasure.The most important thing is that she digs out all of the amazing things about being a teenager that are so hard to see--the deep insight, soul-searching power, the incredible hope, the blooming intelligence--everything that we tend to bury in the moodiness, anxiety, and pain that comes with going through this stage. It makes adults remember the amazing powers that come with that age, and lets teenagers see, in a way that we don't frequently remind them, that being a teenager can be an incredibly productive time of life.Another great book by an amazing writer."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I really loved this book, it was my favorite. I read A Ring of Endless Light last year. This is the only book I have ever read from Madeleine L'Engle. But after reading this one, I just know all the others will be good. I hope to read all the other stories about the Austins. Anyway, this book was about a 15-year-old girl named Vicky Austin. She has to go to New York with her family to stay with her grandfather, who is sick with Leukemia. Soon after she gets there, she meets up with her old love, Zachary. He has many problems, and just before, had tried to commit suicide. Vicky also meets one of her older brother's friends, Adam. He is a marine biologist and works with dolphins. She starts to like him and he is very close with her also, but treats her like a little kid at times, and she really hates that. She gets to go out into the ocean with him and meet a dolphin, Bazil. While all this is happening, Vicky's grandfather is slowly dying, and Zachary is very depressed and constanly wanting attention from her. She faces many complications along the way, but learns from all of them. If you like dolphins, this is a wonderful book for you. Also, I recommend it for all ages, disregard the age range listed. This book made me cry, I loved the ending, but throughout the entire book, it kept me wanting to read. I have never been this excited about reading a book before, and I am certainly not someone who reads a lot. I hope anyone who reads A Ring of Endless Light enjoys it as much as I did."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Have you ever read a book that simply throws your thoughts and emotions in a whirlwind after reading it? Something that has lessons that stay with you for the rest of your life? That's what this book is like. Madeline L'Engle is a stunning author that mixes theology, science fiction, and an all-powerful sense of love into her books. In this paticular one, she writes about Vicky, a sixteen year old girl dealing with problems in her life. She feels surrounded by death and is doubting the world. She has to go through the painful process of watching her grandfather die slowly from leukemia, and is dealing with three young men that she knows. One, Leo, an old friend, she is comforting because of his father's sudden death. Another, Zachary, a passive agressive boy, she is trying to help while not going in too deep with is problems. The last, Adam, is a friend of her older brothers, with whom she is involved with a project with dolphins. It is ultimately with these dolphins she is given a new perspective in life, while she learns the how to deal with death. She finds out that accepting death is ultametly an affirmation of life. This is a far cry from the typical confused teenager book. This book teaches you lessons that you will carry with you and, as all of L'Engle's books, gives youa fresh and new perspective on life. I would recommend this book to anyone any age, though children and young teens may not get a lot out of it. Even though it's in the children's isle, it is ultamilty an adult book."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"A Ring of Endless Light is one of my all time favourite books. It inspired me to read all of the Austin series, as well as A Wrinkle in Time, et. al.The book is about a teenager, Vicky Austin, and her journey on the path to coping with her grandfather's illness, and eventual death. On her way, she encounters love and friendship, and questions the true purpose of life, as well as what death truly means. She rides with dolphins, and has a child die in her arms. Many events happen during the summer in which this is set, and readers can watch Vicky as she grows up.Madeleine L'Engle is an excellent writer and her portrait of the characters in the novel are full and leave little, if anything, to be desired. I recommend this book for anybody 13 or over who has suffered loss that has left them wishing for answers. Even if you feel you haven't encountered loss, read it; Vicky will surely strike a chord."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I first read this book as a teenager. As an adult, I still re-read it whenever I need to be uplifted or comforted. It is among my favorite books. It is very definitely young-adult fiction, but it has appeal for adults as well, though it will almost certainly appeal more to women than men. This is a book about triumph and tragedy, pain, loss, love and growing up. It is life-affirming even though it deals with sadness and anguish - a trademark of L'Engle's work. Vicky is a heroine everyone who ever was, is or will be a teenage girl can relate to - particularly anyone who has ever lost someone to death or betrayal. Beautifully written, as all of L'Engle's work is, but this one stands out as something special. It is one of my two all-time favorites of L'Engle's work, and that is saying something because I have read most of her work and virtually all of her novels (the only one I don't own is virtually impossible to find). There is an element of the \\"supernatural\\" in that Vicky has the ability to communicate telepathically with dolphins, and it was originally written long enough ago that some of the pop culture references are a bit dated, but other than that, this book is as real as it gets when it comes to dealing with first love, friendship, death, tragedy, anguish and growing up.I was extremely disappointed in the movie, so I will add my voice to those who have said that if you've seen the movie, don't expect the same from the book - the book is infinitely better and completely different. In my view, the movie both missed the point and gutted the story of the book. Some change is necessary when adapting a book, but this was one of those cases where, with the exception of a handful of character names, a poem, the title and maybe half a dozen lines of dialog, the book and the movie bore no relationship to one another - and the movie suffered for it. It was a perfectly adequate movie, but it was NOT \\"A Ring of Endless Light\\" and they ought not to have called it that - though if it gets kids who saw it to read the book, I suppose some good can come from it. If you liked the movie - read the book to find out what REALLY happened to Vicky, Adam & Zachary (oh and that guy they left out of the movie entirely - Leo). And if you haven't seen the movie - skip it and read the book!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Lloyd in Space. Kim Possible. Except for a few cartoons, I veer between Cartoon Network and Nick, not stopping at the Disney Channel. A big exception, though,was A Ring of Endless Light, a recent Disney Channel TV movie. Given that the books are always better, in my opinion, this film compares favorably with the book. It's enjoyable to see the dolphin sequences \\"come to life,\\" as it were, after their vivid portrayl in the story.Like many readers, I came to L'Engle through the \\"increasingly inaccurately titled\\" Time Trilogy (now up to five books). I was amazed at how her story-telling skill transferred effortlessly from the O'Keefes to the Austins, even without tesseracts, Proginoskes and kything.Having said that, I think that L'Engle is one of the most delightful authors to read. Her writing is deceptively simple, but every page something new subtley draws you in. Somehow she also seems to understand adolescence. She doesn't write down to teens or fob off some contrived formula (as a great many recent films seem to do); maybe her inner teen is writing these books.I'm likely not the only one who'd like to see L'Engle's books get the Harry Potter treatment on the big screen, but this Disney Channel movie is certainly a good start."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I have read almost every one of Ms. L'Engle's Books, (i am her #1 fan, my ultimate goal is to read them all, which will be a challenge) and this one, A Ring of Endless Light, is my favorite, i liked it even more than A Wrinkle in Time. I am a ravenous reader and i have read a million and two books, and this one is my FAVORITE OF THEM ALL. I cried at the end of this book because IT WAS OVER, thats how good it is. You MUST read this book if you are a L'Engle fan, it is AMAZING.In this book, Vicky Austin is visiting her grandfather on Seven Bay Island, somewhere of the coast of New England. Her grandfather has Leukemia and it is consistently getting worse. She also, for the first time in her life, finds herself the center of attention for 3 boys. Adam, a friend of her brothers who she is working with on his projects with dolphins, Leo, an old friend who wants more and all Vicky wants is friendship. Then Zachary, a troubled rich boy, who Vicky wants to help, but shes not sure how. This book is complex and GREAT! A MUST buy for teen fiction readers. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"In Madeline L'Enlgle's A Ring of Endless Light, 15-year old Vicky goes out to visit her sick grandfather to spend some time with him. During her stay, an old family friend, Commander Rodney, dies because he was trying to save another person from dying. On top of this, three young men are trying to get her adornment. Leo, Commander Rodney' son, is the nervous and puppy like young man who needs Vicky's attention. Although he may be nice, Vicky just wants to be his friend. Adam, a young man working at the marine biology center, confuses Vicky because he likes her, but pushes her away at the same time. Zachary, the rich, young man Commander Rodney died saving, wants Vicky back and claims that he needs her. Even though she has to deal with her love life, she has to help her grandfather, and other family members. During this vacation, she learns a lot about herself, death, life, her friends and family.I really liked this book because it is very insightful. It gives me a lot of insight about living life. I want to live my lifelike Vicky and think like her because she lives her life to her fullest poetical and is moral, unlike me. She put phrases and lessons to heart and has a way of putting things into the right words. I liked how the author also wrote about death because I know that everyone is confused about tins subject. Some people firmly believe in one thing while other people are confused and wobbling. I remember what the Madeline L'engle writes about death whenever I come across one because her words sooth and help the soul.I dislike the fact that the characters are a bit to perfect. The Austins are a bit like robots. There is the housewife mom that loves her husband and doesn't seem to have any arguments are all with him. The father is a strong man that supports his whole family. The oldest brother, like his father, is strong and smart. The youngest sister is beautiful and smart. The youngest brother is cute and innocent. Although Vicky seems more human than her family, she is still robotic. She always tries her hardest and it seems that everyone is drawn to her. Everyone trusts her with his or her secrets and everyone in the story has a longing to be with her. She is the person that people always want to be.My favorite part of the book is hard to decide, but I think that my favorite part is when Vicky goes and visits the dolphins. I think that this is really interesting because Vicky learns that she can communicate with dolphins. In the beginning, she is really scared, but then she realizes that there is nothing to be afraid of. Soon, she feels comfortable with Basil. She can play with the dolphin and communicate freely. Even though people can't communicate with dolphins, Vicky can because her mind is somewhat childish, open, and free. I think that this is my favorite part because Vicky's relationship with Basil is much like my relationship with my friends. When I first made my friends, we were scared and shy, but once we knew each other, we had a lot of fun. When I am with my friends, I become childish, open and free, just like Vicky."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"\\"A Ring of Endless Light\\" by Madeleine L'Engle is a fictional, poetic story about an almost 16-year-old girl who is spending the summer with her family and Grandfather on Seven Bay Island. Her Grandfather is battling leukeumia and a lot of this book is about handling death and questioning life.Vicky is trying to decide between three different guys: one, Leo, who Vicky wants to just be a friend, Zachary, who drives too fast and scares Vicky most of the time, and Adam, who Vicky feels the closest too, but Adam treats her like a child just when Vicky feels like finally growing up. Confused and curious, Vicky has philosophical discussions with her family and meets Basil, Noberta, and Njord, three dolphins that she can communicate almost telepathically with.I thought this book was very deep and meaningful because it gives a different perspective on life and death. Teenagers 12-16 would probably enjoy this book the most out of any age group."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I've had this on my shelf probably since I was the intended audience: there are pages falling out and the cover is creased. A story about a young woman on the edges of romance, of self-discovery, having to deal with her grandfather's dying, her parents becoming *people* instead of just her parents, and her changing relationships all around. The poetry is really good, the imagery excellent; I can feel the atmosphere she describes and fall into the scenes easily. I reread this book at least once a year - keep it on your bookshelf for yourself as well as any passing youngsters of appropriate age/reading level."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This is just in response to another review that mentioned the Disney remake of this book. It was horrendous and unrecognizable. Disney slashed characters and trivialized the entire book. The powerful impact of Vicky's inner turmoil about her grandfather and life in general is replaced with a stupid boy interest that doesn't come close to the Adam in the book.Side note: I've reread this book countless times and it remains one of my all-time favorites. It never fails to brighten my mood. Great characters and a family that seems too-good-to-be-true and real at the same time."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"A book which deals with the gifted Austin family, A Ring of Endless Light shines with its handling of growing up issues: death, first love, and discovery of your purpose in life. A completely different book from A Wrinkle in Time, but has the same magical quality. Recommended along with A Wrinkle in Time, The Gifted Girls Series, and The Chronicles of Narnia Series."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I first read this book when I was in middle school, and recently re-read it for a 400-level college course on children's literature. When I read this book for the first time, I wasn't overly enthralled with it, but I loved Vicky and felt the pain that she was going through with all the death around her.When I re-read this book, I was astonished at how moving it was. The writing style is superb and the language is like poetry. The pace of the book, while it may be a little slow to younger readers, truly makes you lose yourself in the story. I believe this is a must-read for any age."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"A Ring of Endless Light is a good book till the end. Then it's a great one!

This is a must read book!..."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I read this book back... and I loved every page! It is very sad, though, I cried more than once while reading it. It starts out with Vicky Austin at her friend, Leo's, father's funeral. This is where Vicky first meets Adam Eddington,who works with her brother, John, at the marine biology station, and is doing research on dolphin communication. Later, Zachary Gray, a troubled boy whom Vicky knows from last summer, shows up in his fancy car. Vicky is torn between these three, Adam, whom she really likes, but is treating her like just a child, when it seemed like he really liked her. Zachary, who needs Vicky's support and has attempted suicide. And Leo, who loves Vicky. To make matters worse, her grandfather is dying of leukimia and probably won't live much longer. BUt then Vicky, discovers she has the ability to communicate telepathicly with dolphins, and with the help of Adam, and Basil, the summer looks as if it might turn out okay after all. But then, something happens, and it looks like nothing will ever be right again.... THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK!

Though L'Engle's style takes a few chapters to get used to, this is an amazing book. The characters and the plot are so real you never know what will happen next."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This book deserved way more than just 5 stars. Madeleine L'Engle used symbolism and metaphors to represent life and death. She brought it out in the open in terms everyone could understand. She made the characters so realistic that when they felt pain, you felt it as well. I have read this book mulitple times and still tear up every time. This book is amazing and it keeps you reading and makes you think about the events going on in the world around you."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I thought this book was pretty mature for the average twelve year old, but wove a tremendous story concerning a girl and her confusion of life, death, and everything in between. When Vicky Austin hits the realization of death after a friend of the family passes away, she is ponderous over what life means and how life always works itself out. Meanwhile, she must care for her ailing grandfather, watch out for her three siblings, and get involved in the lives of three very different boys. Madeline L'Engle is an incredible author, and describes the twists of today's world in a very unique way."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"\\"A Ring of Endless Light\\" is a book everyone can relate to, especally teens. It gave me a new understanding of life and death. The characters all have so much dimention. Vikky Austion learns so much about life."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Dolphins have taught us many new ways of communication, thinking, and learning about what's around us. But to Vicky Austin, dolphins have taught much more. The lesson they teach her is something that she will never forget. A lesson that takes most people a life time to discover; something that has baffled scientists for years. The lesson of life and death.Vicky has a gift. A rare ability, that comes with her beautiful sense of poetry. She can communicate with dolphins. And because of Madeleine L'Engle's poetic and descriptive writing style, Vicky's blessing seems to come alive. This is one of the most powerful elements of the book because it has such an effect on the reader's view of the plot.Another contribution to the novel's effectiveness is the characterization. L'Engle does a fine job of creating diverse and interesting characters that almost anyone can identify with. Take for example the character Zachary. Zachary is your average \\"bad boy\\" stereotype. But because of Zachary's luxurious but troubled childhood, this characteristic that he seems to have is really a mask that only Vicky can see through. Zachary's character plays an interesting role in the book by teaching Vicky that some people are not always truly as they seem.Packed with detailed descriptive writing and interesting plot elements, A Ring of Endless Light is a must read. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a desire to read a heart-warming tale of self-discovery. Read it and experience for yourself the beauty of the sea."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This book is the best.

The ending made me cry. All I can say now is, read this book and you won't regret it. (( I recommend it to Pre-Teens and Teens ))"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"How?! I want to know where L'Engle gets her ideas. This book captured and enthralled me from page one. The three boys, all going for Vicky (I liked this because I will never know how that really feels), the Grandfather plot that was forever making me cry, and Adam's dolphins were masterfully and seamlessly put together. To give a brief and inadequate synopsis, the Austins summer on Seven Bay Island, where Vicky's grandfather is dying. Vicky has three different loves/lovers, none of which are truly mutual in the same way. She is introduced to the dolphins as part of a project of Adam Eddington's, from _Arm of the Starfish_. Through them and her grandfather, Vicky learns to accept death and enjoy life while she has it. Okay, I know that probably sounded ridiculous, but I mean it: this book is excellent! It may be a little too mature for young children with the themes and stuff, so it's not something to jump to from _A Wrinkle in Time_. I read it for the first time in 6th grade. I'm in 8th grade now, and I could go on reading it almost indefinitely!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This book was all together pretty good.

This book is one of the many books by Madeline L' Engle. This book goes along with the Disney movie called A Ring of Endless Light.I read this book after I saw the movie.

She is visiting her grandfather on Seven Bay Island. Vicky Goes to Second Bay Stables to ride horses. It is a Newbery Honor Book.In this book one person dies, and a female dolphin gives birth to her first pup (a dolphin baby). One of the characters can talk with the dolphins so they can communicate. All in all A Ring of Endless Light is a good book, but I thought it was very boring.If you like Madeline L'Engle I would suggest you read it, but I if have never read a book by her should read A Wrinkle in Time, first."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"My Little girl is right in the middle of this book and she loves it!

A beautiful, elegant book."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Written by one of the twentieth century's most insightful authors, the Newbery honor winning book A Ring of Endless Light tells a story that delves into painful issues yet soars with familial, vocational, and artistic joy.Sixteen-year-old Vicki loses a friend to death at the beginning of the book, copes with her beloved grandfather's terminal illness, and dates three very different young men during a summer spent on an East coast island. She learns to swim with dolphins and luxuriates in metaphysical poetry as she works on her own writing.By weaving in the words of the great 17th century metaphysical poets and other noteworthy authors, this book is a literary treat that moves at a fast 20th century pace toward its conclusion. Vicki must choose life or death, as both forces press upon her from unexpected directions. Readers in grief, involved in dating relationships, and interested in mystics, poetry or marine biology will especially enjoy this story."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"When I first looked at the book-i fell in love with the original cover. it's now one of my favorite books and the thing i enjoyed most about it was that it wasn't just about romance-it was dealing with death but most of all-adolescence in a way that most novels can't capture the essence of this vital period"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I read this book the first time when I was in junior high school. I loved it then, and read it a number of times.I recently picked up a copy for my own daughter. I re-read the book, and this happened to be soon after the death of a very important family member. The book explores death and how it affects a family in a very positive way. I found it actually helped me deal with my own grief - not something I expected when I started to read it.As a child, I adored this book. As an adult, I have an even greater respect for the philosophies in it.I can see now, from the perspective of a few years, that this book really did help me develop my own spiritual beliefs and understandings. It's a very meaty story, but don't let that deter you.

You obtain some intangible thing at the end. A Ring of Endless Light is such.Most of Madeleine L'Engle's novels seem to strike a chord inside. When I read I can see L'Engle trying desperately to show you something that means a lot to her. I enjoy authors who really work at teaching you just a bit of their knowledge.The character of Vicky Austin is very empowered. She feels the frustration, anger and confusion that all those who grow-up do. Unlike most teenage heroines she comes from a \\"good background\\". I would say her parents gave goals and limitations, and even while trying her wings she has duties to her family. L'Engle knows the healing power of good honest work.Vicky is almost-sixteen and is maturing fast. The summer holds many pains but only Vicky can provide the love and joy. Grandfather, whom you grow to love and admire, has leukemia and the Austins have gone to the stable/house on the beach for his last summer.Adam, a friend of Johns, works at the marina. He gains Vicky's respect and admiration . His project on dolphins takes an unexpected turn when he takes Vicky to meet Basil a wild bottle nosed dolphin. He becomes something sure in Vicky's spinning summer.Adam isn't the only one that wants Vicky's attention, in fact his affections seem more condescending then Leo or Zachary's. Leo is drawn to her in the strong binds of pain and fear. Vicky loves him first for his father and then later for himself, though the love is merely (if friendship is ever 'merely') that of a fellow life traveler thrown together. Leo wishes for more but waits.Zachary, dashing, dangerous and deathly maddens \\"Vicky-O\\" with his brushes with death and his obsession of the jaded. Vicky seems compelled to \\"bear another's cross\\" for him. Going through pain himself the two clearly demonstrates the ways people deal with the unknown.L'Engle writes in a passionate, attached way. She sees so much in what seems to be so little. At first it comes over as over dramatic but as Vicky's Grandfather says 'there are no consequences'. So shouldn't a trail of events be observed. Madeleine's view of death, horror and pain is of one very young. She brings out the smaller points till you feel they overcome the larger. Highlighting a need for a thing we must give to receive. I believe the feeling is a want for God, though she does not put that in her book.Her poems are haunting, she entwines them into her writing till it engulfs you. The way she brings events around till everything is connected is wonderful.A gripping, thought provoking look at life through the eyes of it's alive. A Ring of Endless Light gives hope and joy if you know how to interpret it."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Vicky Austin is almost 16-years-old and her life is rather complicated. She is spending her summer at the beach, a place that many would seem to be paradise. Her grandfather is dying from Leukemia and no one knows how much time he has left. Also for once in her life, Vicky has gained the attention of not only one but three very different boys. One is Leo, an old friend of Vicky who is looking for more than friendship. Another is Zachary, a wild and ambitious teenager. Being around Zachary is a thrill, but sometimes it can be terrifying. And then she meets Adam, a new and intelligent boy with a passion for Marine Biology. When Adam introduces her to the dolphins he is working with she feels a connection with them, a wholeness that she has never experienced before. She can't really understand it but it's almost as if she can speak with them. In a summer where life is anything but simple Vicky must realize who she is and follow her heart to find out who she cares for the most.This book has a lot of levels to it. On the surface is a story about life and death, romance and loss. Below that is another story about morals and the existence that there is something beyond us, possibly a God. Many people who read this book might be confused because of this. The reason for his is Disney channel recently created a made-for-TV movie based on this book. Now while it wasn't exactly a horrible made-for-TV movie it was a poor interpretation of the book. The book is not at all like the movie. The character of Vicky is a lot different. She is a strong character with insecurities like the rest of us. Strangely enough I found I could really relate to Vicky more than most other characters I read about, except I swear a lot more. This book is one of Madeline L'Engles best known (because of the movie and the Newbury Award) and one of her greatest. I would highly recommend it to younger readers, teenager readers, and some adult readers."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Vicky Austin, a young girl with the mind of a poet, is absolutely horrified as she watches her Grandfather slowly passing away, when her family visits him for the summer on the beautiful shores of Seven Bay Island. As complicating as that is, she finds that there are 3 boys, each one of them extremely different, vying for her attention. But one of them catches her eye more than the others. Adam Eddington. Adam gives Vicky the chance to work with dolphins, something she's always wanted to do. And she realizes that she, the dolphins, and Adam all share a strange connection. One that will bond them for life. This summer, Vicky will learn the true horrors of death, but also the true power of love and hope.This was one of the best books that I read all year. Vicky is free-spirited, kind, and an extremely relateable character. Madeleine L'Engle created such a masterpiece when she wrote this novel. It's something to treasure for years to come."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I had started this book on a Monday in the middle of August. Less than five days later, I finished it completely! I have been so enthralled with the book because it has helped me greatly to deal with some of the most personal and painful losses in my family. Vicky Austin is basically surrounded by death all summer long, yet she has the luck of being chased by three boys. She's basically one teenager dealing with a number of issues thrusted upon her all at once. I can identify with Vicky, especially the close relationship she shares with her grandfather. By a strange stroke of luck, less than an hour after I finished the book, the movie came on the Disney Channel.Now, if you haven't seen the Disney Channel's version of the book, it's not very faithful (as if any movie could be). However, I would still recommend the movie and the book together because they both deal with the same issues of life and death. No matter how many times I see the movie or read the book, I will always cry when I see Vicky with her grandfather. I will always be reminded of the close relationship I had with my late father."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Madeleine L'Engle has the ability to read my mind and see into my heart. All of the Austin family books are favorites of mine. I was an adult when this book was published, but having been a fan of &quot;The Moon By Night&quot; for many years, I bought it, knowing that even if it didn't come close to the quality of its predecessor, it would still be great. I was wrong; it matched the quality of its predecessor. I imagine I'm not the only reader who thinks Vicky is her soulmate. Or perhaps Madeleine L'Engle is!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"My words cannot describe this book. It is absolutely magnificent. I first read it in ninth grade. I couldn't put it down. Even now, over 2 years later, it's still my favorite book. L'Engle has written a treasure. Everytime I read it, I feel that I've learned something new and special. Every thought, every action in this book is mine. The ending was priceless and perfect...I cannot think of any other way Ms. L'Engle could have ended it. Do not bypass this book whether you are 12, 24, or 40. I guarantee that it will open your mind and warm your heart."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This was either the first (or maybe second, after Wrinkle in Time) Madeleine L'Engle book that I read. And it is also one of my favorites. I've read it twice so far, because I had to go back and read it again after reading the other books about Vicky and the Austins. (Meet The Austins, Moon By Night and Young Unicorns) I will probably read this a couple more times too!This is a fantastic book in all aspects! Vicki's struggles to understand life and death, the story about Grandfather, (truly an amazing man!) etc.This book is also the one (along with another) that gave me the dream of someday swimming with dolphins. The whole dolphin part of the book was incredably interesting and delightful.I definatly reccomend this to any L'Engle fan who hasn't yet read it, and pretty much any teen, especially girls."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"A Ring of Endless LightA Ring of Endless Light is a breath taking book. I couldn't put it down. Other people might not think as highly of it as me, but I thought it to be wonderful.The Austin family is visiting their Grandfather at Seven-Bay-Island. Their Grandfather is dying of a rare cancer disease, and they don't know how to save him. One of their friends has just died and the question is..who will be the next to go?Let's meet the Austins, shall we? There is first, Mom and Dad. It's the mother's father that is dying and she's really upset. Then, Dad. He is a doctor, and he is trying to help Grandfather.For the kids you have John, the oldest. He's working on an ocean animal lab with Adam, a guy friend of Vicky's.Vicky is the older middle child. She has 3 guys running after her. Leo, the old boring one, Zack, the spontaneous dream, and Adam the very best of all. She is working on a very special experiment with him.Suzy is the younger of the middle children and last but not least is Rob the youngest.This book is about Vicky's life and what she goes through on this very special summer. It shows the changes she goes through, the things she learns, and the many obstacles she over comes. This is a wonderful book and it made me want to cry, its no wonder it got a Newberry Award."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"A Ring of Endless Light captured me from the first page, the deep emotions of Vicky, I can relate to, for I've lost my grandfather, but the death of a child in your arms is unthinkable. This book isn't a totally fun book, but it has a slight touch of romance and it is definately unpredictable. After reading it I found myself writing a little poetry myself, which I have done before, just not that often. This book has also given me a burning desire to finish a novel I have started writing. Madeline L'engle is a great author and the description of the dolphins in this book is exemplory. The ending of the book is a teer jerker, but is described immensly better than the dolphins, if that be possible. The darkness in it puts a vivid picture in your immagination, which kept me awake the night I finished it. Though it not be a very cheerul book the entire time I definately recommend it to all readers ,above fifth grade, the situations may be dull, to anyone younger, or it may not make much sense. This book also pocesses some great poetry which I greatly enjoyed. I will definately read this book more than once."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I've read &quot;A Ring of Endless Light&quot; twice and each time I feel the sensational subconcious power in it; that makes it a success. Everyone who reads this book will be instantly drawn into the confused adolescent world of nearly 16 year old Vicky Austin. As she &quot;grows&quot; wiser in the story, so did I . The content is so vivid, that it paints a picture in my mind. I've read some other of Madeleine L'Engle's books, but I think that this one was the best. No other non-L'Engle books I've read can compare to the vivid reality of &quot;A Ring of Endless Light&quot; either. This book is an inspirational read to me, so I suggest that anyone who likes deep thinking should read it."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 12 or 13 and absolutely miserable about the death of my grandfather and about life in general. I read the sonnet L'Engle wrote in the book about the death of a dolphin until I had it memorized. The book also mentions other 17th century poets, like John Donne and Henry Vaughn. After I finished &quot;A Ring of Endless Light,&quot; I started reading all those poets and trying to write poems of my own. This book made me feel better about life and my faith in God and gave me hope that I could have a better future. I reread it whenever I need to be reminded."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"i would rate this as higher than a ten if i could.The first time i read this book, i was in sixth grade. i'm in eighth grade now and i've read literally about twenty times since then. this is the kind of book that makes you want to be IN it, and you kind of wonder what the characters are doing now...myself, i was kind of sad when the book ended because i liked it so much that i wanted it to go on...but &quot;art is never finished, it just stops at an interesting place&quot;...this truly is art...madeleine l'engle ROCKS and this is probably my favorite of her books, actually my favorite book in the world.and the whole thing about dolphin-human communication is so plausible i wanted to try it myself...i love dolphins, though i've never gotten to hang around one for very long. Vicky's poetry and her friendship with adam and with the dolphins and with her dying grandfather help her get through a time when she's questioning the whole fact of being, when she feels surrounded by death and is trying to find a sense to existence, when it seems like her world is somewhat crashing down (i've certainly felt like that!), and when she isn't quite sure where she belongs in the span of her life.i've talked for a long while now but it's so nice to be able to rave about something you love. i really identified with the heroine of the story. an truly awesome book.PS-- after Troubling a Star, are there any new books with vicky in them??"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This is probably my favorite book by one of my favorite authors. I enjoyed it when I first read it at 15, and I enjoy it now that I am 25. I love the part about the girl who can communicate with dophins--I also love the romance and the true-to-life problems of a coming of age girl"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"And that should tell you what I thought right there. &quot;A Ring of Endless Light&quot; is basically, and we're talking extremely basic here, about one girl (Vicky Austin) and her struggle over one summer to understand death and other people. Her grandfather is dying, one of her family's friends just died, a little girl dies in her arms. Plus she has three guys vying (sp?) for her attention, one the guy who is basically responsible for the death of the family friend, one who is the son of the family friend, and one who worked with the family friend. Little bit complicated here, but read the book and you'll understand. I would suggest that you read a few other books first--it's not necessary, I didn't read them first, but you'll understand it better--they will give you a better idea of who the characters are and why they act the way they do, especially Adam. &quot;A Wrinkle in Time,&quot; (all these are by Madeleine L'Engle, incidentally)&quot;Meet the Austins,&quot; &q! uot;The Arm of the Starfish,&quot; &quot;The Moon by Night,&quot; &quot;The Young Unicorns,&quot; &quot;A Swiftly Tilting Planet,&quot; and &quot;A Wind in the Door.&quot; The great thing about L'Engle's books are that they almost all are tied together by one or more characters. Start with &quot;A Wrinkle..&quot;, then go to &quot;Swiftly Tilting..&quot;, then &quot;A Wind..&quot;, then &quot;Meet the Austins..&quot; then either&quot;Moon by Night..&quot; or &quot;Arm of the Starfish&quot; (they take place at the same time) then &quot;Young Unicorns&quot; THEN read &quot;A Ring of Endless Light&quot;. It will make so much more sense to you. And if you liked all of those, read &quot;Troubling a Star&quot; after &quot;A Ring..&quot; It's a definite sequel about Adam and Vicky the fall after &quot;A Ring..&quot; takes place. If you followed all of the that, I hope you enjoy this book--it's totally awesome."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I don't even know how many years it has been since I first read this book, but it remains, after more than 15 years, one of my favorite books. I have read and re-read most of L'Engle's work, but this is one of my favorites. It is a wonderful book about accepting pain and loss and finding joy through the darkness. Vicky is a character that most young girls can relate to, and her difficult journey into adulthood is very realistic. I learned so much from this book growing up, and I still learn from it every time I read it."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I thought this book was pretty mature for the average twelve year old, but wove a tremendous story concerning a girl and her confusion of life, death, and everything in between. When Vicky Austin hits the realization of death after a friend of the family passes away, she is ponderous over what life means and how life always works itself out. Meanwhile, she must care for her ailing grandfather, watch out for her three siblings, and get involved in the lives of three very different boys. Madeline L'Engle is an incredible author, and describes the twists of today's world in a very unique way."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"15-year-old Vicky Austin is visiting her grandfather with her family. Only they aren't there for pure fun. Vicky's grandfather is expected to die soon of leukemia, and she and her family want to spend all the time they can with him. During her stay, Vicky has three guys visiting with her. Zachary, a rich guy that &quot;couldn't live without Vicky&quot; was on the verge of suicide. Leo, the son of a coast guard that just died is facing some difficult problems. Adam, who most of the time just looks at Vicky as John's kid-sister introduces Vicky to some dolphins that he is studying in marine biology. As Vicky struggles with the pain of facing death, she finds that she can always forget her problems when spending some time playing with some dolphin friends. Madeleine L'Engle is an excellent author and her view of dealing with death and the power of love is amazing."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I have read all of Madeleine L'engle's books for teens and I can say that without a doubt, this book is the best of them all. I love of of Madeline L'engle's books, but this one is exceptional. I have always been in love with the idea of swimming with dolphins, and this book made it seem like a very real possibilty. Madeleine Lengle made Vicky's grandfather's impending death seem very real, and I am glad of that because I can share Vicky's lose. If you get the chance you should read not only this book, but all of Madeleine L'engle's works."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This is a great example of the wonderful books of Madeleine L'engle! If you haven't read this book i strongly suggest you do. Through all of Vicky's misfortunes she is blessed. My favorite thing about this book is the relationship she has with Adam. It makes me kinda of jealous yet I feel dazed when I read about it. This book brought tears to my eyes yet it also gave me opportunities to laugh. I have read this 5 times in my life and I don't plan to stop. Every time I time I read it I can't put it down. If you did enjoy this book, read on with Troubling A Star also by L'engle. It is just as great and won't let you put it down for a second."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"L'Engle does a superb job exploring the complex world of relationships, death, and the life of an adolescent girl. I cannot recommend it any more highly."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"The first time I read this book in the fifth grade I felt possibly as frustrated as the heroine. I was pissed on her behalf at the world of problems and especially at the way every other adult figure kept trying to tell her what to do. A couple of weeks ago I picked up this book with the intention of clearing out my books of youth and ended up re-reading it. And was amazed. The book was so different in examination from every other book Madeleine had written I must have been thrown off course as a child. Reading it now, however, makes me realize just how true to the teenage psyche this book is. The plot is amazingly sensitive and the characters well-developed. And those dolphins still afford the same feeling of peace and serenity they did in my memory. Truly a book every child should read."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"If you're looking for a book that has a great plot and intriguing characters, then this is it. Vicky Austen is having a problem with death going on all around her...a darkness that seems to want to swallow her whole. She finds refuge within Adam, one of the three boys who are interested in her, and his project with dolphins. Then, when the darkness finally seems to swallow her, she returns to the dolphins, and Adam, who fight to bring her back into the light, to take her place as a light-bearer. I loved it so much I bought it to read over and over again!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Nearly 20 years old, this is still my absolute favorite book. L'Engle write with prose that feels like poetry--this is L'Engle at her best. And even though this book is part of a series, it can be read and understood on its own, or read in context with the other Austin family books. I have never had a book touch me quite as deeply as this one. I highly recommend it to young teens, old teens, and even adults. Vicky's struggles and insecurities touch the reader on many levels--on subjects such as death, prayer, relationships, and family.This is a book I plan to keep and give to the children I might have someday. I can't come up with words strong enough to express how powerful this book is. Read it for yourself. Enjoy."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Vicky Austin's character in all of Madeleine L'Engle's other's books with her has been mature. But in this book Vicky-O grows miles. Her deep relationship with her grandfather really made me cherish the relationship I have with family. It also really makes you feel her joy when she swims with Basil the dolphin. The parts in the book I like the best are when Vicky's with Adam Eddington, and the electric tension between her and Zachary Gray. I rate this book the highest possible. Madeleine L'Engle once again relates with young adults about issues that really matter to them."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This is a very awsome book. I think it's one of Madeline L'engles best. This book is very thought provoking and full of clear detail. I really loved it!!!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This is one of Madeleine's best books. I like it because the girl is torn between all of these boys and she begins to care what other people think instead of listening to herself. I read this book when I was 11 and I've read it twice ever since. Now I'm 13 and I still love it."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This book is way cool! I love L'Engle's writing style.

She is my favorite author!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This book is expressed in such detail its easy to imagine the characters and the places in the book. The plot is romantic and enjoyable, and brings a hole new meaning to life. And you can be 12 to enjoy it (like me)."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"It was written with such clarity, I thought I knew her. The issues that she brought up were important, and with the different charactars arguging about it- well I think it is the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I absolutely loved this book!!!! I really enjoyed how Vicky worked w/ the dolphins, and found that extra sense that she had. I also loved the love story that L'Engle developed between Vicky and Adam. It kept me reading always wanting to know what happened. I thought this was a fabulous wonderful book, and will recommend it to many people!!!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I think that a Ring of Endless Light is a terrific story with a lot of reality to it.Vicky is a teenager much like many teens of the 90's. The book is confusing (less so if you read others first.) but worth the time and effort. The charactors are great and so is the story. If you read this book I would definitely suggest Troubling A Star, also by Madeleine L'engle. Both books are for higher level readers and thinkers."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I read this book when i was 12. I first looked at how long it was.

It's now my favorite book!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Vicky Austin is so much like me. She is caring, sweet, and at times a little overwhelmed yet she is optimistic about life. She loves to read and write, like me. And she doesn't know where life is going to take her, but she follows the path with compassion and trust. She doesn't know if she can make all of the right choices but she never let go of her dreams. I nominate this book for the high-ratings club! A True One Of A Kind! Thumbs up to Mrs. L'Engle!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Two boys are vying for Vicky's attention, but Vicky likes Zachary.

But will the sorrow death, which seems to hang constantly, get the best of her? This is an excellent, sensitively written book with the depth and thought-provoking reading that only Madeline L'Engle can master. It is deep, wondeful, and the only reason I gave four, not five stars is because some of the dating scenes get a little \\"strange\\"--not suggestive at all, but still, unusual for this kind of book. Indeed, it has mature themes, and I wouldn't reccomend it for YOUNG readers, but every teen--even boys--should read this. It's magnificent. P.S. IM REALLY 15 BUT THE ADULT FORM IS BROKEN :)"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"At school we read the book A Wrinkle in Time. I hadn't known that Madeline Lengale had written any other books!. this book was definatley one of my very very very favorite books!!! Its about an not-quite-sixteen-year-old named Vicky Austin who moves to where her grandfather, who has leukemia, lives.She has three boys, or young men after her, not like stalking, but who want her as their girlfriend. theres Leo who she thinks is still growing up, but a great friend, Zachary who is sophisticated, but quite frightening, but who depends on her, and theres Adam, who is her older brother Johns friend. Adam invites her to help him with an expeirament that hes doing with dolphins, Vicky learns that she has something special, a way to communicate, I'm not going to say much more because I dont want to give anything away, but Adam treats her as if shes still a child. I would recomend this book for ages 10 and up. Any one around this age, I have Three, and only three very important words for you, READ THIS BOOK!!!!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Madeline L'Engle is a fabulous author, and A Ring of Endless Light is one of her best. Vicky Austin is a part of all of us, we have all suffered her trials. She handles death and pain with a grace that I someday would hope to posess."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Interesting how l'Engle's sci-fi books are her best known, and the Austin Family Chronicles got left behind. I was never attracted to the former, but EROL appealed to me greatly, so much so that I still recall it today, at age 53. In fact, I'm going to look for it for my daughter whose second language is English. Just a great, all-'round YA novel."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This is one of my favorite books. Has been since I was a child and continues to be so today. It's beautifully written, has some strong messages, and is very relatable, especially for teenage girls (of which I was one when I first started loving the book). It's actually a part of a series, but is easily a stand alone book. If you want more background on the characters, it might be better to start with the first book though.Vicky Austin and her family have come to their grandpa's home on an island to spend the summer with him. He is dying of leukemia and while it's a tough time for all, they know where it is supposed to be. While on the island, a friend of theirs, Captain Rodney, suffers a heart attack while rescuing a boy from a capsized sailboat. His death, combined with their grandfather's deterioration sets a pall on the whole island. When Vicky learns that the teenage boy rescued is a friend from the past, that just adds to the confusion. And if she didn't have enough with that, Captain Rodney's son, Leo is interested in her as well. The third boy she encounters, Adam, likes her for the help she provides with his dolphin project, but keeps her at an arm's length, unwilling to trust her. All of these feelings are bubbling inside Vicky and there just doesn't seem to be a fair outlet.Vicky is a very relatable protagonist. She has her normal problems, and while I didn't have three boys ever after me at once, I feel like I could be her sometimes. She's more of a dreamer than a scientist, and loves to write. For the three boys, I didn't really care much for Leo, he didn't add anything. Zach made a good source for problems throughout the book. And Adam, Adam is a good guy, and I've read some of the other books with him in it so I was already a little attached to him. He's my favorite out of the three anyway. I like Vicky's parents too; they are calm and insightful and add a lot to the story.When we get right down to it this book has a lot of romance in it as Vicky shares time with the three boys. But there is nothing inappropriate, and Vicky is strong enough to set her limits with all of them. The real theme of this book is sorrow and death, and learning to accept the inevitability's of life. I really like the message carried throughout and even though there is an undertone of religion in the book, it is done very well and doesn't seem preachy in the least. I also like the incorporation of poetry and think that L'Engle always makes good choices in the verses she includes in her books. I also like the sub-plot with the dolphins and Vicki's interactions with them. It was an interesting concept and one that was completely believable to me.Definitely one of my favorite books. I would always recommend it, and many other works by L'Engle.A Ring of Endless LightCopyright 1980324 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2012"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I can see why a lot of people love A Ring of Endless Light by Madeleine L'Engle, but I didn't particularly enjoy it myself. The Book follows almost 16-yr-old Vicky at a crossroads in her life. The story is plain and straight forward, and there is no plot. The characters are complex and real. The focus of the book is on the emotional turmoil of an adolescent girl dealing with the issues of growing up and coping with the complicated challenges we all deal with at one time or another, with a religious slant. Typically I love books that show the inner turmoil and resolution of people as they deal with challenges, but for some reason, this book didn't strike a chord with me.There are 3 main themes throughout the book.The first, and possibly most expansive, is death. The story starts at a funeral of a family friend, The grandfather is dying of Leukemia, Everyone seems to have someone close to them that has died and is still trying to cope with it, not to mention some accidents, and a manic, possibly suicidal love interest. Through out the book different members of the family and other characters philosophize about what death means. While this is understandable that they would think about death so much with the beloved grandfather dying, To me it came across as overly preachy. L'Engle doesn't give the reader the freedom to try and make sense of it themselves, but reiterates the same points time and time again (though with different symbols/terminology) in dialogue from various characters. Perhaps the point she is trying to make is too important to her to leave it to the readers? I just felt like it was a little too much, and while thought provoking, left none for the reader to philosophize for themselves.Second, Vicky has become the love interest of 3 young men. One is the son of the deceased family friend, One a semi-boyfriend from last summer, and one a colleague of her brother's who is studying dolphins.The family friend wants to be more than friends, but Vicky does not. The semi-boyfriend, who is manic and unpredictable, wants Vicky, but Vicky doesn't know if she wants him. The colleague is the one Vicky wants, but does he want her? Sorting this all out is a major portion of the book. I appreciate that even though the semi-boyfriend wants to get more physical, Vicky doesn't go for it. While there is some alluding to the subject, it's not done in a sensual way- the focus is on Vicky's confusion between feeling excited, and being true to herself. I myself did not enjoy it, but I can see the benefit of it, where these are issues that many girls may face these days. It may be beneficial for them to see Vicky's struggles with the issue, and her conclusions.The third theme is the dolphins themselves, and Vicky learning that she can communicate with them. This was the best part of the book for me. I felt it was not overdone, making the dolphins into some kind of fairytale magical creature. Rather, she portrayed the dolphins as a society that can communicate and feel, and help heal emotions. I think that she could have spent a little more time here, and a little less on the other themes, but perhaps that's just me.The ending showed a climax in all the themes, I felt that the emotional turmoil was well done, but the resolution of that seemed. . . rushed and a little unauthentic. It left something wanting somehow for me.In short, the themes may be too strong for those much younger than the main character (about 16), and if you enjoy books that focus on emotion, relationships, and religious philosophy, this may be a good book for you. If you would rather figure things out yourself or like more action-y books, this may not be for you. It may also be a good tool to open up dialogue with a youth about such things as death, and relationships.As a side note, there are a few instances of religious exclamations toward the end of the book, probably 4-5 in total."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"In high school, I probably would have flown through additional books about Vicky with as much fervor as readers today were sucked into each new Harry Potter book. Sadly, as an adult, I instead found myself a little impatient with Vicky in A Ring of Endless Light. Her family loves her. Two boys have been attracted to her. And, at the end of The Moon by Night, she knew who she was. Forgive me if I thought that A Ring of Endless Light, present a more mature Vicky. Yet Vicky is not quite sixteen. She is facing a funeral for the first time. She's also facing death upfront and personal for the first time, in that her grandfather is dying of leukemia. And then there's the dilemma of boys. Now she has three suitors! Leo, the son of old friend Commander Rodney, needs her in the face of his father's death. Zachary is back, having flirted with suicide and needing her help holding the broken pieces of his life together. And then there's new boy Adam, a friend of John, who asks for her help with--of all things--dolphin research. A previous love interest, Andy, has dropped out of the picture with no explanation. Despite my moments of impatience with Vicky, I still do like A Ring of Endless Light. Vicky has finally found a talent: creative writing. Adam turns out to be someone with whom she might just develop her first serious relationship. And throughout her encounters with death and love, Vicky must explore even more deeply what it means to live a life in God. For example, what does it mean to choose between light and dark? What burdens should we accept as servants of God? What is the purpose of prayer? And how much exactly does God involve Himself in our lives? Vicky faces a lot of choices in A Ring of Endless Light. The culmination of those choices makes for my favorite part of the book."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I have the whole Austin family Series, and this book happens to be the one I just keep wanting to read over and over.I reccommend this to ANYONE!L'Engle at her best!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This book is written on the first person's view, probably due to author's purpose to expose the main character's feeling as scenes develop. Vicky Austin, turning 16 on the end of the year, starts to get confused as the thought of death starts to leak in her life between boys. The Austins are spending their time at the grandpa's house, to spend as much time as they can with their beloved family member.The thought of death started with the actual death of Commander Rodney, occurring while saving a teenager from a suicide. At the funeral, a woman next to them whispers \\"wonder who will be the next to go?\\" And it made Vicky shiver. Later on, she learns teenager who tried to suicide was the rich boy who she didn't like. Why confusing? Let me tell you. Commander Rodney's son, Leo Rodney, knows it was Zachary (rich boy who Vicky didn't like) and he wants to stay with her and be the \\"FRIEND\\" to her. In addition, her brother's friend, Adam, who is working on his project with dolphins, wants her for her amazing poetic mind to communicate with dolphins.So three boys want a piece of her, doing every \\"normal\\" date activities to satisfy her confused mind. Zachary takes her to a luxurious country club and expensive Italian restraints, while Leo has a walk together. Adam, on the other hand, doesn't go on saying \\"do you realize I am doing a lot of things for you?\\" like Zachary or Leo. He just go to the beach with her and instruct her some things for her project, and yet, Vicky likes him.When you get close to the end, you will see more of \\"grandfather\\" than \\"boy friend\\" because things turn to grandfather. He bleeds, he fails to recognize Vicky, and call her Caro, his long-dead wife. To add more tension, he had to be put in the hospital later because of internal bleeding. It doesn't say he died in the book, but it does share Vicky choosing Adam for her \\"friend\\".A Ring of Endless Light is a well written book, and yet, it is only one out of Chronos (The Austin Family Chronicles) series. Madeleine ventured though her career starting from 1918 to 2007, mostly writing books about Christian faiths and science-related. Her famous Chronos series are: Meet the Austins (1960), The Moon by Night (1963), The Young Unicorns (1968), A Ring of Endless Light (1980, Newbery Honor Book), The Anti-Muffins (1980), The Twenty-four Days Before Christmas (1984)Troubling a Star (1994), and A Full House: An Austin Family Christmas (1999).A Ring of Endless Light is the only one I read, though, I'm sure I will read the other of the series with easy as this one."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Vicky Austin knows that this will be her last summer on Seven Bay Island with her beloved grandfather, because the scholarly retired clergyman is dying of a fast-moving form of leukemia. 15-year-old Vicky stands on the dividing line between childhood and adulthood. As a budding poet, she promises to retain childhood's heightened and sometimes painful sensitivities even after she crosses that border. That's a bond she shares with her grandfather, but not with the rest of her loving yet far more scientifically inclined family.Complicating this already trying time for Vicky are three young men. Leo, a lifelong friend of her family, wants more from her than the companionship and sympathy she is ready to offer him. Zachary, a severely troubled and wealthy youth who was her first real boyfriend, follows her to Seven Bay Island and alternately charms and frightens her with attentions that her family would prefer she didn't accept. And Adam, her older brother John's friend from MIT, assumes an important place in her life when he discovers that Vicky's extraordinary (and unexpected, and unexplained) ability to communicate with dolphins can transform his summer project at the Island's oceanographic research station.While Vicky's romantic and other feelings for this trio are central to the story, this is not a conventional tale of young love in which the girl's choice of suitor is the whole point. Vicky Austin is a complete person, and not about to treat romance at age 15 as the be-all and end-all of her life so far; nor as the defining influence on her future. Until now she has been something of a misfit, with her physician father and scientifically inclined older brother and younger sister tech-talking over her head. This summer, finally, \\"dreamy Vicky\\" who often slips away to write verses comes into her own. Which, as so often happens in real life, can only occur as she is tested by life. And by death, and by her responses to both.L'Engle at her finest! Although I'm of grandmotherly years now, \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" was among my own girlhood's defining books. I must now go out and find the rest of the Austin books. This writer's works have something to offer any reader, not just youthful ones.--Nina M.

All of Ms. L'Engle's books are amazing, but this one is my personal favorite. Vicky Austin, star of two previous books, has hit the hardest summer of her life. Her beloved grandfather, who is an absolutely amazing person, is dying of leukemia, and she has to come to terms with this. Enter three young men, all with their own experiences of death: Leo, whose father had died; Zachary, whose mother had died; and Adam from _The Arm of the Starfish_, who watched as someone he cared for was shot. Vicky hears their stories and has to come up with her own way to deal with dying. And this is only half of it. A previous reviewer didn't like the ending, but it was one of my favorite parts. The book as a whole is a testament to humanity's ability to see the whole of things, not one part. Like another previous reviewer, I would recommend this book to the 13-plus age group, rather than the fifth or sixth grade level the book has been given. One of the perfect pieces of children's literature."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Hi ya'll! First of all, A Ring of Endless Light is a simply great book by Madeline L'Engle, probably her best book. It's about not-quite-sixteen Vicky Austin, who in one summer finds out about life, death, and love. She finds herself the attention of three boys. Leo is a fried longing for more than friendship, but becoming more of a friend than ever to Vicky. Zachary is sophisticated, rich, and gorgeous to boot. However, he has a dark, maniacal side, that flirts with death. He pleads to Vicky that he needs her, but she's not so sure. Adam is a friend of her older brother John, nineteen. He's doing a project with dolphins, and Vicky is excited to help. She begins to think of Adam as more of a friend, but he just acts as though she were a child. Death seems to be erupting everywhere to Vicky. Commander Rodney, Leo's father had died, Zachary's mother died, her grandfather's health is deteriating, and an awful tragedy suddenly brings Vicky's life to a halting stop. She has held Death in her hands, literally, and her consciousness just fell apart. Only one thing can save her, the light, the ring of pure and endless light from the dolphins. This is an amazing book by Madeline L'Engle, and is one of my all-time favorites. Coming from me, that's really something. L'Engle fans are sure to love this, as well as anyone who enjoys a thoughtful, serious, well-written book. Read it!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"A Ring of Endless Light has got to be one of my all time favorite books! If you've read Meet the Austins then you already know the characters, but for those of you who haven't, it's about a girl named Vicky Austin who has moved with her family into her grandfather's house because he is sick and they want to be with him when he,well,dies. At her new location Vicky meets Adam, her older brother's friend from work. Adam is studying dolphins and soon, Vicky gets to be apart of his project where she meets Basil, a wild dolphin. Vicky also re-unites with Zach, a rich boy who is not happy with his life. When Zach tries to commite suicide and ends up causing the death of a local life gaurd, Vicky must begin to face death, and heart ache.This is a wonderfully dramatic book that will keep you in tears, and in smiles. If you like dolphins, I gaurantee you will love this book. I've read it many times at the library already and now I'm buying it. This book is dramatic, sad, heart-wrenching, yet at the same time, fun and interesting. This is a must-read book! One of L'Engles best!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This was the first book I had ever read by this author and it was certainly the best book I have ever read. I know that the age is 9-12 but I am 14(almost 15) and I loved it. The main character, Vicky Austin, is sort of torn between three young men while she is also suffering from the hurt with her grandfather being very ill. Leo is an old friend, but he wants more than friendship while Vicky only wants that of him. Zachary is troubled and he feels he needs Vicky. Adam works with her brother John and is conducted an experiment with dolphins and he wants Vicky to be a part of it, but he treats her as a child. She is confused with life...and death.Madeleine L'Engle shows her knowledge in science skills as well as in literature through this excellent book. I really hope this inspires you to read this book at any age!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I've found comfort and happiness, as well as sorrow and hope in this beautiful novel. I've read so many books since I first picked this up in ninth grade, but this has always remained my favorite. It's the only book I've ever read that I take something new out of everytime. The story of Vicky and her summer of confusion and light begins in death and ends in death, but L'Engle celebrates both life and death in a convincing and realistic way. Throughout the book, we also get snatches of fascinating scientific ideas, religious views, and other interesting trivia that L'Engle manages to weave in and parallel to Vicky's life. In my opinion, this book far surpasses &quot;A Wrinkle in Time.&quot; A must-read for anyone, anytime, any age, anywhere."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"One of L'Engle's BestA Ring of Endless Light is one of my favourite books. What intially attracted me to it was the fact that it was written by L'Engle. I had just finished A Wrinkle in Time and A Swiftly Tilting Planet, and I thought it was another story about the Murrys and the O'Keefes. Boy, was I wrong. This book is about the Austin's summer on Seven Bay Island; mostly about Vicky's romantic encounters with the three boys, Zachary, Adam and Leo. During all the confusion of Vicky's estranged love life, the book deals with death, hatred, family and it wouldn't be a L'Engle book without a little supernatural stuff.This book deals with big things during a teenager's life, and I highly reccomend it to any teenager or former-teenager. This book can be read without reading Meet The Austins or The Moon By Night ( I did it), but reading the first two books give it more meaning. This is a VERY good book.Also recommended: Anything by Madeleine L'Engle, and The Only Alien on the Planet by Kristen D. Randle"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I loved this book and I would recommend it to girls from the ages 10 and up. This was a good story to connect to your life or the lives of the people around you. The things that happen to Vicky in A Ring of Endless Light might happen or may have happened to the reader. Therefore the plot of the story is believable. I would like to read another story by this author because I loved how thorough she was when describing Vicky's thoughts and feelings. When she was explaining how Vicky was seeing only darkness after a friend died in her arms, she painted a very vivid picture in my head. I thought that a Ring of Endless Light was truly a great book."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"A Ring of Endless LightBy Madeleine L'EngleBook ReviewIn Madeleine L'Engle's A Ring of Endless Light, main character Vicky Austin discovers many new aspects of life in a single summer. She is sixteen and already holds many responsibilities. Vicky becomes paralyzed with a fear of death when a close family friend is buried, and even more so when a small child dies in her arms in a hospital waiting room. She eventually discovers, however, that death is simply another part of life, and through new friends and a strong family Vicky stays tough and helps others cope.A Ring of Endless Light is engaging and well written, conveying highly believable emotions to the reader. L'Engle uses poetry and metaphor in an effective manor to express the cruel wonder of the world. Vicky's relationships with her family and friends were believable as well, and overall the format of the book really worked nicely and made you want to continue reading.In the story, Vicky participates in a study her brother's friend Adam is doing on dolphins. These sections of the book were intriguing, because Vicky has the ability to communicate with the dolphins themselves. This kind of communication seems to be a theme throughout the book, but in a spiritual more than \\"science-fictiony\\" way. The ocean also works its way into many of the strongest metaphors of the book, as the house the Austin's stay in is right on the coast.Vicky struggles with relationships throughout the entire book, which adds to the believability of the plot. There are three different \\"young men\\" in her life, all very different. There is Zachary, the wealthy yet troubled boy who wishes to show Vicky a life of country clubs and expensive banquets. Then there is Leo, a sad, slobbery child at heart with more needs than Vicky knows how to attend to. Finally there's Adam, the educated older friend who works at the marine biology station. The three are all connected to her, and most need more than Vicky has to offer.Overall, I found A Ring of Endless Light to be an expertly crafted work, filled with tangled emotions and interesting twists. Love and death entwine each other, and only by reading the book can you find which feelings overcome others. I would recommend this book and others in the series to anyone looking to go on a roller coaster ride of emotions that are not their own, but striking just the same."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Madeleine L'Engle has been honoured by the Newbery Award twice. As many know, she won the 1962 honour for her classic &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot;. Her second honour came as an honourable mention in 1980 for &quot;A Ring of Endless Light&quot;. Reading this book, the only surprise to me is that it did not win the Newbery Award outright. It certainly deserved to.&quot;A Ring of Endless Light&quot; is a deep and complex book about death and its place in life. It is so good that it overshadows the rest of the Austin Family series of novels, particularly &quot;Troubling a Star&quot;, which follows it in the series. Madeleine is very at home here with the characters of the Austins and tells a compelling story of their last summer with their grandfather, who is dying of leukemia.Fifteen-year-old Vicky carries off the story very well as the narrator, getting the reader deeper and more personally involved with the characters. The story of her summer is alternately funny, touching, uplifting and very sad. &quot;A Ring of Endless Light&quot; will hit anybody in the gut who can remember losing their own grandparents. The weight that's placed on Vicky's shoulders throughout the book makes my heart ache.This ache is emphasized by the other events of that summer, with the normally lovelorn Vicky (quite to her shock) finding three men in her life. Not only is she pursued by the staid but sympathetic Leo and the fascinating but dangerous Zachary, but she develops strong feelings for the distant Adam Eddington, a scientist friend of her brother John who enlists her help with his project on communicating with dolphins, and who finds himself being emotionally drawn towards this interesting young woman.Some may think the premise of communicating with dolphins and learning from their spiritual sides to be silly, but Madeleine has the guts to pull it off. Those readers should find more to like, anyway, in Vicky's rapport with Adam, and the shocking personal climax she faces in the final chapters.This book is highly recommended, and one which I'm sure many will cherish."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This book is so touching and real that no matter how many times I read it, I always end up smiling, laughing, or crying with the characters. The book focuses on Vicky Austin, a girl who's just growing up and is dealing with all of the twists and turns that life can take. There's fear, loss, love, fun, and confusion, and all the other things that come along with being almost sixteen. There are themes of life and death, and joy and sorrow. It really makes you think about what's important and about how precious life and love are to all of us. Vicky and her family and friends all seem very real to the reader. None of them is perfect, none of them is all bad, but each of them is unique. They make the book come alive.I absolutely loved A Ring of Endless Light, and I am sure that it will touch the hearts of all readers."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This book is just AMAZING.

She and her family have moved in with her grandfather, who is dying of leukemia. In addition to that trial, Vicky has to choose between three young men: Leo, whom she's known all her life and who can identify with the struggle she's going through with her beloved grandfather; Zachary, the poor little rich boy whom Vicky can't quite figure out; and Adam, the gentle, caring--and yet confusing marine biologist. Join Vicky as she travels the path to adulthood--complete with its disappointments and successes--and learns more about herself and the people around her. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes Madelien L'Engle, and enjoys a good read. It was realistic, and yet had that mysterious element of fantasy that L'Engle is so good at inserting. By all means--read it! You won't regret it."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"After first reading this book a number of years ago, I find myself coming back to it again and again.

It's the story of Vicky Austin's summer, as she struggles with her grandfather's illness, her budding romances, and her friend's death. While it addresses the pain of death, it also celebrates life in the young (Vicky, Rob) and the old (Vicky's grandfather). Vicky is an appealing character; it's easy to identify with someone who, while not necessarily pretty or brilliant, is a daughter and a sister and a teenager. Adam Eddington, who also appears in _The Arm of the Starfish_, is one of my favorite L'Engle creations; he plays a large role in this book.When I read this book, I enjoyed the story and the snatches of poetry that L'Engle quotes.

And after I read the book, I was rather upset with the Disney Channel.Although this is a wonderful novel, I would not recommend it to anyone under the age of thirteen because of some mature content.Lastly, I want to include my frequent rant ( more of a whine, really) about that Zachary Gray person: I never understood why Ms. L'Engle kept putting him in her books. He never changes, and he's just as much of a jerk in \\"An Acceptable Time\\" as he was in this book. I don't know what Vicky sees in him.

This was the first one I discovered and will forever remain my favorite other than A Wrinkle in Time. I related well to Vicky because at the time my father's best friend was dying of Leukemia. Vicky goes through a period of time where she meets Adam, and begins to bond with his dolphins. The unique relationship between her and the dolphins is remarkable as dolphins are amazingly intelligent creatures. Madeleine has done a great job of portraying this family as a regular family as well as adding the mystical feeling of telecommunication."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I liked this book a lot especially after reading &quot;Meet the Austins&quot; and &quot;Troubling a Star.&quot; I am a young reader, and I was able to understand Vikey Austin's views and concerns, being about her age.(A little younger, but that doesn't really matter!!) I love Dolphins a lot and I wish I could have took her place being out in the ocean interacting with the dolphins. I loved this book, and I would definitly recommend reading it. Also, &quot;Meet the Austin's&quot; is great, but I didn't like &quot;Troubling a Star&quot; as much."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This book was absolutely great i loved all of the suspence and all of the metaphors"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Once I started to read this book it grabbed me and wouldn't let me go. The amazing words and the web of confusion is perfect for a good book to read a time when you have a lot of open mind space. This book means many things. It shows you Vicky's feelings and how she is struggling between the three guys. It finally starts building to a climax at the end and you can almost predict the ending. This book is better then some of her other books. You are in the story with her and seeing all that she sees. Overall, best book ever!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"I have never read a book like this before. A book that tells you about life and death, and teaches you that you should live the best out of your life. The deep emotions of Vicky, her friends and her family members have captured me. Although this is a young adult book, I recommend it to everybody no matter how old you are. You will definitely discover something that you have never read before."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This book has been my favorite book ever since I read it for the first time in 7th grade. It is a wonderful example of L'engle's ability (one that she shares with great authors such as C S Lewis) to write novels that can be read and appreciated by children and adults. Her message of the joy of life is one that can be understood by all. I thank her for the gift that she has given me, and encourage everyone to read this book, as well as all the other amazing books she has written."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This book is wonderful, no one here will believe it, but fifth-grade girls may even like it, at least, that was when I read it.

Although surrounded by the dark at times, Vicky always pulls herself through."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This book is sad, starting at the first sentance. There is a lot of talk about death, and hard decisions. A girl named Vicky, who is the main character, is spending time with three different boys.

By Katie Brown, Age 11 :-)"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"This is one of my two all time favorite L'Engle books (A Swiftly Tilting Plant is the other.)

It is also the story of faith in God, and learning to let go of things we love so that they may have a better life. The main character, Vicky, has to learn to accept her grandfather's death"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Madeleine L'Engle has done it again. The saga of theAustin family (begun in &quot;Meet the Austins&quot;) continues, with the focus this time on Vicky Austin. Vicky's family moves in with her grandfather, who is dying of leukemia. L'Engle does not turn away from the eventuality of death and its slow painful approach, but focuses on the different ways the family members deal with death. The grandfather is a paragon of men, which makes watching his demise by parts even more upsetting.L'Engle counterbalances this landscape of grief withpoetry (from whence the title), dolphin encounters, andthe deepening of friendships. This book will speak stronglyboth to teens and adults who are fascinated by the paradoxof pain and beauty in the same world.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"A Ring of Endless Light is one of my favorite books of all time. The story revolves around the growth and development of 16-year-old Vicky Austin. She is spending the summer with her beloved Grandfather, for he is dying of cancer. To Vicky death is everywhere around her, and the burden is too much to carry. With the help of three young men: Leo, Zachary, and Adam, she begins to explore the true meaning of life and death. Leo is a friend whose father died and likes Vicky in a romantic way. Zachary is a disturbed handsome young man, who is dramatic and exciting to Vicky. Adam is John's (Vicky's older brother) friend, who is working on a project with dolphins. He invites Vicky to help him with his project on communication with dolphins. Through the dolphins Vicky learns a new sense of wonder in the power of life, and light. This book elegantly writes about the issues of life and death which haunt all people. It emphasizes the power of choosing to live your life as the light, and that life is really just a ring of pure and endless light."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"As always, Madeleine L'Engle delivers a stunning piece of fiction with \`A Ring of Endless Light.' Although the main character, Vicky Austin, gives off a distinctive mary-sue air, the book (especially the guys!) are very enjoyable. Pieces of poetry found in this book are beautiful and elegant; they alone would be cause enough to read the book. \`A Ring of Endless Light' also offers the reader an insight into the emotions and thoughts of a teenage girl in a fantastical setting. I would recommend this book for ages 13 and up. If you enjoyed this book, I would recommend Tiger Eyes by Judy Blume, Father Figure by Richard Peck and With You and Without You by Ann Martin as well as the rest of L'Engle's books."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"Vicky Austin is dealing with emotional problems. The first is Commander Rodney, the whole family's friend. When he dies a hero's death trying to save a kid's life in the storm, the Austins are all very sad. Then when Vicky finds out that her friend Zachary attempted suicide, killed Commander Rodney, and injured himself, she is feeling very traumatized. She starts blaming him for what happened, even though Zachary didn't mean any harm to anyone but himself.Then there is more. Leo, Commander Rodney's son, finds Vicky and wants comfort and maybe something more. But Vicky has other plans for the summer when Adam, her brother's friend, has her help in his project with dolphins.I thought this book was excellent because it shows a teenager's insight on the world around her. If these feelings came into a kid's life, I don't think any normal kid could manage. But Vicky has a way where she can fall apart but still remain standing at the same time. This book showed that even when you think you have given up, something new can always happen, maybe answering your prayers or maybe, just maybe, making things a little worse. This book may, however, be a little too emotional on Vicky's part. I think that she blames herself a lot even when it is not totally her fault. Vicky could also be a little more understanding with the people around her than she is.I give this book five stars because I thought it was a truly excellent book. I would recommend it to people who like fiction with a realistic, emotional twist to it. I think it really shows a bad experience in a better light."},{"Title":"A Ring of Endless Light","review":"The book, A Ring of Endless Light is a great novel! L'engle really gave great descriptions! This novel has a romantic plot but adventure also. The characters are very spirited and mean what they say!This story takes place on an island where a girl named Vicky Austin's grandfather lives. Vicky and her family go to the island every summer for a few weeks but this summer Vickey's grandfather isn't doing too well-he has leukemia. Vickey and her family stay for the whole summer suspecting Vickey's grandfather will die at the end.Vicky is a mixed up teen that is not as pretty as her sisterand this summer is the first that she's got at least three guys after her! One of them is a marine biologist who takes her swimming with dolphins. I won't go into that, that's something you have to find out on your own!I would recommend this book to a fifth through seventh grade girl. I liked this book because it had dolphins and sea creatures!

No better explanation. (And I'm also already in love with Adam.)"},{"Title":"The Law And The Word","review":"The Law and the Word is a excellent outline of just what the tittle states. Troward being one of the forefathers of New Thought gives a very insightful and scientific outline of the power of our thought and spoken word and how the Law works. If you have not read some of his earlier writings like \\"The Creative Process in the Individual\\" and become familiar of his way of teaching and writing it may be hard to grasp. I have been fortunate enough to been exposed to some excellent teachers in New Thought and once I \\"got\\" how Troward writes it opened new doors of thought and perspective. In all honesty Troward was the forefather of Qauntum Physics from a intuitive level. So I suggest when you read him have a open mind and open heart and let his words speak to you and the glimmers will shine through. If you would like to get a sample of one of the next great teachers of this generation visit [...]"},{"Title":"The Law And The Word","review":"Mr Troward thinks deeply and seeks to bring the reader into an understanding of basically, \\"cause and effect\\". He paints a broad picture of how things start and the law or principle by which they originate and translate into their intended purposes. He uses science frequently to show that all things that we have been able to use for our advantage we have discovered certain laws by which they work. Once we find the laws we have been able to unfold a myriad of uses and applications of the laws for a vast number of things. The \\"Law and the Word\\" is his premise for the explanation of how things originate and produce their effects. He starts with God and creation. God spoke (his thoughts) and things emerged and took shape and form. Man being an expression of God made in his image accomplishes the things he does in the same manner by his word (thoughts) and the law translates them into reality. These realities may come into existance by various means including his own efforts in cooperating with the law of his being. Troward says that it is always the law and the word, but the word comes first and the law brings it to pass. Although Mr Troward ventures into some areas of thought that are quite challenging to get a hold of, he often returns to a scriptural basis for most of his insights. Of all the new thought writers Thomas Troward is perhaps the most scriptually focused in all of his writings. There is a reverence and a respect for the bible and he constantly uses biblical texts to help support his conclusions. He certainly uses terms like \\"we may reason\\" or the word \\"speculate\\" in stating some postulations but he unwaveringly uses biblical quotes with a firmness of faith and affirms his obvious recognition of the authority of Christ and the meaning of redemption. The last chapter is full of scripture and he states clearly his belief in \\"the atonement\\" and reconciliation with God that allows the higher dimensions of man's ability to use the Law and the Word in unlimited ways.

Even though I love his teachings, he can be hard to follow at times. I recommend you keep a dictionary handy."},{"Title":"The Law And The Word","review":"This book repeats itself alot.. and goes no where.. with no point in sight..

Terribly 'nice' and verbose Victorian era writing does not disguise the repudiation of human insanity and mental limitations.Worth trolling through with a highlighter, just to uncover the explosive truths he slips you, while throwing his arm over your shoulder in the most disarming way, and yammering about how little he knows.Brings a smile to my face just thinking...for myself."},{"Title":"You are the adventure","review":"I can't remember now how I first became acquainted with this book - but it must have been more than 20 years ago when I first read it and it has remained one of my favorites. J. Allen Boone's unfailing good spirits, his enthusiasm for life, and his excitement about adventures - both physical and mental - are an inspiration. I was going to call him an optimist - but \\"optimist\\" doesn't really go deep enough. Boone was absolutely fearless. He was also a wonderful humorist, and I suppose it's his humor in the book that first drew me into it.

Britannicus, the slave of the mad Roman emperor Caligula, goes through many exiting adventures as he grows more and more weary of his overlords. It is an example one of Burroughs' only bittersweet endings, but it is a remarkable tradegy by the Master of Adventure which no ERB reader should miss. It's too bad it's currently out of print."},{"Title":"I Am a Barbarian","review":"Burroughs' research and plot are both excellent in this adventure set in the Roman Empire during the reign of the mad emperor Caligula. Robert E. Howard fans will enjoy this as much as ERB diehards."},{"Title":"I Am a Barbarian","review":"Good historical fiction from an unexpected source. Burroughs' treatment of Caligula and the emperor's barbarian slave is excellent. I rather expected a Lord Greystoke in Africa adventure and found instead a refreshing take on imperial Rome, told from the point of view of a slave captured early in life and owned thereafter by Caligula.Tiberius is painted rather favorably when compared to most historical fiction devoted to the period, especially that written after the second deification of Claudius by Robert Graves.Many aspects of Roman life are given breath in this book, which is well written and enjoyable."},{"Title":"I Am a Barbarian","review":"This is one of only two historical novels written by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the other being The Outlaw of Torn, but despite never being published during ERB's lifetime, is the superior of the two. ERB gives Rome great depth in this, the story of Brittanicus, slave to the mad Emperor Caligula. Surprisingly for an ERB novel, many of the characters are well fleshed out while the love story is a bit more deftly handled than usual in a Burroughs story. The ending is atypical of Burroughs too, something I found both interesting and saddening. This is a fine historical novel that should have a wider audience. Since many of ERB's books are being reprinted now, I hope this too will be republished by some imprint for the enjoyment of the next generation of readers."},{"Title":"I Am a Barbarian","review":"When I first read this one, I had long ago become inurred to Burrough's cookie-cutter approach to plot and character development. Imagine my surprise, then, that I should be reading something as grittily gutsy as Robert E. Howard at his best. I don't know when in his career Burroughs wrote this one, but it is a throwback to the days of his first few, more adult-oriented, Tarzan novels, but even better. Too bad that even most ERB fans haven't heard of this one. You don't have to be a fan to like it, however, just a lover of great novels, especially historical adventures and romances."},{"Title":"Princeton Review: Cracking the NCLEX - RN, 1999-2000 Edition (With Sample Tests on Disk)","review":"I graduated from the university of washington nursing school with a 3.7gpa. i did not pass the NCLEX after reading this review book cover to cover. After taking the exam this book did not even mention anything about all kinds of material i was questioned on, such as delegation skills and prioritization.

Not only did I find errors in the book (EKG mislabeling), but there weren't very many NCLEX questions at all, and the ones they had were too easy. The computer questions don't give rationales for the right answers, either.

It is required by our school to buy an NCLEX book early on. The idea is to learn what we need to learn to take the test.

You will pick up things you know you need to know."},{"Title":"Princeton Review: Cracking the NCLEX - RN, 1999-2000 Edition (With Sample Tests on Disk)","review":"Of the three books I chose to buy, this one was the best. It offers definitive, but not lengthy, study reviews of major nursing topics. I was able to use their reviews to help me focus where I needed to study more. Two drawbacks of the book are that it lacks an adequate legal/ethical issue section and the sample questions are too simplistic."},{"Title":"Daughter of the Forest","review":"I was pretty disappointed in this book. While I enjoy the occasional romance novel, I am wary to pick up a book by a cross-genre writer like Vella Munn. Its the story of a young woman Twana who has a special power to be able to locate animals, and even in one case, talk telepathically to them. Twana's mother disappeared many years ago, and both she and her mother have been surrounded by abusive, conniving men. Until the insipidly instant love of her life kidnaps her, and together they are able to work through their past traumas and live happily ever after.There! You know the story and that's about as exciting as it gets. It's very negative to most of the men in the novel as a way to make the main male character more attractive and lovable to the reader.This book isn't worth your time or money. This book belongs off the shelves of fantasy and back among the &quot;bodice rippers.&quot;"},{"Title":"Daughter of the Forest","review":"The stage is a Native American community in the forests of the northwest. The heroine is Twana, who has the power to communicate telepathically with animals, but has been kidnapped by a warrior from another tribe. This sounded like an attractive concept, but the more I listened to the taped version, the more I realized this was a sappy romance, with an unappealing heroine who whined and cried and mooned at the feet of her hard-headed and unfeeling captor, Madsaw. All the other characters seem ridiculously &quot;evil&quot;, bent on destroying Twana, and Twana is the only good person, who by her humility finally wins over her captor's love. Yuk! Some heroine! Her ability to communicate with animals was focused on an &quot;evil&quot; bear whom she fears for most of the book, and whom she ends up telling &quot;I love you, I love you&quot;, after she has successfully begged it to leave her beloved captor alone. This was the final act that convinced Madsaw to confess his love for her. I listened to a taped version, which made me grit my teeth frequently as the reader melodramatically whined and begged her way through Twana's character, and cackled evilly for the voices of the Shaman and other &quot;bad guys&quot;. I was glad when it ended. I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 only because I think it would be less annoying in the book version."},{"Title":"Daughter of the Forest","review":"I'm glad that I purchased this book inspite of the reviews. I really enjoyed it. I love native american folklore, history and tales. I am from Montana and have always admired the native american for who they are and were. We could learn so much from them. I felt the author gave me a wonderful glimpse into the forest and the animals that belong there. I loved how she interacted her characters with those animals without it being far fetched and unrealistic. I believe there was a time and still is that animals and men can communicate. Each requires their own respect. As an artist I was able to visualize several pictures from this story that are just waiting to be put to color. Her descriptions and feel of the story did just that for me."},{"Title":"Pain Seeking Understanding: Suffering, Medicine, and Faith","review":"How can God allow this to happen? Where is God in this terrible suffering? What kind of a God would create a world where there is so much pain? If you've ever wondered seriously about these questions with respect to human illness and suffering, whether for someone you're caring for or for your own self, this book is invaluable. Alas, it doesn't provide any perfect answers -- as if perfect answers could be provided -- but it provides a wide range of perspectives in thirteen thoughtful essays by twelve different authors. Some are physicians, some are theologians, some are ethicists, one is a rabbi, some are ministers. Somewhere among these voices you'll find one that speaks to you about these profound and disturbing issues. And while there are no easy answers, it is helpful to read the thoughts of other good people who have struggled with these questions, trying to reconcile the concept of a loving God with a suffering world."},{"Title":"Pain Seeking Understanding: Suffering, Medicine, and Faith","review":"The seller delivered the book in a very good condition just like they said. So good job!!"},{"Title":"Let's Go 2003: Europe","review":"Let's Go is THE guidebook for cheap traveling, especially for students. It's secret? It's written by students, mainly for students...It's strength is that it has a lot of truly budget accomodations listed -- hostels, etc. -- in practically every city in Europe. The main weakness? Because it is put together by students, who by definition are amateurs, the writing can sometimes be weak, the info can be out of date or wrong, and the reviews of lodging and sights are incredibly uneven. (For example, when I used Let's Go almost exclusively for a 3-month Europe trip, some of their $10-25/night budget accomodations listed were fantastic -- but others were dumps unworthy of a listing in any guidebook). The problem is that, unlike a Lonely Planet or a Rick Steves guidebook, which are written by professionals, Let's Go has had hundreds of writers over the years, with students writing about one country but not all the others...If you are unlucky enough to go to a country reviewed by Mountain Man Jack, for example, and he doesn't care about a lack of air conditioning, lumpy beds and smelly rooms, and fails to mention these items, you are out of luck. All in all, though, a great resource for people who need truly budget accomodations, with lots of good maps and other tips... I've personally outgrown this guidebook, having moved on to Rick Steves, who focuses not on the cheapest possible budget but on getting the most possible out of your trip...($50-$100 day vs. the $25-$50 that Let's Go specializes in)."},{"Title":"Let's Go 2003: Europe","review":"Let's Go is the college student classic. Without a doubt, if you are looking simply to party Europe, this is your most helpful tool. But if you are looking to experience Europe, understand that Let's Go is the most popular European travel guide. Virtually EVERYONE has it. This fact does have its advantages: you will never be far from the American crowd. But the disadvantages are the same: the bars, the clubs, the hostels and resturants are all on the Let's Go circuit.In all, my recomendation is to buy the Lonely Planet guidebook that I found much more informative and better written. You can better avoid the American Party crowd when you feel like it, and when you want to partake in the happenings - don't worry they are easy to find.The other advantage of everyone having Let's Go would be that it can be found almost everywhere (hostel bookshelves, your roommate's backpack) and you will not have any trouble borrowing it for a while. Lonley Planet offers a slightly different perspective, and allows you to more fully enjoy your trip abroad."},{"Title":"Let's Go 2003: Europe","review":"This new edition by Let's Go isn't too different to its predecessors but it is slightly smaller in size. Every centimetre and gram of weight does count when you're lugging the thing around Europe. Let's go has also introduced some new small features down it's left hand columns on some pages. They are In Recent News which reports on regional issues that may affect you tells you about recent local council works or stuff like what is happening with gypsies. Irrelevant, yes and weight adding. The Local Story, From the road, The Big Splurge are a few of the others which are equally irrelevant to most backpackers and seem to have been created just to give the book a new look so you'll buy the current instead of an older version.While granted this is a lot better than Lonely Planet's version as it is written more for a non American audience it still doesn't include what it should and has been drastically thickened with a lot of stuff backpackers don't need to know and more importantly do not want to carry the weight of those pages around. It seems to be moving away from being a backpacker book and trying to capture different target markets at the same time. Backpackers don't care about hotels, restaurants and stuff like this. We'd rather a few more supermarket listings. If they want to go after the non backpacker market fine but they should create another book because we're not going to read that stuff and it takes up a lot of room and weight.The information on the actual towns, cities and national parks listed is ever increasing which is good but the number of places listed is fast declining although granted there are more than in Lonely Planet's version. For an overview of the entire continent of Europe this edition should concentrate on having as many places as possible not just the main ones. The whole differentiation of backpackers from tourists is that we see places package tours don't go. The Black Forrest for example is now reduced to a half a page blurb and only mentions Freiburg which isn't really the Black Forrest fairy tale experience type place. Previous editions had towns such as Schlushee and Titisee which are great places but no one will know to go there. I assume this is to get you to buy the other more detailed editions such as Eastern Europe, Germany etc. Backpackers aren't going to spend all that money or want to carry around 50 books.While this book is good to find the location of hostels that's about it. You're better off to buy an older version except obviously Euro Dollar prices won't be used either but remember the price information is usually drastically wrong anyway. Prices of course go up the day after the book is published. Hostel information won't be as up to date in older versions either. You're better off to go by word of mouth from other backpackers to find quality hostels.This edition is good for the information on the places listed but there are a lot of great places to visit no longer in here.

Also, it appears that someone else (unattributed) wrote the book's Chapter 14, &quot;The Divine Prescription&quot;.The book's Chapter 16, &quot;The Ritually Abused Child&quot;, is well-written and useful. It discusses physical and psychological abuse symptoms that parents would notice, how abuse might affect a child, and a parent's role both in helping a child recover and also in working with physicians and clergy.The book's overall lack of credibility is unfortunate. The book's topics (child abuse, and brainwashing) are important topics that deserve strong and objective discussion. In addition, the author clearly *has* been abused, has suffered personality dysfunction, and has real experiences to discuss. This would have been a very powerful and important book had the author worked more with her editors."},{"Title":"Satan's Underground: The Extraordinary Story of One Woman's Escape","review":"Books like this are to Satanism, Paganism and Wicca what &quot;The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk&quot; are to Catholicism -- just a shameful attempt to discredit someone else's religion by making all of its practitioners liable for the bad actions of a few. I'm a Catholic, and I know the &quot;Maria Monk&quot; story was an anti-Catholic lie. Well, this sounds to me like an anti-Satanist lie.

Using Satan to sell Jesus and exploiting a serious problem in this country is an egregious violation of the trust of those among us who need it the most. I do believe that \\"Satanic\\" ritual abuse exists, in the USA and worldwide, and there are far better research materials to say so. I'm not so sure this writer is a survivor - in that her story makes next to no sense. She lost me when she said she was exploited in the pornography industry - on weekends - while she went to college and took care of her father during the week. Excuse me??? Who paid for her college? She certainly wasn't on scholarship, since she admits that she wasn't getting the grades.Then I consider all the information at the end, which is helpful and, for the most part, true in terms of what to look for and how to help - except that none of it dovetails with her own story!She also seems to be very confused about brainwashing and mind control, and never bothers to mention those players in high power - in government and corporate industry, of which there are many, and how their manipulation plays into the \\"Satanism\\" game.This book is badly written and badly researched, and I was surprised to find names referred to that I have a high regard for.

I met the woman at a church, and I feel that it is her true story. She is obviously a woman who has suffered great pain in her life. She is very closed-off, mysterious, and private. I called her from time to time at an answering service number, but it got connected and I lost track of her. After having met her, it is easy to believe that she suffered the things she describes.

For such revelations as those portrayed by the author in this book, the reactions amongst many reviewers and the public at large are consistent with such an intent and influence so prevalent in today's society.To ignore the heart-rending experiences, suffering and the wholesale evil so profoundly described throughout a lifetime's personal experience only serves to condemn other such innocents to similar traumas and to ultimately encourage those responsible to continue their activities.We owe it to ourselves, our children and our futures to become aware of what is going on behind the scenes and to stand up in the name of Jesus Christ against the evil portrayed here. The victims need to be shown that there is a very real and Personal answer to their torment, as the author discovered.Although the author's personal experiences are the foundation and basis of this book, she takes care to emphasise the many thousands of others who have shared in her suffering. Many such cases are mentioned in detail. The child sacrifices, sexual abuse and mutilation at the hands of many Satanic organisations in pursuit of devil worship are truly sickening.A noteable Pscyhologist mentioned in the book, following his interview with a known senior Satanic cult member, estimated the number of such human sacrifices in the USA alone as between 40 to 60 thousand. Even if this number is grossly exaggerated, the fact that such even occur is to be ignored at everyones' peril. As the author states, with tens of thousands of children reported missing in the USA every year, how can anyone be complacent, especially with the rise of Satanism increasing at an alarming rate not only in the USA but worldwide.Indeed, the viscious backlash aimed at discrediting both her and her book is not surprising. Anyone with an eye to see will be aware that her story is only too credible. Disbelief, fear and ignorance and outright rejection of cases such as Lauren Stratford's are the air that many of those involved in the described ritualistic abuse breath.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Satan's Underground: The Extraordinary Story of One Woman's Escape","review":"First, should the story be true then I would pour my heart out onto this courageous women. However, all this book is in actuality is one big lie to convert people to Christianity. The author leads you to beleive that Satanists are out to simply KILL and are are TRULEY evil ! The author is highly misguided. She equates 'modern Satanism' with murder, sexual abuse, horrid perversions, devil worship and devoution to evil and sacrifice. In actuality, Satan represents devoution to oneself and does not advocate any of things mentioned. By connecting modern Satanism with these things she has dug her own ditch. She LIES ! This book consistently mentions 'Jesus' and speaks out against pornography and other issues Christians are against. She claims to have seen demons and the devil himself. If but for one moment she would of picked up a modern Satanic book, she would have realized that Satanists don't believe in demons or the devil in that way but beleive in Satan as a Principle, and not to be equated with the modern concpetion of evil.

I know the kinds of activities it describes have gone on down through the ages around the world. In addition, with all the current glorification of witchcraft, violence, and the rampant cases of child abuse, plus pornography selling more than Big Macs, it sounds totally believable, tragically.

One thing that did disturb me was her description of ritual abuse and how these cults buy children. They either have a breeding house where they keep women in virtual slavery to have these kids or they put an ad in the paper. \\"Loving Christian Couple wanting to ADOPT without going through the adoption process.\\" This ad is in every greensheet across the country. When I read that one afternoon after reading this book it sent shivers up my spine. I've seen these ads everywhere. Thats what is disturbing. What if it is true?

This is the same FBI that insists LHO acted alone and denied the existence of Organized crime until it became impossible to do so.Back to the book. The stories in hear are shocking a disturbing. The problem is there is no means to verify any of it. The timeline is fuzzy and in the end, there's no proof that any of this happened. In short, this is most likely the work of an overactive imagination or planted disinformation.Still I think it's foolhardy to believe that SRA doesn't not exist, unlike UFO and black helicopters, there's enough evidence documented evidence of cult murders floating around. The porn industry produces some unsavory characters. It's also proven that employees of large corporations like DynCorp are involved in the sex slave trade in other nations.

Lauren is one of the few survivors, and I admire her courage. It is a painful book to read. What can the average person do other than get depressed? I became aware of this type of abuse by reading the works of David Icke. He points out that no one wants to think about this type of extreme evil. But as he said, what do we say to the children who are now going through this? \\"Sorry too depressing and negative?\\" Her mother and the porno king were especially hard to read about. The smelly bum who laughed at Lauren for calling for her mom--\\"she's the one who brought me here.\\" Brutal. My only reservation about this book is the Christian dogmatic viewpoint that Christianity is the only path to God. For example Lauren feels meditation can be dangerous, and I know that meditation is a valid way of communing with our Creator. I overlook that however, because Lauren needed her Christian faith to make it through the horror. She survived to tell her story, so I honor her path. What can we do?

Here in Brazil we are much more aware of the havoc they can create...the book tells a story that is all too common here, especially with people who are heavily into spiritism and macumba (santeria). The demons get attached to the person and try to destroy them. But always it starts as a \\"good\\" thing, with nice \\"spirit guides\\"...until you try to escape their control.The best advantage of this book is that it gives an American pespective to the problem, by showing a situation that happened to an American.

True, some of these accounts do sound hard to believe, especially ones of evil spirits materializing into visual form.

The book was reissued in July 1991 by a different publisher: Pelican Publishing Co., a small Louisiana publisher. This new edition features cover blurbs from such people as Hal Lindsey and Johanna Michaelson (who helped get the book published in the first place, but who I thought accepted the Cornerstone criticisms) and Mike Warnke (whose claims of being a &quot;former Satanist High Priest&quot; have also been shown to be false by Cornerstone).What is most galling about the new edition of the book, however, is its afterword, by three Los Angeles clinical psychologists, all women sporting either an M.D. or Ph.D. after their names. The two-page afterword does not address *any* of the Cornerstone criticisms, but alludes to them by saying that (paraphrase) &quot;some critics state that this book should not have been published unless every single fact within it could be verified and documented.&quot; It goes on to say how unreasonable these critics are, and that numerous other people have reported stories &quot;like&quot; Lauren Stratford's. I suspect that the &quot;some critics&quot; referred to do not exist; that no one has made any such claim about Stratford's book. The Cornerstone criticism thoroughly documented the fact that the book is almost entirely a fabrication by Laurel Wilson (the real name of &quot;Lauren Stratford&quot;), a very disturbed young woman whose story has changed radically over time.Surely both the publisher and these clinical psychologists must be aware of the details of these criticisms.

In late 1989, Gretchen and Bob Passantino and Jon Trott exposed Lauren Stratford as Laurel Willson in an article in Cornerstone, still available on the web.By 1998, Willson had morphed into a \\"Holocaust survivor.\\" Some time earlier, she presented herself as Laura Grabowski to a group of child Holocaust survivors, who accepted her claim to be a Polish Jew, a survivor of Auschwitz-Birkenau and a victim of Dr. Joseph Mengele. She pretended to have been liberated to a Krakow orphanage in 1945 and brought to the United States, where a Gentile couple adopted her at nine or ten. In 1998, her poem \\"We Are One\\" appeared on the web. But like the story here, this appears to have been completely untrue.In 1997, Willson/Stratford contacted Binjamin Wilkomirski with her story. He had published Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood in Europe in 1995. Schocken Books translated and published his story in the U.S. In 1997. Then in 1999, 60 Minutes broadcast a segment on Wilkomirski: He seemed to have been born in Switzerland as Bruno Grosjean, and later adopted and renamed Bruno Dossekker. Also in 1999, Philip Gourevitch wrote on Wilkomirski in The New Yorker, as did Elena Lappin in Granta. All three outfits believed Dossekker/Wilkomirski's story to be false.Unfortunately for Willson/Stratford, she had already wound herself tightly to the Dossekker/Wilkomirski story: She claimed to be Lauren Grabowski, whom she said had known him in a Krakow orphanage. He, in turn, used Grabowski to corroborate his story. But the respective publications in 2001 and 2002 ofThe Wilkomirski Affair(Stefan Maechler) andA Life in Pieces: The Making and Unmaking of Binjamin Wilkomirski(Blake Eskin) blew her cover as well.Gretchen and Bob Passantino and Jon Trott revisited the Willson/Stratford story laid out in this book in Cornerstone in October 1999 (also still on the web). This time, they discussed her apparent fakery as Grabowski, and suggested that Grabowski was actually an American Christian who since her youth had fabricated stories about her alleged victimhood, the most well-publicized case being in this book.Alas, Dossekker/Wilkomirski's unraveling also involved that of Stratford, whose Social Security number, according to Maechler, is one and the same as that of Grabowski, the claimed survivor. He also suggested that Satan's Underground and Fragments contain startling similarities.Unfortunately, this book obscures an ongoing and real-world problem of child abuse.

However, Wilson was not about to give up on the fame and fortune she had enjoyed, and reinvented herself as a fake Holocaust survivor, Laura Grabowski.It's hard to say what combination of mental illness, lust for fame, or criminal greed motivated Wilson's exploitation of past victims and present suckers.

Sociologist Jeffrey Victor, in his 1993 study &quot;Satanic Panic,&quot; offers a rational critique of the title phenomenon and of the bogus &quot;survivor&quot; stories that were so prevalent in the late 1980s.Readers of earlier editions of &quot;Satan's Underground&quot; should have been suspicious from the start. The book is filled with unverifiable information. Although the author mentions being hospitalized, attending college, and moving from city to city, the names of these institutions and cities are never mentioned.But beyond being an apparent hoax, &quot;Satan's Underground&quot; is also a bad piece of writing. Stratford's hysterical, melodramatic prose reads like an inept parody of a horror novel. A typical passage: &quot;Horror seized my mind. Terror froze my heart. The purest sacrifice, the most pleasing sacrifice--the one sacrifice I could never make unless my mind and will were completely broken--was the sacrifice of a child to Satan!&quot; (p. 99).&quot;Satan's Underground&quot; is a significant textual artifact for scholars interested in the &quot;Satanic panic&quot; phenomenon of the 1980s.

A man is good as his/her word.Even if Ms. Stratford fabricated her story, I am sure that she told of someone else's story of child abuse at the hand of a parent. She was absolutely correct in saying that there were no protective services at that time for children. She claims to have repeatedly turned to others such as her Sunday School teacher, minister, youth minister, school counselor, & police to no avail. That is certainly plausible. It is also plausible that she did not leave home until the age of 20. It is possible for one to earn a college degree. It is highly likely that she was able to procure employment, but not be able to hold down skilled work due to inability to concentrate & then get on disability benefits. If that is the case, then she could not have written this book.She is correct in saying that the victim is not to blame for the offense. The victim of incest & rape has nothing to be sorry for or ashamed of. We do not know why God allows such wicked things to take place, but the abused person is loved wholly & completely by God & is looked upon no differently than anyone else. At the same time God loves the abuser & can forgive him/her of their sins. She makes a point that the abused should forgive & guard against bitterness & that recovery takes years.She makes a valid point that pornography has 2 victims-the one forced to participate & the one who reads the filth. There is always a progression from soft porn to hardcore porn. Sin begets more sin. Porn does lead to sexual perversion & to crimes of rape & incest.As far as SRA, it does exist to a greater or lesser extent per doccumented evidence in police reports. This fabricated story does hurt the credibility of other victims of SRA. Those who promoted & published this material should be ashamed since all they care about is another dollar to be made & getting their name published. Ms Stratten may you finally RIP."},{"Title":"Satan's Underground: The Extraordinary Story of One Woman's Escape","review":"This book is a hoax. Moreover, Lauren Willson/Stratford also has claimed to be a Jewish girl, Lauren \\"Grabowski\\", who knew Bruno Grosjean Dossekker/\\"Binjamin Wilkomirski\\" in a children's home in Krakow as a fellow Holocaust victim, corroborating his book \\"Fragments\\". The Holocaust, of course, did happen, but when \\"Fragments\\" was exposed as complete fraud, Lauren's story fell apart, too.

Now, Rose finds herself trapped in an abusive marriage with no way out...though more and more she vows to find one.Laverne Fine is a cosmetologist and Rose's best friend. Her two main goals are to one, get a visa so that she may travel abroad and perhaps reap in the opportunities to blossom in her career; and two, to uncover the truth surrounding her lover's identity and nationality.Wendy Arnold is beyond successful in her career. She has the degrees, the accolades and the prestige, but as she reaches the big 4-0, she finds herself panicking, wanting desperately to persuade her long-distance love, Miles to move from Jamaica to Brooklyn in order to live together, get married, and have children.Jamerican Connection is a very interesting read. I enjoyed being immersed in both the American and Jamaican cultures. I quickly flipped through the novel to find out how Rose's intriguing story would go. As you read the novel, you will find yourself rooting for the women, who all have their own distinct voices. You will hate Rose's husband, and probably have disgust for most of the men IN the book, because you get the sense that they have no respect for women as they cheat and some even get the brass ring at the end after all of their cheating and lies.Regardless of that, the novel is a fast-paced story that will pull the reader in to the web of drama that unfolds."},{"Title":"Jamerican Connection","review":"I read JAMERICAN CONENCTION:A Novel during my summer vacation in Greece.

A man she gave her heart to, but he cannot even give her the time of day. The author makes you feel the pain that she suffers with, when she learns of all his indiscretions.She shows how Rose works hard to make her life better. Upon her arrival Rose realizes the streets in NYC are not paved with gold,nor a emerald city.

I read it in two days. Sandra has a very unique way in telling a story. You can get connected to the characters. Your heart pours out to Rose because she was young when she made decisions but she was determined not to remain in a bad relationship. She is naive and full of dreams that she seem to not be able to reach easily. She has great support in family and friends. They never force her to make decisions even though they hate the situation that she is in. Donovan was definately a Thorn. He was crazy and should have been stopped a long time ago. The other characters in the book were also active with their own story plot. Sandra did a great job on connecting the characters to each other without getting lost in the stories of each woman. I also liked the way she put religion in the story lines. It is good to show how people pray to get through a situation. How having a praying grandmother and have a strong background in the church can help you find peace in any situation. I think that you will enjoy reading Jamerican Connection. I look forward to the sequel and will be telling all my friends to read the novel."},{"Title":"Jamerican Connection","review":"Ironically, i grew up in Mandeville where the story took place. it was so real.... This surely hits home... Cant wait for her next book!!"},{"Title":"Jamerican Connection","review":"Jamerican Connection is an intriguing debut novel from Sandra A. Ottey which intertwines the lives of three women into an engrossing tale of friendship, relationships, lies, deceit, secrets, domestic violence, infidelity and suspense.While Ottey writes about three women and their relationships with each other as well as their male significant others, the story is really Rose's. It's Rose's story that compels the reader to continue reading this almost 400 page book into the wee hours of the morning. It is Rose and Donovan's relationship that will have you screaming and wanting to jump into the pages to shake some sense into Rose and to give Donovan the beatdown of his life for being so insensitive and abusive. Donovan preys on young girls and he elevated his manhood and self-esteem by marrying Rose when she was only 16, pregnant with his child and a high school dropout. Rose's idyllic marriage quickly turned into a living hell as she witnessed her husband have one two many affairs and one two many kids to go along with the multiple affairs. Rose desperately wants to get away from Donovan but nothing is beneath Donovan when it comes to keeping Rose dependent, barefoot and pregnant if necessary. The horrific acts that Donovan commits against Rose are at times so inhuman that one has to set the book aside for a moment and take a breather before moving forward with the story.Sandra Ottey has written a heart-wrenching yet moving and riveting debut novel. One of her greatest strengths and weaknesses is the character development of Rose and Donovan, however, Laverne and Wendy's stories really paled in comparison...they were more secondary characters vs. characters on equal footing with Rose. In fact, if their characters weren't included the story still would have been a compelling one. Although, I didn't like the ending for Rose's character. I almost felt like she was proclaiming independence but she was still depending on a man to help her make it through the rough spots. I would have preferred if Rose moved on and became an independent woman who could stand on her own two feet without necessarily having the opposite sex around if she stumbled. Additionally, I felt the ending was a little rushed and had a few loose ends...but then maybe Ottey is going to grace us with a sequel. Overall, I really enjoyed the author's writing style. I liked the vivid imagery and descriptors as well as how she blended life on the islands with life stateside. I look forward to future books from this author."},{"Title":"Jamerican Connection","review":"JAMERICAN CONNECTION was a great read.

I found it hard to digest the controlling emotionless attitudes the men possessed. Nevertheless it was a page-turner and so real.Whether we were travelling the white beaches of Jamaica or the pavement of Brooklyn, the writers' style was so exceptional you always knew what continent you were resting on.Each character was in search of something within. By the end of the book they each realized that and began another journey.

I'm a sucker for anything with a monster in it and this book delivered more than it's share of them. I have recently purchased every Hautala book I can find...I am now currently reading Bedbugs and I love it!!!

A little boy sees his mother killed by 'little brothers' that live in underground tunnels that criss cross his hometown. Now the monsters want him as well.

True, I was hoping for a siege on the town with the creatures eventually running rampant everywhere so it was a bit of a letdown when there were only a few victims/attacks. And even though 2 people (one being a young teen) taking on the entire nest of extremely lethal creatures is a little hard to swallow and slightly took me out of the story I still liked it overall and plan on giving it a few more re-reads in the future. It's the first book I've read where one part actually gave me the creeps."},{"Title":"Little Brothers","review":"Rick Hautala doesn't write, he conjures. His mastery of fiction helps him create characters and worlds so real, you don't read a Hautala novel, you live it.Little Brothers is no different. Kip Howard lost his mother a few years ago. He's still struggling with the grief but little does he know that whatever took her life is coming back. Immerse yourself in a story so rich and engaging that you will not be able to put the book down. Hautala is a master of his craft and Little Brothers is one hell of a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Little Brothers","review":"Have I mentioned previously how much I love Amazon's Kindle? Well, if I haven't, let me state it now--I love Amazon's Kindle. Why? Because so many authors are releasing their long out-of-print books to the digital device. Rick Hautala is one of these authors.I first read Little Brothers when it was published in 1988. I loved it then, and during the course of moves, my dog-eared, well-read copy had become so used and abused it was falling apart to the point where I was afraid to read it again. So when I heard it was going to be released on Kindle (and other digital platforms), I was ecstatic.Five years ago, Kip Howard witnessed the traumatizing events of his young life: the brutal murder of his mother at the hands of. . . What? He couldn't remember. As a result of the murder, his father, who was present at the time but did not witness the attack but did see the aftermath, abandoned work on the new house. But now that his father is about to once again start work on the new house, all of Kip's fears are resurfacing. As if that wasn't bad enough, the memories are trying to break through the wall he built up to keep them hidden.The attack on Kip's mother was so brutal, it was initially attributed to some animal, but John Watson, the town's resident drunk, knows the truth. A Native American who was brought up in the area, Watson knows the legends that surround the land the town has been built on, and what killed Kip's mother is one of those legends. The Untcigahunk, the Little Brothers, a dwarf-like humanoid race that lives in the caverns and tunnels that run beneath the land. They surface every five years with a hunger for flesh and a thirst for blood. And their time is coming around again.Man and boy will be brought together by chance, and together they vow to put an end to the Little Brothers once and for all. But do this unlikely duo stand a chance against a race that his been around since the dawn of creation, or will they be like so many others that have disappeared without a trace from the town of Thornton, Maine?Little Brothers was Hautala's fourth novel, but it was my first exposure to this Master of Horror. The Untcigahunk are, in my opinion, one of the Horror genre's more memorable creatures, ranking right up there with that damned Zuni fetish doll from Trilogy of Terror. The readers seem to agree, as the Untcigahunk were to appear in several stories after Little Brothers was published.This novel is not an edge-of-your-seat thriller, at least not at first. Hautala takes his time creating his characters, fleshing them out and making them real, giving you ample time to get to know and like (or dislike) them, so when something happens to them or they are placed in a position of danger, you do find yourself sweating it out right along with them, or cheering when the bad guy (yes, the Little Brothers aren't the only bad guys in the book) finally gets what he deserves. It isn't until the boy and Indian meet and start making their plans that the book (or Kindle in this case) becomes hard to put down. The details are rich, which makes it easier to lose yourself in the world of the characters.If you haven't had the pleasure of reading the works of Rick Hautala, and many younger readers might not have because many, if not all, of his books are out of print, I can't encourage you enough to pick up one of them and give him a try, and Little Brothers would be an excellent book to start with. You won't be disappointed. And here's hoping to Rick Hautala will be working on another novel featuring the Untcigahunk."},{"Title":"Little Brothers","review":"Stephen King wannabe Rick Hautala hits rock bottom in this utterly preposterous, contrived and unimaginative horror story. Native American folklore forms the basis for nasty little critters called chtihumangas or something like that, which translates to \\"little brothers.\\" Seems like they come out every five years and chew up the local citizenry supposedly in revenge for being underground-bound by some tribe way back in history. Hautala's usual padded book (over 500 pages) has little suspense and the creature attacks are merely comic; there are characters introduced and cast off (like Gail Fleischer, whose only inclusion seems to be to let her dog Barkley get chomped up); and the brothers Marty and Kip are so juvenile and obnoxious, it's hard to feel anything for them, even though Kip does finally stand up to his brother. The dad is a wimp; the alcoholic Indian a stereotype and the conclusion forced and predictable. While I'm not one of Hautala's biggest fans, I've managed to enjoy some of his other works, but this one is tedious and boring."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"This is a beautiful, expertly painted story about two men and their love for each other, their city, and honor. The implications of this love are left ambiguous. One feels as if he has indeed drunk the last of the wine, and it brings about a wonderful, sad dream."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"And I have been recommending this book to many people ever since. It is gripping, exhilarating, sad and everything else in between. Mary Renault's writing, as always, is lucid, imaginative and richly textured. It is about friendship and love."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"Mary Renault has no rival when it comes to classical historical fiction. Her prose pulses with grace and sincerity. On one level, the novel is a love story between two men during turbulent times. Her interpretation of the relationship between men in ancient Greece is thoughtful and engaging. While the relationship between Alexias and Lycis has its physical elements, it is predominantly based on friendship, admiration, and a protege-mentor bond. Keep in mind that women and men led radically different lives, and for the most part women were considered the property of men. It was hard for a man to have a satisfying relationship with a woman because they had nothing in common. It makes sense that men would reach out to other men--not only because they were often away during years of warring, but because they shared the same experiences.On another level, it is an ideal snapshot of a time and a place, complete with appearances from Socrates, Plato, Xenophon, and others. Anyone who wants to know more about ancient Greece and the Peloponnesian Wars should read this novel. Additionally, anyone who wants to read compelling fiction should pick it up and anything else by Renault."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"Mary Renault has always been my favorite author ever since I read \\"The Persian Boy\\" as a teenager.However, it was \\"The Last Of The Wine\\" that demonstrated to me the sheer magic of Reanault's words, how she effortlessly can weave a few historical tidbits into a full-fledged epic novel.The Last of the Wine, as are many of Mary Renault's greek novels is a homosexual-themed story of friendship,love and ultimately courage and sacrifice.It traces the story of 2 lovers,the handsome youth Alexias and his older friend Lysis.The story depicts in startlingly vivid images the Athenian siege by the army of Sparta and the plague epidemic that nearly devastated the cultural beacon that was Athens.How Alexias survived the siege is one of Mary Renault's finest moments of historical suspense.The book has also some extremely explicit allusions to subjects considered taboo in the 1950's from latent Oedipus complex (Alexias and his step-mother) to gay love.As a gay man, I also found this novel to be Mary Renault's most erotic.Gay sex is never once mentioned overtly but is alluded to many times in a way I found to be very sensual.The eroticism between Alexias and Lysis in a scene taking place on the seashore (where Lysis washed Alexias's feet)remains in my mind one of the most powerful depictions of gay love in any novel.Mary Renault knows more about what triggers a gay man than most gay male authors!Alexias,the handsome young man and Lysis his heartbreakingly ruggedly masculine and loyal lover remain for me Mary Renault's favorite characters.Throughout the novel,these two men sacrifice for each other in a way that I found romantically ideal.A superb novel all the way"},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"This is one of those novels that I found difficult to critique without a good deal of reflection. As other reviewers have explained, this novel is set in a key moment in Western history - Classical Greece during the Peloponessian War. It is a coming of age novel in a society that is as different from ours as many a fantasy or science fiction society, and yet plagued by the same human weaknesses. I loved it.Why?Firstly, as a middle-aged heterosexual Christian male born and raised in the Anglo-Celtic tradition I found the love aspect of this novel to be quite confrontational (notice I say love, not sex). Athens was a society where pederasty (love between an older man and a youth) was a normal stage in development. Once past that step the older man would then fall for and marry a girl in her teens. As a coming of age story, the protagonist experiences this stage of development. The novel does not portray this love in any lurid manner, but with the same sensitivity as any other love story. This was confrontational to me because in modern Western societies the adult-with-youth relationship is both distasteful and illegal as pedophilia (NOTE: please don't interpret this as me saying the novel is about pedophilia - its not). I should also point out that I have friends and relatives who are gay and as such never thought people's personal gender preferences to be an issue, and yet this beautiful portrayal of male-male love disturbed and unsettled me more than I expected. I suppose this can be interpretted as my heterosexuality expressing itself, but nevertheless I was really surprised. Any novel that can challenge your beliefs about yourself and make you feel uncomfortable is a good one. Please note that this is just a part of the novel, not the key aspect, and I have probably dedicated more words to it than it rightly deserves due to my own emotional responses.Secondly, the novel brought several philosopical questions to bear, questions that I believe are still relevant. For example there were various questions about the nature of democracy and its relationship to fairness. There also were questions about the situations in which people find themselves and how they subsequently respond. Every question raised was approached in a manner that fitted well with the story and in no way seemed \\"preachy\\".Thirdly - ancient Athens!!!! (Yes, four deliberate exclaimation marks). In my teenage years I consumed Herodotus, Plato, Thucydides and any Greek legends I could find. Imagine listening to Socrates, or watching a fleet of triremes, or walking the acropolis at its prime. This is a pure travelogue to a long lost world.Fourthly - the characterisations are rich and wonderful and each is unique. Individuals behave in a realistic manner.These things aside, the author's approach is interesting. It is a first person novel in the form of an autobiography. She really captures the form of a memoir, meandering on the brink of key historical events while always keeping focus on the character's own priorities. At times I simply broke out the history books to find out more about things that in this novel were treated as a periphery. I loved it. Having said this, I can easily imagine complaints of boredom from those readers who like their novels more direct. But this novel is about the journey more than the destination (sorry for the old cliche).Yes - read it."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"I've read several of her books and this book is good but not as good as the others. I found quite a few sentences to be so awkward that I had to go back and re-read them to understand what she meant. Also, as in common with her other books, there is not a trace of humor, which can be kind of taxing after a while. Finally, I would shave about 50 pages, as it drags in parts."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"This beautifully written novel tells the story of Alexias, an Athenian youth coming of age during the final years of the Peloponnesian War, and his lifelong friendship/love affair with Lysis, an Athenian soldier. As Renault composes the tale of their relationship, she brings ancient Athens alive, providing enough detail to lend her setting the authenticity it needs. The narrative is at its best when it focuses on the development of Alexias' and Lysis' bond in all its dimensions--as mentor and pupil, as fellow soldiers and citizens, as friends, and as lovers. Renault tells their story with no apologies and depicts the customs of the times with great realism. Although her prose is never didactic, I learned much about Greek history while reading this novel; many historical figures--including Sokrates, Plato, Alkibiades, and Xenophon--figure prominently in the plot. The political circumstances in ancient Greece about which Renault writes serve as a metaphor for many of the political events occurring during the time when the novel was written (1956), notably McCarthyism and the Red Scare. Her depictions of war and Greek politics, however, do constitute the weaker portions of the narrative, and she sometimes meanders too long through her characters' discussions of philosophy and ethics. In spite of these occasional lapses, \\"The Last of the Wine\\" is a satisfying and well-written novel."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"In my opinion, reading historical fiction is all about seeing the world and life through the culture and values of a different society. In this book, Renault does an excellent job of putting one in the character's life. The reader gets a well developed sense of the values and society of the time period through the eyes of a potentially typical youth. Renault writes very well and researches quite thoroughly. Socrates is a supporting character of the novel. Her portrayal of that historic celebrity is elegantly done, yet still very human. All in all, a superior story."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"This is the first novel I read by late Ms Renault, a best selling author I admit I know nothing about.First of all a comment on this edition: one has to take real pains to understand who is speaking, as the characters' speeches follow each other on the same line with a questionable use of punctuation. In a novel where dialogue is rich and continuous one can imagine how fortunate this is.Someone should also have told the publisher that the cover picture, though beautiful in itself, has nothing to do with the Vth century b.C. Greece Ms Renault takes so much pain to depict.This author has a beautiful sense of storytelling: the plot itself is nothing new to a contemporary reader, the love and friendship of two young men in a Greece illuminated by Sokrates' thinking and devastated by a cruel war, but she tells it, simply and compellingly, and she never fails to keep her reader's interest.Before discussing the book's flaws I wish to stress how this novel stands out among ordinary fiction. This told, one has to point out that the philosophing is often clumsy; the competitions rhetorical and the overall style not always as polished as in some paragraphs Ms Renault ha clearly written with more care.To me there is another flaw but I admit it would be unjust to give it undue weight, this book belonging to a woman probably born at the beginning of the century.She writes with ease of the homosexual liaisons typical of ancient Greece, making no fuss about them and giving her attention to the feelings involved, but she betrays her embarassment when dealing with her two main heroes: she makes two disciples of Sokrates' ideas about love of them, thus avoiding too close physical intimacy between the two; later, when they finally surrender to their passion, the fact is hardly mentioned and NEVER quoted again."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"Mary Renault has always been my favorite author ever since I read \\"The Persian Boy\\" as a teenager.However, it was \\"The Last Of The Wine\\" that demonstrated to me the sheer magic of Reanault's words, how she effortlessly can weave a few historical tidbits into a full-fledged epic novel.The Last of the Wine, as are many of Mary Renault's greek novels is a homosexual-themed story of friendship,love and ultimately courage and sacrifice.It traces the story of 2 lovers,the handsome youth Alexias and his older friend Lysis.The story depicts in startlingly vivid images the Athenian siege by the army of Sparta and the plague epidemic that nearly devastated the cultural beacon that was Athens.How Alexias survived the siege is one of Mary Renault's finest moments of historical suspense.The book has also some extremely explicit allusions to subjects considered taboo in the 1950's from latent Oedipus complex (Alexias and his step-mother) to gay love.As a gay man, I also found this novel to be Mary Renault's most erotic.Gay sex is never once mentioned overtly but is alluded to many times in a way I found to be very sensual.The eroticism between Alexias and Lysis in a scene taking place on the seashore (where Lysis washed Alexias's feet)remains in my mind one of the most powerful depictions of gay love in any novel.Mary Renault knows more about what triggers a gay man than most gay male authors!Alexias,the handsome young man and Lysis his heartbreakingly ruggedly masculine and loyal lover remain for me Mary Renault's favorite characters.Throughout the novel,these two men sacrifice for each other in a way that I found romantically ideal.A superb novel all the way."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"Mary Renault's \\"Last of the Wine\\" represents the gold standard of historical fiction. Few of her rivals can match her intimate knowledge of her subject, yet her writing is never didactic or dry. Through her fiction we feel as if we are living in ancient Greece, not perusing some modern reconstruction. She is a master illusionist.Set in Athens during the final years of the Peloponnesian War, the novel is the story of Alexias, a man who always seems to be near the center of key events. Through his eyes we meet a galaxy of the city's best and brightest, from the ever-entertaining Socrates, to the grim and brilliant Plato, to haughty Xenophon and haunted Phaedo. Contrary is some previous reviews, these characterizations seem fresh and real, like portraits of living people taken from life. (Beware anyone who seriously compares Renault to Stephen Pressfield, who seems the use the Greeks mostly as ancient action figures, and only seems inspired when writing battlefield porn.) Few can rival the skill of her writing on a sentence-by-sentence level--her dialog snaps and bites, and her descriptions are poetry.One can quibble at a few things--there do seem to be a number of suspicious coincidences in the plot, contrived mostly to keep Alexias in the center of things. But such minor blemishes take nothing from Renault's achievement.One final word: some object to the implicit homosexuality in the book (there is nothing overt in it). It is a very small mind indeed that demands that every period in the past conform to our modern prejudices about who should admire, love, or go to bed with whom. To put it bluntly--if you can't accept that ancient Greece was a different place, with its own standards, to be taken on its own terms, then Renault isn't for you. The loss would be yours."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"This is a book that dumps you squarely in the agora, the symposium, the trireme and the battlefield. There is not a single wasted syllable, not one sentence that rings false. Like a Mozart symphony, it is exactly right - the Platonic ideal of what a historical novel should be. Being set in the era of Imperial Athens, it naturally incorporates its own tragedy - more than one, in fact. Almost effortlessly, it leaves you understanding just why the Athenians behaved the way they did and how their arrogance led to disaster.Great historical figures spring from the pages, with all their faults and weaknesses as well as their magnificent virtues - Plato, Socrates, Alcibiades, Xenophon, Critias, and many others. Yet alongside the lucid rationality of Socrates, which rings true down the millennia, Alexias and his contemporaries inhabit a world of gods and demons. Zeus, Poseidon, Apollo, Athene and the Furies are just as real to them as the mountains and the sea."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"The second of Mary Renaults books I read, and, in my eyes, the best. She brings back an ancient Greece that almost makes you wish you'd lived 25 centuries earlier. I'm an historian, so I'm well aware it wasn't all honor and love. But this book may well be the truest book I ever read, in what it tries to show us about human life, and what it means to live a life of consequence, not for the greater good of mankind, but for our own sake. Mrs Renault manages to create rich characters without even once sounding melodramatic, or overdoing it. She has that rare gift to say much and make it clear without actually saying it outright. A fine understanding of language.Apart from the achievement to bring ancient Greece back to life better than anyone else, she manages to tell a story about honor, love, devotion, loyalty... I could go on. We see the &quot;invention&quot; of democracy and the beginnings of it's degradation from the pure, wonderful idea, to the ugly thing it will become the closer we get to the end of the classical period (what we're stuck with today, for lack of something better).A true masterpiece, like most of her other works. A word of caution: I found it hard to stay interested when I read it the first time, not being used to her voice. You have to get used to her style of writing, to appreciate it, and understand what is going on. But now, after reading it over and over, I can't find a page I don't treasure."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"Well no, I haen't read them all, but I've read a lot of them, and only Robert Graves comes close. This book does what historical fiction is supposed to do and seldom does: evoke a time and place that is not our time and our place. So much of historical fiction is a but a Potemkin village; contemporary characters and attitudes promenading before superficial historical settings. This book calls up in imagination Athens at its most critical hour. It is both eloquent and deeply moving. There is nothing greater in the tricky world of historical fiction writing."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"The Last of the Wine is arguably one of Mary Renault's best books. Its moving tale of the collapse of Athens into Sparta and its eventual resurrection are seen through the eyes of the growing figure of Alexias. He becomes interested in the phliosophy of Socrates and through Socrates meets various young philosophers and students of philosophy, including Xenophon, conservative but brave; Phaedo, a slave who comes to respect the people who destroyed his world; and Plato, extremely young, but also extremely wise; there is also Lysis, with whom Alexias becomes involved, at first just as friends, but later sexually. The most amazing moment came when the news of the battle of Goat's Creek was brought to Athens. For the time being, democracy is lost; any reader would feel the deep sadness of that moment. Democracy is restored, but rejoicings are tempered by the fact that the people will destroy Socrates, clearly foreshadowed at the end.This book encompasses all the great features of Athens and shows their rise and fall. It is also extremely moving."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"Take a seat and read the first 3 pages. Learn how Alexias survived his first weeks in plague ravaged Athens. Every word grips, pulls you into a time never to be seen again. I have read this novel many times and occasionally after reading some drivel that has left me despondent I'll pick this up and re-read the first three pages, more perfectly wrought than the necklace with which William de Villehardouin wooed and won his Byzantine princess. Gore Vidal has called the novel sentimental, and I think that is correct, but not in a negative way. (You can read his crystalline Julian to get an appreciation of his treatment of historical fiction.) But I do not like to be distanced from the subject. Mary Renault is unafraid of exposing the heart regardless the differences of time and place."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"Much has already been said about this book and Mary Renault by other reviewers, and said quite well. All I have to add to that is this: it's been over a month since I finished reading this book (I pretty much swallowed it up whole) and I'm still thinking about it. The time period and the characters are so vividly fleshed out that I feel like I went into the book and then walked right out of it with the dust of Kerameikos on my feet. I think Lysis and Alexias are going to stay with me for a very long time as very welcome guests."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"One of the most tender and beautiful depictions of a love relationship between two men that you will ever read. Literary but accessible, The Last of The Wine truly captures the spirit of ancient Greece. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"This wonderful story of a young man living in the Athens of the 5th century BC is about friendships, family values, honor, death, love and coming of age in a time of great change. The reader is able to feel with Alexias as he watches his city, the birthplace of democracy and home of humankind's greatest thinkers, gradually fall to the Spartans and into the depths of despair. Mary Renault's ability to take human emotions in perfect historical context is astounding. This book should be read by anyone who has an interest in anything, because it covers it all!"},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"This is a beautiful, expertly painted story about two men and their love for each other, their city, and honor. The implications of this love are left ambiguous. One feels as if he has indeed drunk the last of the wine, and it brings about a wonderful, sad dream."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"Don't read this book! It's laced with homosexual themes and descriptions of homosexual acts between Alexias (the narrator) and Lysus his older male lover, as well as many other characters. The jist of the story seems to me to be more aimed at describing Alexias and his feelings toward other men than telling the story of Athens from an economic and political standpoint. This book seems to be a requirement for many college history classes so consider yourself warned! I think this book was a major waste of time, there are definately better ways to learn the history of Athens for that time period. Alexias wasn't even a real person for crying out loud! He was fictional!"},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"We had to read this book in Sophmore English (circa 1977-78). In the entire sophmore class, only two people actually read the book from cover to cover; most of us never made it through the first chapter. First off, none of us could understand what this book was about, and second after the first few pages (I only got to 35 pages myself), it had undertones (overtones?) that could not be overcome, especially in a Catholic school. Thankfully, we never got tested on it. This book was trashed as soon as school was over for the year and if this book ever went out of print will be not a day too soon.I do not know, as an adult, if any of us would \\"choose\\" to read it for pleasure. I think any book that was \\"required reading\\" sort of kills the pleasure of reading it again decades later for your own amusement."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"I gave it as much as two stars because the author does write well. She also clearly did a lot of research on the time and it shows. However, if you are not into reading about glamorized homosexuality, this books gets very tired very soon. I say 'homosexuality' but it is pedophilia, really--the protagonist, Alexis is a young teenaged boy and his 'lover' (abuser) is a mature man. We are supposed to believe that this relationship makes the boy more mature, more intelligent, more brave, etc. etc. etc. and that this kind of thing was what made the Greeks so great (tell that to NAMBLA). Sex is not described in detail--we are just told how enobling this 'love' is ad nauseam; I guess because the book is aimed at normal people, and when you're propagandizing in the obvious way that Renault is, details that would gross most readers out are best kept hidden. Famous names are freely thrown around and the impression that one is meant to get is that our modern society would rise to a higher cultural level if only we all got open-minded like the Greeks. Unfortunately, in the fifty years since the book was written, we HAVE got more open-minded and what have we got? Not Socrates (who wasn't gay, by the way, neither were Homer, or AEschylus)) but queer eyes for straight guys, AIDS and crystal meth and a lot of lobbying for homosexual 'marriage'--which even the Greeks had sense enough not to try. Lysis may be messing around with little worshipful Alexis, but marries a woman. He wants to have children, after all. I say a 'woman' but he actually marries a shadowy little girl. None of the female characters in the book is much (the other main one is Alexis' stepmother) which is a little odd, since the book is written by a lesbian, but she really does seem have thought herself thoroughly into a male homosexual frame of mind (if you think that is a worthy accomplishment).If you really want to learn about Greek culture, I would suggest reading one of the great works from the time, such as the Iliad, the Oedipus Rex, the Oresteia, the Odyssey--none of which have homosexual or pedophilia themes by the way. (For that, you have to stick to reading only the Symposium, where the homosexual propagandizing is all put in the mouth of Alcibiades, hardly a role model)."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"\\"The Last of the Wine\\" had a deep influence on my life. Recommended to me by a fine Spaniard in Amsterdam as \\"the best gay novel ever written,\\" I naturally bought it at the first chance. I think it changed my life, a little bit. It brought home to me two facts I have been dealing with ever since.The first fact is that men can and do love one another. The problem with the word \\"homosexual\\" is that it manages to suggest that it's all about sex. For me, it's all about love. But many gay men have been damaged by their upbringing, and continue to insist that it's all about sex, because that's as far as they will go.\\"The Last of the Wine\\" has its priorities right, in my view. There is no question that Alexias and Lysis have sex (off-camera), but the love between them is much more important.The second fact is that men can and do love both sexes. In modern America, the very idea is brushed off as \\"nonsense,\\" and there is almost no dissent on this subject.Things were quite different in Ancient Greece, as this meticulously-researched and supremely well-written novel points out. And, if we are so different from the men in Ancient Greece, well: would that be a matter of cultural programming, or a matter of biology?Read \\"The Last of the Wine\\" and wonder about these questions! :-) Or not. The most important thing is to read it. It really is a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"What makes a novel for \\"young adults\\"? Is it one written for them, one marketed to them, or one which they will like? The correct answer is, of course, \\"any or all.\\"I cannot find the reference, but I remember reading an interview with an author who had been quite successful in writing novels for adults, who had been asked to try her hand at a young adult novel. She was advised that the best way to do that was to make her main character the right age, and go on from there.Given that the main action of the novel starts when the narrator, Alexias, is fifteen and ends when he is in his early twenties, this would classify the work as a young adult novel, although it is usually marketed and criticized as an adult novel.The story is set in Athens, during and just after the Peloponnesian War. Alexias and his lover Lysis become pupils of Socrates. However, it is not all dry philosophical discussion. Alexias is a middle-distance runner and Lysis is a pankratist. (Pankration was a Greek combat sport; it means 'all power' and involved anything short of biting, gouging, and hair-pulling. Kicks, punches, throw-holds, grappling, and joint-locks were all parts of the pankratist's repertoire. I suppose the nearest thing we have would be full-contact karate.)Now, why would a teenager be interested in this? Well, the popularity of such films as Troy and The Three Hundred shows that Classical civilization is still of interest to young people; so does the continued growth of enrollments in high school Latin classes. Both war and sports--subjects which young men in this age group find interesting--are important parts of the plot. And, last of all, it is such a well-written, interesting story that one can hardly fail to be sucked into it.Lastly, for GLBT teens, it offers us a view of a society in which same-sex relationships are seen as normal, even expected. Indeed, Alexias' year-mate Xenophon--yes, the same person who later wrote the Anabasis; Renault is famous for putting real and made-up characters together--is totally heterosexual. At least Alexias suspects that he may be, but says that (a) he couldn't bring himself to ask in so many words and (b) if it were he felt rather sorry for his friend who would thus have missed out on an important part of life. When Alexias' father goes off to Sicily with the army, he and his son sit down for The Talk--but it isn't about girls. Renault presents all this very matter-of-factly. That such a society could exist once implies that it could exist again.In spite of this, Renault does not idealize Ancient Greece. The evil of slavery, the low place of women, and the casual cruelty are unblinkingly presented. (For example, the way prisoners of war were treated makes recent US violations of the Geneva Conventions look tame.) Contrast this with the thoroughly judgmental tone of Frank Yerby's Goat Song, which imposes early-twentieth century values on Classical Greek culture.For a more extended discussion of Mary Renault's writing, see http://www.glbtq.com/literature/renault_m.html (accessed 6NOV07); I would recommend this--and indeed all of her mature period novels--for high school on up. The Mask of Apollo is set about a generation later, and sets things up for her trilogy about Alexander the Great (Fire from Heaven, The Persian Boy, Funeral Games.)Recommended for high school and up."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"I first read this book when I was in 7th grade. Perhaps I was a bit young for it, but each reading illuminated more and more about history, human nature and philosophy. These characters are so real, so true in all their human foibles that I identified with them completely. The death of Lysis, told in its understated fashion, truly made me weep. And the historical characters are not caricatures but individuals of flesh and blood. I particularly liked the sub-plot about Phaedo and the Melian War and how that event infiltrated the lives of every character. For me this book only can be compared with Graves' I Claudius books - multi-layered and rich in language and ideas."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"The Last of the Wine is one of Mary Renault's wonderful historical novels about ancient Greece.

It was full of historical detail and seemed very well-researched, even if the writing was a little hard to get through at times. I did wonder, and none of the other reviewers have mentioned this, so maybe I'm way off target, if the book's treatment of the abuse of democracy towards the end was supposed to be a reflection on the McCarthyism of the 1950s. Especially when you consider that the book was written in 1956...The comparison, which works even if it is not intentional, really struck me at the very end, where Sokrates is referred to as &quot;anti-democratic&quot; and &quot;un-Athenian&quot; for promoting independant thought and free speech."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"The book opened up the wonderful world of ancient Greece.

Mary Renault has the gift of making things clear without stopping to explain. 'Last of the Wine' is in the first person, and the narrator, Alexias, speaks as he would to a person of his time and culture. But he is never obscure to a person from the other side of the world and 2400 years later. Such writing, lucid, even limpid, but effortlessly achieving a very difficult task, is such as to make other writers despair. This book is not fantasy, but every fantasy and SF writer ought to read it, to see how well it can be done.The subject of 'Last of the Wine' is the making of a man, by prosperity and adversity, triumph and disaster, love and hate. Alexias faces, in his Aegean microcosm, the whole breadth of human experience. And that is why 'Last of the Wine' is a novel for anyone who is interested in anything.A previous reviewer claimed that this book is 'laced with descriptions of homosexual acts'. I can only say that this is a wild exaggeration. Alexias is bisexual, and his love for Lycis dominates his youth and the book. But the only sexual act mentioned is a single kiss. If that puts you off, so be it: but I think that you would be making a mistake not to read this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"An English teacher recommended that I read Mary Renault's excellent book \\"The King Must Die,\\" and because \\"The Bull From The Sea\\" had been checked out of the library when I finished its predecessor, I took another book by Renault. \\"The Last of the Wine\\" cemented my admiration for her work, but there's nothing I can say to praise Renault that hasn't already been said.\\"The Last of the Wine\\" is set in Athens during the Peloponnesian War and is told by a young aristocrat named Alexias. Alexias, an unwanted child, begins his story with the plague that killed his mother and uncle, among others, as well as Pericles the statesman. The famous names appear as people who move in the same circles Alexias expects to move in as an adult; friends to his father Myron, associates, politicians, and--as this is Athens--wooers of Alexias as he becomes an adolescent.But besides himself, Alexias's story concerns two other men: a stonemason turned philosopher named Sokrates, who helps Alexias out of his shy awkwardness, and Lysis, the man with whom Alexias falls in love. According to Athenian tradition, the older of a homosexual pair was supposed to teach the younger how to fight, to hunt, to behave in society, to be a man; Lysis does all this and also imparts to Alexias a desire to exceed his own limitations.If this story was simply about the downfall of Sokrates, it would be tragic, for Sokrates' story is bound up with the fall of Athens and the rise of democracy after the Spartan victory and the tyranny of the Thirty who terrorized the city afterwards. But it is also about the relationship between Lysis, a man whose integrity survives one disappointment after another, and Alexias, who seems destined to lose every dream he has. The two of them overcome jealousy, loss on the battlefield, plague and starvation, and poverty; the one thing they cannot overcome is Lysis's determination to see things as they are, and Alexias's need to see things as he wants them to be.The characters are richly drawn; Renault could make her people live through simple descriptions and dialogue, and the reader will feel as if they've lost friends when they finish the book. Alexias's point of view is set well ahead of the book's place in time; the narrative has a poignance, an air of regret, that makes the moments of happiness seem that much more precious. But there are wonderful scenes as well. Any scene with Phaidon, the courtesan who became a disciple of Sokrates, crackles with tension and energy. Agathon the playwright is shown as charming and flamboyant, and Sokrates is as homey and comfortable as a beloved uncle. As for villains, who needs the Spartans when we have Kritias, a notorious member of the Thirty, a man who attempts to molest Alexias in his boyhood and then later helps to ruin his family?The title comes from the Athenian dinner custom of tossing the dregs of the wine cup into the serving bowl and reading the patterns of the droplets for an omen. The Peloponnesian War came through Athens' dreams of empire, and Sparta's rivalry with her sister city-state. Athens' loss in the war foreshadowed the downfall of its own prestige; never again did the city rise to the power it had held prior to the conflict, nor did it ever produce, in Classical times, men like those who made it great. \\"The Last of the Wine\\" is a tragic story, but it is also a farewell to greatness, the glory that was Athens."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"&quot;When I was a young boy, if I was sick or in trouble, or had been beaten at school, I used to remember that on the day I was born my father had wanted to kill me.&quot;This is the opening line of The Last of the Wine. I anticipated finding a weak, sickly protagonist, plagued by misfortune. This was not the case. I found a man who lived his life in dignity, honor, and devotion, even with such a humbling beginning to his life.Alexias, the narrator and protagonist of this story, matures and grows to manhood during the Peloponnesian War, in its final days. Alexias reaches young adulthood without the benefit of a father for many years, believing him to be dead, and takes over as head of the family, caring for his stepmother and sister, defending his honor, and the honor of his father, as others try to corrupt him. He is fair of looks, posessed of good health, and strives to better himself, body and mind, throughout the book.He meets and falls in love with Lysis, another Athenian boy, and the two form a life-long bond of friendship and devotion to one another, which extends to Alexias compromising himself to rescue the virtue and honor of Thalia, the bride of Lysis, when famine comes to Athens.I think one of my favorite aspects of Mary Renault's novels is her treatment of homosexual subject matter is not only extraordinary for the time her books were written, but also reads as though the sexual nature of the friendships, especially the one between Lysis and Alexias, is secondary to the genuine love and caring they feel for one another. Mary Renault's gentle treatment of, at the time, such taboo subject matter, never comes across as censored, or stifled, in any way.This book is about many things; friendship, honor, principle, love, committment, and sense of duty. Of all the Mary Renault books I have now read, I find this to be the most complete telling of the life of a man in ancient Greece. The reader travels with Alexias, from his formative years as a boy, through his training as a soldier, his belief that as head of his family he must provide and care for them, his stepping down from that role when his 'not so dead as he thought' father returns to Athens, his struggle with complying with his father's wishes, while trying to retain the values and beliefs he has instilled in himself during his father's absence, and so much more. We see him risk his life to fight alongside Lysis to see Athens freed, not only because he knew it to be the right thing for himself and the people, but because Lysis believed in it, and his love for Lysis was enough for him to support the cause, even if it meant his own death.I dare to say that I will never find another author so in love with this time period that they can re-create it with such beauty and passion. I hope that other readers will enjoy all of Mary Renault's books as much as I have."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"Mary Renault wrote several contemporary novels of varying quality (&quot;The Charioteer&quot; being by far the best) before she decided to delve into ancient Athens and found her genius of making history seem so vibrantly alive that we feel we are right there in the middle of it. Renault's first historical novel, &quot;The Last of the Wine&quot;, is set during the Peloponnesian War, in an Athens grown too powerful and too complacent for its own good, riding for a calamitous fall. Renault introduces us to Alexias, sixteen years old when this story opens, the surviving son of an aristocratic family, whose conservative father disapproves of his hanging around the agora picking up all kinds of new ideas, and especially the dangerous notions of a philosopher named Sokrates (Renault scrupulously keeps the Greek spelling of proper names throughout the book). His father being called to serve in the disastrous Sicilian expedition leaves Alexias feeling as if a weight had rolled off him; out from under his father's thumb and free to spread his wings, he gravitates closer to Sokrates and a young Athenian nobleman named Lysis who becomes his closest friend and then his lover. Bisexuality was a given in ancient Greece and Renault writes about such relationships as a matter of fact. His father returning from the war beaten, degraded and escaping from the harsh slavery imposed on captured prisoners of war precipitates a crisis in the household; and Alexias and Lysis leave home to join the Athenian navy and find their own independence. The relationship between these two is not just that of lovers but as mentor and pupil; as the older of the two, it is Lysis' responsibility to train his younger friend in the ways of war, honor and manhood; and it's a responsibility he takes seriously. Lacking a benevolent father figure, Lysis becomes all in all to Alexias -- lover, big brother, best friend and confidant. There are inevitable conflicts between them as Alexias grows to maturity and the two begin to grow away from each other to build their own lives as adults; but their relationship grows deeper as it adapts to changing times and needs. Alexias says of Lysis, &quot;It was he who taught me to be a man.&quot;&quot;The Last of the Wine&quot; is a story of war and friendship, love and honor, set against the turbulent background of classical Greece. Here you'll meet some familiar figures from history textbooks: Alexias' contemporaries, Plato and Xenophon; Phaedo, the captive Melian boy who grew up to become a philosopher himself; and the fascinating character of the charming double-dealer Alkibiades, the renegade Athenian who played both ends against the middle and perhaps more than any other individual helped bring about Athens' defeat in the war and its subsequent decline. Renault's bringing these real figures into her narrative makes it seem that much more alive and immediate; as we read this excellent book we travel deeper and deeper into 5th-century B.C. Athens, and it's with some regret that we turn the last page and are jolted back into the present."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"When I was in college I read this book for the first time. It has been a part of me ever since. I have only re-read it once, and I couldn't bring myself to finish it because I couldn't face the loss of Lysis again. So deeply did I sink into the character of Alexias that I actually became ill when tragedy struck. I will never be able to read it again but I carry it with me always. I became so interested in Greek history after reading this book and all of Ms. Renault's Greek novels that I studied Ancient Greek in college so that I could read Plato, Plutarch, and the other great writers of the time in the original Greek.This book and all of her other books handles the subject of bisexuality with taste and discretion. There is nothing explictly homosexual in any of her novels. If that's what you are looking for you'll be diappointed. The reader should be advised to remember that bisexual relationships were not unusual at the time and any casual examination of the social sturcture of ancient Greek society will make it clear why such relationships occurred."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"I first read this at 14 and was bowled over. 40 years later I'm still bowled over. This is certainly the best novel I've ever read, and only rivalled for sheer writing brilliance by her THE MASK OF APOLLO. But MASK is a very different book, and though it has its own delights, lacks the magic of discovery that permeates WINE. On every page, one feels with Alexias that one is discovering and coming to slowly comprehend a world at once new and old, a world glistening with the strangeness of antiquity yet immediately understandable, with characters one feels one could stop and talk to on any steetcorner. And the sheer intelligence in every line exceeds anything else I've ever come across. In his biography David Sweetman tells us that many of Mary Renault's classmates at university were afraid of her intellect, and I can believe it! Her insights are astonishing--psychological, philosophical and political. And she makes it all seem so easy, like &quot;the conversation of a cultivated man&quot;, as Dr Johnson once defined the ideal writing style. Who was this woman, who could bring the disparate elements of the hardest genre in writing into such sharp and brilliant focus, and make it all seem like something that just occured to her after dinner? She was one in a million, and this her first historical novel is for me the yardstick for all fiction. I've read it a dozen times--no doubt I'll be going for another dozen. If I ever had to learn a book by heart to preserve it, a la the conclusion of FARENHEIT 451, this would be the book."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"I've loved this book for half my life, and I've assigned it to students in Western Civ. classes in universities. Be very clear, now: this is not a novel about the battles of the great war between Athens and Sparta. It's not intended to be like Stephen Pressfield's account of the career of Alkibiades. It's about the decay of Athens' greatness, about the end of the Athenians' belief in their own glory and greatness. It's a tragic book-- about the end of a vision of democracy, about the ruin of a family, about the end of a love affair. But it's brilliantly written-- Renault crafted the language to feel Attic and distanced, and she tried to take up the attitudes and beliefs of her characters. I always read the opening lines to students-- the narrator Alexias blithely recalling that on the day of his birth, his father had ordered him put to death as too weak and sickly to bother raising. Renault's portrayal of Sokrates is sympathetic, human, and sad-- a fine depiction of tragic greatness. This is a novel that I'll assign to classes again, and certainly one that I'll put on my list of books for a desert island."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"Keep in mind that this gorgeously written and touching story was first published in 1956 by Renault, an Oxford-educated British woman, dead now 25 years.\\"Last of the Wine\\" is much more than a coming of age tale, as we like to call some of these stories nowadays. Far from it. Yes, it is a gay love story, sans sex, a subtle and timeless and accurately portrayed romance between 2 beautiful young men in 5th Century B.C. Greece - thus, before Alexander. There's a good bit of history and a lot of fun in meeting some of the incomparable ancients - an aging Socrates and a young Plato, and in hearing about others, Alkibiades, for one. If you manage to read Steven Pressfield and Renault, as well as others writing of this era, it all begins to make sense.Renault seems magically to understand perfectly love in its deepest sense between men and those touchy human aspects of love between anyone: possessiveness, jealousy, soft adoration, absence and longing, and the overwhelming desire to spend all one's time with one's love, to say nothing of comfortable easy silences and shared thoughts.The 2 primary characters, Alexis (the younger of the two by 6 years) and Lysis, are physical ideals and good to the core. They know how to enjoy the long-lost simple pleasures. I loved them both. She also grasps firmly the intricacies of family, of obligation and of the inevitable inscrutable conflict between father and son.\\"Last of the Wine\\" is as contemporary as your latest e-mail exchange with your partner or offspring. She writes with finesse and profundity. Consider these excerpts.Page 241. \\"It was a warm spring evening; one smelt the sea, and supper cooking on pinewood fires, and the scent of flowers upon the hillside; we sat in the doorway of our hut in the late sun, greeting friends as they passed.\\"Page 242. \\"The evening sun glowed like bronze upon the reed thatch of the roofs; here and there men were singing about the fires. I (Alexis) said in my heart, \`Such things as these are the pleasures of manhood.'\\"Page 243. \\"But we sat a little longer; for as the sun sank, the moon had risen. Her light had mixed with the afterglow, and the hill behind the city was the colour of skins of lions.\\"Page 244. \\"'Nothing will change, Alexis' (Lysis speaking). \`No that is false; there is change wherever there is life.... But what kind of fool would plant an apple-slip, to cut it down at the season when the fruit is setting? Flowers you can get every year, but only with time the tree that shades your doorway and grows into the house with each year's sun and rain.'\\" As Adlai Stevenson once said, \\"Change is inevitable. Change for the better is a full-time job.\\" These young men had a firm grasp on reality.The story traces not only the rise of fledgling democracy but also its temporary demise. The build-up to Socrates' eventual murder by authorities fearful of his teachings is compelling. The end of the story is both uplifting and sad.Renault's \\"Notes\\" at the end of the book are insightful, the \\"Chronology Table\\" is helpful, and the map of \\"Greece and the Aegean\\" is a good anchor for orienting yourself to political and physical geography.Yes, it is fiction. Yes, the over-riding theme is a gay love story. And yes, it's enthralling and gracious. Relax into the story, flow with its pace, learn from it, and read it with unabashed pleasure. Forget the homophobe reviewers who are falsely \\"offended\\" by the story (after, of course, they knowingly have read every word!)."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"Classics is my minor in college, so I have read quite a few historical fiction books, but this has definetely been one of the best. As the story develops, you can see Alexias grow and mature as a man, and his relationships with his father, mother, his friends and his beloved Lysis change and mature through the years. This is a highly knowledgeable, well-researched true history of the times politically, as well as being a tender, warm story of love and friendship and a tale of courage, patriotism and the power of freedom. If you have ever wondered about the nature of love, wisdom, friendship, pride, sincerity, faith, courage and life, you must read this book. Mary Renault does an impeccable job."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"Like another of your readers, this affected me deeply the first time I read it almost 25 years ago!I had been looking for some good literature, perferably with an historical basis, one very warm summer afternoon during my university life. I picked this up in the student union bookshop and have never given it up over the years nor will I ever. This is a richly laden story of a youg man's maturation, personal encounters with the great and the sordid, as well as the scope of historical Athens and Greece, but in paticular, the eternal love of friendship.This friendship explores all that encompasses the depths of such a soulful journey (yes, it's bisexual, however, the only physical encounter is that of a kiss, as well as several descriptions of masculine strength, athleticism, and physical beauty, so if you are not given to an inquiring mind, scan over these passages and read the rest!)This book cannot leave you unaffected by Alexis' tale of friendship, family, community, and our eternal search of being apart of someone else's love and a kindred soul."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"mary renault does a brilliant job of painting Athens as the powerful,fragile center of the ancient world at the time of Socrates and the awful beginning of the peloponnesian wars.

A timeless classic."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"As a foreigner reader, I should like to state a customer analysis over less poetic than Renault's, but both them try, as long as I can see it, to tell us how the ancients dealt with love, war, hatred and the possibility of living. Both them dealt with what, one should say today, gay themes. Or, at least, love among human people, regardless their sex. Renault is more intimate, more occupied with the soul. In \\"The Last of the Wine\\" which I freely translate to portuguese adding a \\"drop\\", she deals with a warrior. Haply, we hardly see the warrior, but frequently see the person, worried about the ones he loves, or hates, always trying to belong to the world he lives in. The ambiance tells us the story, makes us fell awkward, but send us to the marvelous navel of western culture. Gods are there all time, but we are constructing a future, whichever difficult it is. If anyone should like to know where it was the point the world took a hint of it's possibilities, I should recommend \\"The Last of the Wine\\". Athens at it's upmost, and near end"},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"I freely admit I'm a bit of a historical novel-aholic, and I really, really wanted to love this book...but, I found Renault's tale of male love set against the backdrop of the Athenian/Spartan conflict very uneven. Certain events are riveting (Alexias running and winning the long race, Lysis fighting and losing a wrestling match at the same games), others humdrum (the telling of Alcibiades' restoration to favor after defeating the Oligarchs left me longing for Steven Pressfield's infinitely better &quot;The Tides of War&quot;). I think there are better, more vivid tales out there covering the same ground. Renault's writing feels a bit dated, and the central relationship of the book (Alexias and Lysis are described constantly as &quot;lovers&quot;, yet the details of whether or not they actually physically consummate their homosexual relationship are left ludicrously vague) never fully gels. Still, the historical details are rich, and there are brilliant moments peppered throughout."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"I've loved all of Mary Renault's work until The Last of the Wine.

I heard Mary Renault was a master of classical historical fiction, and I especially love the period around the Peloponnesian War, so I gave this book of her a try first. I did enjoy parts of reading it, I got quite interested in several of the characters and a few of the scenes, such as competing in the games, or protecting Athens as part of the city guard service. However, it's far too long of a time period and too much to take on for such a small novel. Which would have been fine, if the author hadn't felt the need to explain so much of the political goings-on and battles. As is, she jams in a massive amount of very factually written history between more flowery prose and I found it rather jarring. In the end I skipped through all the history and politics, because it was about as exciting as reading a dry history book, and skipped to the character plots."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"[excerpts of meaning from Mary Renault'swondrous historical novel of life in5th century B.C.

The novel takes place during the Peloponnesian War (c. 430 B.C. - 400 B.C.) a Greek civil war of sorts between Athens and allies and Sparta and allies.There are many famous personages here: Socrates, Pericules and others. However, the main character of the novel is not one of these. Alexias (the main character), is a young man who grows up in a noble Athenian family. He has a full ancient Greek life: participates in war, competes in the Isthmian Games (similar to the Olympics but at Corinth), has a homosexual relationship and then is married to a woman. One of the main problems I had with the novel is the way homosexuality is treated; it is considered part of the status quo, so to speak. It is historically accurate (i.e. the Greeks would act like that) but it is immoral nonetheless.One of the most interesting parts of the book is the effects of the War on Athens. To appreciate this, some background is necessary. Approximately 50 years before the start of this war, Athens led a military alliance that won the Persian Wars (against Persia, the superpower of the day). After the Persian Wars, Athens emerged as the naval and cultural leader of Greece. Athens also had a large military-political empire. Near the end of the novel, the Spartans (and their allies) lay siege to Athens. Inside the City, the Athenians suffer. There is substantial inflation and the nobles (including Alexias) start to suffer and hit the poverty line. In order to earn money, Alexias is forced to pose for statue sculptors and the wife of his best friend almost turns to prostitution. Then, the Spartans have their great revenge. They tear down the Long Walls... These were a great symbol of Athenian military power. A modern analogy might be if North Korea conquered America and then publicly dissembled and then destroyed all US nuclear missiles.The novel was very historically accurate and I found it very fun to walk around in the Agora (briefly defined as the meeting area of the city where business, politics, philosophy etc would happen) in Athens. I could see the places that the characters visited as I wandered around. This novel is a good way to get some feel for the time period and what it might have been like to live then. Historical fiction serves as an interesting complement to more traditional ways of understanding history.I know some other people who have read, &quot;The Mask of Apollo,&quot; by the same author and I may just read that as well."},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","review":"The book takes place in Ancient Greece. There is a map and a glossary of Greek terms, but referring to that grows old pretty quickly! If you have studied Ancient Greece and are familiar with Greek terms, you might find the setting more appealing than I did. The characters are predominately male (all but one) and go about their day wrestling, hunting and fighting wars. Their names run from familiar to difficult to pronounce. The author spends an inordinate amount of time with descriptions of irrelevant events. She uses run on sentences and nonsensical similes.

If you choose to read it, I advise reading in the morning!"},{"Title":"With The Grain : 200 delectable recipes using wheat, corn, rice, oats, barley and other grains","review":"Having read numerous fascinating and interesting works by Raymond Sokolov, I was unpleasantly surprised by the quality of the recipes in With the Grain. Not only are some almost identical recipes repeated numerous times with only minor adjustments - (there were no fewer than six recipes for stuffed grape leaves in six different chapters!)- but some recipes omitted ingredients or made blatantly dangerous suggestions. The Jambalaya recipe on page 126 calls for 6 pounds of chicken to be browned and set aside; but the reader is never informed when to add the chicken back into the recipe. The recipe for Orzo with Chicken Breasts and Red Peppers requires that the marinade, in which raw chicken has been sitting in for six hours, be strained and used as an uncooked dressing on the Orzo pasta. As my marinade was filled with raw chicken blood, I found this not only unpalatable but a clear example of unsafe food handling. How could an editor let that one slip through? Were these recipes not tested? To his credit, Mr. Sokolov did add some interesting historical facts and excerpts from other sources, but his recipes did not satisfy my hunger for easy to follow directions. If you are looking for a grain cookbook that has safe, easy to follow recipes in addition to &quot;nourishing food for thought&quot;, I would recommend Nutrition Secrets of the Ancients by Dr. Gene Spiller and Rowena Hubbard.

It is important that emphasis is put on peripheral signs as they often supply the deciding clues for the correct diagnosis. Peripheral signs are for example completely undervalued in German literature on the subject. What I miss a little bit is what you find in recent German books by H. Bl&ouml;mer and P.

The reader will gain a greater understanding for the operatic form that Mozart loved. I consider my investment of time in reading this book well spent."},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"I would never say that I have any real knowledge of classical music, but there are a few composers who have slid into my awareness and settled into my appreciation. Ravel, Debussy, Handel, Stravinsky, Beethoven, and, of course Mozart. His music is compelling on so many levels. His musical pairings are so versatile, and he brings out so many different things in his instruments. And in spite of the complexity, the music can make your spirit soar, reaching right into your core. Requiem reminds me of Dostevsky's reaction to a Hans Holbein painting, \\"A man could even lose his faith from that.\\"When you marry the sensations his music elicits with his life--maybe more so his death--its mind-bendingly tragic. The combination of his genius, youth, and tragedy make him one of the most mythological figures of the Western Canon.Peter Gay's brief biography of Mozart gives him greater depth while acknowledging the legends the preceed him. Legend vaguely alludes to Mozart as someone who is haunted and is consequentially given to fits of silliness and frivolity. Gay proves that what most haunted Mozart was his father-- the most influential figure for the young prodigy. Serving also as his son's manager, critic, and booking agent, he was awestruck by Mozart's talent, but also embittered that his own talent paled in comparison. In an effort to make a musical contribution, he puts rigorous demands on Mozart, insisting he devote more time to his craft, to the point of monasticism (even though he was unfathomably prolific). When Mozart established his independence financially and familially, he carried a heavy burden of guilt the rest of his life, wanting only to please the man he felt so indebted to.Gay attests that Mozart's fatal flaw was his inability to tighten his belt. His concept of \\"necessary\\" included a lot of billiards and frequent entertainment, lavish furniture as well as a house staff. His debtors were largely people from his Masonic Temple, but as they mounted, his self-loathing increased. He suffered the disappointment of his wife, his father, and his Masonic brothers, got in more debt to pay other debts, and was forced to take assignments he deemed unworthy of his attention.Gay does a great driving home these core points: paternal influence, debt, and Mozart's crude sense of humor. But he makes many connections with what was happening in Mozart's life and how it connects to the material. Gay tracks Mozart's interest in the Schubert's concertos and his efforts to make his own concerto. He also tracks the history of the Opera, and Mozart's contributions. But I'm most interested in what kind of mind is revealed in the source material? How does it represent his music and his ability to make the most callous critics swoon?One of the few insights his letters give into the workings of Mozart's mind is that he enjoyed composing in building where people practiced. While in Milan he writes to his sister, \\"above is a violinist, below us another one, next to us a singing teacher giving lessons, in the room across from ours there is an oboist. That is rather amusing to compose by! Gives one lots of ideas.\\" Its hard to imagine being able to hold so many sounds in your head. But the fact that it could not only be tolerated, but used as inspiration, is really profound. Making the ethereal nature of his music all the more alluring.Ultimately, I'm impressed that Gay can discuss Mozart comprehensively, the man, his music, and the people in his life in only 175 pages.[..]"},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"I have a confession to make: while I have long regarded Mozart as sublime, I was not really that familiar with him, only owning a bog-standard \\"greatest hits\\" collection and La Finta Simplice. After reading this book, suddenly I want to hear nothing else and have begun to acquire the greatest works identified within.I am already an admirer of Pater Gay based on his monumental 2-volume work on the Enlightenment, and I must say, the light touch revealed in this small book is, well, a revelation. Gay is not merely the biographer of Mozart, but also the Mozart of biographers. Sometimes I wish that such short books were longer, but for Mozart this was just right. Mozart is in the music, after all.Gay does not explain this enigmatic genius, but he does make him accessible and give an impression of the depth of his genius - for as a sometime bedroom rock guitarist and still listener I have no doubt that much of that genius evades my ear as it stands. Scatological of wit and irresponsible of money, Mozart was still a genius of unique standing and reputation, being known as a child prodigy at an age when most of us in today's world would have only the vaguest portents of our adult career. Moreover, he never stopped developing, neither as a prodigious child nor as a grown man. Who knows what could have come of him had he had the opportunity to die in his dotage. Alas, it was not to be. A mere decade after finally shaking free of the bondage of his controlling father, he was in his grave.That bondage followed him even after his father's death, but musically Mozart was always his own man. That grave, recorded in popular memory as a pauper's, might not have seemed so unfitting to Mozart as to us. With the French revolution still drying to black crust on the baskets of Paris's squares, the nobility were not in the mood for ostentation and the Emperor had quashed lavish funerals. Mozart went into a grave typical of his time, his music to fall into contention and bowdlerisation for a little time to come. Mozart, a Catholic but not an especially pious figure, scathing of Voltaire but a freemason of the Age of Reason, would probably have found it fitting. Mozart took lovers and a wife, with an appealing affection for women, travelled, learned languages and was not averse to a party. Truly, this would not have been a wasted life even were it not for his exquisite legacy.Gay's work is wonderfully light reading, devoured in a rush. I have heard the Beatles referred to as the Mozart of pop. Now biography has its own exemplar.And no, Salieri didn't poison him."},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"I purchased this as a Christmas stocking stuffer for my 17 year old nephew. He's a musician and composer. He told me that the book is quite fascinating and has made him want to read a full-length biography of Mozart. As an avid reader myself, that tells me that the Penguin edition must be quite good if it encourages the reader to explore the subject further."},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"Peter Gay's book on Mozart is truly utilitarian, just a short book with all the facts and a few minor clarifications on the folklore surrounding Mozart. The author follows his subject chronologically, with a special emphasis on the familial relationships and Mozart's unusual correspondence.Gay suggests that Mozart's achievements as a child prodigee may have been partly the work of an ambitious father. Gay also puts to rest the enduring rumours that Mozart was poisoned, murdered by a patron, or buried in a pauper's grave. None of these actually happened, despite what we have seen on the silver screen the last 30 years.The book is well written, Gay is an entertaining and thorough author, but dont expect anything really new or controversial here."},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"Peter Gay's \`Mozart' is the sort of book a heavy-hitting historian like Gay writes while on holiday at the beach. Lite, witty and short, but still substantial enough to satisfy. (The same could be said for many of the excellent volumes of the Penguin Lives series--alas, now defunct.)As nearly every other reviewer has pointed out, this slim volume treats Mozart's correspondingly brief life with Gay's celebrated prose style. No new details are introduced, at least nothing destined to alter Mozart scholarship (for all the details, you'll want the much longer \`Mozart: A Life' by Maynard Solomon). What Gay brings to Mozart's life is readability, historical context (this is PETER GAY, after all) and a nice quick summary for those readers who have an interest in Mozart but may not care to spend more than a few hours studying him.One nice advantage of the book, especially for those looking to gain a better understanding of Mozart's music, is that Gay connects the events of Mozart's life to the production of some of his musical masterpieces.

In other words it partakes of some of the Classical qualities which so distinguished Mozart's work. And this when one of Gay's major points is to stress that Mozart's dark side was a very great part of his music. Gay traces the story of the child prodigy who unlike most child prodigies continued his complex development throughout his working life, creating in the course of this a vast body of work at the highest level in all the musical genres of the time. Two of his friends Johann Christian Bach and the great Haydn helped him on his way. Haydn told Mozart's proud, overbearing, pushy father,\\"Before God and as an honest man I tell you that your son is the greatest composer known to me either in person or by name: He has taste, and, furthermore, the most profound knowledge of composition.\\"Gay dispels a number of popular myths including the one which is the basis of the film 'Amadeus' that Salieri poisoned Mozart. He makes use of his psychoanalytic training to explain the relationship between Mozart father and Mozart son. He dispels the myth of Mozart's abject poverty and rejection. He provides a very readable narrative of the lives of one of mankind's great God - gifted geniuses.But he also does not do what I had hoped he would i.e come close to revealing the secret or secrets of Mozart's genius. So many others have written music and so many others at the same time were writing music. Reams and reams of it. What gave Mozart the ability to do this on a level beyond the others? And what in the music itself is so beyond the others? Words like 'lightness' and ' complexity' and 'depth' and 'lyricism' and 'fluency' and 'powerful feeling' and 'emotive expressionism' and ....All the words do not say it.I would have liked to have read more about what we 'hear' in Mozart that we can hear nowhere else.Gay does a good job telling the life, and especially I think the relationship between father Leopold and the much- demanded- of genius son. But he does not, and perhaps no one can, tell us the real secret of why this musician and this music have been for so many, of another realm entirely."},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"Professor Gay is a superb author. His opus on the genius Mozart is eloquent, brings new elements to my understanding of the musician, and keeps the reader completely centered in Mozart's world and era. His prose is tremendously engaging and his book is hard to put down. I had read many of Prof. Gay's work while studying for my Ph.D exams 35 years ago in his area of speciality, the Englightenment. Then he brought me a great understanding of that era and he continues in that manner on Mozart. I am most impressed with his characterization of this life and his thorough understanding of Wolfgang's music related to his life. We spent a week in Salzburg this year (our second journey to this Episcopal Imperial on the Salzach, and then ordered this biography as we longed for more information. Prof. Gay's work was the perfect suplement to this trip and the great music we hear and a most welcome addition to our library. May he write even more entertaining and enlightening works."},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"Anyone who has children can relate to this book and the trials of poor Leopold Mozart with his son Wolfgang.Even now as I write this I am experiencing the most vexing problem of trying to impart my wisdom in my children especially my two teenage daughters who, are themselves struggling to gain independance and who inevitably know it all. Truly a most vexing problem for me.I have two more younger ones that have yet to try my patience and go out on their own,worldy and confident in their own abilities to conquer and reign without my help. We shall see what is what in the end won't we parents?Can you relate to my plight? If so then this is a fairly well written little book on the life of Mozart as good as any I guess.There is much to this little man and his own relationship with his father here and how it shaped his life and his works. Recurrent themes in his operas appear to be the end result of ongoing paternal angst.There are more expansive histories available but the mans life is at times open to interpretation so sometimes less is more.This book gets to the point,presents the stages and influences of his development and incorporates them nicely.It does a good job of dispelling the myths associated with the man and is quite clinically basic in its approach.All you really need to know without the influence of letters to this one and that one back and forth ad nauseum which if presented poorly can make a book longer than it has to be.For the rabid fan of every factotum,no it probably will not do.But for the regular person who wants to know and have a good look at Mozarts life a \\"just the facts mam\\" kind of person,you know, just enough current information on the life of Wolfgang A.Mozart to carry you through some martinis and social banter armed with the truth about him with a well respected author and biographer at the helm then this book is the one for you to read.Secretly,I too wanted to believe in the movie 'Amadeus' and all of its assertions but it's all hogwash.Salieri did not kill Mozart or contribute to his death in any way.In fact they were actually cordial friends respectful of each other and not mortal enemies as people tend to believe.The cause of death is another matter which I will let you research on your own.I don't want to spoil all your fun. This book will start you on your way very well as it reduces the fluff and gets to the pure genius that was Mozart, a man that was probably the last of his kind,one of the greatest composers ever to yet live, ahead of his time yes, yet had day to day problems just like the rest of us and left us way too early because medicine hadn't caught up yet.The book will fill you in."},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"In this book, Peter Gay offers an excellent, concise summary of Mozart's life and greatness. This is not a balanced recounting; Gay compresses the Mozart's active childhood of tours and performances into a single chapter, while his frustrating years at Salzburg are similarly condensed to a few pages. Yet such an approach is more than justified given the purpose of the \\"Penguin Lives\\" series, which is to offer brief introductions to their selected subjects.A distinguished intellectual and cultural historian, Gay brings considerable knowledge of Mozart's world to bear in examining the details of his life, connecting it to the broader historical developments of his time. Chapters 6 and 7 break away from the biographical narrative to focus on Mozart's achievements as a writer of symphonies and operas, which allows Gay to turn his finely honed analytical abilities to evaluating Mozart the artist. While there is nothing new in his analysis, it nonetheless provides an excellent introduction to the life of this brilliant musician and composer."},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"This is an great book to read if you want a nice quick and very easy to read account of this great man. As the other reviews state its not a deep searching biography but its size does not detract from an excellent account of this man and his times.From page one I was drawn into the narrative and learnt quite a few interesting pieces of information about Mozart, his music and his personality. This book wets your appetite for more information about Mozart and his music and any book that can do that much then the author has done a decent job. Read it and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"If you need a book in order to waste 10 minutes while waiting in line somewhere, and you don't know a thing about Mozart this book will work for you. The book is extremely simplistic, details are glossed over, and is an uneventful read. Mozart; with all his brilliant compositions deserves more than this."},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"I enjoy Peter Gay's books, and appreciated this one. But on the subject of Freemasonry this book is pretty mixed up. A lot of the confusion eddies from the central misprision that the opera is meant in good faith to represent an enactment of Masonic ritual. There are so many repercussions from this central misunderstanding, that no wonder Masonic scholars have been eager to try to clear things up for the general Non-Masonic public. But such clarity is hard-won, because Masons want to always emphasize what a great Brother the composer was. Thus to properly situate and contextualize the very act of clearing away the many misconceptions almost requires an hermeneutic all its own. These are some of the realities that I dealt with in my recently published paper now on the excellent Masonic Music -- Music of Freemasonry site (masonmusic.org): Peter Paul Fuchs, \\"A Resolution of Mozart and Freemasonry: Enlightenment and the Persistence of Counter-Reformation\\"."},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"Peter Gay's MOZART is a no-nonsense, straight to the point brief biography of Mozart. Organized by themes--the Prodigy, the Son, the Servant, the Freelance, the Beggar, the Master, the Dramatist, the Classic--Gay seeks to dispel certain myths created by the Oscar winning movie, Amadeus--such as Mozart's rare use of that form of his middle name in the Latinate--while reaffirming Mozart's undeniable musical genius. The major drawback of the book is one that Gay could not avoid, you can only imagine Mozart's compositions in your mind as you read. Gay tries to paint the picture of how magnificient, truly unmatched Mozart's gift was, but words only go so far. The positive thing along the same lines, however, is that I can't wait to play \\"Jupiter\\" and piano concertos like no. 20 and 21 and soak in their richness, which ultimately is Gay's goal. Reading about Mozart must serve hearing what endures in his music."},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"Mozart was published in 1999 as one of the volumes in the Penguin Short Lives Series edited by James Atlas. This book is authored by distinguished scholar Peter Gay. The book is succinct but chock full of information about the genius of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) one of the greatest composers who ever lived.Mozart was born in Salzburg to a musician father Leopold and a loving mother. The child and his sister Hannerl traveled the courts of Englightment Europe performing for royalty. Mozart was once dandled on the lap of Marie Antoinette! The young genius studied in Italy and astounded musicians with his prodigal powers of composition and incredible photographic memorization of scores.Mozart left Salzburg spending many productive years in Vienna. He wed Constanze Weber having several children with her. Mozart enjoyed crude jokes, billiards, dancing and living in his exalted estoric world of musical compositiion. He wrote everything from 41 symphonies to such opera masterpieces as \\"The Marriage of Figaro\\"; \\"Don Juan\\"; \\"Cosi Fan Tutti\\"; \\"The Abduction from the Seraglio\\"; \\"The Magic Flute\\" and many others. His music is noted for its elegance, melody and sheer beauty. Many consider Mozart the world's greatest composer.Mozart was a poor money manager; was often in conflict with his dominating father and often had to depend on friends to help him out of financial difficulties.His short life ended too soon but his music will always live. Peter Gay covers the essentials of Mozart's life and art in a well written little book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"I bought \\"Mozart: A Life\\" simply to learn a bit more about the man himself, but never did I expect it to be so uninformative. I can honestly say this is the first history book I've ever read that I got nothing out of. I found myself practically sleeping through most of it, and just when things started to get interesting, it ended, just like that.I am a details person. I like to know things down to the minutest detail possible about a person's life; Gay is not, and his brief, shallow, and unsatisfying biography just doesn't cut it for me. \\"Mozart\\" feels like a poorly written and over-stretched essay by a psychological student obsessed with the foppish and scatalogical side of W.A. Mozart, and the domineering personality of his father Leopold. I'm thankful I didn't pay too much for this book, but with a MSRP of $13.00, the book could have been a bit meatier.Peter Gay's writing is brief, disorderly, and vague at best. He contradicts himself often, and frequently uses the phrase \\"As we have seen\\", or \\"As we know\\", which in my opinion should never be used in any piece of literature, even a historical one. You never get a feel for Mozart or his times. Important details are glossed over, and things of minor consequence get superior preferential treatment. For example, Mozart's bawdy letters and crude jokes, or over-long synopsis of some of his operas, which most opera-lovers like myself are already well acquainted with, take up huge stretches of the book; whilst things that are usually essential to know about anyone's life just aren't there.You learn almost nothing of Mozart's childhood, for the book skips from his birth to his first tour of Europe almost instantly, without telling you anything about his education, his composition habits, or even his relationship with his sister Nannerl. The entire description of his adulthood is built from a mix of brief sentences pertaining to his ever-growing licentious desires and excerpts from his begging letters to friends on the subject of loans. Perhaps Mozart really was like that, but because of the author's lack of definite commital to fact and cursory interest in detail, who knows?What I was most annoyed about was that you never get to know the man as a person, or even a composer, for that matter. Because so little detail is gone into, there is no way you can form an idea of what he was like, aside from his less honorable pursuits. Even so, his vices remain just as enigmatic, with brief hints thrown here and there, but nothing given a definite conclusion one way or the other. In short, you're left with a one-dimensional figure draped in mystery, whose feelings and motivations are never known, and whose short life, supplemented with a massive creative output as it was, seems even shorter.Gay seems to have an aversion to dates and figures, and aside from Mozart himself, no one else's birthdates, dates of death, or anything in between are mentioned, so you must have prior knowledge of the family and everyone else involved at the time to follow along coherently, which I really don't. He even leaves out the names and birthdates of Mozart's six children, only mentioning that only two survived infancy, and he all but ignores Constanze, Mozart's wife. Even their wedding date is omitted.He drones on incessantly about Leopold Mozart and his overbearingness and tendency to exploit his children's talent, haunting every chapter with him and constantly referring back to him in an obsessive fashion. Honestly, I can't understand these authors and their fascination with Herr Mozart Sr. I began to forget who I was supposed to be reading a biography about: was it Mozart, or Mozart's father? Even so, Leopold gets a nearly-complete gloss-over as well. There is nothing about his early life, so don't expect a birthdate or even a year; and there is certainly nothing about what sort of a person he was before Wolfgang was born.Gay's descriptions of Mozart as a composer and of his music itself speak plainly that he has a limited knowledge of music and composition, and serves to bore rather than inform. Sure, I might not be able to describe the sublimity of Mozart's pieces any better than anybody else, but the sheer lack of detail with which he presents those elaborations diminishes the idea that there was anything unique or revolutionary about them. His section on Mozart's involvement with Freemasonry is caustic and lacking, and made me feel as if I had been lectured by someone with a severe dislike for all things Masonic. He is also extremely biased in his chapter on Mozart's various operas, and presents his own opinions heavier and in greater quantity than honest fact.After poring over all 163 pages, I can't really think of anything new I learned about Mozart, aside from the true identity of the mysterious commissioner of \\"Requiem\\". I still am practically clueless about his personality, his physical appearance, and even his musical influences and inspirations. Even the etymology of his name is left ambiguious. Gay only mentions his christening name of Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart, but nothing more. More details please? I did my own research online and found out more about Wolfgang, not to mention the origin of his name, in about five minutes--a lot less time than it took me to learn nothing from reading this book. If I can look up Mozart myself, certainly a published author should be able to. Apparently, he didn't. Or if he did, he seemed to think that those kind of details were extraneous and not worth including.To close, this book sorely disappointed me, and if you're hoping to learn something about Mozart, then you should by all means pass this one by."},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"Readers (especially non-musicians) in search of short biography of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart should be warned that althoughMozart: A Life (A Penguin Life)reduces Mozart's life and accomplishments to the manageable size of 163 pages plus endnotes and bibliography, this condensed life story is hit-or-miss.The book is divided into eight chapters each of which reflects a different aspect of Mozart: prodigy, son, servant, freelance composer, beggar, master, dramatist, and classic. This organization is sound in theory but creates a nonlinear chronology, which can be confusing to those not paying strict attention to the dates. The death of Leopold Mozart is reported (without an exact date) in Chapter 5; however, Leopold abruptly reappears in subsequent chapters to disapprove of his son's actions and give musical commentary.The author goes into detail perhaps interesting but irrelevant details -- such as Mozart's comically bawdy letters to his first love interests -- but then omits or glosses over crucial parts of Mozart's life. Upon describing Mozart's marriage to Constanze sans his father's approval, he fails to provide the date for their wedding. Then a few pages later, the author mentions that Mozart and his wife had six children adding that only two survived, but he gives neither names nor dates for any of them, and they are never alluded to again. His citation of dates is also slapdash. For example, rather than giving the date of Mozart's death, the date Mozart became bedridden with the illness that killed him is documented, and his death is described as happening \\"fifteen days later.\\"Mozart's compositions are cited by their K&ouml;chel catalogue number as they are discussed; however, the author never explains this citation to the potentially inexperienced reader. All the works of Mozart are identified by the letter \\"k\\" followed by a number. \\"K\\" stands for Ludwig von Kochel who compiled the first catalogue of Mozart's compositions, and the number indicates the piece's chronical place among Mozart's body of work.Mozart's relationship with his father is much analyzed from a modern point of view, and the author fails to take into account the family structure of the time and instead interprets from a 20th Century mindset. Ironically, he says nothing about Hapsburg Emperor Joseph II who was under the thumb of his mother as co-regent until her death, an event which took place at the same time as Leopold Mozart is painted as cruelly refusing to step down as patriarch of the Mozart family and insisting on melding in his son's affairs.The first three chapters do provide a good overview of Wolfgang Mozart's early life, family situation, first musical influences and training, and childhood concert tours as well as the social and cultural climate of his home city of Salzburg. The author does a good job describing and dispelling the myth surrounding Mozart's death in the final chapter. He also charts Mozart's musical developments in a way that laypeople can comprehend even if they don't have a clear idea what musical terms such as counterpoint and libretto mean."},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"This Book is a very good book!

(The others were &quot;Mao Zedong&quot; by Jonathan Spence, which seemed disappointingly incomplete, and &quot;Woodrow Wilson&quot; by Louis Auchincloss, which seemed terribly superficial.) As an eminent cultural historian of Europe since the Enlightenment and a native of German-speaking Europe himself, Gay is more than qualified to write a superior life story of Mozart and certainly rises to the occasion with a captivating style that made reading this book a pleasure.For a book that is only 163 pages long, exclusive of endnotes and bibliographic essay, this volume offers an unusually full picture. It depicts Mozart as man and musician, while placing him and his art in the context of his times. Gay delves into Mozart's complex relationship with his autocratic father, describing his evolution from docile Wunderkind to assertive mature artist. He also explores Mozart's unusual personality, including his often juvenile sense of humor, his devoted commitment to his wife, his tendency to constantly live beyond his means and the resulting sometimes obsequious dependency on his patrons, and his interactions with contemporary composers, particularly Johann Christoph Bach and Franz Josef Haydn. Gay is especially good at explaining Mozart's major contributions to the development of classical music in terms that even someone who lacks a technical understanding of music can fathom, showing how he contributed to chamber music, the symphony, and opera. And he briefly points out what is distinctive about a number of the composers' major works.In short, this is a book that offers all the fun of &quot;Amadeus,&quot; but a far more satisfying portrayal of Mozart and a fuller explication of why he is an icon of Western civilization. For readers who lack much knowledge about the composer, Gay does an artful job of tantalizing them into wanting to learn more, then pointing the way with a helpful and thorough bibliographical essay."},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"This is one of several volumes in the Penguin Lives Series, each of which written by a distinguished author in her or his own right.

Finally I decided that a few brief excerpts and then some concluding remarks would be appropriate.On misconceptions of Mozart (e.g. the &quot;willful child&quot; unable to grow up, the \\"miracle worker\\" who never needed to revise a single note): \\"These tenacious caricatures are distortions rather than fabrications; most of them, as we shall discover, contain a kernel of truth....But Mozart's life in music is fascinating enough without embroidery; his reputation as a genius is not threatened by mundane truths.\\" (Page 2)In a letter to his father (1781): \\"Nature speaks as loudly in me as in anyone, and perhaps louder than in many big, strong lugs. I cannot possibly live like most of the young men today. -- First, I have too much religion; secondly, too much love for my fellow beings and too honorable a disposition to seduce an innocent girl; and thirdly, too much horror and repugnance, dread and fear of diseases, and too much care for my health to scuffle with whores.\\" (Page 70)Peter Gay on Salieri: \\"There is an all-too-well-known melodramatic tale about Antonio Salieri poisoning Mozart. It began as a rumor and was first given literary form in the 1820s in a verse playlet by Pushkin. It is a malicious, preposterous fabrication, but hints at the envy Mozart's rivals had every right to feel. Yet Mozart, too, had grounds for envy: Salieri, born in Italy but long settled in Vienna, occupied privileged posts that Mozart would have deserved but, given Emperor Joseph's predilection for Salieri, could never hope to obtain.\\" (Page 100)Mozart's last year: \\"[It] has often been described as one long preparation for death. But in that time, Mozart wrote two operas, a piano concerto, a large number of minuets and counterdances, a clarinet concerto, a Masonic cantata, two quintets, and most of the Requiem. His creativity was still working at full speed.\\" (Page 156)I am among those who have seen the film Amadeus many times, admiring it more each time. For dramatic purposes, those who produced Amadeus focus on several of the \\"tenacious caricatures\\" to which Gay refers. What I especially appreciate about this biography is that Gay duly acknowledges all of Mozart's human limitations and inadequacies while examining Mozart's creative discipline in ways and to an extent which the film does not. With regard to this biography's context, Gay tells his reader only what is essential to know about the various cities in which Mozart lived and worked during various periods in his all-too-brief life (January 27,1756-December 5, 1791). Rather than create an historical or cultural context, Gay prefers to focus primarily on Mozart's art. As he notes, the renewal of interest more than a century after Mozart's death raised his music -- \\"all of it -- to the eminence it deserves.\\""},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"For anyone who has ever wanted to know about Mozart, but does not want to dig through massive tomes, or the intracacies of counterpoint, Peter Gay gives a thorough linear analysis of Mozart, his life, and times. Describing the growth of a musical genius, with commentaries on major works, Gay places Mozart firmly in his historic period. We see the role of the musician as hired tradesman and Mozart trying to equate his genius with social standing, only to play secaond fiddle to the second rate. An excellent and enjoyable window into a complex mind and a brief but indelible life."},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"Somewhere between Maynard Solomon's 650-page opus Mozart: A Life and the Mozart write-up on Wikipedia, there is Mozart by Peter Gay.Mozart's story should lend itself to the Penguin Lives series of short biographies. It was a remarkable life in spite of its brevity. Mozart gifted the biographer with a voluminous correspondence and Gay makes extensive use of it. If it sometimes seems as if the narrative consists of epistolary excerpts strung together, they do communicate some aspects of Mozart's character, particularly as regards the increasingly difficult father-son relationship.Gay also enjoys quoting the vulgar witticisms that frequently occur in the correspondence. Peter Gay is also the author of a biography of Sigmund Freud, so the character analysis was perhaps bound to take a psychoanalytic turn. For example, vis-&agrave;-vis the penchant for vulgarity, Mozart \\"yielded more readily than many others to the regressive pull of early fixations.\\" His adolescent attraction to Aloysia Weber was the expression of \\"agreeable rescue fantasies\\". It's hard to say what, if anything, these observations add to the reader's insight into Mozart the man. In the end, while we learn the important facts about Mozart's life, we don't really get a clear sense of character from this book.Not to say that the author fails to recognize and carry out his writerly duties. In a biography of Mozart, or of any famous person, the author is required to engage with the standard mythology, and Gay dutifully sets the record straight. Mozart was in fact dismissed from the Archbishop of Salzburg's service with a kick in the rear end, and he did once write a full symphony in four days (No. 36). He was not, however, poisoned to death by Salieri (rheumatic fever was the culprit) and he was not just taking straight dictation from God - his original manuscripts bear much evidence of rewriting and revision. (Unfortunately, Gay does not address the implicit charge of alcoholism in the film \\"Amadeus\\".) As far as Mozart's famous arrogance, Gay's account perhaps affords an improved perspective: \\"He had no false modesty about his gifts; since they were God-given, it would be sacrilegious, he thought, to make light of them.\\"To a great extent the story of Mozart's life is the story of his musical compositions. He began to compose in early childhood; by his death in 1791 the corpus had grown to some 600 works - among them, of course, a number of the signal works of the classical era. Gay cites most of the appropriate pieces - the \\"Turkish\\" violin concerto, composed at 19; the piano concertos; the great late symphonies including the No. 41 \\"Jupiter\\"; the Requiem Mass. Others could have been mentioned, some excluded; it's pointless to quibble. The important thing is that our author should write well about them.Unfortunately, Gay isn't very good at writing about music. His musical discussions tend to lapse into praise rather than interpretation: \\"To experience [the late symphonies] is to enjoy a spectacle of energy translated into beauty.\\" He finally throws up his hands: \\"...how puerile these common metaphors are compared to the experience of *listening* to Mozart!\\"The musical analysis we do get generally comes in the form of quotations from other people - established critics and scholars like Alfred Einstein and Charles Rosen. These, along with the bibliographical essay, are helpful for those seeking more substantive discussion.Character analysis and musicology aside, what we really want from a Mozart essay by Peter Gay is a discussion of the composer's place in the great intellectual movement of his time: the Enlightenment. Gay is the author of a magisterial two-volume survey of the Enlightenment which runs to some 1,650 pages and is considered definitive. So we make our way through the present narrative patiently waiting for the part where Gay reveals his expert insights into Mozart's role in the Age of Reason. In vain. The benefits to Mozart of Emperor Joseph II's reformist policies are briefly acknowledged. Hope glimmers with Mozart's induction into Freemasonry, but Gay pretty much dismisses this as a networking maneuver. The Magic Flute is characterized as \\"a rationalist Mason's celebration of truth, love, and human warmth\\", but the analysis goes no further. If the Penguin Enlightenment Reader is correct on the matter, The Magic Flute's libretto \\"distills the essence of the Enlightenment\\"; so it's particularly disappointing that Gay has nothing much to say about it here.Come to think of it, it's hard to say what advantages Gay's book really has over the Wikipedia essay. After all, they offer substantially the same information; Wikipedia includes color pictures of the composer, his family, and his native Salzburg; you can click to hear the musical pieces discussed; and you can save $[...] to spend on something else. Like some music by Mozart, for example."},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"I enjoy biography, but the trend these days is toward the voluminous, detailed study that weighs in at 700 pages or more.

Author Peter Gay has successfully avoided the heavy-handedness present in some of his other works (e.g. in the &quot;Bourgeois Experience&quot; series), and the result is a pleasant stroll through the late 18th century. Gay concentrates more on Mozart the person rather than on Mozart's music, although the evolution of Mozart's style is an important theme.A quick, easy, enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"Mozart dies at age 35. His output was stupendous, but his life was short. This gives the author the chance to write about it in great detail within a slim volume. He does an admirable job in bringing Mozart back too life for us.Mr. Gay puts repeated emphasis on Mozart?s dependence on his father Leopold. Although Leopold recognized his son?s genius, he kept him under firm and strict control. Part of this was founded in society?s approach to the upbringing of children. But another large part was the fact that young Amadeus became the money making machine that kept the family financially afloat. Mozart himself went from subservience as a child to absolute disavowal of his father when he became of age. The connection to his sister Nannerl , who was a good musician but not a genius, was more neutral. Young Amadeus had quite the sex drive. But when he married Constanze . he finally found somebody who cared for him. This poor woman outlived him by about 40 years.Mozart was basically a lonely man. As a child, he met - and worked for - kings and emperors. He was aware of, and corresponded with, the great musicians of the time. One of the contacts with the people around him was his membership in the Freemasons. His life was composing, day and night.The author does not give short shrift to Mozart?s music but, thanks be to him, does not spend time on telling us what he personally thinks of one piece of music or another. He accounts for all the compositions and mentions the progress Mozart made. He does give special attention to the operas, writing a short and most helpful resume of all the major ones. Librettist da Ponte receives a place of honor, and Schikaneder an honorable mentioning. Mozart loved to compose operas and is given full credit. He was versed in staging and was a major contributor to any presentation. But he was not a happy person. He loved to spend money, and his music did not bring enough income. He did not like Vienna, where he spent so many years. He came to dislike his father, who held him responsible for his mother?s death.Reading this book, you feel a great affinity for this young genius. And you ponder, of course, what would have happened if----------he had lived longer."},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"Gay's book is a colourful portrait of the genius Mozart. It's lively not boring and gave me more than enough information on the man himself but very little on his marriage. I would have preferred more info on that aspect of his life but admittedly Gay does a splendid job on the early and Mozart and giving me a better understanding of what made the Great Composer tick.And the best of the Penguin lives series that I've come across so far."},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"The Penguin Lives series continues to serve me well as I rebel against the opposing current of plodding steamer trunk-sized biographies. In under 200 pages, the Penguins neatly shake off obscurity and/or legends that have grown up around a significant life and tell its story neatly, in light of the individual's environment and enduring contributions to culture.Peter Gay's Mozart is a good example of the series' strength. The narrative flows gracefully, allowing Mozart's character to come out in full. As Gay says, his genius was special in many ways: he built on an early precocity; he did not live in a garret, he was popular in his own time, he participated in a community of peers rather than in a vacuum. Mozart's life has been clouded in legend and Gay makes it his business to sift out the truth. Sometimes the truth dovetails with the tales, as in being booted in the rear by Count Arco upon being released from his Saltzburg duties, after whining about wanting out. The guy had his bratty moments. Other legends are celebrity gossip: his death was prosaic illness, he and Salieri seemed to get along, and his money problems were probably not so terrible as he himself would tell it, though productivity is directly connected to patronage.Gay does a good job of portraying the complex relationship between Mozart and his tyrannical stage father. Likewise, he effectively describes Mozart's relationship with his social environment, late in the Enlightenment. He also tracks his creative development, revisiting the genius of many works, especially the later operas. Working within only 163 pages, though, something gets left out: we know nothing of Mozart's own children and Gay drops almost any mention of his sister, Nannerl, past their childhood. He says that Leopold, Mozart's father, continued to exploit his son's gift after his death but does not say how when it comes time to discuss it.Those are minor flaws. Mozart's a delight, the writing's a delight. It's like a fizzy drink packed with nutrients."},{"Title":"Mozart","review":"Peter Gay's biograghy of Mozart is a nice additon to the Penguin Lives series. It is short and readable and captures all the salient facts of both Mozart's life and his works. This is the perfect book for those who want a short read to enhance their listening and understanding pleasure. There are better, more thorough accounts of Mozart's life but this volume dances over much of the same territory while nicely peeling away the mythology clinging to Mozart through the centuries. A bibliograhical note at the back will lead the readers who have become interested further down the garden path. The other readers will be quite satisfied with what they have read in this compact, delightful book."},{"Title":"Decorating Cakes for Fun and Profit","review":"Snyder thought me how to decorate at his school of cake decorating.

In recent years, there has been a curious tendency to euphemistically substitute the political party of the Germans for their nationality, all the while retaining the ethnicities of other peoples. (Thus, \\"Nazi killers of Poles and Jews\\" makes as much sense as \\"German killers of Pilsudskyites and Bundists\\"). Gilbert's atlas unabashedly calls the Nazis for who they were: the Germans. (Of course there were exceptions, but they were just that--exceptions). For example, Gilbert refers to German concentration camps, not Nazi concentration camps. And, although this atlas is about Jews, Gilbert does not avoid mention of the fact that the Germans also murdered several millions of non-Jews. (This, of course, does not include the additional millions killed directly or indirectly by German military action).Gilbert's atlas is concise enough to fit on an ordinary bookshelf, yet is packed with much useful information. Maps depict many Biblical and post-Biblical events. The travels of the Apostle Paul are included. So are many \\"alternative Zions\\", where Jews were to find a new home. The history of Jews in the USA is also featured. Only one obvious error stands out: When Gilbert depicts the Bogdan Khmelnitsky (Bogdan Chmielnicki) revolt, he incorrectly states that the killers of Jews (and also Ukrainian and Polish nobility) were Polish peasants. In the main, the killers were actually Ukrainian peasants.Gilbert's atlas includes the experience of Jews outside of Europe and the Americas. Although certain Muslim lands offered the Jews more tolerance than Christian ones, there were also many Muslim lands in which the Jews suffered extreme persecution. This alone should refute the common claim that anti-Semitism is a product of traditional Christian teachings about Jews. In fact, from Gilbert's atlas, it is obvious that the Jews suffered from pagans long before Christianity."},{"Title":"Energy policy (Major planning issue)","review":"I enjoy the way that Gilbert chronicles Jewish history through maps. I found at least one error in his maps, however -- and one of the more recent maps at that -- which makes me question the accuracy of the entire work. The 1947 Partition Plan Map of Palestine, partitioning Palestine into 2 separate countries -- a Jewish state (Israel) and an Arab state (Palestine) -- is blatantly incorrect. While Beersheva is part of present-day Israel, it is improperly reported to be part of the Jewish partition in this book. In fact, all of the area surrounding Beersheva was part of the Arab partition in the UN Resolution. Similarly, the Arabs were also given a larger chunk in Gaza than what is depicted here. Martin seems to take the outcome of the Arab war -- what Jordan and Egypt were able to wrest and occupy (and incidentally, not give to the Palestinians) -- essentially though not exactly the Green Line map of 1949 -- and represent that land as what was suggested in the UN Partition Plan. In my view, this is a serious shortcoming, especially in light of the events surrounding the present peace process and the history leading up to it."},{"Title":"Energy policy (Major planning issue)","review":"This fascinating Atlas traces the history of the Jewish people, from the early Jewish migration from Ur to Canaan, in about 2000 BC, up to developments in the modern State of Israel.He traces the migration of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt back to the Promised Land, and the conquest of the Promised Land by the Israelites, the whereabouts of the Twelve Tribes of Ancient Israel, the kingdoms of David and Solomon 1000 to 925 BC, as well as the destruction of Jewish independence by the Assyrians and Babylonians and the subsequent deportations and dispersions of the Israelites.The book shows us maps revealing the Hasmonean Kingdom and the Jewish revolts against Roman Rule.Gilbert outlines the development of ancient Jewish communities in Iraq, Persia, India and China, as well as Europe, the persecutions, pogroms, expulsions and different places of settlements of the Jews throughout the world.The book deals with some lesser known facts such as the whereabouts of the Karaite Jews, 10 000 of whom were murdered by the Nazis in Crimea, in 1943, the fact that in 1805 Napoleon formed a Jewish battalion that fought at Waterloo, while in 1799 the Jews of Jerusalem joined the Turks in preparing to defend the city, and in 1812, the Jews of Russia, supported their Russian overlords against Napoleon, as they feared that Napoleon's liberalization would be a threat to their orthodoxy.A fascinating map shows the possible whereabouts of the ten lost Tribes of Israel, and the intriguing possibility that their descendants could include the Ibos of Nigeria, the Masai Tribe of East Africa, the Berbers of North Africa, the Khazars, the Bnei Menashe of EasternIndia, the Karens of Burma, and the Shinadai Tribe of Japan.Other maps show the development of Jewish life in the Americas, Jewish military activity from from 1794 to 1967, the return of the Jews to the Land of Israel, the numbers of Jews in Europe at the outbreak of World War II, and those that perished in the Holocaust, the numbers of Jews who fled Europe for Palestine, during the Holocaust, Jewish resistance against Nazis persecution in Europe, and against Arab pogroms in Palestine, and Israel's War of Independence in 1948, the Suez War of 1956 and the Six Day war of 1967, describing the balance on the eve of that war of Arab and Israeli forces:The total Arab strength was 547 000 troops, 2 504 tanks and 957 combat aircrafts, while Israel's strength consisted of 264 000 troops, 800 tanks and 300 Combat aircrafts.While the author is correct about persecution in Europe, of the Jews, by Christians, he underestimates and does not fully describe the many massacres and pogroms against Jews in Moslem-ruled lands, as well as the severe dhimmni status under which they lived.Nevertheless Gilbert succeeds, in illustrating the vast panorama of the Jewish people, through the ages.He makes obscure periods in Jewish history better known, if only in outline, leaving the reader the task of embarking on deeper research.Finally the book leaves the reader amazed at the endurability of a people who survived thousands of years of hostility and attempts to destroy it, and were gathered together once again in their ancient homeland, having to defend their homeland against 100 million Arabs, and a very large chunk of hostile world opinion."},{"Title":"Energy policy (Major planning issue)","review":"I can now find where my grandparents lived before coming to the USA in 1906.

This book not only entertained, with its story of a young lawyer investigating a World War II-era suicide, it also educated. How many people are aware that 52,000 Italians were interned as potential enemies during this period? Many of these were fisherman, but they also included poor slobs who had the bad luck to be working on cruise ships docked in U.S. ports when the war broke out. Thanks, Ms. Scottoline, for both writing a terrific read and shedding light on a little-known chapter in our history."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"The focus is on Atty. Mary diNunzio in Ms. Scottoline's ninth novel featuring the all-woman law group, Rosato & Associates. Mary takes on a pro-bono case at the request of family friends, that of WWII internee Amadeo Brandolini, who apparently committed suicide during his confinement. Most of the principals are now deceased as well. As Mary checks things out, however, she receives threats on her life, and when a fellow attorney is murdered, she suspects that Amadeo did not die by his own hand. The closer Mary gets to the truth, the more perilous the casebecomes.Killer Smile is a light, interesting legal thriller, though after the first few pages, it lacks the tension that characterizes much of Ms. Scottoline's other work. There are some problems with the plot - it's never made clear why Mary would take such risks for a man who died sixty years ago, one who had no grand estate to recover, and she is prone to taking some impulsive risks that are genuinely inane. Nevertheless, the outcome is a satisfactory one that would not have come about without her persistent sleuthing."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"I love Scottoline's characters. The story moved quickly and held together to the end. In this book, there's the added bonus of the history lesson. I had never thought about any group other than the Japanese being interned during WWII so reading a little of the history of the Italian experience at Fort Missoula was very interesting."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"I have a soft spot for Lisa Scottoline. Many years ago I was working in a used book store when I ran across her first book, 'Everywhwere that Mary Went' and I loved it. We had two copies of that book and we must have re-sold them a dozen times after I started recommending them to people who asked for someone new to read. Pretty soon, Lisa Scottoline was one of our hottest items - we even special-ordered in some new copies! I like to think that I had a very, very small part in her success, even though the used book store is now defunct.This book continues on with several familiar themes in Scottoline's books. Once again Bennie Rosato's all female (with the exception of an office manager) law firm swings into action in a case involving the Italian neighborhods of Phialadelphia. Mary DiNunzio, Scottoline's original character is back with a pro bono case based in history. Some Italians were sent to internment camps during World War II (much like the Japanese camps but not nearly as numerous) and this is at least the second book that focuses on this sad fact of American history.DiNunzio is investigating the mysterious death of a prisoner in an Italian internment camp, despite the 60+ year time lag. And, it turns out that some people do not want this old case solved and are willing to use violence to keep Mary away.This is a fun, quick read - great escapist reading."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"What a fascinating look at a little-known chapter in American history -- the internment of Italian-Americans during WWII -- as seen through the eyes of a funny, endearing cowgirl South Philly lawyer.

I was drawn into this book by the author's very adept and witty dialog; some of the best I have read in a long time. I laughed out loud at some of the comments made by the characters. Ms. Scottoline really knows how to turn a phrase. Then came a completely implausible chase scene where she apparently could not find a way to rescue the character, so she just ended the chapter with no explanation. But I was willing to forgive based on the quality writing to that point. Then, after slowly building to a climax, the book concludes with a Santa Clause ending. A Santa Clause ending is employed by writers that do not want to expend the energy necessary to create an intricately woven plot and conclusion. Rather, they resort to a surprise ending that is only surprising because nothing lead to that result. In other words, you are expected to slap your forehead and exclaim, \\"wow, I never would have guessed that Santa Clause was the murderer.\\" She then wraps up everything discussed in the novel in a nice bow, even though the results are inexplicable.You will end this legal novel wanting to sue the author. I have to believe that Ms. Scottoline suffered a family emergency or was contractually obligated to finish the book, because nothing else could justify the ridiculous ending. If you are satisfied to read a book for some very nicely crafted dialog, then this is a good read, but stop before you read that last 20 pages because they will wipe the smile from your face."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"The core concept is good but unfortunately it got lost in a morass of rambling sidebars that made for tedious reading.

The novel begins as Mary, a young Phildelphia lawyer, answers a threatening phone call (apparently from someone who they have nicknamed Premenstrual Tom) meant for her boss Benedetta Rosato, the founder of the all woman law firm Rosato and Associates. Mary is working late on a pro bono case involving the apparently ancient history of the estate of Amadeo Brandolini, an Italian immigrant and local fisherman who died while interned in a Montana camp as a foreign national during World War II. The estate of Amadeo's son has approached Frank Cavuto, a solo practioner with limited resources, to sue the US Government for reparations. Frank (who was Mary's childhood baseball coach and remains a family friend) has enlisted Mary's help in his efforts to complete the research necessary to determine the basis of any claim for reparations that they might file. Eventually Frank tries to convince Mary that the case is hopeless and she should drop it, but her stubbornness causes her to decide that justice will not be achieved until she has examined the unanswered questions which still bother her.Soon the stakes escalate! A lawyer is killed! Mary's office is trashed and crucial items concerning the case are stolen. She becomes increasingly convinced that a shadowy figure in an Escalade is trailing her as she continues her investigation. And these events all occur in the first few chapters of the story. Mary then enlists Judy Carrier, her best friend and an associate at Rosato, to help in her investigation; she soon decides that to get to the bottom of the case she will have to visit the former internment camp in Montana. Despite the fact that she has never been on an airplane before (one of the three personal secrets she shares with no one - you will have to read the book to discover the other two) Mary resolutely sets out for Montana, where she unearths very troubling information which eventually places her in great personal danger. The plot twists are frequent, the conclusion is satisfying and the story is fast paced and absorbing as all the various threads are gradually tied together.The story is told entirely in the first person with Mary as a very engaging and likeable narrator. Her inability to move beyond the recent death of her husband Mike, her close relationship with her father Mariano and mother Vita, and the background of her childhood as an Italian Catholic in South Philadelphia are all intriguing and essential elements of the story. Her insights are clever and often self deprecating, and her powers of observation are sharp and expressed in a way which provoke frequent smiles and occasional outright laughter as the story proceeds. (E.G. At one point she imagines Rosato and Associates morphing into the Supremes, with Bennie Rosato as Diana Ross. Later she becomes uptight when she realizes that she is flirting and thus might be dishonoring Mike's memory. But she realizes she hasn't tensed up as usual and concludes that it is because she is flirting outside, &quot;where it went into the air and didn't land anywhere&quot;).In summary, while this is a clever mystery and the legal elements are essential to the story (but not dominant), it can more appropriately be viewed as a story about Mary and the effect that this case has on her life. The premise is short on realism, but the details are wonderfully realistic and it is long on fun. It is a thriller laced throughout with real humor and character development. It has some serious weaknesses, including at times a very questionable timeline. (Any discussion of details is impossible without including some spoilers.) Usually the weaknesses in the story would have occasioned me rating it only four stars, but I felt that they were offset by its strengths and that the author defintely accomplished her goal of writing a real pageturner. Even the perhaps overly sentimental (and almost corny) nature of the conclusion was completely offset by the cleverness and appropriateness of the outcome of the legal proceedings due to Mary's hard work, persistence and luck. In conclusion. this is a feel good thriller; it will be enjoyed by those readers who can do without the extreme gore, violence, tension and profanity that so often are associated with the genre.Disclaimer: Based on my reviews of previous novels of this genre, I was furnished an ARC (Advance Review Copy) of this book by the publisher. This is the first book by the author that I have read, and I have never met either her or any representatives of the publisher. I made no representations or promises regarding any review that I might write. However, I have included this disclaimer in the interests of complete disclosure so that the reader may have all significant information concerning any facts that may be viewed as having biased my review.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"The book arrived as promised; it was in very good shape. It replaced a book at the local library because our puppy decided to \\"read\\" three borrowed books. The hardest part was replacing the inscription that was in the borrowed book."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"This the first of Ms. Scottoline's books I have read and it will most likely be the last. Poor writing and a totally implausable plot had me shaking my head. With so many good thriller writers out there I can't see myself giving this one a second try."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"When Lisa Scottoline's career began, I had high hopes for the author and her strong female lead characters. I was not disappointed . . . in the beginning.However, some of her more recent works (this book included) are proof that success has its pitfalls.While I like Scottoline's heroine Mary DiNunzio and her south Philly family roots, this story strayed way beyond the credible. . . at least to me.The Japanese war camp story was interesting, but the way Scottoline tied all the loose ends together wasn't at all tidy or believable.I hope the author goes back to HER roots . . . tidy, tight legal thrillers."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"Amadeo Brandolini moved from Italy to Philadelphia where he found work as a fisherman. He soon marries and begins a family when World War II breaks out. The FBI incarcerates Amadeo as one of ten-thousand Italian-Americans designated as an enemy. Amadeo is sent to Fort Missoula, Montana without the benefit of a trial to work in the sugar beet field. Not long afterward, Amadeo works with one other person and no one else in the vicinity. He is later found dead, ruled a suicide.Years later, Amadeo's son \\"hires\\" Mary DiNunzio of Rosato and Associates to sue the government for reparations. Being from South Philly like the victim and her client, the case means a lot more than her usual load to Mary. However, she never expected the roadblocks put up by the Feds nor that Amadeo might have been murdered and that her inquiries have brought her to the attention of the Saracones family who willingly will murder to keep World War II data interred in a dusty archive.The return of Rosato and Associates (See COURTING TROUBLE and EVERYWHERE THAT MARY WENT) would be a reason unto itself for legal thriller fans to rejoice. However, KILLER SMILE also adds a terrific insightful look at an ignominious moment in United States history with the lock up of ethnic Americans. The timing is perfect with the no fly list and enemy combatant principle employed today. Lisa Scottoline does not neglect the modern day investigation led by brass South Philly cheese steak attorney Mary. Readers will enjoy this entertaining yet educational cautionary tale on how easy the first amendment is tossed aside under the guise of \\"national security\\".Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"Mary DiNunzio, the widowed lawyer with smothering but loving Italian parents, takes center stage in \\"Killer Smile,\\" the latest novel by Lisa Scottoline. Mary is obsessed with a pro bono case that she is pursuing on behalf of the estate of the late Amadeo Brandolini. Brandolini was interned in Montana during World War II along with other Italian-Americans, and he apparently died by his own hand in 1942. Mary has been retained to sue the federal government for reparations on behalf of Amadeo's estate. Since there is very little documentation left after so many years, Mary is having a hard time putting together her case.As Mary digs further into Amadeo's background, even making a trip to Montana where he had been interned, she finds some puzzling clues that raise a number of intriguing questions. Did Amadeo really kill himself or was he murdered? If he was murdered, who killed him and why? Mary refuses to drop the case even after she is threatened and her office is ransacked. Mary's tenacious pursuit of the facts surrounding Amadeo's death soon places her career and her life in jeopardy.\\"Killer Smile\\" is paint-by-numbers Lisa Scottoline. She once again mines the Italian-American background of Mary DiNunzio for comic relief and poignancy. Mary's parents, Mariano and Vita, as well as her South Philadelphia neighbors, are all incredibly protective of her. Mary's relatives, neighbors, and colleagues are constantly setting her up on blind dates, but since her husband, Mike, was killed, Mary has been unable to fall in love with another man.The mystery of Amadeo's death is mildly engrossing, but not enough to offset a long and tedious narrative that leads to a melodramatic, pat, and predictable ending. The villains are thuggish, the good guys are sugary sweet, and the humor, which in previous novels was often delightful, is forced this time around. Mary is a bland character who cannot carry a whole novel on her frail shoulders.I found the subplot about the federal government's unfair detention of Italian-Americans during World War II compelling, especially since I knew more about the internment of the Japanese-Americans than about the victimization of other ethnic groups. Although \\"Killer Smile\\" provides a good history lesson about a shameful chapter in our country's history, it is a tepid and only mildly entertaining legal thriller."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"Attorneys often work late. They often lose track of time when immersed in law books and legal briefs. But when Mary DiNunzio gets a phone call from a man threatening to kill her, she instantly regrets being alone in the office at 10 o'clock at night. She can hardly leave quickly enough. Once outside, though, she believes she is being followed and can't shake the feeling that someone is watching her every move. It doesn't seem possible that anyone could be interested in the case she is working on, since it is a straightforward case of finding and returning property to one Amadeo Brandolini, a detainee from the camps of WWII. DiNunzio wants to serve justice by reimbursing his estate for the loss of some boats. Seems pretty benign.Bennie, head of the all-female law firm, gives specific orders for Mary to cease work on Amadeo's file. She has business out of town and needs some important cases covered in her absence. In the spirit of pleasing the boss, Mary agrees, with somewhat exaggerated enthusiasm. She immediately ignores Bennie's orders, landing her in hot water not only with her boss and some influential clients, but also the sinister forces trying to keep her from learning an old and highly damaging secret. With so much at stake, they aren't about to let an impetuous lawyer meddle in their business.Lisa Scottoline ratchets up the action when DiNunzio returns from a discovery trip to Montana. Having picked up some good leads there, Mary sneaks out to pursue some of them and nearly returns in an ambulance. In addition to trying to avoid the office tattletale, Bennie's files and some nasty folks bent on doing her harm, she tries to dodge an endless parade of well-meaning matchmakers. Too many of her friends --- okay, nearly all of them --- believe she needs to get over her dead husband and start dating again. With all of this going on, Mary's plate is beyond overflowing.KILLER SMILE beams with gusto and wit. While I wouldn't quite call it a thriller, it kept me rapt throughout its 350-plus pages. Chapters passed almost before I knew it. There's a darned good mystery here and a courageous heroine to carry the day.--- Reviewed by Kate Ayers"},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"It might be good if Ms. Scottoline sticks to history or the law, then uses a ghostwriter. Her discussion of the treatment of Italian-Americans is very good; her treatment of the protagonist is poor. The protagonist is a genius in one sentence, then a dolt in the next; not a believable character. The plot deserves a 10, the history deserves an 8, the legal writing deserves a 7, the writing deserves to be forgotten."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"Mary DiNunzio is tired of everyone trying to fix her up so she immerses herself into her job.

Someone does not want Mary to find out the truth and they will do whatever it takes to stop her...even murder.\`Killer Smile' is an enjoyable read but not one that is not on par with Lisa Scottoline's other novels. I found the plot somewhat dull and the secondary characters un-interesting. Scottoline does a nice job of peppering the novel with witty dialogue and there are some suspenseful moments that will genuinely surprise readers, but as a whole the novel just didn't work.Not one of the better Lisa Scottoline novels.Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"We have come to expect different kinds of books from Lisa Scottoline, depending upon which character carries the plot. It's one type of story if it is Bennie, another if it is Judy, and quite different if it is Mary. Mary DiNunzio is an earnest, appealing, \\"Stephanie Plum\\"-type lawyer. Her head is in the right place, but her heart often leads her astray as she pursues justice for her client. In Mary's stories, there is always more humor and more, for want of a better word, \\"Italianicity\\" (Italian + ethnicity). I won't repeat the plot of \\"Killer Smile,\\" as it has already been discussed. I will say, however, that Mary's singleminded pursuit of justice for her wronged client, an Italian alien interned during World War II, was a compelling and complex thriller that gathered speed as it unfolded and was hard to put down. In addition to reading the book, I also listened to Barbara Rosenblat's masterful performance on audio, which added another dimension to book. Listen if you can, even if you have read the book. Looking forward to the author's next entry in her series and wondering who will lead us through that thriller."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"I have only read a few Lisa Scottoline books, so picking up the unabridged audio sounded like a treat esp.with Barbara Rosenblat narrating, she does a wonderful job. This book dealt more with the past than the present. Not much on mystery, but very good read anyway. You know who the bad guy is, and the whole mystery part takes place in 1942. It is enjoyable following Mary around and listening to her dialouge esp. to herself. I do like the way Ms.Scottoline ties everything up at the end. I will read/listen to more of her books."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"Scottoline's legal fiction doesn't usually provide a history lesson but this one does. Based on the experience of her grandparents, it tells the story of an Italian immigrant, branded an emigrant alien in WWII and sent to an internment camp, where he committed suicide after his wife died. The young lawyer in the story, an Italian American from Philly, investigates on behalf of the immigrant's estate, and finds his death wasn't really suicide. He was murdered by a friend who stole his invention for some kind of a hatch for fishing boats that went on to earn millions for the murderer. Mary DeNunzio travels to the internment camp in Montana to investigate the case and returns to Philly with some answers. She is nearly killed by the murderer's family before she has her day in court, with Scottoline providing some riveting courtroom drama to conclude the book. But the highlight is certainly the history angle, the immigrant's story truly profound and Scottoline adept at telling it within the confines of a novel. And plenty of Philly flavor too, which is another highlight."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"I have read her previous books which had some legal and professional basis. Killer Smile has neither. The idea behind the plot is intriguing but he dialog and events make it more of a comedy than a mystery and some of the legal maneuvers are a joke."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"This book has 140 interesting pages. Unfortunately, it's 352 pages long. It starts out great - with a unique plot and some thought-provoking mystery elements. However, at page 141 it turns into a typical thriller novel with every possible cliche thrown in. The plot twists in the wind well beyond my ability for suspension of disbelief. I skipped through the last 3/5 of the book, wishing that I hadn't dropped $20 for the hardcover. My advice is to borrow it from the library."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"Retained to investigate property appropriation of long-ago internment camp veteran Amadeo Bandolini, Mary DiNunzio finds herself caught up in the story of a young man who apparently committed suicide over sixty years ago. Ordered out of town, Mary visits the site of the camp in Missoula, Montana, and becomes convinced Amadeo didn't commit suicide. He was murdered. And, in the present, the lawyer for Amadeo's son's estate is also murdered.Mary soon learns the identity of the murderer, although she hasn't a shred of proof. And there's no motive.But in the style we've come to expect from Scottoline, Mary can't just leave matters to the police. She undertakes a spot of breaking-and-entering, faces down a very wealthy and powerful adversary, falls into a trap that gets her locked into a car trunk, and a whole lot more. Meanwhile, she's dodging a series of blind dates from nice-enough guys who don't stand a chance with the ghost of her dead husband, Mike. Her aging parents confront health challenges. And she matches wits with Judy Carrier, her all-time best friend.The joy of this book comes from Scottoline's powerful plotting and sense of drama. Seemingly small throwaways -- like the curvey letters on the doors of Italian households on Mercer Street -- turn out to be relevant. Mary's blind dates turn the plot wheel a little faster.Mary is the deepest and most sympathetic of Scottoline's characters -- possibly her alter ego, as she's hinted in interviews. We see Judy Carrier through Mary's eyes, even when Carrier takes stage center. Benny Rosato remains a distant matriarchal power figure. This time, Scottoline wisely turns the story over to Mary, complete with Mary's sardonic humor that she doesn't dare say aloud. Some of these scenes -- e.g., when Mary compares a going-nowhere conversation to a high school French lesson -- are simply brilliant. Only a pro could pull it off.And only a special author could keep the suspense going as Mary pages back through dusty archives. The ending is plausible and fun, though just a tad coincidental. But if you make it that far, you won't care.Lisa Scottoline could be a model for wannabe mystery writers. Then again, maybe she shouldn't. She makes it look easy but it's incredibly hard. I can't wait for the next volume in the series...Just one question for Lisa: When will Judy and Mary make partner in the Rosato firm? They're not really &quot;young associates.&quot; They made partner in a big white-shoe law firm already, and they're getting a lot of seasoning."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"I am an avid fan of Lisa Scottoline's novels. I usually read her books within a day or two of publication. However, this book was not nearly as compelling a read as previous books. I could take it or leave it--not becoming very involved in the story line.Very little of the book concerns the &quot;girls&quot; at the firm. I missed the &quot;lawyering&quot; that takes place in the other books.If you've not read Scottoline before, don't pick this one as your first."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"I've read a few of Lisa Scottoline's books (Look Again, Legal Tender) and found them to be good reads. I thought this one was so bad, I couldn't even finish reading it. I kept waiting for something significant to happen or what the end game was going to be and it just never happened. Didn't seem to have any point at all."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"The girls of Bennie's firm are back, this time with Mary DiNunzio taking the lead. She's devoted to (obsessed by) a pro bono case, getting justice and remuneration for an Italian-American fisherman who died in an internment camp during WWII. The story takes her all over Philly, and even farther away from home than she's ever been before, and there's a lot of intrigue, and quite a few convenient coincidences. (The latter is a Scottoline weakness.) But still, the character development is solid and some passages were genuinely moving. (Especially the one where Mary takes her father's arm.) A few of the plot twists were genuine shockers. And the backstory about people like Bandolini is serious and deserves telling."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"First, I had never read one of this author's books before although I live near Philadelphia and my best friends are from South Philly. Everyone urged me to read one, and just by accident I picked up this one. Wow. Not only is it well-researched and interesting, but it was funny, sad, and swift moving. Not only were the Philadelphia details authentic and colorful, but so were the ones in Montana where I lived and where my daughter also lived for a decade. I loved the characters and from reading this review, am glad to see that there are more books where they reappear. It isn't rocket science--it's entertainment, but intelligent and fun, yet you care a great deal about the people in the story.The back story about the Italians who were interned was fascinating and sad, but goes to show what kind of courageous people these Italians were--not a bunch of whiners despite the indignity. I liked the information at the back of the book that will enable me to delve deeper into that period--especially those who went to Montana."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"This is a fairly entertaining read, but it could have been more suspenseful and with more action. A little too chatty at times, annoyingly so.Still, overall I enjoyed it. My first Lisa Scottoline novel. I'd be willing to try another. She certainly loves her native Philadeplhia and that comes through as does her pride in her Italian-American heritage. I really learned something new about Italians being interned in World War II, something I didn't know before. The historical storyline is very interesting and a departure from most thrillers. The book is well researched and accurate.Overall, a good read but not a spectacular one.James A. Anderson,Author, DEADLINE"},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"I thought the story line was great. Introducing Italian immigrants, connecting with early homeland security, mysterious drawings, twists of plot, and a happy ending all made the book enjoyable. And who doesn't like a victorious courtroom drama? The author has an easy way with descriptions and adding humor in clever quips. The drawback of this book was the main character, Mary. Mary - so socially inept, engaging in stupid and dangerous stunts, and breaking the law through her impetuous activities detracted from a good plot. If the heroine were not so bumbling, I would give this book a five. I would still recommend the book for a good entertaining read."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"This is a pretty good light mystery book. The heroine is at least differnt from the run of the mill super detective that you usually find in these type of books. The story centers around Mary who is still recovering from the death of her husband (in a earlier book?) and is working on a pro bono case invloving the death of an Italian business man that died in a internment camp during WWII along with trying to fend off her well meaning friends and family that set her up with blind dates. As Mary investigates she begins to find more and more evidence that the man was murdered and did not commit suicide which sets in motion a series of events that has Mary fighting for her life.The book moves at a good pace and has a sense of humor through out. Also has no sex scences, so you dont have to skip through those parts to get back to the story.All and all a good book if you like fast paced mysteries."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"Lisa Scottoline uses some of her family history in writing this book which features lawyer Mary DiNunzio. Mary has taken on a case for the estate of Amadeo Brandolini, an Italian who was interned during WWII. While in the internment camp Amadeo died, supposedly by committing suicide. His son's estate is asking Mary to seek reparations for Amadeo's death. While investigating the case, Mary begins to unlock secrets which have been covered up for many years. Because of her knowledge, she is pursued by people who have a lot to lose if her story comes to light. She dodges all sorts of bodily harm, while her well-meaning friends try to fix her up with an interesting variety of bachelors.Scottoline's paternal grandparents, while not interned during the war, were required to register as enemy aliens, despite the fact that they had lived in the US as law-abiding citizens for several decades. In this book, author Scottoline brings these injustices to light. Many people know that Japanese were interned during the war, but I,for one, was unaware that Italians were also being arrested during this time.Despite the interesting historical background of the book, it lacks the pace and suspense of many of Scottoline's other novels."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"This is my second Scottoline book and while she's not my absolute favorite mystery writer, I sure enjoy her books! They are entertaining and in this case, a bit informative especially regarding WWII and the internment of the Americans of German, Italian and Japanese descents.Mary DiNunzio, an attorney, has a new case ~~ the strange suicide of an Italian fisherman who was interned during a dark chapter of American history. The deeper Mary digs into the case, the more bizarre it becomes. Then a lawyer who she grew up with is murdered and the case takes off, sending Mary off into a chase to find out the truth of who murdered her friend and if exactly it was a suicide at the camp all those years ago.It is a fast-paced novel for me ~~ like one reviewer here mentioned, it's a bit far out to have a lawyer spilling her guts out to a reporter and messing with a crime scene ~~ but to me, it is what makes it fiction and fun. So this is a fun read ~~ nothing too spooky that you can't read in the middle of the night. Perfect beach reading, really.If you like Scottoline's other books, then you will enjoy this one. If you're looking for a fast-paced murder mystery that keeps your mind occupied, this is a good one to try!6-15-06"},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"Like her counterpart male lawyers turned writer (Grisham, Turow, Martini et al), Lisa Scottoline is a Philadelphia lawyer turned author who indeed writes about what she knows about. Her series feature the Philly-based, all-female attorney law firm of Ms. Bennie Rosato and Associates, but like several of her earlier novels, Mary DiNunzio is again the &quot;star&quot; of &quot;Smile&quot;. Working long hours has become a norm for the young widowed Mary, this time on a pro bono case involving an Italian-American, Amadeo Brandolini, who was interned in that horrid sweep of some 10,000 east coast Italians conducted during WWII. While in a Montana internment camp, Brandolini commits suicide; and Mary has been hired 60 years later to seek reparations for his confiscated property (fishing boats). That she is a South Philly Italian descendant herself makes the case even more personal for Mary, as her family and circle of friends are all counting on her. When her tireless investigations, including a trip to Montana (&quot;it's somewhere left of Philly&quot;), reveal that the suicide may instead have been a homicide, more violence ensues as yet another Italian family, the Saracones, is implicated. Moreover, the Saracones seem to have untold wealth with no obvious source. The plot thickens as Mary becomes hounded by followers and injured left and right. A last ditch effort in court to stave off the Saracones selling the &quot;golden goose&quot; is a fitting touch to a suspenseful tale that keeps the pages turning quite smartly!Scottoline has penned a cogent plot -- yet one with funny dialogue and amusing happenings to lighten the tone that might otherwise be set by the dark deeds that unravel as the book unfolds. Judy and Bennie put in just brief cameos, so it's really Mary and her family that carry the whole storyline. That the internment scenario was one borne out of a similar set of circumstances in earlier generations of the author's own family, complete with reproduced copies of their &quot;alien registration&quot; cards, added a sense of history and intensity to the tale. Only some far-fetched actions by lawyer Mary, such as breaking and entering a crime scene, kept us from a 5-star award. All in all, &quot;Smile&quot; is a fine addition to this growing series that readers, both old fans and new, will find most entertaining. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"Not as good as her earlier ones, but an interesting plot line.

I thoroughly enjoyed this tale with its entertaining plot twists. The book has a natural flow and along with the mystery gives you a few chuckles along the way. The characters are well fleshed out and believable in their actions. I look forward to new stories from Ms. Scottoline and am eagerly looking for past books by this same author to read and enjoy! I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes and mystery and enjoys some humor. There are too many dark and depressing thrillers available and this book is a refreshing change!--- Valerie"},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"Others here have detailed the plot line of this most entertaining book. I had not read this author before receiving an unsolicited ARE (Advanced Reader Edition) from the publisher with an invitation to read it and review it. I was aware of her and wondered if her works were like Janet Evanovitch with her Stephanie Plum novels, which are light and frothy chick detective novels. Scottoline, in my opinion, delivers a more hefty effort. The story is interesting, the mystery takes some time to unravel, the characters are well drawn and when the plot turns dangerous it gets a bit compelling as well. Add to that the information contained in the book about the Italian American internment camps and you have a bit of a learning experience also. A pretty interesting mix."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"This was my first read by author Lisa Scottoline. Given that I'm originally from Philadelphia, I was looking forward to reading this story set in the City of Brotherly Love. In that respect, I was not disappointed, as the novel was peppered with numerous specific references to Philly landmarks-so many, in fact, that I think a non-Philadelphian might feel somewhat bewildered at times. Unfortunately, the story itself failed to meet my expectations.The book opens with main character Mary DiNunzio, a young attorney, researching a case concerning deceased Italian immigrant Amadeo Brandolini. Being a South Philly Italian herself, Mary is determined unravel Amadeo's enigmatic past (which includes his apparent suicide) and to get reparations for his estate. As Mary becomes increasingly obsessed with Amadeo's life, her behavior becomes increasingly unbelievable, and the storyline itself becomes increasingly implausible: Mary ignores her other cases, is involved in a series of bizarre events, and is able to solve the mystery of Amadeo's past through near-miraculous circumstances. Finally, the various subplots-Mary's widowhood, her mother's illness, etc.-added so little to the main story that I wondered why they were included. I might give Lisa Scottoline another chance, but I'd be unlikely to recommend this book to anyone other than perhaps a Philadelphia native."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"Scottoline always excels at characterization and dialogue, much of it witty. She's in top form here; and in addition to these strengths, I found this one of her best plots.

During that time, Amadeo lost everything and committed suicide. Mary realizes that maybe this case isn't ancient history after all. Add the fact that everyone is setting Mary up on blind dates, in the hopes that she will not be a young widow for much longer. However, when a killer comes after her, Mary realizes that she may not be able to handle everything that's on her plate.I have never read a Lisa Scottoline novel before, but after reading KILLER SMILE, I hope to have the chance to read other novels by her. Mary is a fun, yet extremely intelligent protagonist, who's hardworking demeanor, and great outlook on life, even though she has suffered many hardships, is inspirational, and uplifting. Her character will win a place in the hearts of female readers the world over. The law firm that she works for, Rosato and Associates, is reminiscent of the various womens-only television shows, and will have fans of Lifetime Channel for Women's programs dying to read the next Scottoline novel. A must-have!Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"These are a few of the commonplace expressions of the supposedly mature, educated, intelligent female protagonists of the author's series of books about an all-women law firm in Philly. The problem is, it's not an all-women firm: it's a girly firm with actions, dialogue and clothing more appropriate to an eighth-grade clique than to college-educated, seasoned professional women. Despite the occasional interesting plotlines and background, I can never get past how silly these people are and how they never seem to grow past their eeks and yikes. Come on, Ms. Scottoline: stop dumbing down your characters and raise them to an acceptably mature level - it's way past time for that."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"This is my first book by the author. I enjoyed the twist at the end of the book but overall I felt there were several sections of the book that really dragged. Other parts were just ridiculous and tough to believe.

Killer Smile is another page turner and I can hardly wait until she releases her next book.My husband and I moved to the Philadelphia area about two years and I always saw her books featured prominently in the library as well as in area bookstores. I checked out Running from the Law at the library and immediately became a fan. She writes in such a \\"real\\" way that I have felt that I have been in the presence of Bennie and her associates. Ms. Scottoline's characters are real. The kitchen of Mary's parents is so vivid in my mind that I can smell the marinara sauce that Mrs. DeNunzio is making for dinner. Judy, Mary's best friend and lawyer pal is perfect in her own way. I have fallen in love with the characters.We prefer audio books and have listened to nine of Ms Scottoline's. The first two of her books are not available on audio, so I will have curl up and read those soon. Along with good writing, you need a superb reader and Barbara Rosenblatt is one!!!! The combination is so enjoyable. Ms Rosenblatt's voice is friendly and her dialects are unbelievable. We have listend to two other Scottoline books on audio that were read by other readers and the story was not as enjoyable. It was a struggle because the reader just read, she did not bring the charcters to life. I had to get use to Ms Rosenblatt's style because there were long lulls between chapters and you could hear her throat sounds as she paused, but they added to the story.This is a book that you can read and enjoy without having to have read the othes. The Vendetta Defense, also by Ms. Scottoline is an all time favorite of mine. Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"The protagonists of other Lisa Scottoline books (Rosato and Associates) are back. In this latest installment, Mary DiNunzio takes center stage (with Bennie Rosato and Judy Carrier playing supporting roles). Drawing on her own family history, Scottoline weaves the story of Italian immigrants during WWII (imprisoned in internment camps and stripped of their belongings) into a modern tale of murder, fraud and general mayhem. In this story Mary is representing the estate of an Italian immigrant (Amadeo Brandolini)who, it turns out, didn't commit suicide at all. His murderer stole his invention, made millions and now his family will do anything, including killing anyone who gets in their way, to keep Mary from exposing them. The Scottoline trademark of mixing generous doses of humor throughout the drama is present. There are some situations that stretch credibility (like attorney Mary DiNunizo breaking into a sealed crime scene, for example), but don't let that hinder your enjoyment of the story.All Lisa Scottoline books seem to follow the same basic outline. Regardless, her books are very entertaining page turners that you don't want to put down. If you've enjoyed Scottoline's other Rosato and Associates books, you will definately like this. If you're new to the adventures of this all women Philly law firm, you've found a gold nugget. I suggest you curl up and enjoy the ride (and then check out their other stories)."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"A young Philadelphia lawyer refuses to turn her back on an investigation involving an Italian man in an internment camp in Montana back during World War II. When the investigation runs into a seemingly dead end, when the money and the support for the investigation disappear, when everyone around Mary Dinunzio pleads with her to quit, she is unable to do so. She feels a moral responsibility to a man she never knew and continues to piece things together. Was his death an accident, a suicide or was it a murder? Things take an ugly turn when she turns up the heat on her investigation, and people start getting hurt. An intriguing tale of an immigrant making his way in his new country becomes a critical aspect of her investigation.Meanwhile, as Mary is stepping on some dangerous toes, those around her can only think about her lack of a lovelife!This is an interesting mix of history, romance, danger and friendship."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"KILLER SMILE by Lisa ScottolineLisa Scottoline's latest legal thriller, KILLER SMILE, takes the reader back to WW II to solve a mystery involving an Italian immigrant. Lawyer Mary DiNunzio is working for a client whose family goes back to WW II when a number of Italian Americans were rounded up and placed in internment camps, similar to the Japanese Americans. Amadeo Brandolini died during WW II at one of the camps, and Mary is trying to figure out if this was truly a suicide, or murder.She picks up clues that lead her to the conclusion that it was murder, and as she delves further into the history of this man, she finds herself in danger. When her law office is burglarized, she can't imagine that this is related to her investigation of Brandolini's life. Her boss Bennie Rosato is not pleased that Mary cannot let go of this investigation, because it is obvious that all Mary can do is breath and think about Amadeo.A side trip to Fort Missoula, Montana, where the internment camp used to be, helps Mary put more pieces together. She discovers that Amadeo had a close friend at the camp, which may be the key to what really happened.I enjoyed reading KILLER SMILE. It was not your typical legal thriller, since Scottoline spent a good part of the book on the Italian American experience during WW II. It was an eye-opener, as I had thought only the Japanese Americans were sent to the camps during this awful time in history. One thing I was not happy about, however, were the many errors that were made during one scene of the book. An entire scene taking place in a Japanese restaurant showed countless errors referring to specific foods. The word \\"togarashi\\" is red pepper, NOT sweet potato cakes as was told in the book. An error such as this is either a poor research job or misinformation, and the author needs to find a different source in terms of researching details such as this. I am assuming the facts about the Italian American experiences during WW II are accurate.Despite the few negative comments, I am going to give this book 4 stars. It was worth the read despite the errors, and non-Japanese readers will definitely not catch them. This is my second book by Scottoline, and I definitely plan on reading the rest."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"Here is another fascinating book by Lisa Scottoline which kept me glued to every word from beginning to end. Mary DiNunzio, a lawyer with Rosatto & Associates law firm represents the interests of a client, Amadeo Brandolini, who had died in 1942. The more she investigates his past, the more she learns about a little known historical/political event when Italian immigrants were interred in a camp during World War II to protect the US from potential harm. Mary becomes obsessessed with learning the truth of how he died and about a piece of paper she discovered in his wallet which she surmised was very valuable. It had circles and something else on it. Everyone to whom she showed it believed it was merely doodles but... her hunch was it had to be very important or else why was it folded carefully in his wallet? The more she dug, the more she wanted to learn the truth. The facts were he was Italian and Catholic and unlikely to commit suicide, this knowledge gnawed at her.Mary's need to know led her to the internment camp in Montana, where she searched for people to interview who might have known Amadeo Brandolini. She went to the cemetery where he was buried and went to the site where he allegedly committed suicide. Several clues of what she learned there haunted her ... It is totally amazing how Lisa Scottoline ties together the clues and discoveries as Mary DiNunzio is provided hints and gradually puts the pieces of the puzzle together. The reader is fascinated with the life of Amadeo Brandolino, a simple fisherman from Italy who came to the US to build a better life for himself and his wife Theresa. After Mary returns, she believes she is being followed by a black car ... the lawyer who hired her to investigate Brandolini's estate had removed her from the case before her trip (although she persisted investigating on her own) and is found dead in his office. She learns Amadeo's best friend in the camp ... is still alive and a very wealthy elderly Italian man, who also was from Philadelphia and lives in a rich suburban home. Under false pretext she visits him and exchanges a few words ... only to be struck in the face and spit on by his son. The ingenius methods by which Mary DiNunzio achieves her goals are worth discovering. With amazing twists and turns in the plot, the reader is taken for a wonderful reading experience. This reader is totally captivated by the dazzling writing style and talents of Lisa Scottoline.Erika Borsos (erikab93)"},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"Lisa Scottoline's &quot;Killer Smile&quot; is more than just a suspenseful and engaging mystery with great characterization and plot. It is historically enlightening as we are reminded of the internment camp relocation of over 10,000 Italian-Americans during the outbreak of World War II. But first and foremost- &quot;Killer Smile&quot; is a fantastic mystery.Scottoline's story is compelling and sincere. What is even more touching is that Lisa draws from her own paternal grandparent's experiences for this novel. Her father would have been so proud of this book by his daughter.&quot;Killer Smile&quot; is more than historically engaging, however. It is a mystery that has you turning pages quickly because it is so gripping and suspenseful.I especially loved the thoughts of Mary throughout the book in regard to her feelings toward her family and friends. Some were particularly hilarious and Scottoline is quickly turning into one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"Lisa Scottoline's 2004 legal thriller is as much about history as it is about personal danger in pursuit of justice. Mary DiNunzio is a young lawyer at the all-female firm of Rosato and Associates embarking on a pro bono case to sue the U.S. government for reparations on behalf of the estate an Italian-American who committed suicide in 1942 while at a internment camp in Montana. Wading through documents, Mary uncovers a lead that suggests perhaps Amadeo's death was not as simple as previously thought. Her persistent sleuthing puts her and others' lives in danger, and, as she gets closer to the truth, the stakes become obviously more modern day than historical.After an awkward start and all-too-obvious false suspense, this novel picks up as Mary starts to understand the history of the Italian-American persecution during World War II and meets the characters both peripheral and pertinent to her case. The strength of this novel lies not in the suspense (which is decent but not page-turning) but in the unfolding of history as it relates to the present; to Scottoline's credit, these historical details are revealed through the experiences and voices of her characters, not through preachy passages. The characterizations are mostly memorable, although the characters that talk in all capital letters can be annoying, and the premise is a poignant one. Scottoline uses the setting of Philadelphia well, making it impossible for this thriller to be set elsewhere. Unfortunately, Scottoline's attempt to make history come alive in present-day Philadelphia results in forced plot turns and unneeded peril. The final revelation and its implications, however, rescue the rest.Despite some clumsy writing and a premise that is more historical and sociological than by-your-throat suspenseful, KILLER SMILE is an entertaining read. Readers looking for high adrenaline levels will likely be disappointed, as will be those expecting a thorough look at American internment issues. This legal thriller is a light mix of suspense and history, a pleasant enough way to spend a few hours."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"A reader doesn't just read a Lisa Scottoline novel instead the reader becomes one with the novel; whether Mary is in dialogue with her friends; or in the kitchen with her Mother and Judy. In the kitchen scenes one can smell the cooking; the sauce -0h the sauce - my mouth was watering without ever losing site of the dialogue and the familial affection and respect.Ms. Scottline brings to the attention reader a subject little know to many American's which was the internment of Italians during the war. The uprooting of immigrants who were the part and parcel of the foundation of our nation and lovers of America who, while enjoying the marriage of their special ethnic heritage and new American ways, were taken by 'big brother' and set apart from home, family and friends and transported across the United States; stripped of hard gained assets and identification to live like prisoners in the country alleged paved with gold.Share the dedication, loyalty and camaraderie of the friends in the book and the tenacity of each to push forward to find the truth.You don't have to go to South Philly to become part of this story - just read the first page and you are there."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"Normally I enjoy Lisa Scottoline's books and the gang at Rosato and Associates. However, this one left a lot to be desired.The camaraderie between the main characters is usually fun, but in this book I found it highly annoying -- I kept wondering when Mary and Judy would just get a room already and be done with it.I also found Mary, usually the wallflower of the group, to be highly annoying as the lead character. Her hundreds of apologies got old really fast, and her stupidity made me want to put the book down several times without finishing it. The worst came when she broke into a crime scene to steal evidence and basically got off with a slap on the wrist when she confessed what she'd done to the lead detective. Close behind were the two scenes at the Saracone house, when she broke away from the wife at a run to storm in on Gio on his deathbed, and when she waltzed into the house pretending to be a \\"funeral planner\\" in order to snoop. None of this was realistic and all these things made me dislike the character even more than I already did. She was wimpy, stupid and annoying.Normally I enjoy Ms. Scottoline's writing style, but I found it annoying during this book. The constant \\"Crak Crak Crak\\" of the gavel throughout the trial, the \\"Kick Kick Kick\\" when Mary was being kidnapped, and everything her father said being typed in all caps nearly drove me insane.If we see the gang from Rosato and Associates soon, I hope the book is better, or I may just give up on this group."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"I've read other books by this author before and thought that this one would be a quick and fun read, which it was. It was not spellbinding and I certainly didn't feel the need to get up and read the book at every chance I got. It was a cute story, but had many predictable elements. The main character is often times so goofy that you just want her to wake up and enter the real world. The plot elements are also very predictable - making the book unappealing for mystery readers who enjoy interesting and unique plot turns."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"Rosato & Associates has one hard-working, dedicated associate in young Mary DiNunzio who has sworn to find a way to collect reparations for the estate of an Italian-American who died in 1942 while in an internment camp. The immigrant, Amadeo Brandolini, owned three fishing boats. What ever happened to the fishing boats after he died in the camp?Mary's situation is encouraged by having been recently widowed, so she has time on her hands . . . and blind dates to avoid. So when the budget for the Brandolini matter is exhausted, she works on in a dedicated way late into the night.The case revolves around records, archives and fading memories of the few people who were alive then. Mary couldn't be more determined, even if it were for her own family.From a few scattered clues, she becomes convinced that the story of Brandolini's death don't make sense. Could it be that there's a greater wrong hidden behind the government's interning hand?If you love Mary DiNunzio and poking around in old mysteries through documents, you will think this is a fine novel. If neither one appeals to you, look elsewhere. This is a Rosato & Associates book you could skip without harming your understanding of the series.I graded the book down because there's a little too much Mary to the exclusion of the other characters. The plot is also way too convenient for how the clues keep turning up at just the right time. In a number of places, I felt like the plot development just didn't make sense . . . even after rereading the material to try to find what I had missed. The courtroom ending will remind you of Perry Mason pulling a rabbit out of the hat at the last moment. And, well, I always thought those were pretty far-fetched too.But how can I grade down a decent lawyer too far who looks out for the downtrodden? You don't find many stories like that in today's fiction."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"I have read all of Lisa Scottoline's books and naturally was looking forward to this one. Usually I can't put them down, but this one (although the historical background is interesting) is VERY slow moving to me. I pick it up and just as easily put it down. I think the narrative could have been told in few pages and maybe the effect would have been the production of a better book. I will keep reading her stories, but would not highly recommend this one especially to an individual who has never read one of her books before."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"This is the first time I read a book by Lisa Scottoline.

It's so slow that I can't wait for something to happen."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"Lisa Scottoline's Mary DiNunzio series is on my so-so list of books. I'll read them if they come my way but I don't go out of my way to find them. I generally listen to the audio versions as the buyer at our library seems to be a huge Scottoline fan and never misses a one. However, I happened to come across a paperback copy of Killer Smile and trudged my way through it. This book is a terrific example of everything I hate about this series.First of all the heroine, Mary DiNunzio, is just too dumb to live and in this book she more than proves it, breaking laws right and left to try to track down what happened in the 1940's when an Italian fisherman dies in an American intern camp in Montana. Mary has been hired by his family's estate to find out what happened, however she continues on the case even after the estate \\"fires her.\\" She barges her way into the house of the man who was with the fisherman when he died and terrorizes the old man, who is on his death bed, lying to his wife/widow about her actions. She enters a police crime scene and removes evidence. She lies repeatedly to her boss about her actions and leaves her paying clients stranded while she pursues her obsession with this case. It is a source of wonder to me that this idiot is able to get herself dressed in the morning, much less have any kind of credibility as a lawyer.And yet... and yet... Mary may get herself into the dumbest situations, but she also gets herself out. She doesn't have to be rescued by some handsome male interest, or even her friend Judy or her boss, Bennie Rosato. As impulsively stupid as she can be, when she stops to think and use her brain, she is able to come up with solutions to her problems and to work her way out of very tight situations. I have watched her character grow from a sheltered child of loving parents to a woman who is becoming more comfortable and trusting of herself and the decisions she makes.This book has a lot of major holes in it and some loose ends. What was Keisha going to tell Mary that was so important that she had to be stopped? What happened to the actual blind date who was supposed to be waiting in the restaurant for Mary? There are more, but I don't want to get into spoilers so I won't bother with them.Suffice it to say that while this is definitely one of the weaker Scottoline books, it does provide some important growth for Mary's character. These books still haven't moved to the top of my must read list, but I am starting to appreciate them more."},{"Title":"KILLER SMILE","review":"This is the first Lisa Scottoline book I have read, but after reading this one I know I will read more.

Are they right ?I liked they dealt with the internment of the Italians during World War 2.I was ignorant about this chapter in history until now. The author even talks about it at length at the end of the story. I know a lot of older Italians and yes they have the first initial of there last name embossed on the front door.The humor was belly laugh funny. Esp when Mary goes to the hip sushi place where the seats glow in the dark and make your butt differant colors. Her dad talking loudly about the importance of fresh lettuce at a funeral and Mary trying to get of a business lunch by pretending to need a cigarette so she can check her text messages was hysterical. The funeral planner chapter I listened to twice.I thought the lady who read it on tape should just have read the book instead of trying do voices.

In addition it includes serious and well-thought-out discussions on the meaning of food to humankind.Camporesi, a Professor of Italian Literature at the University of Bologna, informs the reader in his first essay, &quot;Bread and Death: Food and Peasant Rituals in Italy&quot; of something that may come as a surprise: &quot;the fearful threat of famine continued to hang over people's lives until the middle of the nineteenth century,&quot; and what is thought of today as the &quot;Italian national diet&quot; was in fact a late nineteenth- century invention. Before then, the peasants of Italy were frequently hungry, &quot;thrift was the iron law of the table,&quot; people lived frugally on some bread, maybe a little wine, greens and root vegetables, maize and chestnuts, snails and frogs, fish occasionally, a little pasta, very little fruit, and very little meat. Dairy products and eggs were limited to what one's one animal (or much less frequently, animals) could produce.Industrialization contributed greatly and decisively to the expansion of the Italian diet, and what we think of today as Italian food owes much to the ninteeeth century's embrace of railroad and steamship.Camporesi has an unromantic and passionate interest in the social history of the Italian peasantry. In &quot;The Two Faces of Time: The City Calendar and the Country Calendar&quot; he explores the myths and ritual of the clock and the calendar, and his focus on the diet and practices of the peasantry threads through each essay.An essay of particular interest to students of food history, food geography, meaning and ritual is &quot;Dietary Geography and Social History,&quot; a remarkable study which includes a discussion of the geography of fats and oils (no small thing in a country that is the world's largest exporter of olive oil). There are essays on the contrasts between city and country cooking, and bourgeois cooking in the nineteenth century. One of Camporesi's pet topics, &quot;Shopping for Food&quot; includes a plea to &quot;touch, sniff, handle, and swallow.&quot; He rejects grocery-store modernization and standardization (and food as status symbols), and wants food to be sustenance and sensual essential, &quot;the umbilical cord that must never be cut.&quot; Food is too important, he asserts, to ever be &quot;still life.&quot;There is much to this careful and scholarly book that will thrill and educate, as well as surprise. There's a glossary of Italian food names, a bibliography (most of the books are in Italian only, though), many pages of endnotes, and a good index. Great stuff."},{"Title":"The Humanity of God","review":"I was really impressed with how good quality this book was. The only drawback at all was a library tag on the spine -- very minor in my opinion!"},{"Title":"The Prairie Primer: Literature Based Unit Studies Utilizing the \\"Little House\\" Series","review":"Laura Ingall Wilder's Little House on the Prairie series is amongst the most often recommended read-alouds in homeschooling circles. In fact, the complete nine-book series provided our family's earliest chapter book read-aloud experiences. Since that time we've re-read favourite books from the series - particularly Farmer Boy - but we've never sought to mine the historical treasures to be found in these beloved fictional autobiographies.The next time we read through the Little House series we'll have Margie Gray's excellent unit study The Prairie Primer in hand. Gray provides an in-depth study of the series that can be completed in one or two years alongside the novels and other recommended supplementary resources. Incorporating history, language arts, science, domestic arts, Bible, character development and fine art, this guide for students in grades three through six can easily be adjusted to involve older and younger students for an educational experience the entire family can enjoy.Clearly organized for easy use, Gray makes the lesson planning process simple for busy mothers. If you've tried planning your own unit studies from scratch you'll appreciate the effort that goes into choosing appropriate resources, developing activities and conducting research. Gray's provision of a general overview to each book (including relevant historical and background information), weekly planning guides that are invaluable in gathering knowledge and material in advance, and the clearly laid out daily lesson plans with scheduled readings, comprehension questions and a plethora enrichment activities are the keys to a simple unit study.While the presentation and organization pull everything together for homeschooling parents, the content is excellent as well. Reading through the Primer provided an additional level of depth and understanding as Gray tied together Ingall's life with historical events, revealed the actual chronological order of the events of the books, and shared additional background information from Ingall's life. Reproducible worksheets and forms are also included for suggested learning activities which correlate with the portion of text studied that day.The daily activities provide far more options than a typical homeschooling family will be able to accomplish in a single day. Many times lengthy assignments are suggested, involving research, report writing, and presentation - a project requiring more than a single day's effort. Picking and choosing from the available activities will result in your children learning through a variety of modalities (visual, hands-on, tactile, auditory etc.) while working in a number of subject areas each day.Of particular interest to Christian parents is the integration of applicable Bible passages and scripture memorization suggestions that are tied into the study of the text, enlivening the selected passages. I still recommend a systematic Bible study in your home apart from thePrimer, as the verses examined are topically included, serving more as character lessons than deep study. This focus upon character and illustration allows for profitable use of the material by Christian families of a wide variety of denominational bents Major doctrinal issues are generally left unexamined while the author maintains a conservative, Christian worldview throughout.As a homeschooling mother herself, Gray has pulled together as many features to simplify life for the teacher as possible. One such inclusion is an extensive appendix of suggested suppliers for the many recommended resources Gray shares throughout the Primer. Last revised in 2000, some of the suppliers are no longer in business (where am I going to find dry owl pellets for dissection now?), and parents will need to do some extra scouting to find replacement suppliers.Whether you are interested in using The Prairie Primer to tackle several major subjects for the year, or simply want to use it in conjunction with your family's read through and take advantage of the background information and some light activities, Gray has penned an invaluable resource. The ease of use paired with Ingalls much beloved series guarantees a delightful educational experience for both you and your children."},{"Title":"The Prairie Primer: Literature Based Unit Studies Utilizing the \\"Little House\\" Series","review":"\\"The Prairie Primer\\" is a unit study written to cover the westward movement/pioneer era using Laura Ingalls Wilder's \\"Little House\\" book series as the spine. Topics covered in this unit study include: Bible, literature, art, science, creative writing, cooking and history.The pluses of this curriculum are:1. The curriculum is extremely affordable. The unit study can be done over a period of one to two years.2. The study emphasizes character development from a Biblical perspective.3. The author has included a section on the study of Native Americans.4. The unit study method works well with all types of learning styles.5. The unit study method is great for teaching younger students basic library skills. In regard to the older student it reinforces the basic library skills while teaching research skills.The minuses of this curriculum are:1. Several of the books which are required for the curriculum have gone out of print. The parent or older student will need to search for materials to replace those which are no longer in print.Overall I think the concept of studying the life and era of Laura Ingalls Wilder's is a fantastic idea for studying the pioneer era/westward movement of the United States."},{"Title":"The Prairie Primer: Literature Based Unit Studies Utilizing the \\"Little House\\" Series","review":"I have always loved the Little House books but my interest increased when my oldest child asked me to read them to her at the beginning of our homeschool journey over 7 years ago. We'd sit for hours on the couch reading till my eyes refused to focus on the page anymore. I'd take a short break and dive in again because my daughter was begging for more. How could I say no? I wish we'd found the Prairie Primer back then because we missed out on so much fun. I never knew you could learn so much and touch on so many academic subjects simply from reading one chapter. So far we've read books on manners, watched videos on light, bears, owls, gun safety, cleaning house... we even successfully made butter and we're only on day 4.This unit study is wonderful. I want to do every activity. In fact it's Sunday and my 2nd daughter wants to \\"do school\\" today- that's how much she loves it. I'd also love to try Cadron Creek's Further Up and Further In unit study of the Chronicles of Narnia. Now my problem is there's so much good curricula and so little time. :)"},{"Title":"The Prairie Primer: Literature Based Unit Studies Utilizing the \\"Little House\\" Series","review":"We are finishing up the Prairie Primer this week. I have used this unit study last year and this year with my 3rd-4th grade daughter and 5th-6th grade son. We have all loved it wholeheartedly, and I'm so sad that it's ending. The author takes advantage of the things you read about in each chapter to delve into a whole myriad of topics, everything from science and nature study to finances to daily life skills to history to vocabulary and on and on.... She also uses bible verses and helps you dig into the character traits and the choices of a whole variety of people you meet in these stories. I appreciate the authors purpose in this, and I certainly followed her lead to talk about these issues, but my greatest disappointment with this book is that I felt the author was not intellectually honest in her use of bible verses. While many of them worked well with her chosen material or point, 1.) sometimes she had to choose a verse in a specific translation in order to make her point. You could read the same verse in five other translations and could see plainly that it was not really trying to say what she *wanted* it to say. 2.) Often she wanted to make a point and would choose the \\"salad bar\\" approach to bible verses, finding one she liked that she thought said what she wanted it to say. To be intellectually honest in bible study, one must read the whole passage and take it in context to see what the author means. It's like a journalist taking a partial quote from a politician and putting a spin on it to make the person look foolish, or as if he or she supports something s/he doesn't. Anyway, I hate to rat on the author for this, as, overall, I really, really *love* this unit study! We have made some great homeschooling memories these last two years - I'd even say that out of the twelve years I have homeschooled, these last two were, hands down, the best! But be aware that you can't necessarily check your brains at the door just because she's done so much of the work for you in putting this study together. I would not ever hesitate to recommend this to anyone at all, as long as I mentioned that they must use some care with her bible study."},{"Title":"The Prairie Primer: Literature Based Unit Studies Utilizing the \\"Little House\\" Series","review":"Great homeschool resource if you want a unit study.

This may be great for a Teacher, but not so much for anyone else."},{"Title":"The Day of Creation","review":"What I liked best about this novel was the images that Ballard was able to evoke. To be honest, I started reading it and lost interest. I picked it up some years later and was hooked. He truly can create amazing pictures in the mind unlike most writers. It is perplexing to me to see a book like The Firm getting such good reviews and being read by millions when this one is hardly even a footnote, when this book is superior in just about every way. It is not his best. I would say Crystal World, High-Rise and The Drowned World are his best, but this is a very original novel."},{"Title":"The Day of Creation","review":"Ballard's 1987 novel \\"The Day of Creation\\" is a sinuous odyssey through a surrealized Africa drunk on the potential of Western technology. Ballard's narrative voice is rich and engaging, the fluctuating exterior and interior landscape rendered with delirious conviction. \\"The Day of Creation\\" reads like a particularly brutal 20th century fable, deftly pointing the cool lens of technology on our secret fascination with the Dark Continent.\\"The Day of Creation\\" has been compared to Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness.\\" But Ballard's novel is at once deeper and more topical; by infusing his story with a compelling and unlikely romance, Ballard reveals a sensual versatility lesser writers would gladly kill for. Read as an adventure story or as erotic allegory, \\"The Day of Creation\\" is a pleasure."},{"Title":"The Day of Creation","review":"This is one of those books that clearly isn't meant to be taken entirely literally, the kind where all the events have some kind of metaphorical significance and the exterior landscape is an obvious externalization of an interior one. When done well, this can result in extraordinarily rich and rewarding fiction, the sort of story that does profound things to deep parts of your brain and can provide new insights and emotional resonances every time you return to it. Sadly, when it's done, er, less well, what you end up with is a story that fails to work on two levels instead of just one. And while it does have a few points of interest -- enough that I almost talked myself into giving it three stars instead of two -- this novel unfortunately is one of the latter kind. The metaphors and the imagery they're captured in never seem quite rich enough or subtle enough to be really engaging, either emotionally or intellectually, and the plot in and of itself is neither particularly interesting nor especially plausible. It's been quite a while since I've read any of Ballard's other work, but from what I remember he's not exactly untalented at this sort of thing. Even talented writers occasionally fall flat, however. I wanted to like and appreciate this story, I really did. But, in the end, I was counting down the pages until I was finished and could go and read something else instead. I suspect I only finished it because I'm stubborn. My advice: If you've never read anything by Ballard, start somewhere else. And if you like some of his stuff but don't feel a burning desire to read every word he's ever read, you might as well skip this one."},{"Title":"The Day of Creation","review":"A doctor, sick of the corporate shill he is becoming goes to work in Central Africa.

Indeed, this was obviously written for his newfound audience as one finds no traces of the sexual/violent extremes some of his earlier work embraces. What he does embrace is the character of one Dr. Mallory, and the river he inadvertenly &quot;invents.&quot; Mallory is a mercurial ride in narrator fashion, though you never get much further than his obsession with the river. This, in fact, is the problem with the entirety of the book. Everyone, including the river itself, is given a complex single-faceted personality (make sense?) and what this inevitably leaves the reader with is a spark of intrigue, but never a feeling of real involvement. That greatly hurts an adventure work, such as this one, where Ballard doesn't have his tremendous imagination to fall back on. Overall, a pretty good time, but definitely not one of his best"},{"Title":"The Day of Creation","review":"This is not so much a story as a fable, or fever-dream.'Dr. Mallory' arrives in a poverty-ridden African country to run a WHO clinic. Messing about, Mallory improbably exposes a natural spring in the arid landscape, which rapidly becomes a substantial river.Mallory names the river after himself and sets sail along it in a derelict ferry, the Salammbo, to discover its source, along with characters such as a former guerrilla, a 12-year-old girl he names Noon. Strangely some of the characters resemble real people I have met, myself, in parts of Africa.One of the most interesting characters is the half-blind Mr Pal, who entertains us with an occasional monologue of the passing scenery:\\" . . . wild magnolias and many small tamarinds, with comfortable footing for passerine birds . . . the river is some eight metres in depth, moving through an ample basin of washed granitic marl, well stocked with aquatic life. The warm waters offer friendly refuge to snakes and lizards . . . \\"\\"Mr. Pal . . . \\" I cut the throttle in protest. \\"For God's sake - you sound as if you're stocktaking on the last day of creation . . . \\"\\"Well put doctor, that describes it exactly . . . \\"Mallory finds that the 'benefits' of the river are becoming cancelled by its dangers, and decides he must destroy it, but he disintegrates into delirium as he tries to reach the source, harrassed by the guerillas, the local 'peace forces' - arguably more 'evil' than the guerillas - and nature itself.Ballard has long impressed me with his incredibly vivid ability in imagery, evident as long ago as his early work \\"The Drowned World\\" (now prophetically coming true as the ice caps melt); but in this book, The Day of Creation, Ballard revels in imagery at the cost of making the story realistic. There were too many spots where this reader simply felt 'thrown out' of the narrative, caused by a failure to suspend disbelief in this outrageous tale, due to the extreme improbability of certain of the events."},{"Title":"The Day of Creation","review":"RIDING HIS PREVIOUS COATAILS INTO OBLIVION ...ONCE HE WAS GOOD, AND THEN HE JUST GOT WORSE AND WORSE .PROiSE IS REALY DEAD.

In _Android at Arms_, the Mengians, heirs of the Psychocrats, have snatched about a dozen VIPs from their homeworlds over a period of years, always on the brink of momentous events - e.g. important trade negotiations, designations of heirs. Each victim was replaced by a ringer - an android duplicate. Now a gigantic electrical storm has disabled the security of the prison where they've been held (in some cases, for many years). None remember their capture or imprisonment, having been held in suspended animation and subjected to hypnocasters.Or have they?Which are the androids, and which are the originals? How can you tell, when the androids were crafted to be *perfect* duplicates?We follow Andas, heir presumptive to the throne of Inyanga, a world settled many centuries ago during one of the first &quot;outspreads&quot; from Earth. By chance, Inyanga is closer to the prison planet than any other captive's homeworld, so the escapees head for sanctuary - only to find that even more time has passed than they thought, and that captivity hasn't united them.Andas, having formed a friendship with Yolyos, a Salariki fellow prisoner, takes Yolyos into the secret ways of Inyanga's Triple Towers, the sprawling palace complex from which the Emperor rules a world - a city within a city. They venture even into the Flower Courts of the women - where death 'stalks more ruthlessly than the Emperor's dungeons.'Inyanga's culture is drawn from African elements, rather than the more usual European-based fantasy. Exploring the culture and the political problems faced by Andas will keep you entertained as the prisoners try to cope with the Mengians' riddle - what is the nature of a man?If you can't tell which is the android and which is the man - does the difference really matter?"},{"Title":"ANDROID AT ARMS","review":"Android At Arms is a singleton novel set in the Psychocrat universe, a subset of the primary future history. Lightning strikes a building on an otherwise uninhabited world and the residents are stunned senseless. Awaking, they find themselves in unfamiliar surroundings and company. All the power is off and the robots found within the building are standing immobile.In discussing their situation, they conclude that they have been under the influence of an inhibitor, which muddles the mind. As they exchange information, the last date remembered by each of the residents differs over a range of decades. Moreover, each was involved in some time-sensitive activity. Then one of them tells of a rumor he has heard of a service that, for a suitable fee, offers to replace selected persons with programmed androids. Since each of the residents remembers being a person of consequence, they wonder if they are the originals or the androids.In this novel, Imperial Prince Andas of Inyanga awakes in a gray box with very simple furniture and dressed in a coarse one-piece coverall. He assumes that the building must be a prison, but the door is standing half-open. He finds other residents, including the aliens Demizonda Elys of Posedonia and Lord Yolyos of Sargol as well as Arch Chief Tsiwon of Naul, Veep Turpyn of the Guild, and Chief Councilor Grasty of Thrisk. Together, these six crowd into an automated supply ship and divert it to Inyanga. However, the Guild Veep has a trick up his sleeve.In this story, Andas eventually returns to Inyanga, but finds that many years have passed since his own time. Another Andas sits on the throne as Emperor and his men hunt Andas and Yolyos. Though they escape the hunters, another power haunts Andas' dreams and draws him through a opening between timelines into a strange Inyanga where his counterpart is also hunted, but by the followers of the Old Woman.This novel is obviously related to other books by the author, including the Psychocrat connection with Ice Crown. The similarities with the Solar Queen series include the Salariki of Plague Ship as well as the cultural parallels with the African settlers of Voodoo Planet. The mentions of Zacathans, the Guild and Jacks tie in with most other works in the future history.This story is typical of the author's quest plotlines, with a strong destiny component. The author foreshadows most of the twists, but some seem a bit contrived. Overall, however, this novel is a good, if not great, adventure story with an interesting puzzle at its heart.Highly recommended for Norton fans and for anyone else who enjoys mystery quest tales with a young determined protagonist.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"ANDROID AT ARMS","review":"This book is one of the late, great Andre Norton's mixed barbeques: it starts out as straight science fiction then gradually descends into magic. The likeable Prince Andas wakes up in a tower on an alien planet after a ferocious storm has knocked out the power to his prison. Other prisoners gather, all of them important people on their own worlds, including a woman with green hair, gills and pearly scales, a cynical Salariki (Norton's favorite cat-like aliens first appear in \\"Plague Ship\\"), and a man who seems to know more about the installation than any of his fellow captives.The robots that had been guarding and caring for the prisoners have all been disabled by the storm, and as the six captives learn about each other, they begin to realize that some of them have been held in 'stass' for decades. The worlds that they were kidnapped from may no longer care about their existence.Nevertheless, Prince Andas wants to go back to his world to see who is ruling in his place, and regain power if he can. After many adventures, he returns to Inyanga and skulks through the hidden ways of his palace, with his companion the Salariki, Lord Yolyos, trying to find the android who replaced him on his throne.Andas does indeed confront his double, a much older version of himself who has sired children, and begins to wonder who is the android and who is the real prince? How does an android age? How does it beget offspring?Now comes a touch of magic and also confusion. Andas, after all of his adventures in what is his 'here and now' is lured into a parallel universe where the local version of Prince Andas is dying. A nasty blend of magic and technology has driven the dying prince into exile, and he wants his counterpart to take his place, and straighten things out.So the kidnapped prince is in a sense kidnapped once more, and sets out in the true Andre Norton underdog style to win back his (alternate universe) throne.\\"Android at Arms\\" (1971) is a bit haphazard plotwise, but it is still full of interesting and likeable characters who forge their own destinies against all odds."},{"Title":"ANDROID AT ARMS","review":"Androids at Arms\\"It was a sere wasteland, riven by stark gashes, as if some intolerant and sadistic god had lashed it with a flail of lightning.

Hiding from pursuit in a remote supposedly haunted corner of the great palace, he was summoned to a strange fire by the sound of an ancient harp and drawn into a strange world that mirrored his own--but a world so beleaguered by enemies from within and without that it seemed it must perish.Yet, somehow, he had to save it. and with it the whole of Inyangan civilization.Highly recommended for fans of the Grand Dame of Story telling, Andre Norton.Gunner April, 2008"},{"Title":"ANDROID AT ARMS","review":"Story about some important people of different races kidnapped and possibly replaced by androids for some unknown purpose.

I most enjoyed the descriptions of the island inhabitants, their ecosystem, and their culture."},{"Title":"The Sherlock Holmes Theatre [UNABRIDGED]","review":"I listened to this audiobook on a recent hiking trip and found it very entertaining. A talented cast presents the only Holmes plays written by his creator, Sir Authur Conan Doyle.In Sherlock Holmes, our hero fends off various nefarious plans launched by his nemasis, Professor Moriarity, the head of the London crime syndicate. Holmes even develops a love interest.In the second play, The Speckled Band, Holmes solves an old murder and prevents a second one. The Anglo-Indian doctor has unusual habits, a mean disposition, surly servants and dog, and a propensity for seeing unhappy outcomes to the women left in his charge. Fortunately, Watson knew the family in India, and brings Holmes into the picture at the right time.Then we have the little extra treat. Ghastly Double Murder in Famed Detectives's Flat is a more recent comedic play involving the Doyle characters, written by Yuri Rasovsky. This shows us what happens when the spotlight is turned off, as many new twists encircle Holmes, Watson, Mrs. Watson, and the long-suffering housekeeper. In this short story, Holmes elects an early retirement, as the current cases and criminals no longer hold his attention. Watson foresees his own demise, as he is broke, in debt to nefarious characters, and has already sold book rights that Holmes will never grant. The landlady realizes no one other than Holmes will pay the rent that has enabled her lifestyle all these years. She and Watson team up to stop Holmes' retirement with a surprising outcome."},{"Title":"The Sherlock Holmes Theatre [UNABRIDGED]","review":"These are well done audio dramatizations with full orchestra and a fine cast. The third play takes up one CD and is not by Doyle and furthermore, is a comedy. I found it funny, but it may not be to the taste of a Doyle/Sherlock Holmes purist. Given that the focus of this set was to present performances of Sherlock Holmes plays that Doyle wrote or was involved in (the first play, \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" was originally written by Doyle but then re-written by William Gillette), I was surprised that Doyle's one-act play \\"The Crown Diamond\\" wasn't presented too (it would have fitted on one-disc). That said, \\"Crown Diamond\\" has never been highly regarded by most fans. All in all, a terrific set that is well worth having."},{"Title":"The Sherlock Holmes Theatre [UNABRIDGED]","review":"In this remake of a well-known classic, Professor Moriarity plots with potential blackmailers to have Holmes killed, resulting in suspense and intrigue, including Holmes falling in love, with a mystery woman. The audio offers a new and realistic take on the London detective story."},{"Title":"The Sherlock Holmes Theatre [UNABRIDGED]","review":"If you love Sherlock Holmes, and know Sherlock Holmes, this production will greatly disappoint you. Personally, I am fond of the Jim French versions. They are more in tune with the real character, and much more entertaining."},{"Title":"The Sherlock Holmes Theatre [UNABRIDGED]","review":"How did this win a Best production Award? In todays world of hi tech audio, this was sadly lacking in production. The actors sound like they are sitting on stools reading into a microphone. There is no feeling of action or excitement. It is a dull reading with music that sounds as if it was taken from a record, and not designed for this production. When compared with the Sherlock Holmes I hear on XM - this production falls flat, and was a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Sherlock Holmes Theatre [UNABRIDGED]","review":"I was already very well acquainted with Gillette's play Sherlock Holmes and Doyles adaptation of his own Speckled Band. The plays were faithful, meaning they kept a hold of some of the more serious flaws of the source material (i.e. the inquest in Speckled Band) but the good stuff as well. The performances were universally good and the production was top notch. The final installment, Double Murder....was one I wasn't familiar with and was absolutely side-splitting. The author obviously has a great love for the stories, but is also willing to pick them apart mercilessly. The package was a bit pricey, but I felt it was worth it."},{"Title":"The Sherlock Holmes Theatre [UNABRIDGED]","review":"The Sherlock Holmes Theatre is a perfect audio experience. A full production of actors takes on and interprets the only two plays Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote about Sherlock Holmes, The Napoleon of Crime and The Speckled Band. Also included as a bonus is a new one-act comedy play, Ghastly Double Murder in Famed Detective's Flat.The Napoleon of Crime and The Speckled Band are typical entertaining Sherlock Holmes mysteries. In The Napoleon of Crime, Holmes and Watson find themselves immersed in an international conspiracy against Holmes arch-rival Professor Moriarty. A young woman has letters that could implicate the British heir in a major scandal right before his marriage. In order to take these letters from her and earn a tidy profit, a couple kidnaps her and holds her captive. Sherlock Holmes is soon on the scene to help her out and uncovers the mystery while also discovering admiration for the lady. Complicating matters, Professor Moriarty arrives in the picture and is bent on the final destruction of Holmes.In The Speckled Band, Watson steps in to help a family that he knew back in his days serving in India. Two daughters returned with their mother and step-father to England. After their mother's death, the eldest daughter dies under mysterious circumstances after uttering a mysterious phrase about a \\"speckled band.\\" Two years later, the younger daughter has just gotten engaged and is starting to hear the same strange music that her sister had heard and her stepfather has moved her to the same bedroom. Fearing for her life, she asks for assistance from family friend Dr. Watson and his good friend Sherlock Holmes. Will Holmes be able to solve the mystery and save a life?The play version of The Speckled Band was based on an earlier short story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Facing financial difficulties, Doyle adapted his favorite Holmes story into a play changing names and some situations. The play was a smashing success in both London and in America solving the financial problems. It sounds like the villain (the step-father Dr. Grimesby Rylott played by Lyn Harding) was quite the character and something to behold. I would have loved to have seen the production.The new one-act comedy play by Yuri Rasovsky, Ghastly Double Murder in Famed Detective's Flat, made me laugh out loud several times. Obviously not a Conan Doyle original, in this parody, Holmes and Watson tell each other what they really think of each other. I really enjoyed the humor in this piece.I enjoyed listening to all of these Holmes stories. I really love listening to audiobooks with a full cast of voice actors for all of the parts. It really enhances the experience for me. I thought this audiobook was brilliant.Overall, if you are looking for a great mystery and a comedy, The Sherlock Holmes Theatre is an excellent audiobook.This review was originally published on my blog, Laura's Reviews"},{"Title":"The Sherlock Holmes Theatre [UNABRIDGED]","review":"The theatrical productions of the stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are entertaining, but I suggest that you don't waste any time on the piece by Yuri Rasovsky. The logic is flawed, the dialogue is trite, and the humor is flat. It would be a terrible play even if the characters were new, but it's even worse as a Sherlock Holmes story since the actions are entirely out-of-character both for Holmes and for Dr. Watson.I'd give 4 stars to this item if it only contained the first four discs. Disc Five eroded my enthusiasm to the point that now I can only muster a 2-star rating overall."},{"Title":"A history of classical scholarship","review":"Sandys methodically outlines the history of the discipline in three closely printed volumes. In spite of being dated the book is great for tracing influences on twentieth century scholarship. It is also a very interesting read, in the way that \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" is interesting: meeting all those busy academic beavers building their scholarly dams and going to war over lemmas and stemmas really gets the blood boiling."},{"Title":"Holy Smoke","review":"Dario Trengoni and his childhood pal Antonio Polsinelli meet for the first time in years and discuss what each is doing and what is happening with some of their mutual friends from growing up Italian in South Paris. Dario insists \\"Anto\\" speaks the real language, Italian better than he so he asks a favor. Anto reluctantly agrees to writes a love letter for Dario to Madame Raphaelle ironically in French.Not long after their encounter, someone shoots Dario in the head. Tonio as he known now is stunned to learn he inherited an Italian vineyard near Naples from Dario. He also finds out that his friend was a Taxi-boy earning his money as a gigolo. Tonio tries to locate Madame Raphaelle, but that proves a bit dangerous. So instead he travels to his new property only to find the wine stinks, the vines are worse, the locals already hate him, and a religious scam is in place. With the inheritance comes the Mafia and the Vatican, two of the toughest mobs in Europe, who expect Tonio to give each of them a 100 percent tithe.HOLY SMOKE! This tale is a terrific twisted look at crime from the perspective of a small timer who is being squeezed by organized groups who want the whole action. Tonio is fabulous as a minnow suddenly swimming with sharks. Fans will appreciate his distinction between the two outside \\"mobs\\". The story line satirizes criminal behavior (a crime is defined by the state) to include organized religion as a subcategory of crime. Tonino Benacquista provides a delightfully droll dark thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Holy Smoke","review":"Holy Smoke is a terrific little (200-page) mystery that works on several levels. On its surface, the book is about the amusing adventures of a man who inherits a vineyard - and a world of problems. On another level, it is about someone in search of a home - a Frenchman of Italian descent who cannot escape his roots. It is a tribute to author Tonino Benacquista that the book succeeds on both levels.The novel opens with our hero, the Italian Frenchman Tonio Polsinelli, running into Dario, a friend from the neighborhood that Tonio left many years earlier. In fact, the reader learns that Tonio has spent his life trying to escape the old neighborhood and its Italian-immigrant residents. Tonio wants to be a \\"real\\" Frenchman and sums up his feelings on the old neighborhood in the following passage:\\"God, you suburbs are depressing. You've got nothing going for you. There you are with your eyes turned towards Paris and your arse towards the countryside. You can only ever be a compromise. You're boredom incarnate\\" (page 53).Tonio agrees to write a love letter to Dario's French girlfriend (because Dario's French is too poor for him to do it himself). When Dario is murdered, Tonio inherits the Italian vineyard that Dario has recently purchased. Fate, then, draws Tonio into Dario's world and back to Italy.Of course, Italy is the last place he wants to go. Even worse, the village in which he finds himself is his family's ancestral home. Once there, all sorts of misadventures ensue; Tonio eventually runs afoul of the mafia, the Vatican, and the townspeople. (Ironically, the townspeople now consider him to be French, which perhaps sums up the immigrant's dilemma of being stuck between cultures).Benacquista paces the story well, it never bogs down. He also interjects little bits of sardonic humor that sneak up on the reader. (Of one Italian-American gangster, Benacquista writes \\"He was amazed that you could get good pizza in Italy too, only not so good as at home). A subplot develops the \\"searching for roots\\" theme by tying Tonio's current search to his father's past in World War II Italy. Though the subplot meshes with the book's theme, it made things fit a little too neatly for my taste.I am ambivalent about Holy Smoke's final chapter. Benacquista could have omitted it with no loss, but he decided to end with a literary flourish. Perhaps it's a brilliant stroke, or perhaps it's another case of a writer not knowing when to quit - I'm still not sure.As a rule, I am skeptical of any mystery that aspires to be \\"more than a mystery.\\" Most authors of such books seem to view mystery writing as \\"slumming\\" and - as a result - their books fail on both levels. Holy Smoke is a happy exception to that rule."},{"Title":"Holy Smoke","review":"I found this book to be somehow lacking, despite the fact that it has apparently won one or more awards.It sort of meandered along with the main character stumbling into plot connections, which perhaps reflects the Gallic and Italian flair referred to in a review clip from The Guardian.''An iconoclastic chronicle of small-time crooks and desperate capers, with added Gallic and Italian flair. Wonderful fun.'' The GuardianHowever, this stumbling just didn't have a realistic feel to it and perhaps that is why the novel leaves me with a \\"meh\\" feeling."},{"Title":"Holy Smoke","review":"The funniest of all the Bitter Lemon output, a Meyer lemon of crime fiction. Murder-mystery, comedy, and satire all in one, with the satire directed equally at the deserving Vatican and Mafia. Unless you are a devout RC, a cardinal, or a capo, you have to relish the lively pokes at these more or less indistinguishable organizations, as well as the thrill of the chase."},{"Title":"Holy Smoke","review":"This was a good read. Surprisingly one of the most believable books that I have read in a long time. I recommend it for anyone who likes books that are intelligent yet still an easy read."},{"Title":"Life Sentence","review":"I started reading this book because of my involvement with presenting Success Skills Seminars to inmates and staff in prisons. I never expected this book to be so compelling. Although I knew that Chuck Colson made a great impact with Prison Fellowship, still I didn't know much about Chuck or his work. Even though this book was originally published about 20 years ago, it is timeless. Some day soon, I hope to meet Charles Colson in person. This is must reading for everyone who enters a prison, whether they be family, friend, staff, volunteer, inmate, or simply someone who cares."},{"Title":"Life Sentence","review":"If you haven't read Chuck Colson's first book, \\"Born Again\\", you should read that one before \\"Life Sentence\\". This book continues the story begun in Born Again with the events surrounding the beginning of the Prison Fellowship Ministries. The sad truth is that prisons don't rehabilitate those who break the law. More often than not they produce criminals who are more hardened and more of a menace to society upon their release from prison than when they entered. Prisons are often overcrowded, dehumanizing and dangerous. I think it's safe to say that Prison Fellowship and its sister organizations have done more to reform prisons and the criminal justice system than any other single organization. They have demonstrated a powerful combination of the Evangelical and Social Justice traditions of Christianity to redeem lost souls and wasted lives.This book is very honest and humble as well as inspiring. Chuck Colson is honest about his own failings and those he sees among Evangelical Christians (with whom he identifies). He was often treated very badly by the news media and others, but his love for prisoners and commitment to Jesus Christ allow him to take such incidents as lessons from a loving God to help him grow in character and in spirit. Chuck Colson's example of love, devotion and integrity should be considered carefully by everyone. Even after 25 years this book is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Life Sentence","review":"As was Colsons goal, this book was encouraging and challenging.

Great book!"},{"Title":"Life Sentence","review":"\\"Life Sentence\\" opened my eyes to the genuine tragedy of our current prison system and what the needs are in these depositories of humanity. Approximately 33% of Americans will be involved with this system at one point in their lives. That's one out of three USA citizens, folks! I learned how our archaic system is causing more problems within America and not rehabilitating anyone. Often a prisoner is more dangerous when he comes out of his cage than when he went in. This is not what American needs. Yet, these \\"throw away\\" people are in America's despotic prison system by the millions. They \\"disappear\\" to the 66% of us who are able to be free. Mr. Colson points out aspects of the \\"justice\\" system of the United States...whereby a judge is able to sentence someone seven years to prison for stealing $20 worth of goods because the judge had a \\"bad day,\\" while a rapist may serve only three years. Often those who are serving time are the poor who cannot afford an expensive lawyer who knows which judge to choose for a trial so his client can \\"get-off.\\" Yet, in spite of these facts are, Mr. Colson points out how willing most wardens are willing to accept the help of genuine Christians who would like to bring the hope of Christ to the precious human souls they are in charge of, most of whom are non-violent offenders. While being an engaging writer, Mr. Colson honestly, humbly and forthrightly describes his own struggles in following Christ into the prisons. I could barely put this book down. I highly recommend it. You will be uplifted, amazed, and astonished at God's work through Mr. Colson and his Prison Fellowship Ministry."},{"Title":"Life Sentence","review":"Bought for a friend in prison.

Marcus and Stern have created a book that works for the seasoned sysadmin as well as the HA newbie. Frank depictions of case studies provide helpful insight into the many pitfalls of creating HA solutions. The &quot;key points&quot; sections at the end of each chapter provide quick and easy checkpoints should a reference refresher be required.Another excellent trait of this book is its readability and realistic approach to the HA &quot;art&quot;. The mixture of pure philosophy tempered with daily reality provided me at least, with more certainty in finding the best overall balance of reliability, availability, and manageability vs. things like cost of ownership, etc.There is an excellent level of technical proficiency treated in the text as well. The hardcore bits and bytes folk won't be dissappointed by Mr. Stern's treatment various scenarios. The attention Mr. Marcus pays to higher level structural detail also makes you say occasionally, &quot;gee i would have never thought of that.&quot;. (And even if you had, i doubt you would have been able to elaborate on it as humorously.) :)It's one of the few books i refer back to occasionally, (not so surprisingly, this goes for Mr. Stern's Managing NIS/NFS book as well). Overall, it's just an extremely invaluable book that's actually a good read as well. (love the &quot;Tales from the field&quot; blurbs). I don't believe there's any stone regarding HA left unturned by this book. Replication, DR, backup and restores...it's all there.I look forward to their next collaborative effort."},{"Title":"Blueprints for High Availability","review":"High availability is almost like the Holy Grail - believers know it exists, but getting it can be a quest. Not that it's an elusive, impossible-to-achieve objective - it's just expensive and the path to high availability is filled with challenges, blind alleys and the risk of spending money on the wrong things.This book covers every conceivable aspect of high availability, from application recovery to the [Zen] of service level agreements. The emphasis is on the underlying technologies, with a good deal of attention paid to processes and business considerations as well.There are two things that stand out about this book: it is comprehensive and the authors are in-the-trenches technical types who can actually write.It is obvious that the authors have stuggled with and mastered every technology and technique about which they have written. This is a refreshing change from the plethora of technical books written by professional writers who are assigned book projects because they have writing ability, but not necessarily any real technical background. So, in a world that is littered with books with no substance, this gem is definitely worth buying.I am not going to rehash the table of contents, which is readily available on this page - I will say that the authors gave each of the topics excellent treatment on a number of levels. First, they have deleved into the mechanics of each topic, they have shown the strengths and weaknesses of each, and in many cases, have provided anecdotes and real-life stories about their experiences with designing and implementing similar solutions. The anecdotal content follows a pattern: it points out problems and how the authors resolved those problems when they encountered them. These alone make the book invaluable, and increase the credibility of the authors.Who should read this book? Systems engineers and managers.Systems engineers will benefit from the wealth of technical information provided in the book, and will also benefit from the excellent explanations of underlying mechanics of how the various technologies and solution sets work. I am sure that most systems engineers will find the book's many anecdotes to be entertaining reading that imparts valuable information.Managers should read this book because it puts into perspective how various pieces of a high availability solution set fits together. It also provides a dose of reality that might just stop some &quot;suit&quot; from decreeing a technical direction without fully understanding the full set of issues and factors. This book will provide the issues and factors to managers in a readable manner."},{"Title":"Blueprints for High Availability","review":"Finally a book that specifically discusses the very important topic of availability. The book discusses how to address each layer of an infrastructure from the data layer, network, application, etc. with an emphasis on availability requirements. I found it to be an excellent synthesis of all of the components of end-to-end availability. Anyone involved in Web Architecture and design will certainly find value in this book. My only criticism is that there are a few plugs specifically for Veritas but as a fan of their products it didn't bother me."},{"Title":"Blueprints for High Availability","review":"Anyone who has ever worked with me in the past knows I'm somewhat of an availability freak. It is the mark of a network administrator's excellence if they can say they maintain a 99.75% availability rating. High Availability as a design concept has kind of been brushed off to the side in recent years. This book was written is 2000 and at that time I think I bought about three books on the subject. Nothing new has been written about it. During the year 2000 there was a lot of discussion about availability in the private sector since a company like Amazon.com or any other on-line retailer lost big bucks if they were down for just minutes. Availability rating was the most important benchmark of a company's network. This book is my favorite on the subject because it is easy to understand. Cisco published a book on availability and you had to be a CCIE to understand the Introduction. This book is easy to read and marked with good illustrations to emphasize things like RAID, SANs, redundant routing, etc. Hardware companies have built servers, hard drives, controllers, etc. with high availability in mind so for the network administrator it is no longer critical for them to understand or be able to explain availability. However, high availability as a design concept is still the standard and once you understand how it all works and what the difference between 99% versus 99.75% availability you can take steps to maintain that high availability of your network systems."},{"Title":"Blueprints for High Availability","review":"I must first confess to being a colleague of sorts of Evan's--I work in the same company (VERITAS Software), but in a different part. I'll also confess to having bought the book (yes, I bought it) more out of curiosity than out of an immediate need for the information it contains.Having said that, I will go on to say that I am pleased with my purchase. This book is great, not because of the detail it contains in any one area, but because it tells you what all the areas are that you need to be concerned with if you're implementing a highly available system. Lots of books answer questions on how to implement this or that aspect of high availability; what's much less common is a book like this that you can use as a check list to see if you have all the bases covered. It doesn't go into great detail on any single topic, but it gives you enough meat to make informed decisions in the less technical areas (like staff, training, etc.) and to send you searching for more detail in the more technical areas (like backup, RAID, and clustering).I'll pay Evan and Hal another compliment. I own many more technical books than I have read. I didn't really expect to read this book, just because I don't read most of the books I buy all the way through. What I found, however, is that this book sort of creeps up on you. You read a little, and a little more. You put it down, only to pick it up later. The information is very well organized and chapters are self-contained. You can pretty much open it anywhere and have an informative read for 15 minutes, for an hour, or whatever time you have to give it.It's obvious that both authors bring lots of hands on experience to this book. The &quot;Tales from the Field&quot; anecdotal sidebars are worth the price of the book by themselves. I wish I could bring these guys to bear when I have HA problems. If I can't, I'll at least have their book at my side."},{"Title":"Blueprints for High Availability","review":"Hal and Evan have produced an excellent overview of the field of reliable computer systems which is useful to system administrators, system architects and to non-technical people who need a general understanding of the field.As a system architect with a programming background facing the task of designing a simple highly reliable system this provided an excellent perspective on the different issues and technologies. It left me well prepared to then delve into the product literature of specific products that addressed the issues relevant to the project.I believe this would also be an excellent book for IT managers who are looking at commissioning a &quot;high availability&quot; system, whether from an external software integrator or an internal company IT department. In particular, it describes what is easily achievable, what is achievable only at great expense, and what is simply not doable. It also emphasises the roles and responsibilities of people involved in ongoing support of HA systems; this book clearly describes how creating such a system is not the end but the start of providing reliable services.The reading will be challenging for those of non-technical background, but the book keeps its focus on why you would use each technology rather than simply how each is applied, which makes it relevant to a wide range of readers. It should also ensure that this book remains useful even as technologies change.What this book does not do is provide a formula for setting up a system. It's a great first step, though.In addition the writing is clear, structure and flow are good and mistakes are few. Not the lightest of reads, but then again this is a serious topic about systems worth serious money. And at 550-odd pages of dense reading material, this book is well worth investing in."},{"Title":"Blueprints for High Availability","review":"This is a superb book. Anyone who doesn't concern himself with availability ;-) shouldn't buy it, but the rest of us need the kind of clear-headed, on target, practical guidance that this book offers. Evan and Hal have done a wonderful job of presenting the issues and options for HA. This book isn't a &quot;must have&quot;, it's a &quot;must read&quot;!"},{"Title":"Blueprints for High Availability","review":"An excellent overview of high availability techniques. Starts with &quot;why and how much HA do you need&quot;, and goes all the way through the hardware and design side of HA.Doesn't describe any product in details, the authors explicitly refrain from doing so. Instead, the book makes you think the right way by pointing at the actual problems and offering actual decisions. Upon reading this book you can easily answer the question &quot;what can we do to make it work&quot;, not &quot;what brand of server should we buy&quot;.Covers HA theory, redundant hardware, redundant systems design, failover techniques, replication, backups, procedures, disaster recovery.The only thing that I didn't like and still can remember (a year later that I've read it), is that in my opinion the authors should stay totally clear off the &quot;how to write a stable software&quot; side of HA. There is like 2 pages of that, and it doesn't sound like anything sane.Clear language. Solid visual design. Lots of (fun and) real-life samples. See the title of the review."},{"Title":"Blueprints for High Availability","review":"I'm a German reader, who has to deal with HA, writing and publishing about HA and to be aware of loosing all SCSI devices at once because of an electic accident.Everyone who hangs on HA will be glad that there is a new book available. Most of them are from the last decade. The book is clearly structured. You can put it away and open it later by reading the conclusions to get the lost thread again.And it\`s humorous: I'm shure the the small hearts may have been helpfull for John, George, Paul and Ringo to play together in 1-to-4 environment. Something that's unusual (in Europe) when you read books about dry hard stuff like HA.Everyone, who has to manage resilience system should have this book and the &quot;20 keys system design principles&quot; should be plugged on the door - the operational part of the book.But there is a drop of bitterness: the chart of &quot;Causes of Downtime&quot; (from 1995) and &quot;Costs of Downtime&quot; (1996) should be newer -- as time goes by. At least, I miss some word in the Index. There are new solutions working, which don't have to be based on Sun systems -- like Linux?But my message to Evan and Hal: go on, we'll need those experiences as printed in the book &quot;tales from the field&quot;."},{"Title":"Blueprints for High Availability","review":"I knew very little about High Availability (HA) before I read this book. Now I feel I can hold my own with the propeller-heads in the data center.The book gives a thorough treatment of the subject. The explanations were good; the graphics add value but are a little basic; also there is some favorable bias towards Veritas who originally published the book. (Veritas has some high availability software and services you can buy.) But overall a definite keeper. I recommend it if you're interested in High Availability design and concepts."},{"Title":"Blueprints for High Availability","review":"as I was reading this otherwise excellent book, I noticed that there was a very important theme (to my understanding), which wasn't honored enough attention; namely, issues relating to the \`Secure Socket Layer' protocol and availability, which directly translates to money coming your or someone else's way.How does it affect the HA and your web applications architecture? SSL Certificates in a HA setting? . . . etc. All diagrams would present the web farm directly facing the internet!?I even stopped reading and went to the index looking for it and found that there were indeed two -very basic- blurbs on it on pages 301 and 352.I know security is a theme by itself, but the relationship between security issues and HA is way too fundamental to simply skim over them. As a matter of fact I would say that number one issue affecting HA is security.Also the book has a very SA oriented (am I talking about another book already? ;-)) style. I would like to read a little more about \`the Physics' of it. For example, cosmic rays' (I am not joking), like neutrinos, influence on the proper/stable functioning of computers is greater than the, comparatively speaking, very anomalous \`split brain' types of errors and more on, electric accidents, the effective use of ECC memory. Should it go in the Web servers, too, in addition to the data centers? Why?Cabling and electromagnetic inductance issues are mentioned in the \`Tales from the Field', but I could see some people expecting a more rounding explanation/solution to the \`tales'. In the case in which they talk about a java web server people might have the impression that \`Java' or its use in a web server was wrong, whichI could tell was most probably not the case, but the use of JSP without specifying the sessions shouldn't be automatically created, which is the default many developers forget."},{"Title":"Blueprints for High Availability","review":"It isn't often that a single book can deliver solutions to so many issues that plague enterprise executives and system administrators alike, but this book delivers the goods.Most technology related documents focus on the low-level gorp that makes up complex solutions, but this book provides information at all levels.

At least the book is outlined and is very objective and thought provoking. A Must Read for anyone contemplating Disaster Recovery/SAN/High Availability."},{"Title":"Blueprints for High Availability","review":".. you need this book (2nd edition). There are no products that provide availability for the entire enterprise.Most HA products are point products and even those that claim to be general purpose are selectively deployed because they are either too costly and/or difficult to deploy. And none of the general purpose HA products scale to handle current trends with racks of blade servers and SANs.Basically, if you are serious about HA you need to glue many technologies together and this book covers it all. In many cases it won't show you exactly how to do it since the book is vendor neutral. But more importantly, it provides the essential background information you'll need from selecting storage technologies to deploying disaster recovery plans -- and everything in between."},{"Title":"Blueprints for High Availability","review":"One of the most interesting things about this book is that it treats the subject of availability as more then just a technology issue. It goes into areas such aas basic good systems admin practices, Physical placement of equipment, building and facility services. Availabilty is more then just Raid disks, HA software and redundant hardware. They do a very good job explaining all aspects of HA, and giving interesting real world examples in thier short interludes.

Feehan uses pages of writing to try to convey what could be achieved more elegantly with just a few better-crafted sentences.She at least tries to build the heroine's love for the Carpathian gradually, instead of the instant commitment so common in this genre, but doesn't really succeed very well. In addition to fighting vampires, there is a human man competing for the girl's attentions -- but that storyline is never resolved, just left hanging.There's nothing unique or terribly interesting about this episode in the Dark Carpathian series. And there are other books in that series that are markedly better. But if you want to be thorough, go ahead and read it. It does add details to Gregori's storyline.

They are not rescued until after the vampire has taken her blood. When Aidan, the gorgeous Carpathian vampire hunter does come to save them he thinks that Alexandria has been turned into a vampiress and almost kills her before realizing that she is his lifemate.The fact that he is rich and gorgeous pales beside the facts that he drinks blood and sleeps in the ground and has made it so that she must do the same to survive. Alexandria must deal with the emotional conflicts in herself, the jealousy of having to rely on others to help care for her brother, and added to that the fact that she is a target for any vampire in the area.

So I totally understand that she wants to go out and bring her brother to school, just like always.

Once they did, I was relieved to sit back to enjoy the story. Some of these drag on and on a bit through the erotic scenes and I get impatient. However, I imagine some readers like this part best so I compromise move through these parts quickly.

The books are fantasy based but the emotions are everything we want in reality. It was wonderful, too, how the author made each book unique. Dark Prince oozes sensuality and is the perfect introduction to the Carpathians. Dark Desire is darker, more intense, and while we still get the setting and sense of the Carpathians and their world, we get a story totally different for the characters. The same is true of Dark Gold, which was lighter, more playful. They're all very sexy with to die for heroes who have larger-than-life abilities (which make them the ultimate alpha guys!) and intelligent heroines, but the characters have their own individual personalities, too. This is by far the most entertaining, original series of books I've found in a long, long time. I highly recommend them all."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"This is the third in a series of spectacular books about the Carpathians (who become vampires if they succumb to evil)--the first two being &quot;Dark Prince&quot; and &quot;Dark Desire&quot;. Like &quot;Dark Desire&quot;, this book can stand alone without you having to read the previous ones.In this book, Dark Gold, Alexandria who is human matches wits with one of the &quot;golden twins&quot; Aiden Savage. Aiden, unlike most of his species, has much more interaction with humans, trusting his secrets to his family (a family who has known his secrets down through the years, passing the tradition of protecting Aiden down through the generations). Aiden has his hands full with his lifemate, Alexandria, who is as independent as the wind and about as tamable. Like the other &quot;Dark&quot; books, the lifemates must learn the true art of compromise.I think this one was the 'lighter' of the four books in the series that have been released so far, if you can consider it &quot;light&quot;. I found this to be just as much a keeper as the previous ones and have reread it numerous times. I would highly recommend this book to all romance and paranormal readers."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"For any author, there is a challenge when writing a series of books. There always exists a threat that the books will become monotonous -- too much like one another.&quot;Dark Gold&quot; itself stands pretty well on its own. There's good chemistry between the hero and heroine, and the writing flows smoothly.Unfortunately, this particular installment is a pale imitation of the quality that came before. The beginning of the book is compelling, but after Alexandria and Aidan meet up, it's the same old struggle for Alexandria to deal with the change from human to Carpathian that Shea and Raven went through in much more compelling and realistic ways in &quot;Dark Prince&quot; and &quot;Dark Desire.&quot;In addition, the struggle for dominance/protection between Aidan and Alexandria is the same old struggle that came in the &quot;Dark&quot; books that precede this one. It becomes a bit monotonous after awhile.On the other hand, we see more of long-time human/Carpathian relationships in this one in the form of faithful retainers that serve Aidan and his home. I appreciated that glimpse of a relationship that seems to transcend the &quot;human as food and lesser being&quot; concept that can become common in vampire-related literature.All in all, this is a decent read. Feehan writes well, and her characters and relationships are interesting. Unfortunately, this is the weakest installment in the &quot;Dark&quot; series, so it somewhat pales in comparison to the others."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"Dark Gold is a good book, and stands fairly well on its own (it is the third in a series), but does not quite reach up to the standards of the earlier books. Aidan is a carbon copy of Mikhail and Jacques in the previous books. I suppose all \\"Carpathian\\" males exhibit the same qualities and that is what makes them who they are (protective, arrogant, self assured, devoted and strong willed) but reading the same story for the third time can be a bit awkward. They are all good stories, but how many times can one read about a dominant male and his independent life-mate/wife?I found Alexandria to be the most believable of the female leads. She resists the changes happening to her, not knowing how to handle everything. Her first encounter with a vampire is a traumatic one and she doesn't understand (or want to understand), the differences between a vampire and a Carpathian. Aidan tries his best to protect her, though I found that he did very little to explain her new powers (telepathic communication, shape shifting, etc...). Aidan lets her have her space to try and find her new self, (though he is never too far behind) and I found that to be a refreshing change.One of my biggest disappointments in the story is the lack of interaction with the previous characters. We see Gregory (and have throughout the books) and I have to assume that the next story will be his. But we do not see anyone else, not even Aidan's brother. Since the Carpathians are to some extent telepathically connected, I would have thought Mikhail would have at least shown himself to welcome the newest female to the clan. I would have also liked to have heard some news about Jacques and Shea (since at least 18 years have past since the last book). Well maybe I'm getting too nit-picky. I did enjoy the book, and suggest reading it, though I suggest picking up Dark Prince and Dark Desire first."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"Aidan Savage is a Hunter. Little did he know that the woman he thought to be a vampiress was actually his lifemate - thank goodness he didn't destroy her before it was too late! Who cared that she looked like a hag and hated him on sight (talk about having to gain someone's trust), Alexandria Houton was the woman for him! Once he was able to heal her that is.This book was a little different from the previous books and although Mikhail is mentioned, only Gregori makes an appearance. It takes place in San Francisco and has a more modern feel to it. Not to mention more family: Aidan has adopted a &quot;human&quot; family (Maria and Stefan), not to mention his brother Julian Savage (who has his own story in Dark Challenge) and Alexandria little brother Joshua.Although this story was very good I found it missing that &quot;extra, special something&quot; that Dark Prince and Dark Desire had. Maybe it was his appearance (Aidan and Julian are the &quot;golden twins&quot; where everyone else is dark) or maybe it was the lack of Carpathians involved, I'm not sure. The book was very good but in order to be a 5 star book, it has to be extra special!"},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"Unlike other reviewers here, that's the first one I've read of the dark series. So my review probably won't be enough since I haven't compared with the other two books. When Alexandria Houton and her little brother are taken captive after they witness the murderous rampage of a crazed vampire, she holds little hope of ever living to see the next day. Little does she know that the tale she spins to reassure and calm her brother of a golden haired savior coming to their rescue is about to come true, or is it? Has he come to save them or are his golden good looks hiding the heart of a monster? Alex soon learns that although this dangerous being has saved her life, the price he requires in return may be too high to pay. Aiden Savage has taken on the task of hunting down and destroying the creatures of his race who have given up hope and given in to the lure of the thrill of killing. Until he rescues Alexandria, he fears that he too is on the edge of turning. When he meets Alexandria he realizes that she is the only one who can save him, the only one who can bring color and emotion back into his cold, gray world. But Alexandria is not like any woman he has met before. How can he find a way to balance his inbred need to control and protect her with her desire for independence? He knows he can never give her up. With Dark Gold, the third one of her Carpathian series, Christine Feehan establishes herself as the mistress of Torture and Suspense. The torture of waiting for her next book to come out and the suspense of turning each page to find out if this book will be even better than the last! I am happy to say that Dark Gold gives us everything we have come to expect from her books and more. Making it a worthy addition to the series."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"I like Christine Feehan's writing - some of it. This is the first of the Dark series I have read and if the rest are like it, forget about it. I'm about ready to take Alexandria's head and give it a good shake. I mean really... this chick understands nothing. The entire book is her not listening, not understanding, not having a clue. AAARRRGGGGhhhh. Christine can do a lot better than this!"},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"Another \\"hero\\" that sneers and belittles everything the heroine says, thinks or does. All of her feelings and desires are fodder for him to laugh at and make fun of. He takes very little seriously because he makes all the rules, no matter what she wants, including interfering in the relationship between the heroine and her young brother, teaching the child to belittle his sister.Of course, the heroine eventually finds it all amusing and gives in to him. I lost respect for her after chapter one when she stopped being a person."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"I'll admit it. I REALLY didn't want Alex for Aidan. She annoyed me.What I did like was the human family that Aidan had created for himself before he met Alex and Joshua. It made the dynamic of Aidan dealing with Alex and all her human complexities and Joshua's trust and need to feel safe, more real and less 'domineering Carpathian male' being put out.Translation:MORE FUN!Aidan is Golden!"},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"Another enjoyable read from Christine Feehan. I liked her newest heroine, Alexandria, somewhat different from the others.I have devoured all of her books and look forward to any and all books written by Christine Feehan. While not my all time favorite it still was a very good read."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"In this book we follow the actions of Aiden, one of the Golden Twins and appointed hunter of vampires. Aiden is very close to turning into the very creatures he hunts when he rescues a woman and child from his lastest vampire victim. The woman is well on her way to becoming a vampire when he attacks her thinking that she is already one. The results of the attack makes her one of his people, a converted Carpathian. Aiden has to overcome her trauma of the vampire's assult, her horror at becoming a bloodsucker and the problems of convincing a modern woman that she is bound to him for life and that life is going to be very long in order to claim her as his lifemate.As with the other Dark books this one had a few errors. Throughout the books we hear how the blood of vampires burn Carpathians and it makes them sick or damaged yet Aiden assults this woman by sucking her blood when he thought she was a vampiress? Other similar gaps in introduced logic of the series follow. If you can ignore the occasional word in need of a spell check as well you will enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"This was a good story; I found it a bit more lighthearted and less intense than the previous 2 in the Dark series. The real reason I offer this review is to appease and to tantalize Christine Feehan fans. Appease because Gregori's story comes out in July and you can read Chapter 1 online and to tantalize because after reading this chapter, July will be further away than it already appears. The story promises to be G-O-O-D! ......................"},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"This book was just as good as the other two in the series, Dark Prince, and Dark Desire. The tension betweeen the two main characters is very good, and the book is fast paced. I read it in one sitting! This author is very prolific. One of the characters that has been in all three books, Gregory, is finally getting his own novel, and that will come out in July. It is called Dark Magic. I am eagerly waiting for the next in this series!"},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"I must say, even though i rated this book 5 stars, i missed the other characters(Mikhail, Raven, Jacques, and Shea). But this book was absolutley another best of Ms. Feehan. Aidan makes you want to kill him and kiss him at the same time. In the 3 books of Ms. Feehan's about the Carpathian race that i have read, i have always loved the female in trouble, the handsome male rescues her. And this takes the cake along with her first and second books.

THEY DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES BY NOT KILLING THEIR VICTIMS WHEN THEY DRINK. THEY ARE LOVEABLE CHARACTERS AND THE STORY WHICH I FEARED WOULD BE DUMB WAS WRITTEN WELL AND DID NOT GO OFF TOO DEEP INTO WEIRDNESS. IT WAS THE FIRST ONE OF THE SERIES I READ AND I ORDERED 4 OTHERS THE NEXT DAY. THE SERIES SHOULD BE READ IN ORDER BUT THIS ONE IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE.

I really enjoyed the first books in this series. Unfortunately, I can't the same about this one.I found Alexandria to be a boring heroine--immature and selfish. What would happen if a human woman enjoyed being \\"turned\\"? (TAKE ME!!) Adain had more patience than I would have. (Actually, so far ALL of the Carpathian men have been VERY patient with their \\"lifemates. Makes me wonder if it is really worth finding her--most of them are royal pains.I am still going to read the rest of the series and hope that Ms. Feehan was having an \\"off day\\" with this one.Don't let the negative reviews keep you from discovering this series--basically--it is very good."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"I won't bore you to tears with the summary of this story, there are plenty of them written by other reviewers. However, I have to agree with Tanya Veverka's review, she hit it right on the dot. The book is becoming too much like the others before it with the exception of Dark Prince, considering it was the first installment. The character that got on my nerves was Alexandria; I guess I'm getting alittle bored with the 'I'm so innocent-totally unworldly, I'm so young, I'm so beautiful, I'm so frightened of the big, bad vampire,' routine. What would happen if the so-called destined female lifemate wasn't so innocent and pure? Actually liked becoming a Carpathian? Hmmm... Anyway, it was so annoying to keep hearing Alexandria say that Aidan was a 'vampire' and with him constantly correcting her. Every waking moment she denied the fact that she transformed into Carpathian, even though she knew she had incrediable hearing, needed blood to survive, couldn't go out into the full sun, slept during the day in the soil, etc. I was beginning to grate my teeth, Aidan definitely had more patience with her, than I did. I could've pitched her out the window and said later. Also, Dark Gold plot is weak and the \\"Dark Series\\" fight scenes (except for Gold's gang fight scene) lacks the detail I'm used to reading. All in all, Dark Gold is a good read, but hopefully I won't be disappointed with Dark Magic - however, the preview summary already sounds annoyingly the same with the herione characters."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"Dark Gold is different yet from those it follows. We are no longer in the Carpathian Mountains with Mikhail and Raven but rather we are on the west coast of America. Aidan is the hunter of the region and he is very good at what he does. While hunting a vampire that has been leaving a messy trail all over the place, he finds a woman and a boy. After mistaking her for a vampiress, he is in the process of putting her out of her misery when he realizes that she is in fact his lifemate.This book contains everything that the others do in the respect of sensuality, intelligent characters and outstanding abilities. But this book is a bit different where you arent completely lost without having read the ones before it. Aidan has been on his own for years with little to no contact with other Carpathians. Alexandria is an artist who draws vampires but doesnt truely believe in them. But after she is converted into a Carpathian, she has a hard time understanding it all as being real.Another great book by Ms. Feehan.

The heros are Carpathian. They must drink blood to survive but they don't kill their prey like true vampires do. They can transform into anything and have telepathic abilities. They also have a big problem, their race is dying out. There are very few women and when they have children most don't live past a year and most are born male. They have recently discovered that a few human women can becaome thier lifemates. These women are telepathic and can survive the conversion without going insane. Our heroine in this book is such a woman. Alexandria is a struggling graphic artist in San Fransisco. She is trying to raise her younger brother alone after their parents died. She ends up being kidnapped by a vampire( a Carpathian who has turned to the evil) and he has exchanged blood with her. She is rescued by Aidan who after almost killing her(thinking she was a vampire herself) must give her blood to kill the poisen the vampire gave her. She goes through the conversion but not willingly. She hates what she is becoming and hates Aidan for turning her this way. He has realized that she is his true lifemate and struggles to protect her in this modern world. She is stubborn and insists that she be able to have her freedom. She soon discovers that she is very strongly linked to Aidan and like to tease him and longs to hear his laughter. She is unaware that he hasn't had any emotions for over 800 years until she cam into his life. Together they struggle to find even ground. He has been hunting several vampires that have been preying on San Fransisco and when one takes her brother he uses all his strength to save him. Alexandria sends him her strength telepathicly and together they kill the evil. This has been the funniest of the books so far and I enjoyed it a bit more because of it. I can't wait to read Gregori's story next. If you want great books get the Dark series, it won't dissapoint."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"I eagerly sat down to read Dark Gold, expecting something on the scale and depth of Susan Krinard's books. I was disappointed by the pacing, &amp; the sudden turn-around of the female protagonist to the controlling Tortured Hero's (tm) p.o.v. For several hundred pages, she resists, rebels, then they have sex and BOOM! that's all she wrote.At its core, I guess I find the omniscient, arrogant, superpowered male being and the quivering, shocked young girl trope a trifle too S&amp;M for me...not that the author resorts to whips and chains to keep her heroine in line. The cutesy humor between the two main characters in several scenes became tiresome after the third scene. It ran counter to their stated relationship and diffused the modest sexual tension. I popped out of the story when it happened. When the Heroine should have been angry when her authority over her little brother was usurped by the rest of the household, scenes that IMHO should be ratcheting the tension are reduced to yet more cutsey scenes. I guess these were to show the soft side of the arrogant Hero, and gain reader sympathy. I just wanted to gag! It undermined the character's intensity (not that I took them seriously in this Mary Sue flavored romance fantasy).Also, many of the problems suffered by the characters (esp the Heroine) would have been solved more easily if the Hero had simply explained a few things to the Girl. Character stupidity to advance a plot is a frustrating device.He doesn't inspire much trust, even after getting to know him. About the only thing that could would be to have a mental link to him, like the Heroine develops! His so casual entrances into her mind became increasingly frustrating, invasive and plot crippling (and more examples of that cutesy humor). It would have been nice if limits were placed on that power. Especially since the author didn't show the Heroine reciprocating this display of persistant bad manners!I agree that Feehan has an interesting premise for how vampires evolve, but coupling it with such an apparently strict formula (as stated by other reviewers) reduces my attraction to this series. I'll try one more...but this time, I'll loan it from the library.It was easy to put this book down. It just didn't grip me. Different strokes for different folks, I guess."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"This book was so bad that I have to wonder if family and friends of the author wrote the other reviews. I feel like I was deceived since I got it based on those same reviews. To be honest I didn't (couldn't) actually read the whole thing. I think I threw it against the wall after 50 or 60 pages. I forced myself to read that far. I should have gone with my initial reaction and tossed it after the first 5 pages."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"\\"Dark Gold\\" is the 3rd book in Christine Feehan's Carpathian series. This book centers on Aidan Savage. He is born of the Carpathian Mountains of Romania. He is 800 years old. Like others of his race, he drinks blood; he can shapeshift; he has telepathic abilities; and he can not go in the sun. Like all Carpathian men, he lost his emotions and his ability to see in color after he turned 200. Those gifts will not return unless he finds his lifemate, the other half of his soul. If he does not find her, he will lead a barren existence, until he chooses to end his life or become vampire, an evil being who kills and inflicts misery on others.Aidan finds his lifemate, Alexandria, in the clutches of a true vampire. The beast is trying to take her for his own mate. And he has tortured Alex to a point where, when Aidan first sees her, he thinks she is a deranged vampiress and attacks her. Once he realizes his mistake, he gives her his blood to save her life. After his brutal attack, Alex does not see the difference between Aidan and a vampire.Aidan brings Alex and her young brother (who she is raising) back to his home. He realizes that the vampire had two blood exchanges with her --and his own blood exchange was the third necessary to convert a human woman to Carpathian. The conversion is hard on Alex and she doesn't want it. She fights her attraction to Aidan. She fights becoming Carpathian. It's hard to see her stripped of her choices; her independence ripped away.Even though Aidan killed the vampire who first kidnapped Alex, another is searching for her, which puts her life in danger. And there is drama in that, but the real issue at the center of the book is her fight against what she has become and her fight against her feelings for Aidan. It takes a long time for her to get past the idea that he is using his telepathic abilities to make her want him, as he pushes his will on her in so many ways. I found I got angry for her many times in the book. As with all the other Carpathian men, Aidan believes his way is always the right way... and with the strength of his abilities, that's a tough pill for Alex (and me) to swallow.Of course, the sex scenes are pretty hot. That's one thing you can always count on in a Carpathian book. But I think we can start a fairly good drinking game, where you take a shot every time Feehan uses the word \\"velvet.\\" Everyone will be tanked before we get halfway through the book. Between the velvet sheath, the velvet fist, the velvet tip, the velvet over marble, and velvet voices, we could open a fabric store courtesy of \\"Dark Gold.\\" If you can overlook that, the love scenes alone make the book a great read.Despite my issues with bossy Aidan (and of course my rant on \\"velvet\\"), I enjoyed this book. It was fun to see the heroine running away from our hero, despite the fact that he is gorgeous, rich and head over heels for her. 4 stars."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"I'm sorry there's no way to rate in minus stars.

Personally she should have made this one the short story and made Dark Descent the longer version. Alex was ready to give up her life for her brother, than becomes a real sissy the rest of the book. I still liked the book in other ways, with the battles and Aidan's relationship with his servants and Alex's little brother. So it was worth reading."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"I grew very fond of this book, different compare to the first two, this one really focus on Alexandra and Aidan's relationship.Aidan put a new light in his lifestyle and way o f living compare to ther rest of the capathain males. He is also different mentaly and physicaly may I add. Aidan had showed alot of paitence and restraint with Alexandra which I give him credit for.You will see that Alexandra is tough and stubborn to the point that she will get on your nerves at times. There was a number of funny moments throught out the book and also wasn't overloaded with sex.DARK GOLD is the third book in the Carpathian Series and somewhat different from the first two books (DARK PRINCE & DARK DESIRE) in that the violence is less graphic and the sex scenes more toned down. It also made more attempt at humor. I enjoyed Aidan's playfulness especially when Alex goes out on a date with Thomas Ivan. Again I simply adored Aidan's patience with Alex, considering she starts off as rather selfish and annoying. Another thing I liked is the fact that Aidan had humans living with him who are aware of his true identity and love him for what he is.

The PASSION and loyalty the characters create is extraordinary. So, follow along the primrose path with the rest of we Christine Feehan fans. Then join us as we wait for Gregoris story &quot;Dark Magic&quot;!

I love it!"},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"This is another favorite of mine within this series. It was actually the first book of the series I read. At the time, I didn't know it was a series, a friend of mine loaned it to me and I fell in love with Christine Feehan's style of writing. However, once I started reading the other books within the series, I realized they become repetitive. She uses many of the same words and the stories pretty much follow the same line.That being said, I would recommend this book and the rest of this series."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"I truly loved this book. If you have not read the series especially the first two books then reading this book you will be missing some crucial information about the characters. This book tells the story of Aidan and Alexandria destined life mates that have to overcome some very distinct obstacles. Aidan is a Carpathian who thought his life mate was attacking a child. He realizes almost too late and was able to save her following her brutal attack from a vampire. I like the characters in this book especially Aidan's human staff that delights in poking fun at Aidan since his life mate has a human suitor. I do not want to give a way to much of the book in this review but one of favorite characters Gregori makes an appearance in this book. Great addition to the series of telling the story of the Carpathians."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"Christine Feehan has made a series for those of us who love paranormal books as well as romance and put them all in one. Its a series I came across by accident and ended up reading book 14 first. Since then I have started at the beginning and am workin my way through them all. I love how even though I read 14 first I wasnt lost on what was happening. They can stand alone but its so much better when she brings past characters in and you immediately know who they are, even though she does normally give a very brief description of the past characters so for those of you who dont follow the series arent lost. Georgori and Savannahs story is my favorite if I absolutely had to choose, but the stroies of true love and how each couple has to overcome their individual issues to get there are great. I would recommend this series to anyone who has a love for romance and paranormal. To me its all wrapped up in a very nice package and keeps you interested. And this is coming from a person who literally reads a book every 3 days...so Ive read alot of books in my time. Enjoy it!!"},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"I believe Feehan was one of the first to seriously cover the whole vampire romance genre and was a very unique read at the time.

I've read hundreds! But, for some reason I had never heard of Christine Feehan. One day, I decided to do a search of the top authors in paranormal romance and came across her name. I was surprised and excited to see the long list of books in this series. Lots of reading material! I got the first book and drudged through, thinking that books written early in an author's career are not as good as what will come and i was just getting the scenery and back stories of the next great books... and the second one in this series was an improvement to be sure, but still lacking, so I had hopes.... I am now in the middle of this third book in the series and I am so bored to tears, I can't stand it!

She pulls you into the middle of a world that you can almost believe into reality. He character's are charismatic, energetic, and most definatly sexy. Romance is paramount as well as the danger of evil beings lurking to thwart the love between the carpatian and his lifemate at every turn. Each book captivates you even more and brings you more into the dark world. I cannot put these books down and am impatient waiting for the delivery for theh next one. You should only read these books if you want danger, romance and the promise of a night of passion."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"Another great story.

The main characters seem to have a slightly more equal relationship and Adain is a nicer character in the beginning as opposed to the deceptive, half rapists that appear in the previous books, which practically force the woman into sex then hurt her in the process. Overall these books are all the same story line so far; man about to turn evil, meets a woman who rejects him, he forces her into submission , the woman falls in love, there is a brief excitement when a nemesis attacks and they must protect the woman, then everyone lives happily. Its a nice read when you want something light and quick, although the plots grow boring in each successive book."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"Aidan Savage is the Carpathian sent to San Francisco to defeat the vampires in that area. Unfortunately, Aidan is 800 years old and very close to turning or greeting the dawn himself. Alexandra Houton and her young brother Joshua are kidnapped one night by a vampire and held prisoner in his lair, because she is psychic and he wants her for a mate. She manages to keep the vamp away from Josh, but it feeds on her twice.Covered in blood, bruises, and blisters from the vamp's abuse, Alex looks like the undead, and when Aidan arrives to defeat the vamp that's exactly what he thinks she is...a human turned vampiress. After killing the vamp, Aidan begins to end Alex's life too. Imagine his surprise when he can suddenly see in color and feel emotion again, realizing this battered woman is actually his lifemate.This is another wonderful addition to \\"The Carpathian\\" series. Lots of humorous dialogue, good sex scenes, and sweet romance. A very good read."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"As usual I love Christine Feehan's style although I always get annoyed by the heroines' \\"need for independence\\" which actually translate into heading blindly into any and all danger and just plain defying their lifemate for the sake of it...

I really just hated Alex and the fact that she blamed him for what a vampire did to her. He saves her life and she treats him like crap. She was soooo selfish when all they wanted to do is help her deal with the situation. But all in all I read the book because I really love this author."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"I think that this is the worse written book out of her whole series. It repeats itself soooo many times that you can skip paragraphs without missing anything. The writing style is not consistant with her other books in the series and almost seems that a different person wrote each paragraph. One of many inconsistancies that I found in this book was the conversion from human to Carpathian. In all the other books it states that it take 3 blood transfers to convert - in this one it states 4. And I just wanted to yell at Alex and tell her to get over it already - the vampire had almost converted her completely anyway. And also during the conversion it states that Alex threw up the tainted vampire blood, yet she had just taken blood from Aiden and they are supposed to be able to push the toxins out of their pores - not throw it up after a day has passed since the first vampire exchange.I've read 9 of the books, but not in order and couldn't wait to read Aiden's story, but I am VERY dissapointed in this one. It was so poorly written that I would have given it 0 stars if it was possible. If you like strong females - I suggest reading Dark Destiny."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"The Carpathian (Dark) Series:(First ten in the seres listed here)Dark PrinceDark DesireDark GoldDark MagicDark ChallengeDark FireDark LegendDark GuardianDark MelodyDark DestinyCarpathians: AKA \\"The People of the Earth.\\" They are not vampires. They do survive on blood, but never drink to the point of causing death. If a Carp drinks to the point of causing death, he/ she instantly forfeits his/ her soul. At this point, the Carpathian becomes a vampire. The rest of the vamp's existence is spent hiding from Carpathian Hunters who slay vampires to protect both the human and Carpathian races.The Carpathian men are undeniably hot. Although they are dominant, their first and foremost necessity is to provide their mate with protection and complete happiness. Their women are their greatest treasures. When a Carp man finally finds his mate, he is so grateful to have her in his life that he will do whatever he must to keep her safe and happy.Until a Carp man finds his mate, his life is empty and meaningless. Some grow so lonely and desolate, they choose to \\"turn vampire\\". Feelings of evil can fill an empty soul, giving the illusion of an end to centuries of loneliness.In \\"Dark Gold\\", our hero is Aiden. \\"Gold\\" referring to his hypnotic golden eyes. Aiden is a Carpathian Hunter. He is one of the oldest and most powerful Carp men in existence. For 800 years, he has waited and searched for his mate. The one who can bring color and emotion back into his life. Aiden is nearly at the end of all hope, ready to walk into the sun and end his loneliness through death rather than giving in to the temptation of turning evil.Alexandria (Alex) has been raising her little brother for the past four years. She was only 19 when her parents died. Little Joshua is her reason for waking each morning and pushing through each day. She is horrified when her psychic mind envisions Joshua in danger. When she runs to his aid, both Alex and Josh are captured and held prisoner by a vampire. This vampire believes she can give him back the soul he forfeited.Aiden has hunted down a vampire who he believes has \\"turned\\" a human woman. He must slay the vampire, then kill the vampiress. He hopes to overtake her mind so that he can kill her without causing her any more suffering than the vampire has already forced upon her. He is shocked to find that her mind is very resistant to his powers. Even more shocking, he realizes that he is seeing colors and actually FEELING emotions of compassion for her suffering. These gifts of emotions and colors can only come to a Carp man when he has found his true lifemate. Rather than slay her, Aiden must make her and her brother feel safe in his home. The blessing of having Alex in his life is worth any amount of work it will take to convince her that she belongs with him. Surprisingly, Josh becomes just as precious to his heart. These two humans have become his family. Josh is thrilled, but Alex is not about to give up her independence. Josh is glad to conspire with Aiden to help win Alex's compliance.Sadly, Aiden often finds himself having to hunt his old friends. When they give up and turn, Aiden must slay them. Now an old friend has come to Aiden's city to challenge him. The vampire wants to kill both Aiden and Josh, taking Alex for himself. The last vamp who tried to take Alex failed. This one is far more powerful. Using Josh as a pawn, the vamp calls Aiden out. Only one will survive. The winner takes Alex.I loved Aiden. He was a terrific hero. He was so full of joy at finding both Alex and Josh that I couldn't help but melt for him a bit.I liked Alex's strength and determination. I could definitely relate to the fact that she wanted to keep her job in the field of art, even though she no longer needed to work. Her protection of, and affection for, Josh was vibrant. I could understand her resistance to Aiden's lifestyle. The problem was that it dragged on too long. She even put him through watching her date other men just to prove herself. It got old. By the time she came around, I was ready to put the book aside. I still read the rest of the book, which was excellent, but didn't enjoy it as much as I could have.Want to read the whole series?

He also has a &quot;family&quot;, humans who have come with him from Carpathia and lived with him for generations.Alexandria Houton is living on a shoestring--she's a computer design artist who's got no job, no money, and a six-year-old brother to care for. Just when it looks like her luck might be changing, she witnesses several murders by a deranged, bloodthirsty creature. To make matters worse, he seems to have taken a fancy to her, and carries her off to some cavern where he makes her drink his blood.Enter Aidan, who mistakes her at first for a vampiress and drains her blood. When he realizes his mistake, it is too late; he has already brought Alex over, and realizes she is his lifemate.All of a sudden, nothing in Alex's life is the same; she's living with strangers in a strange house, can't be out in the sun, and can't eat anything. For a person used to being in charge of her life, the loss of control is terrifying. Alex is attracted to Aidan, but desperately wants her old life back. Can there be a compromise?Dark Gold has a much lighter feel to it than its two darker, more primal predecessors. This book has got more of a comedic element, due in part to Aidan's reaction to Alex's persistence in continuing to date.If you haven't yet read Dark Prince and Dark Desire, you don't know what you're missing. For those who have been following the Carpathian series, you will be happy to know that more info is provided in this book about Gregori and his lifemate, and that his book is the next one to come out, in July."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"So, going into this book I hadn't read a romance novel in several years. I've always found that romance novels are extremely hit or miss. I don't like the contemporary ones at all and the historical/fantasy ones range from tawdry fairy tales with little substance to masterful works that are only seperated from regular sci-fi/fantasy by an overabundance of sex and fewer fight scenes.My co-worker was an avid fan of Christine Feehan's work, so I decided to see what all the fuss was about. Dark Gold is apparently the third in the \\"Dark\\" series, but my co-worker recommended it as her favorite. Though the setting links the various novels, they can be read independently of each other without confusion. Her latest installment in the series, Dark Symphony, just came out this week.Each book tells the tale of a particular \\"Carpathian male\\" and his future \\"life-mate\\" as they find one another and overcome various obstacles on the way to spending the rest of eternity together. In essence, the Carpathians are a race of predatory, immortal humans. Over the centuries, the number of Carpathian women has dwindled and the males have been forced to wander for eons in search of a life-mate. A life-mate is the only thing that can assuage their savage nature and ensure they they do not succumb to the dark side and turn vampire.Very few human women have the mental fortitude to survive the transformation into a Carpathian, so most of these guys must wait for a long time. Imagine all that pent up sexual frustration! Fortunately for them, they cannot feel strong emotion (or even see in color) until they meet that special someone. In this particular novel, we bear witness to the romance of Alexandria Houton and Aidan Savage.I, personally, found much lacking in this book. There was a lot of sexual tension and very little plot. They spend most of the book in Aidan's house while Alexandra undergoes her transformation and then Aidan tries to convince her that she is not damned for all time. Very little actually happens in this book. I was bored to tears halfway through it and even the forthcoming steamy sex scenes couldn't completely overcome my apathy.The characters were one-dimensional. They did not undergo any real growth during the course of events. This is particularly true of Alexandria, who spends most of the book being defiant and then suddenly changes her tune in time for the books climax. Apparently the sex really was that good! Unfortunately, the most interesting character, Aidan's mentor, doesn't appear until the end and is only present for a few scenes.All in all, there was plenty of sex and much of it was suitably animalistic. Ms. Feehan has a firm grasp on the necessary romance novel terminology; the sexual tension and sexual encounters were well done. Unfortunately, I like a little more substance to my stories, even in the context of a romance novel."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"Christine Feehan, has done it again! She has created yet another unforgettable Carpathian male and spunky heroine. While having a different feel then her previous two books (Dark Prince and Dark Desire), Dark Gold still packs a powerful punch. How can you not feel for the heroine, who must struggle to understand and accept what she has become, and yet at the same time fight off her growing attraction and love for a being she fears. The hero in this story, Aidan, is different from the Carpathian males we've met, while just as arrogant, possessive and powerful as his brethren, he is able to put his needs and wants aside, and allow Alexandria the space and time she needs to grow. Definitely another keeper. Fans of paranormal romance, and romance fans in general will love this book.Also recommend Dark Prince and Dark Desire"},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"Dark Gold is another masterpiece in the Dark saga by this author. I highly recommend this book. It is full of excitement, suspense, romance between to strong lovable characters, and adventure. Although the story stands on its own, I would suggest reading Dark Prince and Dark Desire first to get the true flavor of this book. Many questions can be answered. But new questions have been raised about this interesting race of people, Carpathians.You will not be able to put it down.For Vampire and paranormal genre readers, this book is a must.To all readers, I suggest putting this author on your automatic &quot;To Buy&quot; list. She will not disappoint you."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"As the third book in the &quot;Dark&quot; series by Christine Feehan, &quot;Dark Gold&quot; fails to achieve the can't-put-it-down status of its brethren. Aidan Savage, an exceptionally powerful Carpathian and hunter of those of his species turned vampire, inadvertently rescues his lifemate (the light to his darkness,) Alexandria, and her much younger brother from the hands of an &quot;evil one.&quot; The traumatized Alexandria lives only for the safety of her brother- for whom she has been the sole caregiver since the death of their parents many years before. Being forced into the home and life of Aidan Savage- in addition to facing the tribulations of having become a Carpathian herself- leaves the fiercely independent Alexandria in a constant state of denial and frustration. Aidan does little to ease his lifemate's transition. To further complicate matters, a group of rogue vampires continually seeks to abduct Alexandria and eliminate Aidan, placing his fledgling lifemate and her brother in constant danger. Aidan's battles with the vampires allow Alexandria her demonstrations of unity and strength while providing a reintroduction to &quot;The Dark One,&quot; Gregori, who arrives in town to await the arrival of his yet-unclaimed lifemate (the daughter of Mikhail and Raven.) In the end, we learn nothing new of the Carpathian male (except, perhaps, of Gregori's transgressions) and are presented with the quintessential defiant, human lifemate. Still, the addition of Aidan's human caretakers adds a new spin on this thrice-told tale. For dedicated readers of Christine Feehan and paranormal romances- or for those who have yet to read the previous two novels in this series, it will captivate. For those of us who have read &quot;Dark Prince&quot; and &quot;Dark Desire,&quot; &quot;Dark Gold&quot; is less enthralling and far more predictable. For either category, it leaves you salivating for the sequel, &quot;Dark Magic,&quot; and FINALLY, it's story of Gregori!"},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"My friend loaned me the entire series as I love all things vampire. At least I thought I did until I started the Dark series. The premise is excellent - the idea of the Carpathians versus the vampires is unique and intriguing and is what initially drew me into these books. However, the author really needs to gets herself a new editor as several people have mentioned - the editing is absolutely apalling. This and repetition of large chunks of back story, phrases and character types make these books inferior to others of this genre.The third book in the series is simply a repeat of the second which was a repeat of the first. Different characters, same storyline. Perfect, darkly handsome, imperious Carpathian males with \\"black velvet voices\\" (if I had a nickel for everytime that phrase was used I could go and live in the Capathian mountains) find lifemates with equally perfect, small waisted, long haired (beyond their hips - I mean who really has hair that long?) human women with gem-colored (fill in the appropriate gemstone) eyes. The Fabio-like men always have a \\"beast lurking within\\" inches from the surface just waiting to get out, which basically means they haven't been getting any for several hundred years and a good third of the book will be given over to \\"steamy, hot sex\\" (yes, another frequently used phrase) with the woman resisting valiantly until the \\"liquid heat\\" overcomes all and she gives in. Resistance is futile - you will be assimilated into the Carpathian lifestyle, like it or not.My friend tells me that the books do get better. Unfortunately I don't want to waste any more time waiting to find out. I actually quit Dark Gold half way through which is extremely unusual for me; in the 40 years I've been reading adult fiction I have only done this a handful of times. Unlike the women in these novels, I do have the power to say \\"no\\"..."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"Alexandria Houton desperately needed the job that Thomas Ivan could give her. She was an excellent computer programmer and knew that she could design Ivan's games so that they were better than ever before. But, before she could close the deal in the restaurant, she heard a voice calling to her. She didn't want to follow it, but, when she saw the creature holding her beloved little brother captive, she knew that she had no choice. The vampire chained her in a cave where she could not escape, too weak with blood loss and the poison now flowing through her system from the vampire's tainted blood to even try to get free. When the vampire rose the next evening, she prepared to face her death, but found an avenging angel who came to save her...Aidan Savage had volunteered to leave his beloved Carpathian mountains to hunt the vampires in San Francisco and its surrounding area. He had lived for so long without a life mate that he didn't believe his eyes when he started to see color and feel emotion in Alexandria's presence. He knew that Alexandria was afraid of him, but could never let her go. Aidan tried to ease Alexandria into her life as a Carpathian, but she defied him at every turn - demanding that they drop her brother off at school even though the sun was exquisitely painful, going out on a date with Thomas Ivan and continuing to work with him, refusing to take his blood until forced, in short, doing everything in her power to deny what she had become. How long would Aidan be able to be patient with his beloved Alexandria before she would finally accept who and what she truly was?I really liked Aidan's character and thought that he made a nice change from Ms. Feehan's other heroes. For one thing, Aidan is blonde, where all the other Carpathians are dark, and he seems to have keep more light in his soul than the other men in the Dark series. He is very playful and patient with Alexandria. Aidan also has a human family who have cared for him for generations, a son or daughter always choosing to stay on and to take care of his house and other affairs while he is resting during the day. The only problem was that Aidan was such a strong personality that all of the other characters seemed to pale in comparison. I would have liked Alexandria to be a richer character, less superficial, but I did like her. This was a great addition to the Dark series and I enjoyed the new setting as well as the new kind of hero. Keep up the great work Ms. Feehan!"},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"I wish I could give this no stars. I don't know how people can enjoy this woman. This is by far one of the worst published authors for this genre of books, I've ever had the displeasure of reading. I've read only two of her books (the second one, was just to give her another chance) and they were just horrendous.It's the most repetitive, ridiculous, unbelievable cheesy dialogue imaginable. It's almost insulting to the reader how horribly vapid the writing is. I thought I was reading a Ann Rice-wannabe/Harlequinn Romance hybrid abomination.I just can't even express how awful this author is."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"After having read Dark Desire and Dark Prince (both 5+ keepers), I was a little disappointed in this story. It started out great with the vampire kidnapping Alexandria, and keeping her prisoner in a cold and sea sweep cave. The scenes were vivid and detailed, and you could almost feel her pain and confusion. Alex's rescue by Aidan was dramatic and riveting and probably the best part of the book (chapter 3). The disappointing thing is that the story was sort-of ho-hum after that.If I had read this book first, I might not be as critical. But knowing how good Ms Feehan books can be, this one was a little disappointing."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"I really like the Dark series. I bought numbers 1 - 8 but skipped over this one because of the mixed reviews. I found something really good in each of the installments even though I do have my preferences. Well, I finally decided to go back and get it just to complete my collection ... I could have left it out. This is definitely the weakest link in the chain.It starts off strongly with Alexandria and her little brother as compelling characters but once the two main protagonists actually meet it loses its life. In a series of this nature the author has set up certain constants of Carpathian instinct/culture that are not subject to the individual character's personality. There are inconsistencies in the story line that don't fit with the Carpathian premise. The most annoying of which is the fact that Aidan is supposed to be an ancient great hunter but he winds up needing the strength of a fledgling human convert to save him. It makes you wonder how he survived on his own all these \\"centuries\\". The entire development of the story wasn't plausible.For example, when Alex was going through the change Aidan gives his word not to do anything to her and sweats blood pacing outside of her room because he can't stand her pain but doesn't interfere. No. It doesn't fit with the Carpathian male's makeup. He would have been compelled to interfere for her own good. The whole \\"I can do no other but see to your happiness\\" thing. In addition, the major climactic confrontation near the end of the book is provoked by the kidnapping of the child. Aidan sits back and watches the boy leave the house when any of the other Carpathian characters would have simply taken control of his mind and made him stay in the house - thus preventing the whole scene. Ms Feehan needed to work on this one a little more. There's also the fact that Aidan kept expecting Alex to understand what he was talking about when he made references to things Carpathian but he hadn't really explained anything to her. No wonder she kept having panic attacks. There's also Alex's insistence on thinking that she was going insane or in the middle of some really long hallucination...come on. After having witnessed several murders, been kidnapped, bitten, threatened, and subjected to emotional torture and exposure by a vampire she actually says that they don't exist...and can't see the difference between that other creature and herself and Aidan.I was rolling my eyes. I only finished it because I paid good money for it.The rest of the series runs right along and you won't miss not having read this one. If you're new to the Dark series then start at the beginning with Dark Prince. If you're not new but are looking for one with a little different twist and a main character with a sensitive approach then check out Dark Symphony which is Byron's story."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this series. When I heard about it I immediately headed to the bookstore to buy it. To my dissapointment they did not have it in. It took a couple of more try's but I finnally had it in my hand and was anticipating sitting down and reading what looked like an exciting vampire/romance novel.I sat down, I read halfway through, then I put it down and never picked it up again. It started out interesting but went down hill once Aidan a dominant caparthian male, became the dominant character in the story. His personality was to overpowering and the heroine just seemed to fade into the background. When he started acting like the heroine couldn't move an inch without him there to protect her that's when I realized this was going to be one of those boring novels where the woman is protected like a piece of china . It looked like a good book but Aidan cast to much a shadow over the heroine's personality so she became just a meek shadow of what she might have been.If you like a little horror in your vampire romance you might want to check out Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blakes series instead. A series were there's a heated romance triangle and a Heroine who actually has a voice."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"Let's face it, these books are certainly not intended for what you'd call the \\"modern woman\\". These Carpathian men may be hot and have old-fashioned romantic tendencies but they sure as heck don't truly respect women. They say they do but their actions speak otherwise. In all the other stories we had these seemingly strong women who have a tendency to succumb to the all-powerful Carpathian males in a matter of heartbeats. \\"I'm strong and have a mind of my own, you can't boss me around! Oh hey, when you touch me it feels great... Ok, you can boss me around.\\" The men definitely milk that obedience for all it's worth, throwing their weight around like wrestlers gone crazy. On my more submissive days it can be a bit appealing strictly from a fantasy view. I must admit though, this book really wasn't as bad as the others. Aidan seems a bit more laid back and is able to laugh at himself. He ends up turning his lifemate by accident as opposed to the men in all the other novels. He's trying to save the boy so unlike the other books it doesn't seem like rape of the will. He tries to protect the boy, discovers she isn't an evil child killer but his lifemate, and goes about saving her life by changing her. At least he didn't seem to do it for purely selfish reasons, as the others do (Gregori... Don't even get me started on him). \\"I don't want to turn vampire or walk into the light so I'll just take YOUR life away! How's that sound? Don't like it? Too bad. You'll grow to love me in time...\\"The heroine of the story actually holds out for half the book before giving in to her Carpathian male's charms. That was refreshing for a change. She actually made an effort to fight against the new life she was afraid of. It was refreshing to see at least one of these women fight instead of rolling over and simply accepting it.All in all, I enjoyed the book. I also enjoyed Julians' tale \\"Dark Challenge\\". Was nice seeing him paired with a powerful woman."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"Both the main character and the plot were pretty disappointing. Particularly the author's clear lack of understanding of any of the things it takes for a person to support herself as an artist (let alone her little brother, who appears to be merely a plot device, instead of a character). Now she's going to be a game designer? She got this interview how? But I digress.The love story was forced, the girl was much too perfect, and for crying out loud, if she's going to be an artist, you could have the decency to give her a day job and some paint under her fingernails like the real thing. Also, what is with the totally generic mansion? They need a ballroom why? Is pretentious consumerism somehow wired into the Carpathian mindset?"},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"THIS CARPATHIAN SERIES...WAS ANOTHER ONE THAT DEFINITELY A PAGE TURNER FOR ME..AND IF LOVE THE CARPATHIAN SERIES AS MUCH AS I DO YOU WILL ENJOY THIS LITTLE TALE OF ALEX AND AIDAN!THE WHOLE CARAPHIAN MEETS PYCHIC GIRL, BATTLING THE VAMPS..I TRULY ENJOY!TO THE FULLEST."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"I have collected all of Ms. Feehan's book since reading the first of this series.

It is so refreshing to read an emotional and sexy vampire book (I've said it before and I'll say it again--they're vampires!--just good ones). I have definitely enjoyed the playfulness in this book, the jokes and the teasing, yet it still remains serious.I recently received Dark Magic, and now I want to read that one, but, as usual, I don't want Dark Gold to ever end.

After reading it the first time I went back and read it again, immediately. Can't beat it for sheer romance and intensity. This is the first book I've read by Ms. Feehan. I've already ordered two more. The plot is great and really moves along. My only complaint, and it has nothing to do with the author, is the ripped bodice cover to the book. It's really embarrassing to pick it up off the bookstore shelf. Also, the cover trivializes the story, giving the impression that you're just going to read another &quot;heaving breasts&quot; novela written to the level of a thirteen year old teenager.

SOONER THAN LATER"},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"Nearly another quarter of a century has elapsed (since Dark Desire) and the Carpathian plight is little changed. The race is facing extinction. The woman are scarce, the few surviving children male. The hope for the future lies in those rare human women with true psychic ability who are able to survive the conversion process and become lifemates.A previous attempt to depose the Dark Prince having failed, the vampires have dispersed to the far corners of the earth. The hunters have been forced to follow, leaving their beloved homeland and it's healing soil behind. Aidan Savage is one such man. An intimate of the Prince, he is a master hunter charged with the task of ridding the New World of the deadly menace. His soul is at risk however for, without a lifemate, each kill brings him closer to turning himself. His home base of San Francisco has recently been invaded by a band of five vampires. He has yet to stop the killing spree. He must hunt.Aidan is unique in several ways. He is fair in color, a trait that he shares with his reclusive brother Julian. He also he has a loyal human family who care for his home and protect him during the vulnerable daylight hours. This second quirk will later become invaluable to him.Alexandra Houton is a young woman in her twenties. She is the sole guardian of her six-year-old brother and a talented graphic artist. This last fact has not escaped the notice of the foremost creator of vampire video games. Excited about the prospect of this highly desirable career move and the hope of creating a better life for her small sibling, Alex agrees to an evening interview at a local restaurant. Unable to leave her young brother at home alone, she leaves him to wait outside with a kindly indigent of their acquaintance. Shortly into the meeting it becomes clear that the wealthy employer is interested in more than Alex's artistic skills. Taking a moment to check on her brother, Alex finds his protector brutally slain. The killer is a creature the likes of whom she has never seen. Attempting to prevent her mesmerized brother from reaching the demon, Alex, the true prize, is captured and spirited away to the entrance of the demon's lair. The vampire has recognized Alex's lifemate potential and hopes to claim her for himself. He performs two brutal blood exchanges before chaining her to a wall at the mouth of the cave. He does not trust her to know of his lair, where he will lay vulnerable while the sun is in the sky. As the level of seawater in the cave rises the elements take their toll on Alex so that she is unrecognizable by nightfall.Night is upon them and Aidan has discovered the whereabouts of the vampire. After a brief battle he dispatches the betrayer. He then turns to the crazed vampiress (Alex) of the evil one's creation. She is clutching a small human child. Aidan attempts to destroy her before she can slay the child but in the process discovers that the blood surrounding him appears to be red. Sensations burst upon him. The woman is no vampiress, but his true lifemate and she is dying. He must save her at any cost.The cost is further blood exchange which triggers the conversion process. Aidan regrets that this has occurred without her consent, but he was left with no choice. The vampires' treatment of her and the battle she witnessed between him and Aidan has fostered distrust of him. She cannot distinguish the difference between Carpathian and vampire. She wants no parts of this creature who would possess her and despises what she has become. She rebels against him, but even as she struggles to maintain her independence, in an effort to retain her humanity, the bond strengthens. Aidan is stunned by Alex's loveliness and even more taken aback by her affect on other men. Though he is aware that the bond between them is unbreakable he must struggle to win her trust and her heart.Four vampires remain. It is clear to the pair that the humans they love are their Achilles heel, that the vampires will undoubtedly strike at them through their family. Will Aidan be able to convince Alex that they are each other's destiny? Will they combine their strengths to fight the menace that plagues them? Will they succeed?Aidan meets briefly with Gregori, who awaits his lifemate's arrival here. Gregori is walking the edge, having given her the freedom to grow before claiming her. Her identity indicates that the union between those special human women and the Carpathian males is indeed the solution they were hoping for to continue the race. It is a perfect lead-in to the next title in the series, Dark Magic which is Grigori's story.I thoroughly enjoyed this story. This was the first time a human lifemate had an actual family member to contend with. One wonders how the pair will handle this as the boy grows older and they remain the same. At some point the child will have to be let in on the secret. It will be difficult for Alex not to be the major part of his life that she wants to be, and it will be even harder to watch him age. It is a testament to Ms. Feehan's writing ability that she is able to deal with such hard-hitting issues with such aplomb. I am really looking forward to the next installment due to be released in late summer. --Leslie Tramposch, Copyright 2000 ~Paranormal Romance Reviews"},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"I enjoyed Alex and Aidan's story.

In fact, nothing sexual happens for 2/3 of the book; instead Aidan and Alex get to know each other, making it realistic and romantic and sweet.I also liked the fact that Aidan had humans who took care of him, who shared his life and his secret. It made him more vulnerable, more approachable. This is my favorite of the first 4 books in the series. Sometimes ratings are so hard. This one should be a 3 & 1/2 star rating."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"It's hard to believe but this series just keeps getting better and better.

I thought Fire was best overall, and Gold was good because Aidan was a really sexy hero. But it seemed incomplete, for eg, I thought there was a lead-up to something sinister happening with the Ivan character but nothing came out of it and he just disappeared from the story. But bringing in Gregori was good, because it showed his darkness and his power, preparing us for his story in Dark Magic, which I hope to read soon, along with Dark Prince.

Unfortunately, women are not being born to Carpathinians and generally humans can not give birth to Carpathinians. Except it seems a woman with psychic abilities. When a Carpathinian male has lost his ability to feel, and his hope of finding a mate he turns and becomes a vampire.

Aiden's conversion of Alex occurred more by accident than intent, which is a nice change from her other books (frankly, the he-man beating on his chest approach was getting a bit repetitive).

Vivid characters, an exciting and well-written storyline and a lot of steamy sex combine to make a fabulously sensual tale that will leave readers craving a Carpathian of their own.Alexandria Houton has one purpose in her life, and that is to protect and care for her young brother, Joshua. Since the death of their parents in a tragic accident, Alexandria has struggled to make ends meet for herself and Joshua. A talented graphic artist, Alexandria is thrilled when one of the most prominent video game designers in the U.S. takes an interest in her work. Leaving her brother outside with a homeless man they have befriended, Alex meets her potential employer for an interview at a fancy restaurant. But in the middle of her meal, Alexandria is overcome by a feeling of evil and impending doom. She rushes out to check on Joshua to find him entranced by a soulless monster, a vampire. She manages to save her brother, but both are kidnapped and taken by the vampire to his lair.It seems as though Alex and Josh are about to meet their untimely end, when out of the night comes Aidan Savage, a powerful Carpathian hunter, who destroys the vampire and then turns to the task of destroying Alex, believing that she is a deranged vampiress. But before he completes his unpleasant task, Aidan suddenly realizes that he is seeing in colour for the first time in countless centuries. And that can only mean one thing - that this poor beaten and bloodied woman is his lifemate!Aidan brings Alexandria and Josh to his home where he inadvertently converts Alex into a Carpathian by exchanging blood with her (not knowing that the vampire had already completed two blood exchanges). When Alex awakens she is terrified by Aidan and by the thought of what she has become. As time passes Aidan tries to help Alex adjust to being a Carpathian, but many aspects of her new life are hard to accept. Aidan wants to keep Alexandria close in order to keep her safe from harm, but Alex needs to have her independence. As these two try to work out a way to balance their needs, Alex finds herself falling for Aidan, though his immense power still scares her.Alex and Aidan are an explosive couple when they come together, and the reader is treated to some incredibly hot and steamy scenes. Aidan, though he is overbearing and arrogant at times, is a fantastic hero who readers will adore. Likewise, Alexandria is a truly lovable heroine who will win readers over with her courage, determination, and sense of humour.\\"Dark Gold\\" is a wonderfully entertaining read that will leave readers sated and satisfied. Feehan expertly renders Alexandria's internal struggle, and captivates her readers as we watch Aidan and Alex find all they ever wanted and needed in each other's arms. There is a perfect dose of danger and excitement in this story, as vampires close in on Aidan and Alex in an attempt to take Alexandria for their own. All in all, I truly enjoyed this book and I'm sure that you will too. So sit back, relax and get ready for a very sexy read!"},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"I enjoyed Aidan's story because there are a few more characters than the other stories.

He is also referred to as the \`golden one' for he is fair in coloring unlike the usual dark features possessed by male Carpathians. For years he has lived in San Francisco, ridding America of those abominable creatures, many of whom he once called his friends. But Aidan Savage feels the desperation that plagues many of his kind. He knows that he would soon need to make a choice between greeting the dawn or succumbing to the ultimate evil - that of turning into the very breed that he has spent years ridding the world of.She is a very talented graphic designer desperately vying for a job with Thomas Ivan's highly successful computer games company, a job that would mean a better life for herself and her little brother Joshua, who she's been taking care of ever since they were orphaned. Apart from her usual talent in designing is another that is powerful enough to attract the attention of a vampire who means to make her his partner for Alexandria Houton is a true psychic. So on the night of her meeting with Thomas, little does she know it would be her last night as a human being. Knowing she would sacrifice her life to protect her brother, the vampire threatens to kill Joshua unless she comes to him willingly.After blood was brutally exchanged between the vampire and Alex, with dawn soon to come, he takes her and Joshua to a cave and chains her to the wall where Alex starts to feel the torment of the contaminated blood in her. With her rapid physical changes, all she could do is hope for a miracle escape, which comes shortly after nightfall as Aidan has discovered the vampire's lair. After the vampire was killed, Aidan sees her clutching Joshua and he assumes that she is a crazed vampiress about to murder a child. Thinking to destroy her, he bites her neck and is shocked as color burst upon him and he knows instantly that the dying woman in his arms is no other than the lifemate he has endured centuries of loneliness and bleak existence for.In order to save her, Aidan has to give Alex more blood which would also get rid of the contaminated blood that the vampire gave her. But as Alex became Carpathian, Aidan faces a battle of wills for she refuses to trust him and accept what she has become. And despite the bond between them, Aidan knows that he must win Alexandria's trust and love before they could truly find happiness together.DARK GOLD is the third book in the Carpathian Series and somewhat different from the first two books (DARK PRINCE & DARK DESIRE) in that the violence is less graphic and the sex scenes more toned down. It also made more attempt at humor. I enjoyed Aidan's playfulness especially when Alex goes out on a date with Thomas Ivan. I loved how he nearly drove Thomas insane making the poor man think he was hallucinating. And I simply adored Aidan's patience with Alex, considering she starts off as rather selfish and annoying. Another thing I liked is the fact that Aidan had humans living with him who are aware of his true identity and love him for what he is.Although I didn't think this as good as the first two, I still enjoyed it if mainly for the humor and of course the hero. Now I can't wait to start on Gregori's story (DARK MAGIC)."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"I have to agree with most of the others who have written reviews on this book. I LOVED the first two in the \\"Dark\\" series. But i couldn't even finish this one, i'm jumping ahead to Gregori's story. I absolutely hated Alex. Just like everyone else was saying, she was snobbish, and selfish. I kept reading, hoping she'd get over her \\"hysterical\\" period and finally LISTEN to Aidian about what she'd become, but she kept pushing him away, and being what i thought was really closeminded about the whole thing. I couldn't stand her to the point where i was reading with my teeth gritted, so i just put the book down. i'll keep reading the rest of the series b/c i adored the first two. I just hope the rest to come are far better than this one."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"I basically felt this book was force. I was forced to believe that these two would fall in love, but with the whole Carpathian lifemate thing working and the ability to mind read, you don't ever get the chance to listen to the characters share their fillings, their past or their fears. Since they automatically know each other. I felt I didn't know anything about either character and this made it even harder for me to enjoy the book. Anything about them was a blip compared the physical attraction they had for each other and then to top it off the sex scenes were often quick and annoying fix its to the story with Aiden Savage asking for more afterwards."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"This was a beautifully written story. Liked the fact it took Alex ages to come around to the hero, Aidan, and not accepting the 'Carpathian' changes in her so readily. I also liked that it was almost halfway through the book before they finally made love. The chemistry between them was great.And I definitely like the fact, Aidan, being centuries old, didn't use modern day endearments, which in this case would have worked because of him living with and interacting with humans through the centuries.A great tale!!!"},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"As others have said, this installment in the Dark series can pretty much stand on its own as a separate story.Alex, for me, was at least the spunkiest of the females thus far. I know that I would NOT be pleased to find out that I couldn't eat chocolate or sit in the sunshine ever again, no matter how hunky the tradeoff. The whole concept of a mono-diet is so unappealing. So any female who resists 'conversion' for a long time has my vote.Anyhow, Alex resists and tries so hard not to accept who and what she has become. Gradually, she does come around, but the chemistry between her and Aidan isn't quite what I'd hoped for. Still good, but not great.Her little brother is a nice touch, as well as the human servants. Like someone else said, its nice to see the 'vampire' world expanded a bit to include, well, 'us'.Good read overall!"},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"I loved Dark Gold and the other two in the series. I couldn't put them down until I finnished each book. I do wish I could have learned more about previous heros and the women they bewitched. I can't help asking myself, did Jacques and Shea have children? Where in the US did Julian settle? Has any of the others taken mates yet?The series really is wonderful and I'm waiting impatiently for the next to be published in July."},{"Title":"Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)","review":"As the previous two books before it, Dark Gold tells another wonderful story in the Carpathian series. Aidan and Alexandria were great. We see a different side to the Carpathian male in Aidan, who is funny and patient as well as sexy. The heroine was scared with all the changes occuring in her life yet kept her head above water with her humor and strength. I found myself laughing out loud while reading this book. The book was set in a more modern setting and due to this fact I thought the plot went smoothly and the feelings shared by the characters well portrayed. A different book than what we have seen but just as good.

Lots of awards, recognition, books, etc. Well respected. If you're not in marketing, he's still the world's foremost, etc, etc. And from his perspective, we are all in marketing. So, this book is for everyone in business...and then some.You'll find this little paperback disarmingly short...in appearance. First impression is that the book is too short to have much to offer. Surprise! There's an amazing amount of knowledge and insight in these pages. The format makes the book easy to read-in one sitting or in chunks or even sporadically as a reference book.The format is somewhat unusual, which gives a sense of special-ness to the book. Think of a question you'd like to ask a man like this, if you could have him all to yourself for a few minutes. OK, good. Now, ask another one. And another one. That's what your experience will be with this book. Question after question-that people have asked the guru over the years, followed by his short answer. Not long treatises, just short answers like you might get in an elevator encounter.The questions are organized into major categories and subcategories. The major sections are Markets and Marketing, Marketing Strategy, Marketing Tools, Market Planning, Marketing Organization, Marketing Areas of Application, and Marketing Excellence. The table of contents consists of the questions and the page numbers. Just let your finger move down the page and you'll find questions that draw you in because you're curious about his answer.Bonus: this book has a comprehensive index that makes it easy to find the answers-and the questions-you're looking for. Hence the value as a reference book.Drawbacks include the plight that the answers will often be shorter and shallower than readers will want. So, read his other books for the depth. There is some redundancy, as might be expected as the topics intertwine. All in all, this is a valuable book, perhaps worth multiples of the price to have a resource for quick, concise, sometimes provocative answers."},{"Title":"According to Kotler: The World's Foremost Authority on Marketing Answers Your Questions","review":"Philip Kotler is an institution by himself and perhaps the father of modern marketing. I have read most of his books and was pleasantly surprised to read about the growing importance of PR in his book. For a marketing expert to admit this requires guts.

Good book to understand modern marketing methodology and practices."},{"Title":"According to Kotler: The World's Foremost Authority on Marketing Answers Your Questions","review":"Having been immensely impressed with the material provided in Principles of Marketing, i found this book somewhat disappointing.

Taking the next step is up to the reader, but Kotler places the reader in a place where he or she will understand not just the fundamentals of succesfull marketing but much more about how marketing is a key component of any succesfull enterprise. Kotler also points the way to other authors whose expertise he respects and whose work will further round the reader's knowledge of this important subject."},{"Title":"According to Kotler: The World's Foremost Authority on Marketing Answers Your Questions","review":"Mr.Kotler has used more simply words to desribe and answer and summer market questions which has nobody to do it before him!I really like his books!Therefore, I have purchased his another book \\"Marketing insights from A to Z in china.

In this book, you will read, in their own words, the faith of early Christians and the secret of their courage knowing they were soon to face the wild animals of the arena. Following are over 70 more writings of Christians, some well-known, others not. However, each is powerful...St. Augustine, Martin Luther King, Jr., Mother Theresa. Challenge yourself to read the heart-felt responses to the Word of God through these writers from varying Christian faiths."},{"Title":"Invitation to Christian Spirituality: An Ecumenical Anthology","review":"Although I originally purchased this book for my seminary church history class, I find I won't be stopping at the required reading. Tyson does an excellent job of giving enough information on each writer to grasp their beliefs but not enough to bog the reader down in details. Some of his articles are almost a tease, enticing one to want to read more about those writers. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more about their Christian spiritual heritage."},{"Title":"Invitation to Christian Spirituality: An Ecumenical Anthology","review":"While the text provides some good excepts from Christian thinkers, the explanations of their lives and influences is poorly written."},{"Title":"Invitation to Christian Spirituality: An Ecumenical Anthology","review":"i'll start by agreeing with the previous review, this book is well written and very interesting to work through. i also had the benifit of having dr. tyson as a professor. he is a great guy who's very intelligent and he has put together a great collection. his intro notes are helpful for getting a grasp on the selections and i think that they would help the novice theologian or even a casual reader interested in just getting their hands on some spiritual writings. i can recommend this with total confidence to anyone looking for some good reading and know that they will be able to get a good look into the mind of the writers and not be left wondering as they are in some of the spirituallity books i've read."},{"Title":"Invitation to Christian Spirituality: An Ecumenical Anthology","review":"This book is a larger treatment of Dr. Tyson's theme found in \\"Faith, Doubt, and Courage\\" (Abingdon Press, 2008).

Whilst there have been many new developments n the field, the basic technology remains essentially the same with the stimulus for change being the desire to meet the demands of new applications. Many problems relating to fluid flow and heat transfer n networks involve the use of complex computational procedures, and they are, in general difficult to model due to the randomness of the processes and sometimes the presence of fluid transients and instabilities.In recent years Numerical Heat Transfer is an area which has generated much interest among researchers and thermal designers . The technical development in computer industries has created an increased impact on all the disciplines n heat transfer, including heat conduction, forced convection, natural convection, boiling, condensation, etc. Therefore, the book by Professor Nakayama is a record of the technical progress in the application of computational methods to some problems of fluid flow and heat transfer. The book covers boundary-layer flows to full elliptic flows, laminar flows to turbulent flows, and free convection to forced convection. A substantial part of the book (73 pages) describes problems of convective flows n porous media, which has been a topic of extensive research and development over the past 35 years. I believe that it was timely, in 1995, that Professor Nakayama presented an extensive survey on the subject of the application of numerical codes using personal computers (PC) to several heat transfer problems. Further specific emphasis in the book was placed on the application of a novel and very efficient integral solution methodology proposed by Professor Nakayama and his co-workers n 1994 to some non-similar boundary-layer problems. This method is a more general technique, in the sense that it not only yields the results identical to those from the classical Karman-Pohlhausen method for the case of Newtonian fluids, but it was also extended by Professor Nakayama and his associates to non-Newtonian power-law fluids and convective flows in porous media. Some contributions in the book are of direct relevance to the development of computer programmes, while others describe some of the available codes which have been furnished for the students to conduct numerical experiments of their own using a PC. These programes are both flexible and efficient, and have potential use n technology. The careful reader can readily see how to modify these programes for his own advantage."},{"Title":"PC-Aided Numerical Heat Transfer and Convective Flow","review":"EL LIBRO COMPRENDE EL DESARROLLO COMPUTACIONAL DE LOS PROBLEMAS DE DIFUSION-CONVECCION, COMO ELEMENTO DE APOYO PARA COMPRENDER EL USO Y DESARROLO DEL PROGRAMA SAINTS.

Other books gives results and not just mathematical formulas. Also, there are no appendixes or pictures at all. The analysis is a zero and you have to know exactly and extensively the heat convection theory to read this book. In other words, buy this book if you are going to study heat transfer extensively (university project, being a proffesor etc.). I am studying Mechanical Engineering, I did read many books about heat convection and the way that this book is written isn't the appropriate. Finally, the program is not one but ten small programs. Written in Fortran, the least that the author could do is to give a small compiler. Who can find a Fortran compiler these days? Who knows Fortran well enough to change the program list to describe the program he/she studies ? Furthermore, this book is expensive for what it offers and it doesn't contain any book resources. I think that Mr. Nakayama (I had read other books of him and found them good) has to think over the writing of this book again. After all, it is written in 1995."},{"Title":"PC-Aided Numerical Heat Transfer and Convective Flow","review":"I had read many books about &quot;Heat Transfer&quot; but this book is out of reality !!! It's all of mathematical formulas and nothing more. It doesn't contain any comment on heat transdfer and the examples it uses are not helping. Also, the program listing is in Fortran (remember ?), something difficult to use (if you find a compiler first). In other words buy this book if you read ALL the others. If you want to write a project on heat transfer look out for better books. Anyway, this book is not edifying but it just confuses the terms and the values."},{"Title":"Spoon","review":"The designers work showcased in Spoon is great, and is the best collection of up to date design that I have seen. The work in Spoon is mostly product and furniture design. This book is a great addition to any industrial designers library for content alone.The cover and binding design is the stupidest I have ever seen. Spoon is the least functional book I have ever used. It has a heavyweight, sharp edged, curved metal cover. Spoon doesn't fit in a bookcase, and is not sturdy enough to leave out on a table. Upon a few passes through, this book that cost $75, began to fall apart. If a guest picks it up I have to tell them to be careful, so as not to rip it. Spoon catches on some knit surfaces and is sure to scratch your bookcase if it is made of wood.The form of the book is nice, and could have worked nicely if one of the designers featured inside worked on the outside packaging. Spoon nests on your lap when opened thanks to the wave shape of the cover, then it slips off thanks to the nature of the material and its protective coating.It should have had a soft but durable cover with more welcoming lighter materials.

The Twilight of the Clans series has been excellent so far, and this book is the best one yet! I think that this book has an excellent amount of intriugiing politics, character developments, and intense Mech' battles. I love Victor Davion, and this book only made him more of a hero in my eyes. He is a true leader, perhaps along with Theodore Kurtia and Candace Liao, the only sane leaders left in the Inner Sphere. Katherine is a treacherous, insane dog, Sun-Tzu is a minipulative weasel, and Thomas Marik is just plain stupid! Especially for sheltering the Word of Blake from the justice that they deserve. The new Star Leauge is not too concrete, but with the Clans stopped, they might stand a chance(along with a few choice assasinations).

The Clans are so much more Advanced, has the Inner Sphere caught up that quickly? The Trial of Refusal on the Invasion could have been a whole novel in its self. Then came the second half! There was twist after twist that just kept you guessing. A lot of politics were played out, but that is the other half of the whole Battletech Universe, and it left you asking, &quot;What will happen next?&quot;. Michael Stackpole is definately one of the best when it comes to the Batteltech Universe."},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"In this book, number seven of the Twilight of the Clans, the Inner Sphere has destroyed Clan Smoke Jaguar to the point where only a handful of warriors remained to escape to Strana Mechty, the Clan homeworld. Determined to not let them escape, Prince Victor Stiener-Davion leads his forces there to stop the invasion once and for all. There's very little actual combat in this book, but a lot of interesting things happen. For one, Clan Ghost Bear, the most powerful of all the clans, announces that it is switching from a Crusader Clan to a Warden Clan. Also, when Victor &amp; crew return home to the Inner Sphere after soundly beating all the Crusaders but Clan Wolf and Clan Jade Falcon, Victor discovers that his sister Katrina hasn't been idle in the 1 1/2 years that he's been gone, and has managed to take control of the entire FedCom! Left without a realm, Victor has little to do, but you can be sure he won't let Katrina get away with the theft.

The first half is unfortunately predictable but carried well, as nothing else could have really happened. The second half is nonstop Stackpole, as if the best parts of the Warrior trilogy (with its huge surprise at the end) and 'Assumption' and 'Bred for War' were re-enacted. I would like to fuel speculation that the main character of the post-'Heritage of Kerensky' trilogy Stackpole novels is actually the 'Assassin'. What would really be neat is for him to go to the Clans and become their leader..."},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"Victor and gang (Operation Bulldog/TaskForce Serpent finally reach the Clan homeworld of Strana Mechty and battle it out in a Trial of Refusal. This leads to an overload of uninspired chapters in the first half of the book describing various unit's battles with each other, almost blow by blow. I know what Stackpole was trying to do, and in theory it was a good idea, but in execution it was a tough read. I think Stackpole was trying to give everyone's favorite clan/unit/warrior a showing in what was arguably the most important battle in BattleTech history (at least since Tukkayid); what we ended up with was kind of mechanical and dull. Oh well, it was worth it once the fighting was over!What I've always liked best about Stackpole's BattleTech writings are the political and social action, and boy he delivers as expected. The Dancing Joker (the assasin/terrorist of earlier novels) makes an appearance, Katherine (aka Katrina) is in rare form, and Victor has some major surprises waiting for him.A must read if you're going to follow the &quot;main&quot; BT story line."},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"A good book. Not the best from Stackpole, but it does show that he continues to be THE BEST writer in the BattleTech series/universe. The beginning chapters describe various battles in a Trial with the Clans, and, while obligatory to any BattleTech novel, they seemed a bit too much at once, and a bit forced. Stackpole's done better battle scenes; however once the mech combat is out of the way, Stackpole's true genius comes out, and it's what makes him my favorite BT author. The political manuevering in the second half of the book is vintage Stackpole, and well worth the read. The Inner Sphere will never be the same! &lt;g&gt;"},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"I would tend to agree with the previous reviewer who stated Mr. Stackpole's writing is rather weak in this book, but it isn't his writing as much as the plot. When one reads the &quot;Warrior&quot; trilogy or the first three of book about the return of the clans, the plot is very complex with many loosely connected storylines. Mr. Stackpole's last three battletech books are not anywhere near as complex and interesting as his previous works. Is it his writing or is it the maker of the game responsible for this change???"},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"While this is not Stackpole's best work in the Battletech Universe (that's still the Warrior series in my opinion), this is another solid entry for him. The plot is clear, but at the same time does take some twists and turns to surprise you. It's very good, if not his best. My only criticisms would be that the battle scenes are a bit too long and too dense, and that the climax is just a bit too over the top. That being said, I enjoyed it, and can hardly wait for Stackpole to return to the Inner Sphere."},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"Lest anyone should doubt, Stackpole is the best when it comes to outlining the history of Battletech - which is as it should be, considering it's officially his job. I will not say PoH is his best effort, because it's not. As far as plot and action and story and character development and all, Grave Covenant was its superior. PoH shows an unfortunate tendancy - which occurs all too often in this genre, IMO - to start slow and then rush madly at the very end to draw the book to its finish. This has left some dangling plot threads, and prematurely cut off some others. One big instance is his almost deus ex machina takeover of the FedCom by Katharine - in the hurry to accomplish this and get to something else, the scenario by which Katherine manages the feat is rather implausible and certainly distasteful. Because of things like this, one believes maybe this book should have been accomplished it two parts rather than just the one cover. But that said, the power and quality of PoH still makes it an invaluable contribution to the series. Politics in the world of Battletech has been set on its ear, and it may never be the same again. And it's been done only as Stackpole could do it. Here's hoping the next episode is not long in coming, for we are seriously in need of resolution. For some things, anyway ... regardZ, JvS!

And to be perfectly honest after having read the other 41 novels, too, I can say that &quot;Prince of Havoc&quot; is the best one so far. The Jags are drowned in their own blood and cruelty, the Clan Invasion has ended (at least as long as the Wolfs and Jade Falcons are busy) and the Inner Sphere has radically changed. The role of being the bad guys has shifted from House Liao to House Steiner (thanks to Katherine Steiner's blood-thirst I can live with that - as a native Kraut). Michael Stackpole has managed to maintain such a high level of tension and incredible surprises and changes throughout the entire storyline, I can hardly wait for the story to be contiuned!Let's just hope that we do not have to wait too long!"},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"I genuinely enjoyed reading Prince of Havoc, I still pick it up and re-read it every once in awhile. But the problem is BattleTech has changed. I remember reading the &quot;old-school&quot; books, the Warrior series, Wolves on the Border, Heir to the Dragon, and so on. BattleTech had a &quot;cyberpunk&quot; feel to it. Things were industrial and dirty, the machines everyone depended on were irreplacable and unreliable. I could have pictured a character wearing dirty clothes with oil stains walking down a dark alley with a big Stersnacht strapped to his side. But now, things are going towards the &quot;space opera,&quot; like Star Trekkish. Things are never desperate. The cavalry always arrives (in this case Victor Steiner-Davion) to save the day. It used to be that in conflicts the winner still loses in the sense that whatever he lost cannot be regained. But now conflicts are big and the good guys always win without much cost (the lost machines and technology is now replaceable). I remember in Heir to the Dragon, I could feel Theodore Kurita's fear of bieng assassinated by his father. But now all of the characters don't have this fear and all the factions of the Inner Sphere are &quot;happy.&quot; Maybe that's why I don't really play BTech anymore (and if I do it's a Periphery Campaign), I just read the novels. Fading Suns, now that's a RPG with a true &quot;fallen empire&quot; feel with retrograde technology! You can guess what I play now."},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"The Smoke Jaguar clan faces certain doom in this novel, with the combined might of the Inner Sphere bearing down on them. The clan's homeworld is lost, and with it all existence of the clan except for the the surviving Ikhan Osis. Guns and politics sums this thrilling novel up very nicely. The beginning of the books throws you into the mix of a Trial of Refusal for the clan's right to invade the Inner Sphere. Victor Davion, supreme commander of the Inner Sphere task force now faces the finest warriors the clans have to offer, but will he and his warriors survive the confrontation? The latter part of the book you learn of Victor's evil sister and that she has annexed his realm and stripped him of his power. The following politics further the story beyond belief but sometimes bore the reader with it's long winded speeches and hidden meanings, and complex anaolgies. Long time readers will like this book than first timers, but this book still proves the mastery of storytelling the Battletech authors have. I reccomend this book to anyone who a slight intrest or any intrest at all in Mech Warrior and Battletech to read this book. There are plenty of combat sequences that do not always favor the good guys. In closing, this book does deserve the 5 stars but the one star I took off is for the lengthy politics near the end, sometimes boring the reader. &quot; A Warrior needs a war&quot;"},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"This book has what I call a hard hitting storyline, that kind of leaves the reader wanting more but the books ends on a note of continued in next book feeling.This book is just what I like from Stackpole.It hits you hard between the eyes and says take that because I have more to beat you with."},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"More and more evidence of total bungling on the part of FASA. I am certainly never going to run any campaigns in the post-3060 universe...way too many unbelivable plot twists, with absolutly no thought given to such ideas as believability."},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"I would tend to agree with the previous reviewer who stated Mr. Stackpole's writing is rather weak in this book, but it isn't his writing as much as the plot. When one reads the &quot;Warrior&quot; trilogy or the first three of book about the return of the clans, the plot is very complex with many loosely connected storylines. Mr. Stackpole's last three battletech books are not anywhere near as complex and interesting as his previous works. Is it his writing or is it the maker of the game responsible for this change???"},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"This book was extremely disappointing. Besides being the typical Michael Stackpole style of 1% mech action and 99% boring politics of the inner sphere, this book felt like somebody said &quot;I'm bored with the Clans, let's get rid of them and start something else&quot;. The casual way that the inner sphere defeats the Clans to stop the invasion left me thinking that Stackpole or maybe FASA just want to end it. So what are the Clans to do now??? Their whole reason for being has melted away, and with barely a tremble from the khans. This book just doesn't jib with the BattleTech universe. Skip it!"},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"The Inner Sphere is suffering.Due to long running contractual disputes, Michael A. Stackpole ceased writing for the Battletech Universe (and the Star Wars Uni, on a side note) after this novel.It was a blow to the series.I think it is fair to say (and I speak as one of Mr.S's greatest fans) that this novel is not his best. At least the first half isnt. He really picks it back up in the second part, with his famous swashbuckling style of writing politics, action and intrigue, giving all you want and more from a series as rich and vibrant, as deep and inmence as Battletech.The first half is by no means a write off (pun-tastic!), but it is a little below Mr. Stackpole's high standard. It is almost completly, a combat scene. Now I realise that the same can be said of the brilliant volume 3 of \\"The Blood of Kerensky\\", \\"Lost Destiny\\", but this time, it is all just a little too familiar.Anyway, I still rate this a 5 star, as it is yet another stepping stone in the BTech Uni, a uni which is an absolute masterpiece in sci-fi.Get this.But get this last, after you have worked your way up through his others. Start with \\"The Blood of Kerensky\\" trilogy, if you're unsure. Then lock your door, throw out the phone, and enjoy..."},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"I was always a Stackpole fan. It was his books that started me on the series and his that still make me amazed when I read them. His sheer detail and vivid action scenes should be a watermark for all other writers. But in this, his latest and likely last Battletech book, something is missing. Creativity. His actions scenes, which could have been incredible, are instead canned and unispired. If you want to read a battletech book for the action, look elsewhere. If you want to read about the deep story line of Battletch, then read this book. That it does do."},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"Twilight of the Clans VII: Prince of Havoc continues the long running storyline that Michael Stackpole and others have established in the Battletech Universe. It is an outstanding book and definately worth reading whether your a Battletech fan or just looking for a classic High-Tech heroes vs. villains book. Stackpole manages to punctuate the finish of long running Star League invasion of the Clan homeworlds, and set the stage for the furture of the Battletech Universe all in this single book. Prince of Havoc is an epic which spans the entire known universe and features the regular cast of characters without being singularly trite. Like I said before, this book is definately worth reading."},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"This book was awesome, but is hard to completely explain without giving away what happens. For those of you who follow the Battletech series, you'll love this book and will be surprised by the ending. (Especially if your &quot;loyalties&quot; lie to Victor Davion.) All I can say is that it's a great book worthy of Stackpole's reputaion."},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"When I got this book in my mail I started reading it at once and did not stop until I read the last page. The story is really dense with many surprises. The only sad thing is: it is too short, especially for that storyline. There was enough for at least two books in it. I just can't wait until the sequel comes out. If you don't know Battletech you'll like this book. If you like Battletech (as I do) you'll love this book. Anyway, go ahead and add it to your shopping cart. You won't be disappointed. Great book!"},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"I've always enjoyed Stackpole's Battletech book, and I was awfully excited when I picked up this most recent addition to the collection. Imagine my surprise when the first half turned out to be the most uninspired piece of work I've ever seen by Stackpole (maybe even from anyone in the Battletech universe). The rest of the Clan conflicts read like it was computer generated from a turn-by-turn playing of the board-game itself. Characters have absolutely no development or depth, and it is essentially a list of the various shots each unit fired with the resulting effect. The second half of the book offers some salvation with interesting plot twists, and the writing certainly improves."},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"I may be a bit biased by the fact that I've read most of the Battletech Series, but I liked it, there's not quite as much to do with polotics early in the book, but later on, political intregue builds up. It's got some suprises that you may not expect. Also it's combat is fast a furious, which is a trademark of this series."},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"An incredible addition to the battleTech universe.

I think that in terms of the battletech universe this is a good book but in terms of stackpole's writing this is kind of lacking. He's a great author and I've just come to expect better of him. Of course he didn't have much to work with since most of the action was done early on."},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"This abomination truly would deserve nothing more than -5 stars. Stackpole and FASA have apparently decided, that the only way to advance the plot is to shake it up, each time with more &quot;surprising twists&quot;.Their latest bungling has resulted in neutralizing the clans, recreating the STAR LEAGUE (for gods sake... The whole mythical &quot;grail&quot; of BT accomplished with few cheap words.) and virtually eliminating all conflict between houses Davion and Kurita.The whole TOTC-series was yet another colossal mistake on FASAs part, the final one for me.

The culmination of a several-year story arc and the Twilight of the Clans series, no BattleTech fan should be without &quot;Prince of Havoc&quot; -- and the nail-biting conclusion is guaranteed to leave the reader awestruck."},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"This book definiatly is a grat topping for the Twilight of teh Clans series. It not only deals with the halting of the Smoke Jaguars, but with the recnt deaths of Morgan Hasek-Davion and Melissa Stiener-Davion. However, if want to see Stackpole's best, dont read this book.

However this is still one the best series I have ever read."},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"As a fan of the Battletech series, I was totally engrossed in this book. While the action was a little hard to follow at times, it was sufficient. What really grabbed me was the intrigue that has become Mr. Stackpole's hallmark in this series. The character development is phenomenal, to the point I take an interest in even minor characters like Curaitis and the assassin. The Byzantine intrigue, snappy dialogue, and rich attention to characters marks this book as a great read."},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"I have read all of the Twlight of The Clans novels and this one brings a new twist. Yes Battletech is mostly about Wars in Mechs but the political environment has a great influence on why they are fighting in the first place.

Prince of Havoc continues his fine tradition of political intrigue with twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat and make the novel almost impossible to put down. I cant wait to see want develops in his future novels (especially considering how PoH finished). All I hope for is that Katherine gets exactly what's coming to her. The only criticism of the novel I have is that it could have extended over two novels, with some of the events that were only described in passing getting a more detailed desciption. But perhaps these events will be covered in future novels."},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"The story was good, but aside from wondering what happened since the last book there wasn't much to keep me reading.

I was fairly dissappointed with Michael Stackpole's bland discription of Battles at least compared to his other books I have read. This book is still a definite must have, due to the sweeping change in Inner Sphere and Clan Poltics. If you don't pick this one up, Your definitely going to be left wondering &quot;what happened?&quot; later in the BattleTech universe.

His wrtitng style and consistecy has kept me coming back year after year."},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"This book is certainly not the best science fiction novel on market, but there are certainly worse books as well. The main characters are well-developed, especially those that are a part of the military, instead of the \\"let's kill everything in sight\\" variety that all too often make up the majority of the cast in many science-fiction novels. They make valid decisions appropriate to their intellect and are of varying shades of gray, instead of the also common and worn out concept of black and white. Another one of the better elements of the book is the technology. Many science fiction authors make the mistake of not researching the technology, making it unrealistic and taking a lot of the enjoyment out of the book. Things must make sense! Things like atomic bombs blowing up asteroids, aliens that have the same physiology as people and can easily be operated on by any surgeon. The list is very long and I not going to go further than that. In this book, however, they simply divert asteroids. The faster than light travel element is accomplished through worm-holes, one of the three ways of going faster than light thought possible by physicists. The plot, although resting on the solid foundation of good characters, is lacking. Many of the plot elements are apparently driven by undeveloped side characters, such as Tsun-Zhu Laio and the Precentor Marshall. The main characters do react well to things, but some of the events just make no sense. Katrina supposedly seizes Victor's realm through polling the populace. How can someone possibly invade by asking questions? The worst part of the book is definitely the combat sequences. The novel is written in the universe of Battletech, a board game developed in 1984 and the combat sequences sound like a play log from said game. They are dull, with no hint of excitement whatsoever. To recap, while the characters are well written and human, the rest of the book is dull and predictable. So if you read Battletech novels, or really need something to read, go ahead and read this. But otherwise, don't bother."},{"Title":"Battletech 42: Prince of Havoc: Twilight of the Clans VII (Battletech)","review":"Stackpole shows true talent in his writing to combine warfare intercantly with politics.

Prince of Havok was devided into to parts, similer to how Grave Covenant was divided up. with the diffrance that the first part was the campaign against the clans and the latter part with the Byzantine Intrigue.

Michael Stackpole is a master at character development and intrigue as apparent in his first (and in my opinion better written) foray into the Twilight of the Clans Series and the second half of this book, but he should really try to minimize the combat scenes in his novels. The battle scenes almost put me to sleep. I felt like I was reading a play-by-play of two guys playing the Battletech board game. It seemed like every laser and missile hit was discussed. Definantely uncalledfor. It had a remarkable second half, once it got into politics and intrigue. The second half of the book deserves 4 stars, the first deserves 2.

Hatty became so 'Dickens-like' in her cheerful suffering that I wanted to gag, and the antagonists were also crosses between those found in Bronte and Dickens and not Austen-like at all. Aiken seemed to abandon wit and good humor for pathos and melo-drama. I hope she will not continue on this vein in her future Austen ventures. Aiken is VERY gifted and readable, so it is easy to forgive her for &quot;The Youngest Miss Ward.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Youngest Miss Ward","review":"I found this latest book of Joan Aiken's to be a very enjoyable one, with many references to characters and events in Mansfield Park, and an excellent portrayal of the early nineteenth century. For the entire first half or more I was quite caught up in the heroine's life and that of the whole cast of unusual characters, many of which seem to be right out of an Austin novel. It was with some chagrin when I realized, toward the end, that Hattie (the youngest Miss Ward of the title), had slipped into the &quot;Goody Goody&quot; mode, and was becoming somewhat insipid. I mean, really, she goes around solving everyone's problems, and taking all kinds of abuse with never a frown, but is always cheerful and helpful to a fault. The other characters have also fallen into rather neat groups of villians and good guys. However, this would not really have bother me, had the ending not been as it was. I don't wish to give anything away, so I won't comment on the obvious flaws and lack of continuity in many of the storylines and characters. However, some may not be as troubled by the ending or the character of the heroine , and, if interested in this period of history, will certainly enjoy reading The Youngest Miss Ward."},{"Title":"The Youngest Miss Ward","review":"This purports to chronicle the hard-times of Harriet Ward, the fourth Ward sister; intimidated by Mrs. Norris, the narrator of Mansfield Park left her out. The woes of Fanny Price pale in comparison.I would ignore the attempted connection to Jane Austen, which I view simply as a marketing ploy. The book has nothing like her wit and has little to do with Mansfield Park, except for background mentions of the doings of the older Ward sisters.This is a historical novel, not a Regency romance, indeed there is very little romance. It belongs to the school of historical woe, finding the past harsh and cruel rather than glamorous. For my taste, it it carried rather to the point of melodrama, more like Dickens perhaps than Austen. It is possible that all of these things could have happened to one young girl in the space of about 8 years. Indeed, there are a number of real people whose seemingly undeserved and unrelenting bad luck make one question the existence of divine justice, but it doesn't necessarily make for an effective novel. Aiken does bring in some interesting complexity as the characters ponder the wisdom and ultimate consequences of unrelentingly idealistic behavior.Oddly enough, although this book apparently starts in the final months of the American Revolution, none of the characters, not even those emigrating to Pennsylvania and Maryland, seem to notice this event. They aren't going to English colonies, they are going to the newly formed United States of America!Not a bad novel, but not something to inspire me to read more Jane Aiken either."},{"Title":"The Youngest Miss Ward","review":"Those who have read and meditated on the themes and events of Mansfield Park by Jane Austen may find this off-shoot by Joan Aiken to be rather intriguing. While the ending may seem a bit forced, the characterizations and the obvious depth of knowledge of the historical period make this enjoyable reading.The most interesting contrast in the book was that of Lady Ursula, well situated in the class structure but not able to cope with the consequences of her choices, and Harriet Ward, the quintessential poor relation who is better equipped to cope with life's vagaries. The novel provides more food for thought than one might otherwise anticipate."},{"Title":"The Youngest Miss Ward","review":"I found the first 300 or so pages most enjoyable. If you don't read the book as a Jane Austen sequel but rather a stand alone it is most entertaining. UNFORTUNATELY where you wanted this book to go or at the least thought this book would go it didn't. It was almost like Ms. Aiken was cautioned nearing the end of the book she only had 1/2 hour left to finish. So she did giving it no thought. She didn't care that the reader would feel robbed. So sad - I really enjoyed her writing. HOWEVER I will give Ms. Aiken a second chance. Hopefully she will not dissapoint as I really want to like her books, her writing intrigues me."},{"Title":"The Youngest Miss Ward","review":"I believe people would not be so harsh in the reviews of this book if it stood on its own merits and did not beg to be compared with Jane Austen. Joan Aiken is more known for her gothic Romances than a writer in the style of Jane Austin. This book definately has some of the Gothic motifs with sickly abnormal-hidden away children, love relationships frustrated and in the end unfulfilled, fires etc. Jane loved a happy ending of sorts with the heroine happily attached to the man of her desire. Joan doesn't give us this. Instead she quickly ties things up in the end by pairing the heroine up with someone else. It just did not tie up as neatly as Jane would have done it.When you pick up a Jane Austen novel you expect to be dazzled with turns of phrases and wit that stuns you. You expect to reread passages and marvel at how that is just the perfect way to express something. Joan does not capture this essence of a Jane Austen style novel. She interjects some beautiful poetic couplets and stanzas. She also creates a plausible character and add an interesting layer to the whole Mansfield Park story. I mean I felt like \\"It could have happened that way\\" after reading the book.There is one part of the book that seemed altogether implausible to me though. Joan has the character Fannie Price ( who in both the Novel Mansfield Park and this one, is always imposing upon the mercy of her relatives for financial or other assistance) send a letter refusing to accept any more financial assistance from Hattie due to her embarrassing marriage to a butler. She gives as the reason that her other two sisters have told her she must for Fanny's sake and the family's good name. I believe in reality it would be more realistic for her to have continued to accept the assistance when it was sent.I believe this book would not suffer such bad reviews if the readers' appetites were not prejudiced to expect another MANSFIELD PARK or PRIDE AND PREJUDICE."},{"Title":"The Youngest Miss Ward","review":"This book is a sorry disappointment coming from a talented authoress like Miss Aiken. The lpot is not true to Miss Austen at all, and not a whit of it leads to the plot, structure, theme, language or depth of &quot;Mansfiedl Park&quot;. And like all Janeites out ther, let me point out that the youngest Miss Ward's first name is not Harriet (Hatty); it's actually Frances (Fanny). Our Heroine in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; is Fanny Price, and she is the eldest daughter, and in true Jane Austen fashion, the eldest daughters and sons are usually named for the parents. A disappointemnt indeed, a far cry from what Miss Austen conceptualised."},{"Title":"The Youngest Miss Ward","review":"I get something new out of it every time. I love Joan Aiken, and this novel is one of my favorites. The text sparkles, it's witty, the characters are all unique and eccentric and charming in their own ways, and the heroine is one of Aiken's best."},{"Title":"The Youngest Miss Ward","review":"I am a long-time Austen fan-though not one of Stephanie Barron, whose footnotes I find endlessly annoying. I found myself wanting to throw this novel away halfway through, when Hatty was being falsely accused of all that nonsense. Blah, blah, blah. I decided to persevere, and found it interesting, though as others remark, too, too Dickensian.But that ending!!! WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT? What a let-down! Ending up with Godwit? Pullease! It certainly made Camber look even more an idealistic fool than before. And that letter with the reference to Hatty dying young--why even include that? We all would rather just have her drift away as part of that time period without being forced to contemplate mortality. And why that letter from the present anyway? Takes away all the 18th Century, pre-Regency atmosphere. Unnecessary and stoopid!"},{"Title":"The Youngest Miss Ward","review":"The Youngest Ward is an okay book - not too interesting, but interesting enough to not be able to put it down for another book. The book focuses on Harriet Ward who suffers abuse wherever she goes. The novel takes place during the 1700s. Harriet is 12 when she is forced to go live with her aunt and uncle because she dared to drop her sister's toiletries while climbing the steps. Her mother is too ill to prevent the departure. At her aunt and uncle's house, she is treated nicely by her aunt but brusquely by her uncle. There she meets Lord Camber with whom she falls in love. The love story is not pushed upon the reader because of physical distance. Lord Camber decides to go to America to set up a colony and this distance causes the focus to be on Harriet and how she is sent to different abodes. Her uncle kicks her out of his home because of Harriet's \\"impropriety\\" of walking alone with the Lord. She returns to her home to find out that her mother has died and her father has remarried the evil Ursula, who is a cousin of Harriet's. Harriet does have her proposal though; her cousin, Sydney, keeps proposing to Harriet, but Sydney is not a good person so Harriet keeps rebuffing him. Ursula decides to send Harriet to Ursula's former home to work as a governess for her two younger sisters. The environment there is grim and Harriet struggles to educate the two sisters who are quite dim. Although Harriet's life is grim and lonely, she does find solace in writing poetry.I recommend this book because the trials and tribulations endured by Harriet and her quiet way of rising above her environment and finding personal fulfillment is riveting. The reader keeps wondering where will Harriet end up. I also like the fact that the requisite love story is kept to a bare minimum. There will be a sad twist to this particular story that is wrenching. However, Harriet seems to be aware that life is about enduring suffering and finding solace from within and that the solution to suffering is to find self-fulfillment in an activity that one loves."},{"Title":"Five strides on the banked track;: The life and times of the roller derby","review":"If you were a fan of the original Roller Derby--and not Roller Games, or what it turned into--this is the book to find.

I recommend it highly to every Indian. It clearly shows the manner in which our greedy politicians have used religion and caste as agents to fill their coffers and make them more powerful.

From that, I learned of the Carolina Israelite and reveled in its humor and so out-of-the-box thinking. Consider the vertical integration plan just one example. Due to much pleading in a car with my parents and five siblings the following summer, my dad was forced to side-trip into Charlotte, give me a chance to call to see if I could meet Mr. Golden, and drive me to his office for the approved meeting. Mr. Golden welcomed me from behind his desk, in his trademark rocking chair and smoking his trademark cigar.We shared a few letters after that, and I was saddened when he died. Only then did I pick up The Right Time and learn more fully of this man's rich life. In a time of trouble in which we find ourselves now, the book is as reassuring as Churchill's speech to Harrow in 1941. Here is a man who lost all, who was sent to the federal pen for stock fraud in 1929, who paid his debt to society, moved from NYC to Charlotte, started over again, and redeemed himself in the eyes of all.

Rudy and Christina made a world of their own in upstate New York, with drinks at five culminating their respective day of creative work. What an enviable life--and what sorrow for Christina once Rudy is gone. In some ways this reminded me of Joan Didion's Year of Magical Thinking, another book that celebrates a collaborative couple, and explores the grief endured by the first one left behind."},{"Title":"Evenings at Five","review":"I can't say more than the previous reviews have said. This is one of those books that I would force myself to lay aside for a little while just so I wouldn't finish it too quickly. In the hands of numerous other writers, it would have come across as sentimental glop, but this was obviously the story of a woman who has lost her soul partner, lover and friend and there is nothing sentimental about it - just true.I DO think someone should sue The Library Journal - on this page and several other places I have looked for this book to buy, I have seen their blurb: \\"Now that her composer husband is dead, Christina dreads \\"evenings at five\\"-the hour that the couple set aside for heart-to-hearts.\\" and it really irritates me. It give no indication of the beauty of this book...\\"dreads\\"? \\"heart-to-hearts\\"? This isn't what I came away with..."},{"Title":"Evenings at Five","review":"An author and a composer have a daily ritual. Every evening at five o'clock, they begin with Happy Hour; they then share their love of language and music along with their cocktails. This tradition is so much a part of their lives that it's only natural that its absence would leave a huge hole in the author's heart when her companion dies.Author Gail Godwin had similar experiences, and has commemorated these traditions and moments by fictionalizing an account, which she has added to a series of additional short stories about her alter-ego Christina.In these stories, we meet Christina at various crossroads in her life, and woven in with these \\"flashback\\" type portrayals are more moments between \\"Christina and Rudy.\\"A provocative read,Evenings at Five: A Novel and Five New Stories (Ballantine Reader's Circle)is a reminder that we must cherish our moments with our loved ones, because when they are gone, the memories of those moments could sustain us.I deducted one star, as sometimes the story's back and forth movements was confusing, and I had to stop a moment to figure out where the characters were--the past or the present."},{"Title":"Evenings at Five","review":"Gail Godwin's thin EVENINGS AT FIVE is a fictionalized tribute to her companion of thirty years, composer Robert Starer who died in 2001. The characters are Christina, a writer of fiction, a \\"cradle Episcopalian\\"; Rudy, who is Jewish, a composer, a polyglot, and tad arrogant; and Bud, whom this most gifted writer describes in one point in the narrative as a \\"neatly folded cat.\\" Every evening-- hence the title-- at five sharp (\\"punctuality is the courtesy of kings\\") the couple-- she on the black leather sofa that the Siamese cats had destroyed and he in his Stickley chair-- had drinks and discussed how their respective days had gone. Seven months after his unexpected death-- even though Rudy was ill, they both believed they had more time together-- Christina is trying to put the pieces of her life back together as she answers letters of condolence, attends church, leans on friends, in short, the things that grieving persons do to get them through the period that Emily Dickinson described as that \\"awful leisure.\\"To say that Ms. Godwin writes about something universal is trite beyond words since all of us at some point will, again in Ms. Dickinson's beautifully sad words, be \\"sweeping up the heart.\\" We expect someone of Godwin's talent to write eloquently about the loss of a companion, a subject that so many authors of her generation have written about recently: Calvin Trillin (ABOUT ALICE), John Bayley (ELEGY FOR IRIS) and Joan Didion (THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING). Then there are writers like Mark Doty (HEAVEN'S COAST) who did not have the luxury of even as long a time together as Ms. Godwin and Mr. Starer had since Doty lost his lover to AIDS before the advent of the new life-sustaining drugs."},{"Title":"Evenings at Five","review":"As I began this read I was intriqued by the two characters that were being presented to me. Two artists, one gifted with music and one gifted with words, merging together as one. Within the creases of the words that I read, I could feel the unity and the respect these two souls had one for another.As I continued on, I could feel the absence as the one soul is taken on to their eternal destiny leaving the other to exist alone, or is she?&quot;Evenings At Five&quot; is a look at continuing love after death. It is the heart of a soul that clings to not just the memory but the lingering essence of a love that will never die.It is a reminder to cherish the moments we have with those we love and to know within ourselves that despite the physical absence the joining of hearts can never be separated. A deep meaningful read, well worth your time.Shirley Johnson/Senior ReviewerMidWest Book ReviewDenise's Pieces"},{"Title":"Evenings at Five","review":"This is one of the sweetest love story I have ever read. It is sad, and poignant, and funny, and sweet.Listening to the tape in Gail Godwin's beautiful voice is an experience I won't soon forget."},{"Title":"Evenings at Five","review":"I was caught by the cover and pencil drawings, but once inside, I felt trapped. I've been that route of grieving myself, and it didn't ring true. It had an elitist, and narcisstic tone to it.And why did the author bother to disguise it as fiction, and touch so lightly on the alchoholism?I found the rememdy for grief was to turn outward, not inward."},{"Title":"Evenings at Five","review":"It doesn't take readers of Evenings at Five too long before they realize that this book was written as an homage and in memory of the author's recently deceased partner. Gail Godwin in her secretly veiled memoir has crafted a fine novel about love, compassion, loss and the human spirit to move on.The title of the book Evenings at Five refers to that time of day when Christina, an author and Rudy a composer would meet for drinks. Cocktails for this twosome are a ritual each evening at five, they even have special names for the knives they use to cut the lemons and limes. This special hour at their home includes lively conversations about how that spent their days on their individual projects, their plans for trips and their futures together. They never anticipated Rudy's premature death and now Christina spends her evenings at five thinking about her time spent with Rudy and her future alone.While this book is poignant and very sad at times, the reader finishes the last pages content that Christina as well as Gail Godwin has had a fulfilling relationship and an amazing love. And because of this she will be able to move on, perhaps a bit sadder,but complete in the knowledge of what they have had. And as the author intended it is a fitting book to be written by an excellent author about the man she dearly loved who did die two years ago.I do recommend this book to those who love,to those who have loved and those who hope to love. As the saying goes,&quot;'Tis better to have loved and lost, then never to have loved at all.&quot; Evening at Five certainly proves this adage to be true."},{"Title":"Evenings at Five","review":"Because life is rarely without loss and grief, this slim novel may have wide appeal. However, this reader feels that the persons most attracted to and affected by \\"Evenings at Five\\" would have to be spouses for whom grief is still new, raw and ever present.It is amazing how so few words can so richly convey Christina's aching feelings. The simplicity of the book lies in the scarcity of words and the simple and stark pen drawings of the very articles that serve as constant reminders and reinforce the piercing emptiness and grief. A favorite tumbler; a metronome that is an integral tool to Rudy's composing skills; a richly-grained wooden chair with a beautiful, tapestried pillow; an answering machine with Rudy's voice that Christina cannot bring herself to erase.The chair keeps cropping up because Rudy, as his disease progressed, required sitting in an upright position and was probably all the more visible because of his forced confinement. Drawings, too, of the living room and descriptions of how they sat in proximity to one another, emphasize their closeness. They were woven together as a couple, as best friends, as collaborators in the co-creation of their home and individual work spaces...she an author...he a composer.Christina chronicles her pain without being mawkish. No matter where she turns, the memories are present and what makes the agony still worse is that on the night of Rudy's death, she had unsuspectingly left to return home and was reading as Rudy was dying. Sadly, she recalls that she will never be able to read that author again. No matter how many moments were spent together, from their grand passion when they first met, to the quieter times, the intimacy that grew over the years, there was never enough because it's now all gone...forever! It cannot be re-created.Religion is of some comfort to Christina, as are some friends, one of whom zeroes in on her drinking but it is in the seeking and in the finding of her own way that Christina can continue. And there are no easy answers, no and \\"she lived happily ever after\\". The final passage contains comforting words from Rudy, one of many things Christina recalls that he said. Memories are blissful, funny, poignant and pierce like a weapon!This is undoubtedly one of the most intimate books I have read on grief and loss. There are many on how to deal with grief; how to become financially capable; how to resume dating; how to tell children about the death of their parent but this one is truly unique in its ability to deal with the simple, pure aching that occurs when a loved one with whom one has shared so much is removed from one's life. It is like major surgery with no anesthesia during the surgery or painkillers to dull the agony following the procedure!"},{"Title":"Evenings at Five","review":"Heart-breaking yet comforting -- exquisitely written, perfectly structured, emotionally precise. The illustrations poignantly echo the writing. I am buying extra copies for friends and family."},{"Title":"Evenings at Five","review":"A good little book that is well-written and beautifully crafted into a story with resonance for anyone who has lost a love to death. Provides a peak into a woman's day-to-day grief and into a life lived well together by two people. Sometimes sad, always poignant, Evenings At Five moves the reader to feel the void death leaves and to hear the voices that remain. It leaves you asking how much time is ever enough with your life's love."},{"Title":"Evenings at Five","review":"Gail Godwin, one of my all-time favorite authors, lost her long-time companion, composer Robert Starer, before writing this book as a tribute to him and their relationship. It is, in a word: Perfect.For anyone who has ever felt unbearable grief, or for anyone who has felt the same measure of real love, this book is a tribute to the best of the human spirit. I was lucky enough to have listened to the Audio version, which is read by the author herself, and her lightly southern-tinged pleasant voice adds a measure of poignancy she may or may not have intended.The fictional characters, Rudi and Christine, an author and a composer, live a life rich in every way, from their afternoon cocktail hour (preceded by a phone call from \\"Cope Paul,\\" Rudi's fictional pontiff who urges them to have a drink) to their wide and wonderful collection of shared jokes, memories, people and most of all words...rich tapestries of words. Rudi is multi-lingual, and Christine is her willing foil.It sounds like it was the perfect relationship we all want and need, and its loss it made all the more so by the way Christine's reaction to her unspeakable loss.A truly beautiful book; I only wish I had seen the drawings that accompany the text, and will make sure I buy the book as well as the recording."},{"Title":"Evenings at Five","review":"I love Gail Godwin's clean, specific prose, and her thinly disguised (according to what I've read elsewhere) story of loss touched me. Her literate examination of (always imperfect) love is a joy, and I was surprised by how much I also embraced the collection of \\"Christina\\" stories in the latter half of this collection."},{"Title":"Evenings at Five","review":"What do Pope John Paul, a serrated knife fondly known as Ralph, and a bottle of gin have in common? Artfully, with humor and tenderness, Gail Godwin weaves the Pope, Ralph, and Bombay Sapphire gin into a loving testament.Every evening at five, Rudy builds his wife a drink with loving precision. and announces that &quot;the Pope has called.&quot; Rudy is a composer and hears music; Christina is a writer lost in a world of words. But somehow, despite their differences, for 28 years their marriage works. When Rudy dies, his formidable presence no longer holds center stage in Christina's life. The gifted linguist and world traveller with a mellifluous voice &quot;one octave below God's&quot; is gone. Stripped of his presence, Christina is reduced to drinking her gin alone and conversing with Rudy's chair every evening at five.It's Christina's recollections of Rudy that makes Evenings at Five a standout. She reads his appointment diaries, kept through their years together, reliving the chronicle of his life. She listens to his music, composed one note on top of another until he reached a glorious symmetry - much like their life together. His is a powerful and lingering presence that defies death.Christina's memories are a delightful read, despite the sobering subject. Ms. Godwin's skill as best selling wordsmith proves itself once again in this latest book. Evenings at Five transcends death and loss, guiding each reader to an individual finale."},{"Title":"Evenings at Five","review":"I can't say much more about this book. This book is probably way over my head but the point of the story touches me deeply. I mean we all have to face our loved ones leaving this world without us and to be with someone for many years and then to have that empty space is a bit harsh.However Christina does, it just takes time. She goes over everything she can remember and I think she is feels a bit guilty about leaving him on the night he went, but perhaps it was better this way. I am not sure what way I would want it.Great book, great author. Have plans to check out her other books. But pick up this book! It is a quick read, but really means a whole lot."},{"Title":"Evenings at Five","review":"First off, the drawings reminded me strongly of the illustrator of the &quot;Al&quot; children's books. Since I loved those books, I was already well disposed toward &quot;Evenings at Five.&quot; But this book though it expressed the stages of grief beautifully just did not go deep enough. I may have been spoiled by Godwin's previous books which are meaty and filled to bursting with provocative ideas and fascinating characters. Perhaps if I were reading it through the lens of grieving, I would have come away more impressed."},{"Title":"Evenings at Five","review":"I listened to this book on tape while driving across the country, tears streaming down my cheeks. When I reached my destination, I read it in an evening. Godwin addresses some big issues in a short book, and makes one think. She does a heckuva job stringing words together.

I have other books on the opening but many of the others books are nice if you understand the basics of the opening first. With this book you learn the basic moves and any traps in the opening, once you have mastered this book you can move on to other books on the opeing that cover more in depth abnalysis. So basically its a primer on the opeing it will discuss the main lines and the most usual replies but ubnlike other books that go 20 moves in depth with 10 parralel line you wont get it here. But this is good, Initially when I first started studying it would take forever studying one line bc there where so many alternative lines and they never seem to end.

He picked up the salt and salted his food, even though it was obvious that salt is unhealthy and any sane person shouldn't eat it. \\"What was that?\\" he thought, wondering where all these bizarre and out of place comments on the action were coming from. Maybe the author was still seven years old, and hadn't figured out how to show instead of tell. Or maybe the author needed to stick to math.John then went for a walk with his friend Joe. Joe was a very important character in the story. Very important. Over and over again it became clear that the story couldn't be told without Joe. Joe first spoke in chapter eleven.On their walk, they walked down the street, around the corner, through the park, up the stairs, down the waterfall, three quarters of the way across the galaxy, and into the mouth of a waiting hamster. Yes, you read that right: the entire walk was a bizarre, mechanically synchronized march. Neither did anything independent of the other, and there were no details, no asides, no changes in movement along the way worth noticing.John and Joe's story was published by iUniverse, a vanity press, and the author's friends all logged in to Amazon and gave it high ratings. Then, someone who likes books with suspense, and is also fond of sushi, spent good money on this steaming heap of manure, was most displeased, and set out to warn others.(*Names have been changed to protect the innocent.)"},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"This book is a brilliant analysis of a side of human nature that we might like to pretend doesn't exist. This is one of the most insightful or enlightening books I have ever read and I am now 71 years old. Although radical Islam wasn't in the world's spotlight when this book was written it certainly applies to what is happening today. I read this book years ago, in fact I can't remember exactly when but my copy looks old and beaten up even I bought it new. More than anything else this book ought to convince you to think independently and not become a follower. What the books points out is that a cause in combination with a charismatic leader has unleashed some of the worst evil the world has ever seen. But more than that the book goes into the psychology and appeal of mass movements and how they get started and why people become part of them. Everybody should read this book."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"You'll think it was written in whatever year you happen to be reading it- truely timeless."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"My original question was, (why do so many people believe what they do and why do they feel the need to force their cause down others peoples throats)?

It should be required reading for everyone, much like Animal Farm and Big Brother, the Orwellian classics are. This book is more difficult to read and not a watered down allegory which makes it a far more relevant read. Anyone with the slightest availability to comprehend complex thought should read this book and refer back to it regularly. The author, Eric Hoffer, read so many classic works and has digested them into a clear conclusion for us here. Rather than require us to poor through a lifetime of reading, Eric has done it for us and pulled it all together in a clear, precise short little book. For anyone that is confused about the difference between Equality and Equal Opportunity, this book is for you.Warning: This book is not good for whiners or intellectuals, who often tend to resemble whiners. The irony of the book is that it requires a thoughtful mind to understand the concepts, but it does not support the systems created by those types of minds. It is the industriousness of humankind that is lauded here."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"A very short book that demands introspection and thought from the reader.Although written 50+ years ago I walked away with a much better understanding of current events, especially the radical Islamic movement and environmentalist.This book may validate your preconceived notions about those movements you disagree with, but it will also directly challenge those you may support. Hoffer does not take sides and you quickly learn that radicals, regardless of their political/religious beliefs, have more in common with each other than they do with the public in general.Should be essential reading for kids entering college.

It is an analysis of fanatics - human beings that are compelled to join causes no matter what the cause. By extension it is an investigation of mass movements from early Christianity up to Fascism and Communism. This book is a cautionary against dangerous trends in the Zionist Enterprise (notice I use the term Enterprise and not Movement). Fanatic selfless idealism - whether of right wing settlers or of leftwing social reformers is dangerous. The arrogant self-righteousness of both can justify corruption, breaking the law and horrendous crimes.As Hoffer puts it: \\"It is only when the movement has passed its active stage and solidified into a pattern of stable institutions that individual liberty has a chance to emerge\\". In the Jewish context we are not post-Zionist we are post Zionist Movement and well into the Zionist Enterprise. I celebrate the maturing of Zionism from a Movement into an Enterprise. The so called solidarity of the past stifled individual self-actualization. Today the Zionist Enterprise offers many opportunities to individuals to actualize themselves as human beings and as Jews. I believe this is admirable and not to be regretted.

As things like Civil Rights, concern for the poor and for the planet reach a kind of crescendo just now, in 2009, all their veneer of compassion is peeling away, revealing nothing much more than the ruthless ambition of callow and rather directionless leadership.This is the True Believer writ large - power-grabbing narcissism, papering over one's own personal problems by claiming to be able to rescue the world from itself.Every American citizen should read/reread this book right now, and certainly before the next election.

A self-educated man who witnessed the evils of the 20's, 30's, and 40's and came to the conclussion that those decades were not aberations.There have always been mass movements and they all tend to share the same characteristics. Also, they share the same type of leaders - those who preach while safely in the rear - and the followers who perform the dirty work.This years - 2008 - political election gives a prime example of a mass movement with the slogans of hope and change.On a side note, I just finished the novel Gai-Jin by James Clavell.

I ordered THE TRUE BELIEVER based on its exceptional reputation and the intriguing subject matter (mass movements and human psychology), but what I found when the book arrived was a sort of irrational screed. Hoffer's reasoning is not -- well, to be honest there is not really any reasoning to speak of in this book. It is a series of assertion statements that are apparently intended to be taken on faith and then are haphazardly elaborated upon. I suppose if you agree with the assertion statements it might seem like an intelligent presentation of ideas. Let me quote an example, which is not taken out of context, but is the beginning of an entire section about action and men of action:\\"Action is a unifier. There is less individual distinctness in the genuine man of action--the builder, soldier, sportsman and even the scientist--than in the thinker or in one whose creativeness flows from communication with the self. The go-getter and the hustler have much in them that is abortive and undifferentiated. One is never really stripped for action unless one is stripped of a distinct and differentiated self. An active people thus tends toward uniformity. ...\\"What should be immediately apparent in this quotation is an absence of reasoning. It is a series of semi-redundant, unsubstantiated assertion statements and then a conclusion based upon those statements. The language used is full of ambiguities such as \\"genuine man of action\\", \\"stripped of a distinct and differentiated self\\", \\"have much in them that is abortive and undifferentiated\\" -- expressions that have no clear meaning and are not defined by Hoffer. If you parse it, there is a strong resemblance to an astrology reading. And this example is not a case of cherry picking, it is typical of the entire work. I turned to a random page to find an example and did not go searching for a particularly damning one.Perhaps for people who agree with Hoffer's statements they provide some kind of personal validation. For myself, I find little to agree or disagree with, I cannot see how Hoffer's reasoning amounts to more than a long string of ambiguous aphorisms. Even his appeals to history and use of historical examples take essentially the same form.To the extent he has a line of reasoning and an argument, Hoffer's point about mass movements can be distilled to the simple observation that people who are dissatisfied with their lot are the ones in a society who seek change. This could not be otherwise, and I do not understand how it passes for revelation. If people were happy with their status quo they, by definition, would not seek change. To point out that people who seek change are 'merely' those who are unsatisfied with their lives, as if that were somehow damning in and of itself, is an empty appeal to the sentiment of the self-content."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"I had difficulty to gain traction in Eric Hoffer's The True Believer. I felt bombarded by wisdoms and common sense sayings that, so I thought, defy an approach to a pressing issue that could not be of less importance today than at the time of the book's writing, 60 years ago. After reading through a bit, I had to revisit the cover: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements. The book delivers on its promise: Thoughts are exactly what you get, rather than a systematic analysis. The author himself points out that he does not aim at authority but rather at provoking questions.Hoffer penned his book under the impression of two world wars and the Great Depression, a time of upheaval that shaped modern society. He also represents a point of view of an American, living in a supreme societal system that seems beyond criticism. As such, the author writes under the ABSENCE of mass movements on his home turf. In his own sense, I feel that Hoffer is a true believer. His essential thesis goes something like this: Hey, I am a free American and superior to people of other nations. If you are a true believer, you have surrendered your individuality to the collective multitude. You are eternally incomplete and insecure.As much as I like and want to agree to what he says, I cannot trust neither his analysis nor his conclusions. Some of it, yes, but maybe only because I wish his wisdoms to be true. Here is an example of what I am trying to say:\\"The most dangerous moment for the regime of the Politburo will be when a considerable improvement in the economic conditions of the Russian masses has been achieved and the iron totalitarian rule somewhat relaxed. It is of interest that the assassination, in December 1934, of Stalin's close friend Kirov happened not long after Stalin had announced the successful end of the first Five-Year Plan and the beginning of a new prosperous, joyous era.\\"The author operates with philosophical statements, which he backs up with unsubstantiated historic analogies. The coincidence does not necessarily confirm or refute the thesis. How that contributes to the knowledge of (religious or political) mass movements, is beyond me. However, I suppose that with this logic, I should be inclined to nod off on the concept that regimes are most volatile when the economy improves. Writing under such impressions as the fall of the Berlin Wall, of Desert Storm, of the Arab Spring that keeps on rocking the entire Middle East, and of my own research on the history of the three Judaic mass religions (see The Great Leap-Fraud - Social Economics of Religious Terrorism), it seems that the target itself is utterly volatile. I could probably make the opposite case that the most dangerous moments of regimes are when economic conditions deteriorate. This would prepare societies for CHANGE (read: Obama's presidential race on undefined change) when longing for hope. Or, maybe I could create a thesis that mass movements are dependent on large economic disparities between regions. I would back it up with the argument that the poor man is not necessarily an unhappy man unless he is faced with the perception of a better alternative. Where I disagree with him most is that religion begins as mass movements. The Gospel itself explains that there remained very few believers after Jesus's (fictional) death. History quite clearly backs up the case that religion is a very, very slow moving target that starts out by multiplying itself through the web of extended families in a process that takes generations. Hoffer borrows from the Gospel, when he proclaims that all mass movements must focus on the future and depreciate the present. Yet, by doing so, he merely states the obvious. What else would a mass movement focus on other than on the promise of a better future at the cost of rejecting (at least some of) the present? Anyone?If you approach The True Believer with a critical mind and are immune to indoctrination from any camp, this book might be a good starting point in grasping some concepts of how masses could be manipulated. But in itself, it is outdated, and for most readers, the theories of the book are probably beyond reach or practical value. Are you going to be the next fanatical leader of a mass movement, desperate to learn the mechanics of captivating a herd of awed believers? The book refutes itself, because the fanatical leader is beyond Hoffer's guidance. The great news is that the book includes not only religions but also political parties, armies, or other mass beliefs. Indeed, religion is rather subordinate as he focuses in trying to understand the phenomena around Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini. He divides the advent of mass movements into three stages: the creation of discontent through writers, the appearance of a fanatical leader who disregards any obstacle, and the transition into organized normality. While the Arab Spring remains undecided, no such leader has emerged but it rather seems that the leaderless uprisings were facilitated by technology and triggered by the global economic disaster that hit the Middle East particularly hard. Most of these countries will revert to the comfort of more Islam rather than a destruction of the old in favor of a new dream for tomorrow. Life on earth is inconsequential for true believers in Islam (or Christianity). Tomorrow is Paradise.Hoffer deserves highest credit just for trying to address such a difficult topic despite (or maybe because of) his lack of formal training. He has certainly succeeded in his goal to provoke questions. I am not in unity with him over the questions of religious mass movements, and just because I tend to agree with many of his other thoughts, it does not validate them. However, by no means does that disqualify his important work. In fact it is a warning to modernity that the slogan of CHANGE might be a sign of a fundamental societal disruption right here in North America. All we need to look out for is a fanatical leader to emerge. Perry might lend himself to fill the shoes.A.J.

He mentions it himself several times in the book that he expects the reader to disagree with some of his points, and that some of his statements are purposefully extreme in order to start discussions. The reader should not accept everything he writes as the final truth by any means.The reader should be aware of the context the book was written in--the mid-50's during the red scare. So a lot of the material seems to support a status-quo government. An impression one might get from reading the book is that seemingly all mass movements are to be avoided, and that the frusterated masses are like &quot;slime.&quot; Again one must carefully argue and question every point he makes. There is no doubt though that this book brings a lot of systemtic and insightful ideas that help explain a lot of what goes on in this world fifty years after he wrote it."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"The work tries to understand and explain, not pass judgment, on mass movements and their followers. Hoffer concentrates on the active phase of mass movements where the true believer has real influence. He cautions that although mass movements share many traits this does not imply that they're equally destructive or beneficent. Their appeal derives from the promise in their materialistic, religious, nationalist or blended natures. Intense, infectious emotion is the fuel. He analyses the various causes of the desire for change. Discontent alone is not enough; other factors are needed to activate it, like a sense of power and the ability to spread a vision of hope.Faith in a cause is to a large extent areplacementfor the individual's lost self-confidence. The movement offers a substitute for individual hope. Furthermore, movements are interchangeable to a surprising extent. As he puts it; \\"A Saul turning into a Paul is neither a rarity nor a miracle.\\" The reason is that they attract the same mentality. Antidotes include arrangements that discourage atomistic individualism or offers opportunities for action or new beginnings, like emigration. Creative expression is a potent protector: even the poor that are creatively involved are immune, as are the abjectly poor and members of close-knit family, tribal or religious groups.Potential converts are the disaffected, identified as misfits, outcasts, minorities, adolescents, the ambitious, the obsessed, the impotent in mind or body, certain categories of the poor, the extremely selfish, the bored and the sinners. Hoffer explains that the burden of freedom aggravates frustration in certain individuals. The followers exchange their individual responsibility for the sense of redemption that the movement offers. Those who feel like failures value equality and fraternity much more than freedom. This illuminatesRussia's regressioninto totalitarianism and thepassivity of Europeans.Another striking insight is that that visions, dreams and utopian hopes are powerful weapons; people will die for delusions. Craving/desire is what causes the reckless self-sacrifice. Movements always target the family; Hoffer provides proof by quoting from inter alia theNew Testament. Disruption of the family makes the person more dependent on the movement. Movements attract and retain followers due to the refuge they offer from the boredom, barrenness, anxiety and lack of meaning in the individual's life.There are various species of misfit - the permanent misfit finds peace only in a total separation from the self. The extraordinarily selfish are likely to be the most fanatical champions of selflessness. Oddly, spinsters & middle aged women have played a crucial role in the birth of mass movements. Emotions like remorse and grievance appear to lead people in the same direction. Fervent enthusiasm helps to suppress a guilty conscience. United action and self-sacrifice are the elements that determine the vigor of a movement. Both sublimate the blemished self. Ways of persuading people to fight and die for the cause include:(a) separating them from the real self by means of assimilation into the collective(b) creating a make-believe self or a collective show(c) making them hate the present and worship the future; the present is not only portrayed as miserable but is deliberately made so(d) separating them from reality with the wall of dogma. Observation & experience are rejected in favor of doctrine which provides certitude.(e) Keeping them in a state of fanaticism by inflaming passions & breaking down the will, thus transforming them into automatons. Reason is ineffective in trying to free a fanatic from these mental chains.Hoffer's view of how different political persuasions view past, present and future is an interesting aside: The conservative is like the skeptic, echoing the thoughts of Ecclesiastes about nothing new under the sun whilst the liberal (Hoffer means the Classical Liberal, not today's leftist types) considers the present the legitimate offspring of the past, a springboard towards a better future.On the other hand, both thereactionaryand the radical hate the present. They differ only in their opinion on human nature's potential for change. The radical is convinced that human nature is perfectible whilst the reactionary believes the opposite. Fanatics occupy the same space on the political spectrum which is circular, not linear. The real difference is between the fanatics and the moderates of all ideologies. It is the temperament, not the ideological content that is crucial: fanatics often move from one form of extremism to another: communism, fascism, xenophobic nationalism, religious intolerance.Sinisterismby Bruce Walker offers more insight into this phenomenon.The unifying agents are hatred, imitation, brainwashing (although Hoffer believes that the power ofPropagandais overrated and that it merely justifies & articulates opinions already present in the minds of recipients), leadership, action and suspicion. His observations on the impulse to convert are most arresting. The missionary zeal emanates from a profound uncertainty, an aching inner void. Proselytizing is a search for something; a quest to confirm that the fanatic's faith is indeed the absolute truth.Three personality types are influential in mass movements: (a) men of words (b) fanatics (c) men of action. The first prepares the ground, the second initiates/dominates the active phase and the 3rd consolidates. Hoffer remarks that the first, whether they bejournalists, academics or priests, thirst for recognition & a status above the rest of mankind. They are often the first victims of what they have unleashed. The fanatic thrives on chaos & destruction. The man of action rescues the movement from the recklessness of the fanatic; when he assumes control the active phase comes to an end.In conclusion, Hoffer discusses good & bad movements, the sterility of the active phase and some factors that determine its length, plus examples of benevolent mass movements. The book concludes with notes arranged by chapter. It remains a masterpiece and a valuable contribution to the disciplines of politics, psychology, sociology and theology."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"This remarkable work examines the elements shared by all mass movements.

His observations on the missionary zeal are most illuminating. Thecompulsion to make convertsderives from a profound uncertainty, a gnawing inner void. Proselytizing is a search rather than a gift; a quest to confirm that the fanatic's faith is indeed the absolute truth.Three personality types are influential in mass movements: (a)fault-finding men of words(b) fanatics (c) men of action. The 1st prepares the ground, the 2nd initiates/dominates the active phase and the 3rd consolidates. Hoffer remarks that the first, whether they be journalists, academics, artists or priests, thirst for recognition & a higher status than the rest of us. The grievance that animates them is with few exceptions, personal. They are often the first victims of what they have unleashed. The fanatic thrives on chaos & destruction. The man of action rescues the movement from the recklessness of the fanatic; when assuming control he terminates active phase.Thoughtful people of words realize the danger of embracing absolutes without succumbing to the plague of moral relativism. They value thesearch for truthand never lose sight of reason as an essential component of faith. Hoffer believes that the fanatic is a non-creative person of words: the basic division between wordsmiths is between those who find fulfillment in creative work and those who do not. The creative is attached to the present and intends to reform, not destroy. The non-creative can never find rest and inevitably becomes a vehicle ofnihilism.In conclusion, Hoffer discusses good & bad movements, the sterility of the active phase and some factors that determine its duration, plus useful mass movements, examples of are Kemal Atat&uuml;rk's modernization of Turkey and Japan's transformation.

There are various species of misfit - the permanent misfit finds peace only in a total separation from the self. The exceedingly selfish are likely to be the most fanatical champions of selflessness. Oddly, spinsters & middle aged women have played a crucial role in the birth of mass movements. Emotions like remorse and grievance appear to lead people in the same direction. Fervent enthusiasm helps to suppress a guilty conscience.The vigor of a movement depends on united action and self-sacrifice. Ways of persuading people to fight and die for a cause include:(i) separating them from the real self through assimilation into the collective (ii) creating a make-believe self (iii) making them hate the present and worship the future (iv) separating them from reality with the wall of dogma (v) Keeping them in a state of fanaticism by inflaming passions in order to prevent the attainment of inner balance.Fanatics of all ideologies occupy the same space on the political spectrum which is circular, not linear. The real difference is between fanatics and moderates. It is the temperament, not the ideological content that is crucial. Fanatics often move from one form of extremism to another: communism, fascism, xenophobic nationalism and religious intolerance.Sinisterismby Bruce Walker offers more insight on this phenomenon as does William Buckley's famous investigation ofAnti-Semitismamongst conservatives, individuals that are nowadays identified as the Traditionalist or Nativist Right.The unifying agents are hatred, imitation, brainwashing (although Hoffer believes that the power of propaganda is overrated and that it merely justifies & articulates opinions already present in the minds of recipients), leadership, action and suspicion. His observations on the missionary zeal are most illuminating. Thecompulsion to make convertsemanates from a profound uncertainty, a gnawing inner void. Proselytizing is the search for something rather than a gift to others; a quest to confirm that the fanatic's faith is indeed the absolute truth.Three personality types are influential in mass movements: (a)fault-finding men of words(b) fanatics (c) men of action. The first prepares the ground, the second initiates/dominates the active phase and the 3rd consolidates. Hoffer remarks that the first, whether they be journalists, academics, artists or priests, thirst for recognition & a higher status than the rest of us. The grievance that animates him is with few exceptions, personal. They are often the first victims of what they have unleashed. The fanatic thrives on chaos & destruction. The man of action rescues the movement from the recklessness of the fanatic; when he assumes control the active phase comes to an end.Thoughtful people of words realize the danger of embracing absolutes without succumbing to the plague of moral relativism. They value thesearch for truthand those who are spiritual never lose sight of reason as an essential component of faith. Hoffer believes that the fanatic is a non-creative person of words: the basic division between wordsmiths is between those who find fulfillment in creative work and those who do not. The creative is attached to the present and intends to reform, not destroy. The non-creative can never find rest and inevitably becomes a vehicle ofnihilism.In conclusion, Hoffer discusses good & bad movements, the sterility of the active phase and some factors that determine its duration, plus useful mass movements, examples of which resulted in Kemal Atat&uuml;rk's modernization of Turkey and the advanced economy of Japan. The True Believer is a most absorbing book that reveals new angles on important issues and really compels one to think."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Though first published in 1951, Eric Hoffer's text on mass movements is an important argument for our time. In a mere 168 pages organized into four parts, Hoffer looks at the appeal of mass movements, the potential converts, united action and self-sacrifice, and finally the beginning and end of mass movements. The discussion draws upon examples from religious, social, and nationalistic movements.The True Believer The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements covers quite a lot of ground for such a compact volume. This is perhaps no surprise to those who are familiar with Hoffer and his disdain for wordiness, which he expressed in a 1977 letter that established an essay contest with a 500-word limit. \\"Wordiness,\\" wrote Hoffer, \\"is a sickness of American writing.\\"Many words have been committed to review and analysis of The True Believer so instead of adding to the noise I will simply confess my particular interest in the book because of the author himself. The book is well-organized and presents a convincing argument for understanding mass movements, but this is not the work of a professional sociologist who is able to spend all of his days observing people and writing about them. Eric Hoffer is often called the Longshoreman Philosopher because he was known as a philosopher even though he was self-educated and employed only as a longshoreman.Through his voracious reading, he had exposed himself to a great deal of information and the thoughts of many men who came before him--undoubtedly including those he would find disagreeable. This would give him a great deal of food for thought. Hoffer later noted that much of his writing was done on the docks while waiting for ships to arrive to be unloaded and in leisure moments during a break for lunch. In his writing, Hoffer synthesized many ideas into clearly-expressed thoughts on complex issues.In considering this, I couldn't help but feel a bit sad--a touch disappointed that more of our countrymen are not inclined to spend their time in reading and thought. Today's workers, irrespective of the color of their collar, will find themselves following the \\"normal\\" course of action after work: kicking back with a beer or two in front of the television, looking for some validation. The sense of sadness emerged when I began to wonder what other useful things might find themselves being presented if only more people would be inclined not to look at their professional pursuits as a means to an end: the funding of idleness and trivial pursuits.Reflecting on another thought from Hoffer, however, I quickly recovered. \\"A society that refuses to strive for superfluities is likely to end up lacking in necessities.\\""},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Hoffer's analysis of mass movements is timeless.

Though longer and not as eloquent as \\"The Prince\\" this book reminds me of it in its appeal to common sense and a realistic view of human psychology. The book is also refreshing in its blunt explanations and language. I often found myself thinking \\"I can't believe he just wrote that\\" one moment and then thinking \\"yeah, he's right\\" the next.If you want a cold and unsympathetic explanation for how mass movements are formed, and who joins them, this is the book for you.

Many later sociopolitical works echo his thoughts without acknowledging this man and his contributions."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"I first came across Hoffer a year or so ago. I was searching for a specific quote on google (which I never found), but a site came up with several pages of Hoffer's quotes. I was pleasently greeted with insiteful comments such as:\\"We all have private ails. The troublemakers are they who need public cures for their private ails.\\"\\"People who bite the hand that feeds them usually lick the boot that kicks them.\\"\\"A war is not won if the defeated enemy has not been turned into a friend.\\"\\"Propaganda does not deceive people; it merely helps them to deceive themselves.\\"After reading these quotes I immediately purchased The True Believer.Perhaps the salient point of this book is how Hoffer rethinks how human beings tend to categorize. For instance, many people who look at a Stalin and a Hitler think that they are polar opposites - after all, one was a Facist and the other a Communist. Hoffer's argument is that the opposite of a Stalin is not a Hitler - the opposite is the average person who has no desire to achieve such extremes.As he puts it: \\"The opposite of a nationalist is not a traitor, it is the average mindful citizen. The opposite of a religious fanatic is not a fanatic athiest, it is the gentle cynic who does not care one way or the other. In short, his belief is that an extremist is an extremist, regardless of which side of the fence they sit on.Hoffer discusses the factors that coax people into joining a mass movement. some of these factors involve losing ones own identity in a mass movement. As he puts it: \\"The fanatic is not really a stickler to principle. He embraces a cause not primarily because of its justness or holiness but because of his desperate need for something to hold onto.\\"In a nut shell, he discusses mans unhappiness with oneself and mans attempt to run from himself as factors that cause them to join a mass movement. He can gain comfort, like an addict, by losing his own identity for a period of time.Much of this book is about fanaticism. Just about anything witnessed in 9/11 can be found in this book. Everything from Bin Ladin, to the Taliban, to the suicide bombers to the US response can be found here. It's almost as if the key players of that epoch climbed out of the pages of The True Believer."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Despite the fact that this book was written 50 years ago and is very short, it is still an essential read on the phenomenon of mass movements and mass violence. And it is unique that it does not bash or even particularly focus on religion--it is really more about political movements like Nazism and Communism. However, his main point is well taken: mass movements and the people who join them have a lot in common.Admittedly, Hoffer's psychology and sociology are a bit dated and simplistic: I doubt that every movement member is a self-disgusted misfit. Some peope have genuine--if misplaced--hopes for a better future. However, there is a great difference between a reformer and a revolutionary, and there is no reason to say we do not need both a little bit.His discussions of hatred, belief, and leadership are probably the scariest and truest parts of his account. People seem to need something to hate, to demonize, in order to solidify their own movement, and honestly we see this as clearly in the anti-terrorist campaign as in the terrorist one. That people are willing to kill and die for vague and even false ideals and symbols is only too true. And that a movement leader need not be so much intelligent as forceful and certain and cunning should make all of us, 21st century Americans too, shudder.Overall, perhaps the most chilling thing is his awareness that certainty makes all other considerations disappear. Beware of the person who is too certain of his own and his cause's truth and goodness. When you start hearing leaders speak of evil, watch out."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Fifty years ago, this book explained terrorist minds such as Osama bin Laden.Eric Hoffer had a perceptive mind and a persistent intellectual curiosity. In the years after World War II, he was puzzled at how dedicated Nazis could become dedicated communists literally within a heartbeat. His conclusion doomed the continuing success of his book, he defined the mind of the fanatic rather than defending the ideology of politics.The book was first published in 1951, at the height of the McCarthy witch hunts. Instead of attacking communism, Hoffer identified fanatics as guilt-ridden hitch-hikers who thumb a ride on any ideology from Christianity to communism. The fault, according to Hoffer, was the mind of the fanatic who needs a Stalin or a Hitler or a Christ or a bin Laden to worship and die for. His description of a fanatic fitted Sen. Barry Goldwater's assertion that &quot;extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.&quot; It applies to Jerry Falwell with the same rigor as he would define bin Laden today.Consider some of Hoffer's assertions:&quot;Faith in a holy cause is to a considerable extent a substitute for the lost faith in ourselves.&quot;The less justified a man is in claiming excellence for his own self, the more ready he is to claim all excellence for his nation, his religion, his race or his holy cause.&quot;A man is likely to mind his own business when it is worth minding. When it is not, he takes his mind off his own meaningless affairs by minding other people's business.&quot;This minding of other's people's business expresses itself in gossip, snooping and meddling, and also in feverish interest in communal, national and racial affairs. In running away from ourselves we either fall on our neighbor's shoulder or fly at his throat.&quot;Now tell me, does this sound like bin Laden and/or Falwell (plus a wide number of other zealots you may wish to name):&quot;The burning conviction that we have a holy duty toward others is often a way of attaching our drowning selves to a passing raft. What looks like giving a hand is often a holding on for dear life. Take away our holy duties and you leave our lives puny and meaningless. There is no doubt that in exchanging a self-centered for a selfless life we gain enormously in self-esteem. The vanity of the selfless, even those who practice utmost humility, is boundless.&quot;Sound familiar ? It is the terrorist mind. It applies equally well to the John Birch Society and the militia movements as to the KKK and the anti-war fervor as to bin Laden and the Palestinian suicide-bombers. In America, fanatics were relegated to the silly fringes of society. In parts of the world, they are elevated to be heroes.The fanatic is forever with us. The very definition of fanaticism rejects toleration for others; yet, to survive, we must tolerate the ideas of others -- even the most outlandish. The answer is from one of the greatest Native Americans, President Benito Juarez of Mexico, who asserted &quot;Peace is respect for the rights of others.&quot;Hoffer outlined the problem with brilliance, but he failed to offer a solution. Americans don't like open-ended problems; from sit-coms to revenge for the World Trade Center, they want answers. That is the weakness of the book, and perhaps why it isn't better known today.For now, the answers will be bombs, bullets and cruise missiles. But, revenge only digs two graves. On a long-term basis, the answer must surely be something along the line of Juarez's statement. In ending his short book, Hoffer quotes J. B. S. Haldane who counted fanaticism among the only four really important inventions made between 3000 BC and 1400 AD.&quot;It was a Judaic-Christian invention,&quot; Hoffer wrote. &quot;And it is strange to think that in receiving this malady of the soul the world also received a miraculous instrument for raising societies and nations from the dead -- an instrument of resurrection.&quot;Or, in more prosaic terms, the inability to hold a grudge."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"This was one of the enlightening books I have ever read.

For anyone who desires to understand the mindset of people attracted to mass movements (whether they're based on politics or religion), this is one of the best books on that subject. One thing I especially like about the book is that Hoffer keeps it short and to the point. He makes his points clearly without any undo fuss. On the other hand, the book is so meaty that I found myself stopping often to consider the author's points. And I found myself almost always agreeing with the author after due consideration.

Beforehand I thought they were extremely religious, hopeless, desperate, lunatic, poor or any combination of the adjectives above. Now I know that they tend very much to be recently frustrated, hopeful for larger than life/self changes, of diverse financial/academic background, irreligious even if they are willing to die for a certain religion and so on.Perhaps the radical perspectives of it (that Fanaticism is a Judeo-Christian invention, Fanatics will remain fanatic on whatever course they pick etc) had made it so undervalued and overlooked in the past decades. However, a pearl is still a pearl under straw and I am obliged to recommend it to any philosopher.p.s. The Amazon book reviews here by Eugene A. Jewett, Theodore A. Rushton and M.S. Feldman are excellent. Dont miss them."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"I tend to be a very sceptical person, I like truth, and I am not a joiner of groups. So I was able to read this book fairly dispassionately. But in it, I did see some attempts to explain why some people purport to believe some assertions that are truly strange, and why they refuse to even consider questioning them.There is a tendency for many of us to think everyone is just like ourselves. But that is not the case. There are things I would fight very hard for, such as human rights, justice, and truth. But I have met people who have a strong desire to fight against them. We're not talking about people who simply have a strong but misplaced sense of fairness. We're talking about fanaticism which can result in truly counterproductive behavior that most people will later refer to as irrational.In this superb book, Eric Hoffer gives us some of his thoughts about mass movements, not all of which he dismisses as uniformly bad. The first comment is that mass movements are bred by a combination of discontent and a sense of power. And he then emphasizes the interchangeability of mass movements. But here I think I would have spent some more time distinguishing between rational and irrational ones. It can be rational to buy nice clothes, or prepare good food, or raise children, or work as a scientist or engineer, or even travel to a faraway land. It can be rational to help others in emergencies, such as storms, floods, fires, epidemics, famines, or invasions. Yet each of these activities could be done with a sense of purpose that is similar to that of any religious fanatic. I'm not interested in that. I'm interested in mass movements that lead folks astray. And into counterproductive and irrational activities.The author then characterizes various types of people who often have a susceptibility to being recruited for a mass movement: the poor, misfits, outcasts, minorities, adolescents, the ambitious, the obsessed, the impotent, the selfish, the bored, and the sinners.Hoffer explains that once in a mass movement, one begins to identify strongly with a group as opposed to seeing oneself as an individual. That makes self-sacrifice a distinct possibility. And the author also reminds us that a fanatic uses a cause as an anchor. That person can be converted to some other cause, even an opposite cause, but never by appeals to reason or morality. An interesting observation!Thus, the fanatic and moderate are poles apart. Fanatics of opposite sides are basically siblings.Now, what about unifying agents? Hatred is a good one. So is imitation. And action. And now Hoffer makes another great point: propaganda is overrated. If people stop believing, propaganda will not convince them at all. Propaganda is of little use without force to back it up.Hoffer explains that without a big bunch of people ready to be led, a potential leader has nothing. But without a talented leader, a movement has nothing. He gives Lenin as an example. I am unconvinced: I think it is quite possible for movements to do just fine with a total idiot for a leader, or with no leader at all.This is an excellent book, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Eric Hoffer was a longshoreman who wrote elegant philosophical prose.I read THE TRUE BELIEVER when I was involved with Ayn Rand's Objectivist movement and recognized myself and everyone I knew.Have your youngster read this book and I guarantee they will never join the Moonies or any other cult while away at college.This is a great book."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"When I first read Hoffer's classic book, \\"The True Believer\\", as a graduate student twenty years ago, I was shocked. I was astonished that a writer could openly suggest parallels among Christianity, Islam, fascism, and the KKK, and survive to write another book. Yet I was riveted by Hoffer's observations, which seemed to jump off the page in spite of his straightforward and unembellished prose. But I also recall thinking that Hoffer was a bit too brash in his assertions; that he ought to have tempered nearly every statement with a qualifier--a disclaimer that left open the possibility that he was mistaken.Upon reading Hoffer again, as a middle-aged and somewhat less idealistic professor, I find that several things have changed. First, Hoffer's observations seem even more keenly relevant today, post 9/11, than they did in the post-Vietnam era. Secondly, I now understand Hoffer's apparent brashness. In my youthful zeal I often rushed through the preface of a book, or skipped it entirely. But therein was Hoffer's justification: \\"The book passes no judgments, and expresses no preferences. It merely tries to explain; and the explanations--all of them theories--are in the nature of suggestions and arguments even when they are stated in what seems a categorical tone. I can do no better than quote Montaigne: 'All I say is by way of discourse, and nothing by way of advice. I should not speak so boldly if it were my due to be believed.'\\" While I am generally no fan of blanket disclaimers, I understand why Hoffer did it this way. His words could have been too easily dismissed had they been continually tempered and restrained.Hoffer revels in pointing out seemingly paradoxical situations and attitudes, such as \\"Discontent is likely to be highest when misery id bearable; when conditions have so improved that an ideal state seems almost within reach. A grievance is most poignant when almost redressed.\\" His incisive comments cut to the nerve of his subject, treating in one stroke mass movements of every variety: \\"It is futile to judge the viability of a new movement by the truth of its doctrine and the feasibility of its promises. What has to be judged is its corporate organization for quick and total absorption of the frustrated.\\"But what I remember most vividly, and Hoffer has reaffirmed for me, are his chilling observations about indoctrination and self-sacrifice. \\"The readiness for self-sacrifice is contingent on an imperviousness to the realities of life. He who is free to draw conclusions from his individual experience and observation is not usually hospitable to the idea of martyrdom... All active mass movements strive, therefore, to interpose a fact-proof screen between the faithful and the realities of the world. They do this by claiming that the ultimate and absolute truth is already embodied in their doctrine and that there is no truth or certitude outside it. The facts on which the true believer bases his conclusions must not be derived from his experience or observation but from holy writ.\\"I will close with one further quote from \\"The True Believer\\": \\"...in order to be effective a doctrine must not be understood, but has to be believed in. We can be absolutely certain only about things we do not understand.\\" It is in statements like these that Hoffer seems to speak from a vantage point that few others have attained. Hoffer's insights are timeless."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Written 50 years ago this classic book has been dusted off in the wake of the Taliban's bombing of the Pentagon in Washington DC and the WTC in NYC. The book concerns itself with the active phase of mass movements which are dominated by a true believer, a man of fanatical faith who is ready to sacrifice his life for a holy cause. The 19 suicide bombers who have wreaked so much havoc on America are fanatics of this sort. Eric Hoffer attempts to trace the fanatic's genesis and to outline his nature.Hoffer doesn't dance around the subject like a behavioral therapist billing by the hour. He assumes, in a very straight forward fashion, that frustration with one's life is a peculiarity of fanatics, and assumes that this mindset is necessary for techniques of conversion to achieve their deepest penetration and most desirable results with regard to the fanatic's twisted adherence to his new faith.Hoffer allows that to understand the various facets of the fanatical personality requires an understanding of the practices of contemporary mass movements. Written circa 1951, he studied the Nazi's, the Fascist's, and the Communist's because it was here where the successful techniques of conversion had been perfected and applied.This is a book of ideas and as such it offers up theories. It suggests that through amplifying the negative feelings of its frustrated fanatic's a movement advances its interests by seconding their propensities. Hoffer also posits the thought that all not mass movements are bad, however the central point of the book is to explain the composition of the mindsets of a movement's collective of True Believers.At 168 pages followed by 9 pages of notes, the book is not difficult nor is it an arduous task to read. In fact it's pithy. It has short punchy sections, 125 of them. The work is to be found in the reader's reflections on Hoffer's assertions. He covers the appeal of mass movements and the desire for change found in potential candidates, the personality traits of potential converts, the unity and self sacrifice of the members that is necessary for the movement to achieve its ends, and the factors which determine the length of its active phase. I would offer here that lengthy reflection is suggested if the reader is to derive the full benefits of Hoffer's insights.Hoffer's beginning notion is that &quot;people with a sense of fulfillment think the world is good while the frustrated blame the world for their failures. Therefore a mass movement's appeal is not to those intent on bolstering and advancing a cherished self, but to those who crave to be rid of an unwanted self. He continues by saying that the true believer &quot;cannot be convinced, only converted&quot;. This basic tenet of the story is about human nature and its susceptibility to totalitarianism both secular and sectarian. To wit, he writes that &quot;all mass movements strive to impose a fact proof screen between the faithful and the realities of the world. And, that that faith becomes the things the fanatic declines to see. He avers how startling it is to realize how much unbelief is necessary to make belief possible, and that faith manifests itself not in moving mountains, but in not seeing mountains move. He say's that in the context of mass movement's faith should not be judged by its profundity, sublimity, or truth but by how thoroughly it insulates the individual from himself and the world as it is.&quot;If you have any familiarity with the story of Jim Jones and his Jonestown Kool-Aid mass suicide, or of the group suicide of the members of the cult who found new meaning in the passage of the Hale Bop comet, or of the mental make up of those who bought into the seven seals dogma of David Koresh in the fatal Waco fiasco, then you will recognize that of which Hoffer describes. Read this book for further insight into the fanaticism of the holy warriors of the taliban and perhaps it will steel your resolve for the long struggle we are all in for."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"&quot;The less justified a man is in claiming excellence for his own self, the more ready is he to claim excellence for his nation, his religion, his race or his holy cause.&quot;--Eric Hoffer, The true BelieverNone of the terrorists of September 11 were destitute. Some even had wives and children. Nevertheless, they committed suicide for their cause. Anyone wanting to understand this horrible irony would do well to read Eric Hoffer's 1951 classic, The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements. Eric Hoffer (1902-1983) was a self-educated US author and philosopher who was a migratory worker and longshoreman until 1967. He achieved immediate acclaim with his first book, The true Believer.According to Hoffer, the early converts to any mass movement come from the ranks of the &quot;frustrated,&quot; that is, &quot;people who..feel that their lives are spoiled or wasted.&quot; The true believers' &quot;Faith in [their] holy cause is to a considerable extent a subsitute for [their] lost faith in [themselves].&quot; He says that we are prone to throw ourselves into a mass movement to &quot;supplant and efface the self we want to forget.&quot; He then adds, &quot;We cannot be sure that we have something worth living for unless we are ready to die for it.&quot;Hoffer offers a general insight about mass movements, which seems to prophetically explain why there is currently widespread anti-Western sentiment within Islamic countries:&quot;The discontent generated in backward countries by their contact with Western civilization is not primarily resentment against exploitation by domineering foriegners. It is rather the result of a crumbling or weakening of tribal solidarity and communal life.&quot;The ideal of self-advancement which the civilizing West offers to the backward populations brings with it the plague of individual frustration. All the advantages brought by the West are ineffectual substitutes for the sheltering and soothing anonymity of a communal existence. Even when the Westernized native attains personal success--becomes rich, or masters a respected profession--he is not happy.&quot;Further along, Hoffer mentions those who &quot;want to eliminate free competition and the ruthless testing to which the individual is continually subjected in a free society.&quot;Why should individualism, freedom, and self-advancement be hated? Again, I can do no better than quote Hoffer:&quot;Freedom aggravates as much as it alleviates frustration. Freedom of choice places the whole blame of failure on the shoulders of the individual. And as freedom encourages a multiplicity of attempts, it unavoidably muliplies failure and frustration...Unless a man has talents to make something of himself, freedom is an irksome burden...We join mass movements to escape individual responsibility....&quot;In light of the above quotes, there is little wonder that the terrorists chose to destroy the Twin Towers. These were architectural symboles of individualism and self-advancement.But Hoffer's book does more than give us insight into the psychology of the fanatic. It causes us to soberly contemplate ourselves. For who has not experienced failure, frustration, and a sense of futility at one time or another? The true Believer is one of those few books I consider to contain ideas approximating to true &quot;wisdom.&quot;"},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"It is no accomplishment to trash a book. Many, who clearly do not understand what Hoffer is writing about or what he is saying, have criticised him over the forty plus years since first publication of \\"The True Believer\\". Hardly any of Hoffer's critics have a single accomplishment that equals the book.Let me tell you a little about this unique man. Eric Hoffer did not finish elementary school. A rare disease struck him blind. Possessing an insatiable curiosity, Hoffer studied on his own, getting anyone he could corner to read to him. He developed powerful memory skills to compensate for his blindness and limited resources. He wrote his books entirely in his mind while laboring and set them to paper when he was done. He could recite verbatim any page of any of his books. (Bill Moyers of PBS had him demonstrate this profound memory skill.)A new medical proceedure reclaimed Hoffer's sight when he was about 19. It was too late for schooling. He had to work. Hoffer lived much of his adulthood as a drifting laborer. At different times, he worked as a miner, a prospector, a dishwasher, a longshoreman. He never stopped learning. This unusual man, who understood his fellow Longshoreman and respected the common man, was able to engage fellow laborers in deep philosophical discussions. That is something no professor can do with a classroom full of university students. Like a Socrates of the docks, Hoffer learned much from orchastrating discussions with his humble work mates. I suspect he got the idea from the works of great thinkers such as Plato and Aristotle, ageless thinkers most professors want students to ignore.Hoffer was dedicated to a life of learning. A practical, rugged man, Hoffer understood the wisdom of seeking knowledge for the sake of knowledge. He read only the best: Plato, Aristotle, Shakespeare, Locke, Mills, books of science. With his contemporary, Mortimer J. Adler, Hoffer detested text books & abridged works of literature.Everything interested him. Nothing escaped his observant mind. One story should give you the flavor of this career autodidact. Hoffer had a few questions no one could answer to his satisfaction. One invloved 'why does grass grow up, not down or sideways.' He drifted to California, rented a sleeping room near a major library and took a job nearby as a dishwasher. He worked just enough to eat, buy shelter and basic supplies. Hoffer invested the rest of his time there studying in the huge library.\\"True Believer\\" (1951) was Hoffer's first book. It proved a best seller and it brought him fame. It is a well written, thin book, as are all five of his books. \\"True Believer\\" brought Hoffer to the attention of President Eisenhower, and before Hoffer died, another president awarded him a Presidential Medal of Freedom, an honor bestowed on few people.UCLA was so impressed with Hoffer's Essays, prose style & independent mind that he was offered a full Professorship in Psychology. Hoffer accepted but resigned a few years later, prefering the streets to the more comfortable campus. He left so he could think.\\"True Believer\\" has never been out of print. Some publisher, somewhere kept the book available. Hoffer's other books have been in and out of print several times over the years. Hoffer wrote exceptionally well. He was a prose stylist. Late in life, Bill Moyers asked Hoffer how he wanted to be remembered. Hoffer chuckled & replied: \\"He could write a good sentence\\". Hoffer could do more than write good sentences. He wrote powerful, thought provoking essays, which is what his thin books amount to, powerfully written essays.The basic observations of \\"True Believer\\" remain compelling. There is a social type who gravitates to extreme ideologies and extreme political movements. the basic personality of fanatics on the extreme left and fanatics on the extreme right are similar, if not the same. It is equally true that it is a marked tendency of this type to migrate from one extreme to the other.If you seek insight into what makes the extreme mind tick, you will not find all the answers here. Hoffer never claimed you would. You will leave satisfied that you gained something valuable from reading \\"The True Believer.\\"By the way, more than a few people have learned to write well by studying Hoffer's prose, an American Cavalier prose, consisting of simple, unaffected, clear, honest sentences. Hoffer would advise us: 'begin and end each sentence with a punch.' He did exactly that."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"I was given this book by my new Stepfather at age 19 in 1967. He had observed my flirtation, if not the beginning of a slide, with radical social activism. Mr Hoffer helped me to see that my attractions to these movements, which have largely been abandoned by even their most ardent proponents, were largely projections of unresolved and indeed unfaced inner coflicts.Thanks Dad. Thanks Mr Hoffer. You saved me and those around me a lot of grief.I think this simple book would go a long way toward social sanity if it were read by High School students."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Because of constraints of space, I'll note that at least two things that he did that were brilliant in the overall writing were:1. The use of specific historical examples to develop the general idea (deductive reasoning) and NOT vice versa (inductive reasoning). Many sociologists get so caught up in trying to make fine sounding phrases that they don't understand that there is a qualitative difference in going from examples to suppositions and not the other way around.2. Succinctness. A great many books go on for a very long time and manage to assert very little. (Read anything by Ayn Rand lately?) This book is very to the point and short on words.The way that we know that his predictions are with merit is that they have come true 50 years *after* the book was written.Ten examples of things for which he gives good, mechanistic explanations/ predictions are:1. Noting that movements for the rights of this group or that group often end with finished products/ governments that are WORSE than the formerly existing order. (Africa).2. Explanations of why it is in the best interest of governments to have citizens that are less well educated. The less well informed are citizens, the less likely they are to hold government accountable for serious mistakes because they aren't aware of what's happening. (United States)3. If there is no cause, people will invent one. (The Islamic world. Student protestors on university campuses).4. When people stay caught in religious movements (or any movement too long), then it will divert other energy that could have been used for other more immediately useful tasks. The net result will be backwardness. (Islamic world again. Sub-Saharan Africa and tribal conflicts.)5. This book makes a clean separation between the Dixiecrats in the American South and the Poor White Trash as the creators of problems for blacks. While he only devoted two sentences two it, it could have well been expanded to explain to explain the origin of the Segregation laws (which happened AFTER the Reconstruction governments).6. He talks about the role of class in assimilation. (The Cubans in Miami have tried to recreate Cuba in Miami because the people the managed to get out were the richest people. But no other ethnic group has gone as far in creating an ethnic enclave because these people were from the lower echelons of their own respective home countries.)7. Religious conversion is *incidental* to whatever conqueror there is gaining control of the government. (So Christianity was not taken up in Japan because the conquerors did not control the government. But in places where the rapport was made between the government and the colonizers, the subjects were converted almost as an afterthought.)8. Shows that there is separation between men of action, men of words, and fanatics. Some people are actually capable of going out and getting things organized and done, but may not be the greatest speaker (George Bush). Others may speak very well, but be capable of nothing else (WEB DuBois). And others just like to stay inflamed and create chaos because that's what they do best (bin Laden).9. Revolutions must take place in certain steps. And there must be people who are *looking* for something to change. (All the talk of radicalism in New England at Harvard and the other Ivy League Institutions may not amount to anything.)10. Succesful governments befriend the \\"learned men\\" (intellectuals), so that they don't become mouthpieces against the governments/ catalysts for revolution. This system existed for centuries in Mainland China. It exists in some sense in the Western World (Universities. The tenure system. Intellectuals won't go *that* far in promoting the destruction of the system that ultimately keeps them employed.)This book has many good things that can be learned. It's only 160 pages. But it should take at least two weeks to read if read properly. And I believe that it has more *authenticated* knowledge than most sociology degree courses."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Eric Hoffer developed an uncanny passion for absorbing and interpreting information; granted, the passion was borne of his fear of a relapse to the blindness of his youth, but it was this passion, the passion of all believers, that he truly understood. The ultimate expression of Hoffer's understanding was this book.Hoffer's jumps between his cross-sections of movements, the primary people of movements, and the people whom may join a movement(s), without any regard for the overt differences on their faces. He sees beyond them to their similarities, and does an excellent job of displaying as much to the reader without bias for any particular one.And that's the truly amazing factor of &quot;The True Believer&quot;: the detached nature of Hoffer's writing, which was favorably compared to that of Machaivelli's writing of &quot;The Prince.&quot; Many people find such abstractions of information and lack of favoritisms troubling, because it leaves so many unanswered questions, or more importantly, the question of who or which movements were or are right or wrong, unanswered.But that's where the reader needs to think. Some people and indeed some movements may have been right or wrong, but Hoffer is not the one to make such a judgment. You have to make those distinctions for yourself. And when you do make those choices, consider the many similarities those movements have with movements closer to your heart. It forces you to consider things at their essence, which is the same.&quot;The True Believer&quot; does not contain all the answers, but it shows the reader the way towards their personal choices and understanding in the matter. It's a book with potentially devastating prospects for the long closed-minded(who may risk shattering their belief/identity and being laid bare before themselves), but it leads many others to that higher sense of awareness needed to survive, even still in this day and age. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"This little book is a remarkable achievement. Written by Eric Hoffer who, at the time, was a dock worker with no formal education, it is one of the best treatments of the nature and effects of ideological fanaticism ever produced. The presentation, in short chapters - each demanding to be thought about carefully - is a synthesis of years of careful reading and research on Hoffer's part. It is a book that can be read and reread with each new reading shedding new insight on political and social issues of our time.That Hoffer went on to become something of an apologist for reactionary government response to many of the protest movements during the sixties - including the civil rights movement which he characterized as a 'racket' - should not blind anyone to the value of his first book. Its insights are still fresh and its wisdom is timeless. He, alas, didn't always take his own lessons to heart."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"It is an acknowledged fact that revolutions and most mass movements are not ignited by those on the lowest steps of society's ladder, but usually by middle-class intellectuals with intellectual weapons and leisure time. In order to gain supporters, these people idealize the masses and portray the poor and the meek as full of spirituality and virtues forgotten or perverted by the rich and successful. Sadly, the fact is there is no more spirituality in poverty than in wealth. At least not necessarily. Of course, the jet-set lifestyle may give you opportunities for expensive drugs or sophisticated sexual perversions, but in general where you can find the most depravity, promiscuosness and general spiritual misery is within the poorest classes. Now, you don't have to be poor to be frustrated, and it is with the latter that this book is concerned. One of its major attractions lies in the fact that it was written, alas, not by a middle-class intellectual but by a proletarian philosopher, a man who did physical labor all his life, mostly as a longshoreman at the docks of San Francisco. So, contrary to Lenin, Mao and Pol Pot, this particular philosopher knows what he's talking about.\\"Thoughts on the nature of mass movements\\" is the subtitle of this classic of social thought, first published in 1951 but never as extant as today. Exactly 50 years after being published, this book acquired a new relevance when some loonies blew up the WTC in NY, and then when middle-class, Britain-born youths boomed themselves -and a host of innocents- in the Lonodon subway. Many people thought then: What kind of people ruin their lives and those of others in such a gruesome way? Who are they? What can make you do that in the name of invisible gods or crazy doctrines? You need look no futher, the answer lies in this slim volume where no sentence is wasted, for all of them are full of wisdom.They are called the frustrated. Those who can not find their place in this world and hence they hate it. Who, by the way, as said before, are not the poorest of the poorest. The latter are more occupied looking what to eat and where to find shelter. As Hoffer says, they lead purposeful lives. It is rather those who have a glance at success, happiness and balance, but don't know how to achieve them and so hate the ones who manage to do so. In the words of Howard Bloom, the frustrated are the cells in the social tissue who, by not contributing, don't receive. The true believer is the empty individual -\\"the hollow men, the stuffed men\\" of T.S. Eliot-, who desperately cling to fallacious doctrines which give them a sense of belonging and a mission in life. The rest of us are busy looking after ourselves, our families and our social circles, and we move on with our lives. The rest of us fill our lives with knowledge, pleasures, personal aspirations, and we somehow surmount the obstacles according to our resources and capabilities. We believe, do, belong, but we also reflect, question, doubt, and refuse to give our lives to crazed tyrants. We are not fanaticals, but guys inserted in several communities, for better or for worse.One of the best books on philosophy that came from the wonderful but also terrible XX Century, its voice is more pertinent today than ever.

First published in 1951, it should be read today. It is on the psychology of mass movements and how they can transform practical purposes in to holy causes. Half the book is on the mental state of the fanatical true believer. Part 1 is about mass movements and their appeal. Part 2 is about the psychology of the potential convert. This believer will possess a belief in an irresistible power, whether it be Marxism (for Bolsheviks), Blitzkrieg (Nazis), Man's Reason (French Revolution), or Islam. In Part 3, Hoffer focuses on the factors that promote self sacrifice and the unifying effect that common hatred of a tangible enemy, suspicion, imitation, or other agents can have. The book closes with a discussion of good and bad mass movements. Especially interesting to the reader in late 2001 will be the discussion on the fervently enthusiastic adherents who are ready to die for the movement. The author begins with the hypothesis that frustrated people are drawn to mass movements in its revivalistic phase, and it is the frustration of the adherent that can be directed and channeled by the movement. He writes that the adherent will be discontented but not destitute, and believe that through their possession of a potent doctrine or infallible leader, they will possess irresistible power. Many will find mass movements appealing so that they can self-renunciate themselves, or rid themselves of the unwanted self; a lost faith in oneself is substituted for faith in the movement. In Hoffer's discussion of the interchangeability of movements, he goes on to posit that the adherent is ripe for any movement, and can be receptive to another movement (Attention Pakistan... redirection of adherents is possible)"},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"A truly great book, easy to read and provides a provocative analysis of fanaticism - promoters and joiners of political and religious movements.

This is probolly one of the 5 best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"This book is a real gem. To begin with, it is the first publication of an American legend: Eric Hoffer. A self-educated central valley farm worker and San Francisco longshoreman, Hoffer's abilities of self-expression are enviable and the penetrating insights of his writings are astonishing.He wrote this book in the early days of the Cold War and the specter of communism pervades the book from beginning to end. However, his central thesis is that mass movements - whether they are nationalist, religious, political or otherwise - are all essentially driven by the same types of people and all follow more-or-less the same organizational trajectory. Indeed, he frequently notes that the most likely recruits for one mass movement are members of another, even if they are diametrically apart in philosophy. For instance, Hoffer claims that Hitler, who hated communists with a passion that rivaled that he held for the Jews, viewed rank-and-file German Bolsheviks as valued targets to join the Nazi party.What makes \\"The True Believer\\" an important read today is how directly it applies to the current focus of American foreign policy: Islamic fundamentalism in general and specifically al-Qaeda. A Navy SEAL recently back from Afghanistan encouraged me to read \\"The True Believer\\" in the context of the War on Terror and I'm glad he did. It is amazing to read Hoffer and then a book like Lawrence Wright's Pulitzer Prize winning \\"The Looming Tower\\" about the genesis and development of al-Qaeda and the 9/11 plot. The parallels between al-Qaeda's history as told by Wright and Hoffer's hypothesis on the nature of mass movements is uncanny.Hoffer writes that mass movements start with a \\"man of letters\\" who has likely been rejected by his society in ways real or imagined and who has little appetite or ability to lead. In the case of al-Qaeda, the man of letters would be Sayyid Qutb, an Egyptian scholar who penned one of the most influential Islamist tracts ever - \\"Milestones\\" - and who was executed by the secular regime of Gamel Abu Naser in 1966.Next, Hoffer argues that the philosophy laid down by the man of letters is embraced by the \\"fanatic,\\" who has the charisma and will power to put the thoughts into action. For al-Qaeda, the fanatic role was played, of course, by Osama Bin Laden and to a lesser extent by Egyptian Ayman Zawahiri and Palestinian Sheikh Abdullah Azzam.The rank-and-file drawn to these movements, Hoffer writes, are rarely the most poor or desperate in society, but rather those just below a comfortable existence or those who have long felt an outsider or humiliated and long for an identity and redemption through a cause, almost any cause. It is known that most of the radicals drawn to al-Qaeda's banner are from prosperous families, well-educated and often have had interactions with the West.\\"The True Believer\\" is less than two hundred pages and can easily be read and digested in a few sittings. It should be noted that Hoffer's arguments are based almost solely on first-hand observations and his own voracious reading from public libraries up-and-down California. There is no scientific method to his research or academic rigor applied to his findings. I would imagine that mainstream sociologists in the academy sneer at Hoffer and his theses, but that is just an educated guess. Nevertheless, this is a classic that is absolutely worthwhile."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Hoffer's 150-page book is a classic that applies perfectly to our times. Hoffer hits the mark again and again with \\"Machiavellian detachment\\" as one reviewer said. Of fanatics, Hoffer wrote:\\"The effectiveness of a doctrine should not be judged by its profundity, sublimity or the validity of the truths it embodies, but by how thoroughly it insulates the individual from his self and the world as it is.\\"\\"The effectiveness of a doctrine does not come from its meaning but from its certitude.\\"\\"It is obvious, therefore, that in order to be effective a doctrine must not be understood, but has to be believed in. We can be absolutely certain only about things we do not understand. A doctrine that is understood is shorn of its strength.\\" (quotations from page 76)Very powerful and convincing reasoning!"},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Have you ever wondered why it is that people persist in believing in something even after all credibility has evaporated in believing that something?How is it that there are people who still adhere to Fascist,Marxist,Fundamentalist religion, and any number of ideologies and substitute religions?In a concise and dead-on-the-bullseye analysis,Eric Hoffer exposed the fanatic and the underpinnings of the psyche and life situations that compels even highly intelligent people to throw all rationality to the wind.The gross excesses of fundamentalist religion,Fascism,Marxism may have passed in their current incarnations,but as surely as man must have meaning in his life and there exists those who cannot provide their own meaning,the movements of identity politics,utopianism and authoritarianism will come upon us again and again.Hoffer didn't sugarcoat or give any pat answers to this problem.What he did do was give us this gift of a book,and that indeed was a great deed."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"\\"Believer\\" is insightful if not always well written. The disjointed nature of some one or two line sections leaves support for their conclusions vacant, making them rather pushy pronouncements. Hoffer does not allow devotion and dedication sourced in conviction and confidence. For Hoffer the holy cause is always a substitute for a loss of faith in oneself. What he does reveal for us, however, is the unification of seemingly unrelated things. Such flashes of connectivity between the apparently sovereign are the mark of brilliance not unlike the unification of religions and mythology provided by Campbell. In the continuing quest for understanding such clarifications are critical to grasping why humans are the way they are.The book's theme is that all mass movements - good or bad social, religious, national - share certain characteristics giving them a \\"family likeness\\". That is, mass movements generate a proclivity for united action (challengers not welcome), breed fanaticism, fervent hope, hatred, intolerance, release powerful human energy, demanding blind faith and single-hearted allegiance. Such features are common to any movement, be it Christianity, Political Correctness, Islam, Postmodernism, the Pensacola Movement, feminism, communism. \\"For though ours is a godless age, it is the very opposite of irreligious,\\" writes Hoffer. \\"The true believer is everywhere on the march\\", converting and antagonizing he shapes the world in his image.Sure to raise the hackles of many Hoffer writes, \\"The hammer and sickle or swastika are in a class with the cross.\\" But he does not mean they are equivalent movements, only that they have equivalent features. Parades are religious processions, all have articles of faith, saints, martyrs and holy sepulchers. (Ever see Lenin's tomb or the burial place of St Peter?) In a nutshell, this is human behavior with reason removed, or made a tool of the passions. Which is not to imply movements have no good rewards. As Hoffer notes, some have organized and others helped shake the West out of the Dark Ages.Carried along in the wake of zealots breaking ground are the \\"not so zealous\\" and those just plain unaware of their surroundings. Though what we today perceive as \\"normal\\", all of it is result of a variety of mass movements from the very advent of agriculture to the invention of the city as a dominant way of life. But Hoffer focuses on movements sprung from an idea, value or perception that are matters of the heart more than matters of technology or comfort.Interestingly, movements have stages of development from initial radicalism to eventual conservatism in which those attracted seek careers in the new order, not molding a new world but preserving the present. The zeal of experience, replaced by orthodoxy. Consider transitions in the Church from apostles to Bishops, 1917 Russia from revolution to rules of communist productivity, riots of 1960's America to the squelching of free speech by graying activists holding university chairs. \\"Believer\\" shines on these apparently disparate acts a new light."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Originally published over fifty years ago, Eric Hoffer's TRUE BELIEVER is a classic treatise on mass movements; breaking them down into their structure and necessary components.Hoffer's writing style is lucid and very easy to understand not academic. This diminutive book is a guide to the psychology and sociology of the mass movement. He analyzes the conditions necessary to foster a movement, the type of people necessary to lead and follow, why movements become difficult to resist. He explores what he considers classic examples including the Reformation, Puritan, America, French and Russian revolutions; he also touches on Christianity and Islam. He examines the rise of Nazism and fascism in the 1930's; the role a Hitler or Stalin plays in the movement and the different personalities necessary for it to succeed or fail. All major revolutions, \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\", contain common traits Hoffer reviews these characteristics in detail.I first read TRUE BELIEVER twenty plus years ago.

Hoffer, a self-educated long-shoreman, wrote the book in the aftermath of Nazi Germany and during the midst of the Cold War, when some in the West (read: the U.S. and the U.K.) were adherents of Joe Stalin's and Mao Tsetung's totalitarianism.Now, in the 21st century, those of us in the West who believe in liberal democracy face a major challenge from Islamofascists. Reading Hoffer today, one can only conclude that we've been here before, and that his analyses of why some become subscribers to totalitarian mass movements still have merit.Call \\"the true believer\\" a Nazi, a Communist, or an Islamofascist, it makes virtually no difference.

This book should be required reading for everyone, at least 3 times."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"The work tries to understand and explain, not pass judgment, on mass movements and their followers. Hoffer concentrates on the active phase of mass movements where the true believer has real influence. He cautions that although mass movements share many traits this does not imply that they're equally destructive or beneficent. Their appeal derives from the promise in their materialistic, religious, nationalist or blended natures. Intense, infectious emotion is the fuel. He analyses the various causes of the desire for change. Discontent alone is not enough; other factors are needed to activate it, like a sense of power and the ability to spread a vision of hope.Faith in a cause is to a large extent areplacementfor the individual's lost self-confidence. The movement offers a substitute for individual hope. Furthermore, movements are interchangeable to a surprising extent. As he puts it; \\"A Saul turning into a Paul is neither a rarity nor a miracle.\\" The reason is that they attract the same mentality. Antidotes include arrangements that discourage atomistic individualism or offers opportunities for action or new beginnings, like emigration. Creative expression is a potent protector: even the poor that are creatively involved are immune, as are the abjectly poor and members of close-knit family, tribal or religious groups.Potential converts are the disaffected, identified as misfits, outcasts, minorities, adolescents, the ambitious, the obsessed, the impotent in mind or body, certain categories of the poor, the extremely selfish, the bored and the sinners. Hoffer explains that the burden of freedom aggravates frustration in certain individuals. The followers exchange their individual responsibility for the sense of redemption that the movement offers. Those who feel like failures value equality and fraternity much more than freedom. This illuminatesRussia's regressioninto totalitarianism and thepassivity of Europeans.Another striking insight is that that visions, dreams and utopian hopes are powerful weapons; people will die for delusions. Craving/desire is what causes the reckless self-sacrifice. Movements always target the family; Hoffer provides proof by quoting from inter alia theNew Testament. Disruption of the family makes the person more dependent on the movement. Movements attract and retain followers due to the refuge they offer from the boredom, barrenness, anxiety and lack of meaning in the individual's life.There are various species of misfit - the permanent misfit finds peace only in a total separation from the self. The extraordinarily selfish are likely to be the most fanatical champions of selflessness. Oddly, spinsters & middle aged women have played a crucial role in the birth of mass movements. Emotions like remorse and grievance appear to lead people in the same direction. Fervent enthusiasm helps to suppress a guilty conscience. United action and self-sacrifice are the elements that determine the vigor of a movement. Both sublimate the blemished self. Ways of persuading people to fight and die for the cause include:(a) separating them from the real self by means of assimilation into the collective(b) creating a make-believe self or a collective show(c) making them hate the present and worship the future; the present is not only portrayed as miserable but is deliberately made so(d) separating them from reality with the wall of dogma. Observation & experience are rejected in favor of doctrine which provides certitude.(e) Keeping them in a state of fanaticism by inflaming passions & breaking down the will, thus transforming them into automatons. Reason is ineffective in trying to free a fanatic from these mental chains.Hoffer's view of how different political persuasions view past, present and future is an interesting aside: The conservative is like the skeptic, echoing the thoughts of Ecclesiastes about nothing new under the sun whilst the liberal (Hoffer means the Classical Liberal, not today's leftist types) considers the present the legitimate offspring of the past, a springboard towards a better future.On the other hand, both thereactionaryand the radical hate the present. They differ only in their opinion on human nature's potential for change. The radical is convinced that human nature is perfectible whilst the reactionary believes the opposite. Fanatics occupy the same space on the political spectrum which is circular, not linear. The real difference is between the fanatics and the moderates of all ideologies. It is the temperament, not the ideological content that is crucial: fanatics often move from one form of extremism to another: communism, fascism, xenophobic nationalism, religious intolerance.Sinisterismby Bruce Walker offers more insight into this phenomenon.The unifying agents are hatred, imitation, brainwashing (although Hoffer believes that the power ofPropagandais overrated and that it merely justifies & articulates opinions already present in the minds of recipients), leadership, action and suspicion. His observations on the impulse to convert are most arresting. The missionary zeal emanates from a profound uncertainty, an aching inner void. Proselytizing is a search for something; a quest to confirm that the fanatic's faith is indeed the absolute truth.Three personality types are influential in mass movements: (a) men of words (b) fanatics (c) men of action. The first prepares the ground, the second initiates/dominates the active phase and the 3rd consolidates. Hoffer remarks that the first, whether they bejournalists, academics or priests, thirst for recognition & a status above the rest of mankind. They are often the first victims of what they have unleashed. The fanatic thrives on chaos & destruction. The man of action rescues the movement from the recklessness of the fanatic; when he assumes control the active phase comes to an end.In conclusion, Hoffer discusses good & bad movements, the sterility of the active phase and some factors that determine its length, plus examples of benevolent mass movements. The book concludes with notes arranged by chapter. It remains a masterpiece and a valuable contribution to the disciplines of politics, psychology, sociology and theology."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"The True Believer is a genuinely brilliant book that is even more pertinent today than when it was first published more than fifty years ago. Eric Hoffer, one of recent history's most accomplished autodidact's, wrote about a world in which social anchorages and cultural standards were more and more difficult to find.Much as with Durkheim in his accounts of anomie (cultural deregulation) and egoism (social deracination), Hoffer affirmed that human beings, by their very nature, find socially and culturally unstable circumstances unbearable. As a result, when we are offered plausible claims to certainty and rejection of relativism as manifest in a group and its code, we are eager to join. The fanaticism shown by those willing to die for a cause bespeaks both our need for cultural stability and membership, and the scarcity of these phenomena in the modern world.In this view, efforts to understand the motives that persuade Islamic -- or any other kind -- of terrorists to undertake martyrdom missions have nothing to do with anticipated heavenly rewards. Instead, as perhaps with those who destroyed the twin towers of the world trade center, horrific acts manifest a firm embrace of belonging and belief in a culturally chaotic and socially fragile universe.Though he was a voracious reader, I doubt that Hoffer ever read Durkheim. The insights as to the social and cultural conditions that engender fanaticism are his and his alone. This is especially impressive because Hoffer was able to overcome what I take to be a sort of commonsense methodological individualism that pervades our society. Hoffer was able to think in terms of collective phenomena, the sort of things that Durkheim referred to as social facts, facts that have their provenance in our social and cultural context, not in the perhaps-troubled interior lives of individuals.In his later years, Hoffer was Lyndon Johnson's guest at the White House. His Truman-Johnson-Humphrey populism was broadcast nationwide in a prime time interview with Eric Sevareid. He dismissed Ronald Reagan (then governor of California) as B movie actor, affirming that \\"California is not a B movie.\\"Not long before his death, Hoffer noted that with age \\"the muscles of the mind grow slack.\\" When he wrote The True Beleiver, however, he was a brilliant and original thinker in his prime."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"I first read this at the tender age of seventeen, in 1963, and there is no question that it has informed my world view ever since.

It still may be. This book is really quite deep and more than a bit esoteric. Its philosophies are timeless. All the same, since this book in a most accurate fashion, speaks of human nature, it is extremely informative no matter what time epoch in which it is read. I read this book about once every ten years and I am amazed how reflective it is no matter what events are transpiring at the time. Since human nature has changed little in the last hundred years, the truisms stated by the author are universally applicable. I wish to suggest that if one had read this book before the election, that person very likely would have predicted an Obama victory. The book and the author addresses itself to mass movements. At the same time, one can readily ascertain individual psychology as well as national and even world sociological trends."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"If you want to understand fundamentalists of all stripes, marxists, fascists, cult members, terrorists, and others who commit themselves to movements, read this marvelous book.One of the most powerful books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"The reviewer, with his hip Michael Moore attitude, obviously didn't understand the book. He makes reference to the Nazis wanting to surrender to the Allies rather than the Soviets--um, did Hitler/Goebbels/Himmler surrender to *anyone*? The nonideological soldiers, the middle men, they weren't the \\"true believers\\", the members of the mass movement who articulated the vision of the Third Reich, who invested their egos into the identity of National Socialism, went down w/ the ship. The suicide rate amongst Germans at the end of WWII was higher than the suicide rate amongst Jews in the concentration camp. Not everyone living under a tyrannical minority is a member of a mass movement, not everyone is a \\"true believer\\". As Hoffer said so himself, \\"The game of history is usually played by the best and the worst over the heads of the majority in the middle.\\" Yeah, the previous reviewer sure did read this book, didn't he!As for the interchangability between Nazis and Commies--it often happened, however it requires some amount of cognitive dissonance to trigger the change. A traumatic event, or a revelation. We see it often on the scale of American culture--David Horowitz and David Brock, Dennis Miller and Ariana Huffington, for example. Fundamentalist Christians become militant atheists. Militant atheists become fundamentalist Christians.Hoffer's conclusion does not differ much from a LEFT wing psychoanalyst, Erich Fromm, who articulated similair views about tribalism as the result of individual narcissism sublimated into group narcissism. They seem to be working on the same wavelength, at least when it comes to group think, group psychosis.\\"A man is likely to mind his own business when it was worth minding. When it is not, he takes his mind off of his own meaningless affairs by minding other people's business.\\"\\"Mass movements can rise and spread without the belief in God, but never without belief in a devil.\\" Gee, what irrational side of the political spectrum does *that* describe? ABB?\\"Those who find no difficulty in decieving themselves are easily decieved by others.\\"Hoffer is not perfect and he stretches on some points. He also approaches mass movements from an amoral point of view--ie, if there was some group out there that miraculously had the truth w/ a capital T, whether divine or scientific in a Grand Unified Theory way, it would still be just like other mass movements preying on the same psychological weaknesses. This book is about human nature and the tribal instinct, not specific moral values. A masterpiece nonetheless, that dissects much of the current worldwide political climate."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"I cannot recommend this book often enough to family and friends who are perplexed by the current state of world affairs. Hoffer directs the attention of the reader away from the particular grievance that every demagogue and his followers have had since the dawn of history, and instead helps us to understand the dynamic at work.More learned scholars than I have written about this in other reviews. All I would like to add is this: The moral of this book is that, whenever a politician, preacher or other leader addresses a crowd in tones intended to whip up rage and hatred, be suspicious (even if he or she is \\"on your side.\\") In other words: It's not Osama or Mao or The Grand Inquisitor or Stalin that's the problem (nor Islam, Communism, Christianity or Socialism)--it's the way they manipulate masses of people in order to gain power.This wisdom is paralleled by mystic teachings in the holy Jewish text known as the Zohar or Kabbalah. In it, we learn that all evil behavior eminates from the Godly attribute of Justice. In other words--when the Lord seeks to right injustice, it is holy. When people seek to do so, what often results is a mob exacting revenge.I am thinking of this book a great deal as election rhetoric whips up to a feverish pitch and some individuals urge their supporters to revile \\"unpatriotic\\" Americans who hold different views.

It is written by a scholar who refused to be involved with academia. To give you an understanding of Hoffer, he thought that academia's whole purpose was to be obscure and inaccessible to the layman.

I recently re-read it. If you want an understanding of fanatical believers, and there seems to be more of them today then in 1951, then Hoffer's book is a must. What makes a true believer willing to die for the cause? What makes them believe that women, children, casual passerby's should be killed along with themselves? Many modern experts seem to believe that therapy will cure the fanatic - such statements makes one wonder if they've ever been in dangerous situations, or even something slightly more than a shouting match. The author was a self-educated longshoreman. I don't know if he had been in any fights, but the working conditions along the wharfs in the '40's and 50's were a bit more primitive than they are today. Hoffer claims that a fanatic can be converted to another fanatical cause, but cannot be converted to non-fanaticism. If true, and I suspect he is, then it makes what to do with fanatics a bit sticky."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"I have probably recommended Hoffer's 'True Believer' more than any other book I've ever read. His thoughts are, at the same time deeply insightful, chilling and ring of underlying truths about human nature. Hoffer dissects, as under a microscope, the essential nature of the fanatic i.e. the searcher, dissatisfied with himself, who always longs for self-completion and seizes it--avidly--in the form of intense belief. As such, he is not amenable to logic. He is blind to reality and can only feel the 'truth' of the great cause that he has immersed himself in.Logic means nothing, belief and conviction mean everything. He lusts for the total committment and sometimes the self-immolation that comes from blind belief. Hoffer has the profound insight that 'True Believers', no matter their political or religious stripe; no matter their lethal animosities, are essentially the same people. They are the same people, two sides of the same coin, and as such, are totally and sometimes devastatingly interchangeable. Hitler claimed, in \\"Mein Kampf\\" that his primary source of converts was fanatical Communists. He had no use for the more lukewarm Social and Christian Democrats. They were, by nature, fence sitters. According to Hoffer: 'You cannot convince a true believer; only convert him.'Hitler, a man who understood the power and weakness of the True Believer as much as anyone, eschewed logic and reason. Instead he promoted the sheer emotionalism of sheer 'belonging', faith and consolidarity with a mass movement--loss of individuality--that the true believer and fanatic could totally immerse himself in.The Christian-Killing Saul, on the road to Damascus, becomes an instant, devout and fanatical convert to the religion he had been persecuting. He became Paul, the defender of the Resurrected Christ. \\"What is the Opposite of a fanatical Religionist?\\" Hoffer asks us. \\"Atheist?\\" \\"No.\\" answers Hoffer. \\"The atheist and religionist are fellows in fanatical faith.\\" The opposite states Hoffer is the gentle agnostic.Much of the grief and death of the Twentieth Century, and now extending into the Twenty-First century, is the product of 'True Believers.' Communism, Fascism, Naziism, Radical Islam--all demonstrably false and failed philosophies that have generated tsunammis of faith and fanatism. Entire peoples have been sacrificed on their altars. The more demonstrably fictitious is a belief, a faith, the more ferventaly its admirers cling to it. Reason is nothing. Belief is everything and, there, lies the continuing tragedy of the human race.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico"},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Hoffer focuses on the active phase of mass movements, the one dominated by the true believer. Frustration seems to be inherent in this personality type. He cautions that although mass movements share many traits this does not imply that they're equally toxic or beneficent. The work tries to understand and explain, not pass judgment.Their appeal derives from the promise in their materialistic, religious, nationalist ormixednatures. Intense, infectious emotion is required as fuel. Hoffer analyses the causes of the desire for change: discontent alone is not enough. Other factors are needed to activate it, like a sense of power and the ability to spread a vision of hope.Faith in a cause is to a large degree areplacementfor the individual's lost self-confidence. The movement offers a substitute for individual hope. Furthermore, movements are interchangeable to a surprising extent. As he puts it; \\"A Saul turning into a Paul is neither a rarity nor a miracle.\\" The reason is that they attract the same mentality.Antidotes include arrangements that discourage atomistic individualism or offers opportunities for action or new beginnings, like emigration. Creative expression is a potent protector: even the poor that are creatively involved are immune, as are the abjectly poor and members of close-knit family, tribal or religious groups.Potential converts are the disaffected. Hoffer identifies them as misfits, outcasts, minorities, adolescents, the ambitious, the obsessed, the impotent in mind or body, certain categories of the poor, the extremely selfish, the bored and the sinners.He explains the burden of freedom, how it aggravates frustration in certain individuals. The followers exchange their individual responsibility for the sense of redemption that the movement offers. Those who feel like failures value equality and fraternity much more than freedom. This illuminatesRussia's regressioninto totalitarianism.Another striking insight is that that visions, dreams and utopian hopes are powerful weapons; people will die for delusions. Craving/desire is what causes the reckless self-sacrifice.Movements always target the family; Hoffer provides proof by quoting from inter alia the New Testament. Disruption of the family makes the person more dependent on the movement. Movements attract and retain followers due to the refuge they offer from the boredom, barrenness, anxiety and lack of meaning in the individual's life.There are various species of misfit - the permanent misfit finds peace only in a total separation from the self. The extraordinarily selfish are likely to be the most fanatical champions of selflessness. Oddly, spinsters & middle aged women have played a crucial role in the birth of mass movements. Emotions like remorse and grievance appear to lead people in the same direction. Fervent enthusiasm helps to suppress a guilty conscience.United action and self-sacrifice are the elements that determine the vigor of a movement. Both sublimate the blemished self. Ways of persuading people to fight and die for the cause include:(a) separating them from the real self by means of assimilation into the collective(b) creating a make-believe self or a collective show(c) making them hate the present and worship the future; the present is not only portrayed as miserable but is deliberately made so(d) separating them from reality with the wall of dogma. Observation & experience are rejected in favor of doctrine which provides certitude. It is believed in, not understood.(e) Keeping them in a state of fanaticism by inflaming passions & breaking down the will, thus transforming them into automatons. Constant fanning of the flames prevents the attainment of inner balance. Reason is ineffective in trying to free a fanatic from these mental chains.Hoffer's view of how different political persuasions view past, present and future is an interesting aside: The conservative is like the skeptic, echoing the thoughts of Ecclesiastes about nothing new under the sun whilst the liberal (Hoffer means the Classical Liberal, not today's leftist types) considers the present the legitimate offspring of the past, a springboard towards a better future.On the other hand, both thereactionaryand the radical hate the present. They differ only in their opinion on human nature's potential for change. The radical is convinced that human nature is perfectible whilst the reactionary believes the opposite.Fanatics occupy the same space on the political spectrum which is circular, not linear. The real difference is between the fanatics and the moderates of all ideologies. It is the temperament, not the ideological content that is crucial: fanatics often move from one form of extremism to another: communism, fascism, xenophobic nationalism, religious intolerance.Sinisterismby Bruce Walker offers more insight into this phenomenon.The unifying agents arehatred, imitation, brainwashing (although Hoffer believes that the power of propaganda is overrated and that it merely justifies & articulates opinions already present in the minds of recipients), leadership, action and suspicion.His observations on theimpulse to convertare most arresting. The missionary zeal emanates from a profound uncertainty, an aching inner void. Proselytizing is a search for something instead of a gift, a quest to confirm that the fanatic's faith is indeed the absolute truth.Three personality types are influential in mass movements: (a) men of words (b) fanatics (c) men of action. The first prepares the ground, the second initiates/dominates the active phase and the 3rd consolidates. Hoffer remarks that the first, whether they be journalists, academics or priests, thirst for recognition & a status above the rest of mankind. They are often the first victims of what they have unleashed. The fanatic thrives on chaos & destruction. The man of action rescues the movement from the recklessness of the fanatic; when he assumes control the active phase comes to an end.In conclusion, Hoffer discusses good & bad movements, the sterility of the active phase and some factors that determine its length, plus useful mass movements. The book concludes with notes arranged by chapter, a portrait and brief biography of the author."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Hoffer's insights are objective and sharp.

And the author says at the end of his introduction that he is making \\"suggestions and arguments\\" not categorical assertions. To me he is saying I'm a fairly knowledgeable person and here are some things that seem obvious to me. That's not typically the kind of book that I would be likely to read, but still it's a much more honest and useful book than one that relies on lies, omissions, and misrepresentations as a way to try to influence the reader.So back to that statement by the critic. First, the book isn't about people who are dissatisfied with their lot, it's about people who are dissatisfied with themselves. The author specifically makes this distinction on numerous occasions and in many ways, so I don't know how the critic could have missed it. Second this book isn't about seeking a change, it is a book about \\"the true believer\\" who joins the mob, the mass movement, not so much to produce a change but to abdicate responsibility. I'm surprised that the critic missed that this book is about mass movements and the \\"true believer\\". I would have thought that might have been evident from the title and sub-title alone.Here's a quote from the author that does a better job of making my point than I can:\\"The freedom the masses crave is not freedom of self-expression and self realization, but freedom from the intolerable burden of an autonomous existence. They want freedom from 'the fearful burden of free choice', freedom from the arduous responsibility of realizing their ineffectual selves and shouldering the blame for the blemished product. They do not want freedom of conscious, but faith -- blind, authoritarian faith. They sweep away the old order not to create a society of free and independent men, but to establish uniformity, individual anonymity and a new structure of perfect unity.\\"This sort of mass movement has happened multiple times before, including in the very recent past, and, since people never learn, it will no doubt happen again, probably sooner rather than later. I think the value of this book is not so much as a preventative, since in all probability irrational mass movements are due to aspects of human nature that make them impossible to prevent, but rather to stimulate those of us that are comfortable enough with ourselves that joining a mob to raise a fist in the air would never appeal to us to think about what drives others to join mass movements and what is the likely progression of a mass movement so we won't be surprised and mystified when we find ourselves in the midst of one."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Although written over half-century ago, Hoffer's observations about mass movements are as insightful, thought provoking and useful today as then.

Eric Hoffer explains how mass movements and discontent are fueled by the increasingly lack of creative jobs available to workers...how the growing feeling of rejection develops as one falls further and further away from 'mainstream society' economically, socially and educationally...how one becomes a fanatic about social change in the quest to regain his sense of self and purpose."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"I read this book in High School and again in college for a cults class back in the 1970 and 1980s.

Just about every 4 years prior to election time, I recommend this book to various people that are wondering about how we got where we are politically. They always come back saying, Wow, I understand so much better now.I can not say enough about the depths of this book. I wish I was a better writer of reviews so that I could do it justice, but many folks here have already written awesome prose on the topic...If you have not read it, I hope you will. At 190+ pages it has way more information than you would assume would be in such a little book."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"When I first started reading this book, I did so on the assumption that Hoffer was talking about the negatives only of the \\"true believer\\" and mass movements, and it is evident that much of the focus is on the negative aspects, which are abundant. However, Hoffer does conclude in various places, including the end of the book, that mass movements (with the fanaticism) are sometimes what it takes to renovate stale societies, or societies in need of drastic change, even though many evils tend to occur in the process. While I agree with much of what he states in the book, he does tend to oversimplify many aspects of belief and fanaticism, and I cannot agree that the preferred method or instrument of change is a fanatical mass movement, regardless of how quickly the results may come.Many times through the reading of this book, I was reminded of many things from my religious past, and wished I could have read this many years earlier, but in those years, I may not have been receptive to much of it. That thought also reminds me that Hoffer considered atheism a religion in this book, and while I suppose some may treat their atheism as a religion, I am reminded of the phrases \\"atheism is a religion like baldness is a hair color\\" and \\"atheism is a religion like not collecting stamps is a hobby.\\" Anyone who lacks a belief in a god is by definition an atheist, but Hoffer may have been meaning the evangelical atheism in which some atheists have to convince everyone else there is no god, a practice that approaches the nature of the \\"true believer\\" spoken of in this book.There were also clear parallels to how things have been in recent years in the United States with the Bush administration, 9/11, and the war on terror. I was reminded of how so many young people flocked to the military recruiters so they could take part in the frenzy to end terror or strike back against those that dared to inflict such pain on our country. That was at least the excuse, but the mass movement surely had different reasons and different effects, and one can only logically realize that those in power are willing to use the religiosity or fanaticism of the masses for their own ends...from the leadership of the terrorists to the leadership here."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"This brilliant--and terse--understanding of all mass movements, their development, leaders, joiners, and rationale must be read by all who would understand this ancient and contemporary phenomenon.

And he ended up in the psyche of an insecure and frustrated individual.His non-academic background largely contributed the book's originality since he was not strait-jacketed by the dominant thoughts in his times. Though some might feel uncomfortable with his sweeping generalisations without the rigors of scientific analysis, I do not see it as a major defect since the subject matter is unique and difficult to duplicate under control environment.All in all, this is a brilliant and deeply insightful book for anyone who wants to peek into what lurks inside the minds of true believers or anyone who wishes to lead them."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Hoffer's analysis of mass movements is timeless.

The Soviet Union was at its apogee, having just extended control over Eastern Europe and developed the atomic bomb.It is amazing how much this self educated man expects his readers to know. He makes extensive references to biblical history, Roman and Greek history, and European and European philosophers from the time of the Enlightenment forward. Simply reading the books he cites in his footnotes would comprise a better liberal education than any American university offers today.His work had good predictive power. He called the reasons for the demise of the Soviet Union - it grew soft from the inside. He draws a critical distinction among the phases in a revolution. Writers sew the seeds, preparing the intellectual environment for change. Fanatics, with a grand disregard for lives, history, or anything except their grand ideal, come to the fore when the moment is right and lead the great revolution. They are succeeded by practical men of action who implement, institutionalize, bureaucratized and enforce the new order.This short diagnosis of the third Reich is that it might have survived if the fanatic who got it started, Adolf Hitler, had died during the 30s has been replaced by a practical man of action. He attributes the longevity of the Soviet Union to this kind of good fortune. Vladimir Lenin died, being replaced by the scheming Joseph Stalin who was practical, at least about holding onto power.The questions of our day are rising populism among the Andean nations in South America, increasing discontent with the liberal regimes throughout Western Europe and a nativist desire to throw out the immigrants and give up on the Brussels experiment, and especially the Arab spring. A surprising phenomenon in the Arab spring is that we do not see charismatic leaders coming to the fore to take advantage of the chaos which has followed the fall of the long-standing regimes and dynasties in North Africa and the Middle East. Hoffer tells you what to look for - the characteristics of the emergent Trotsky or Lenin.I recommend this highly to younger readers. It evokes a very protean era of American history, one in which I as a schoolboy was led to live in constant fear of the Red Menace, and then the ChiComs, and more or less inevitable annihilation by nuclear war. Hoffer saw his era clearly, and has penetrating insights on the nature of political man."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"In an age of electing people based on star qualities, Hoffer shows the parallels we share with the Europeans (and Americans) of the 1930's.

Few can overcome the deficiencies resulting from being a drop out. I would hesitate in flippantly recommending this lifestyle.

However, some readers misunderstand it. The subtitle of the book is \\"Thoughts on The Nature of Mass Movements.\\" The author, Eric Hoffer, is not referring to reform movements nor \\"social movements\\" such as the campaigns for civil rights, woman's suffrage, or the abolition of slavery. He is talking about completely revolutionary movements, which totally overthrow the existing order and install their own order and vision. Throughout the book he constantly uses the Nazis and the Bolsheviks as examples. There is no reason to assume that people who embark on reforming society are similar to those whose intent is to completely remake society in their own image. Another misunderstanding is that the author is opposed to mass movements or true believers. This misunderstanding is partly the author's fault. Clearly he is not a true believer of any sort. He has an independent mind and has a tendency to look down on true believers and fanatics. Yet he also, late in the book, makes it clear that revolutionary mass movements are necessary to historical progress, despite the pain and apparent evil which they seem to generate.This book was published in 1951 and thus explains the authors frequent reference to Nazis and Communists. I am not sure that it provides insight into the minds of international terrorists, although I suspect that it can. Hoffer uses no psychological language -- a relief and a problem. This lack of psychological terms means that he puts his insights into easy to understand terms. This is not a textbook. On the other hand, Hoffer also is unable to backup his insights with psychological research. Mostly he seems to have relied on his own observations and wide reading. He also frequently repeats himself.

This book was written in 1951, made famous when cited by Eisenhower during a press conference, and just as relevant today as when it was conceived.Both straightforward and riveting, The True Believer lays bare the essential and unifying characteristics of all mass movements and their appeal to certain frustrated minds. Hoffer explains the various phases of mass movements, the mindsets of individuals who join them, and how reactions to the movements perpetuate more mass movements.This should be on everyone's bookshelf (placed in between Machiavelli and the Declaration of Independence)."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"This is a truly great piece of philosophical writing.

You'll find your faith somewhat shaken too. Not you're faith in God but in His churches"},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Eric Hoffer's The True Believer, Thoughts On The Nature Of Mass Movements, was a required text in my high school back in the late fifties. I have just finished re-reading it, and it is as useful and illuminating as it ever was.Hoffer was a longshoreman, a kind of auto-didact, a non-academic thinker and propounder of ideas who found an audience in post-war America, an America which was tired of the terrors of war and sought to understand how such frightening ideologies could get started in the first place. This interest came at the height of Stalin's Soviet Union's early post-war expansionist imperialism, and at the end of Hitler's failed Third Reich. The best thing about The True Believer is that it is an antidote, and a cautionary tale, to these two great tyrannies: how they worked, how they were constructed, and what happens to them.I think that this book is still very pertinent today, especially with regard to the Islamic world's activities against the West. It also exposes the roots and causes of any mass movement, not just political or religious ones. Hoffer sees a continuing thread, a commonality, among all mass movements. How do they attract acolytes? What kind of people do they appeal to? How does the leader of a mass movement keep his adherents in the fold? What are the roots of its disintegration and demise?This book is short. It is also somewhat repetitive, but I found the repetition to be a good tool to keep the reader aligned with the basic elements by restating them again in a slightly different caste each time. I would recommend the reading of this book in conjunction with the reading of any book which seeks to unravel the threads of tyranny and modern-day terrorism that hound our world.One caveat: the book is over fifty years old. Some of it is archaic. There are also some wrong, I think, conclusions about some things. So when you read it, feel free to disagree. It is what makes the book so good. It is possible to pick out flaws yet still benefit from the broad overview put forth by the unredoubtable Hoffer. A good basic book for the reader of history and of the psychology of groups and movements."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"A few insights struck me as particularly noteworthy:1. How aggressive mass movements such as Communism and Islamic radicalism differ from the would-be lunatic movements in American politics today. Hoffer points out that a truly vigorous mass movement requires self-sacrifice - but even the most devoted tree-hugger, Bush-worshipper or anti-abortionist is unlikely to want to be blown up for their cause of choice.2. Hoffer foreshadows the collapse of Communism, by suggesting that a dictatorship's most dangerous moment is when it relaxes its restraints. Communism survived Stalin, but not Gorbachev. A logical inference: North Korea is probably more stable than China.3. Hoffer's analysis of the difference between conservatives/liberals and radicals/reactionaries. The conservative and the liberal both revere the present. The conservative \\"doubts that the present can be bettered\\" while the liberal \\"sees the present as the legitimate offspring of the past and as constantly growing and changing toward an improved future.\\" By contrast, the \\"radical and the reactionary loathe the present [and] see it as an aberration and the deformity.\\" The reactionary differs from the radical by seeking to recreate the past, but even this difference may be illusory because the reactionary's \\"image of the past is based less on what it actually was than on what he wants the future to be.\\" Today, the American Right seems dominated by the latter rather than the former, seeking to remake government (if not society) by crushing it with debt.I agree with most of the positive comments. Certainly, Hoffer's generalities are not universally applicable: but Hoffer himself anticipates these problems, stating that the typical 2-star reviewer \\"is likely to feel that much has been exaggerated and much ignored. But this is not an authoritative textbook. It is a book of thoughts, and it does not shy away from half-truths so long as they seem to hint at a new approach and to formulate new questions.\\"The 2-star reviewer wrote that totalitarians \\"subdue and rule through force\\" rather than through belief. But this analysis begs the question: how do these totalitarians take over in the first place? Usually on the backs of an army of true believers, who then oppress the apolitical masses.But Hoffer does fail to address the death of mass movements: how did fanatics stop becoming fanatics after (for example) the defeat of Nazis and Japanese ultranationalists in WW 2?"},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"The true- believer lives by radical hope, by despising the present and living for the future. Closed- minded and following a charismatic leader he lives by myth and slogan more than by actually encountering and observing reality. Indoctrinated to despise his own individual happiness the True Believer is willing to sacrifice his individuality and even his life for the Collective Ideal. The True Believer is Mass Man, the Mass Man of Fascism, and of Communism, and also according to Hoffer of movements which historically have been more benign.This is Hoffer's first and most well- known work. With it he gave the world a concept.Clearly he is in the camp of a different kind of person, the individual thinking person concerned with his happiness and that of his family.This book is rich in ideas and a pleasure and inspiration to read."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Eric Hoffer prefaces this book by noting that it contains his thoughts, not proven theories, on mass movements. After reading the book and seeing the many similarities he describes on the nazi movement, fascism, the catholic church, mormons, the American and French revolutions, I realized he may be on to something. I am sure many will be upset to see that the nazis and catholics have a lot more in common then they do differences. Thats not meant to offend, just to point out that both groups use very similar recruiting processes to grow the flock. Knowing how a person thinks and what motivates them is a great way to get them to join your team.His thoughts on the factors promoting self-sacrifice and the identification with the collective whole has hit the bullseye in my opinion. I have never really understood kamikazes, or more recently suicide bombers, but now I have a clearer picture into their thought process. If you wipe out the identity of the individual and get them to identify with the group, it makes it easier to get them give up their lives for the good of the group.

These extremists are of the same caste as the Nazi whom Hoffer quotes as wanting to be &quot;free from freedom,&quot; and they worship a doctrine which they assume &quot;is a master key to the world's problems,&quot; a doctrine which will be neither intelligible nor verifiable, but which demands total self-sacrifice such that it can extend even to martyrdom.According to Hoffer, all contemporary true believers &quot;whether Communist, Nazi, Fascist...&quot; deem that &quot;Western...democracies are old, corrupt and decadent&quot; and &quot;are no match for the virile congregations of the faithful who are about to inherit the earth.&quot; The author goes on to reveal the woeful consequences which fanaticism and mass movements engender.The reader will understand before he moves very far along in this remarkable book, why Hoffer preceded the text of it with this quote from Genesis: &quot;And slime had they for mortar.&quot;This longshoreman/philosopher has made a vital contribution to our heritage of liberty, and this work can serve as an essential introduction for all those who wish to understand the nature of fanaticism - the age-old enemy of freedom and of free people.It is clear and concise; it can be read in just a few evenings. Add this treasure to your personal library and rest assured that it is even more relevant today then when it was first published, astonishingly, 50 years ago (1951)."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"I find it telling that some of the best insights into human thought come from people without psychological or even scientific backgrounds.

I can't help but wonder why some people just don't get it. Hoffer is not saying that his theory explains everything but it certainly helps to understand the nature of true believers more than it hurts!Some people just hate ice cream and Santa Claus!To all you negative reviewers: Instead of displaying your ignorance of what Mr. Hoffer is saying why not try to understand that which you obviously misunderstand? You might learn something instead of simply trashing a valuable idea. I know it takes some effort to actually think but it may be worth it in the long run. Unless the negative reviews are written by TRUE BELIEVERS, that is."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"The thinking of the true believer is straight-forward: since we know THE TRUTH or THE RIGHT WAY, it would be wrong to question it.Eric Hoffer was surely familiar with Reich's The Mass Psychology of Fascism, self-published in 1932, and with Adorno, et al The Authoritarian Personality, a massive study published in 1950. Both books focused on nazism. Eric Hoffer in 1951 was the first to point out that the personality peculiarities identified by Reich and studied by Adorno and his associates also occurred in Communists as well as in religious fundamentalists. This caused massive condemnation of this book by a lot of people at the time. (Guess who?) But Rokeach's experiments throughout the \`50s, published as The Open and Closed Mind in 1960 and sociologist Seymour Lipsett's study of working-class authoritarianism worried them even more, since they were based on hard science.Thanks in part to this book, everyone in the \`50s and \`60s was made aware of fanaticism, authoritarianism and closed-mindedness, and the watchword of the day became \\"prejudice,\\" judging before getting evidence or accepting a statement without evidence. Prejudice was said to be responsible for racism. The solution was integration which would provide familiarity, which would reduce prejudice, which would eliminate racism. And it did result in decreases of racism until the death of Dr. King. Nobody talks about prejudice anymore. They talk only about racism. Why?There is no way to educate true believers. They judge information by whether it agrees with what they already believe. (And this of course is by definition prejudice.) The right-wing of conservatism continues to provide true believers, and Political Correctness has given us a new generation of true believers. Islam is another prime example of true believers.None of these people want anyone to know what prejudice is. This is why prejudice is no longer talked about or taught to students, although they hear ad nauseum about racism. And since students are taught to reject the concept of evidence and are discouraged from taking science courses, there is no way that their beliefs can ever be questioned. (See While America Sleeps: How ... and Indoctrination Are Destroying America From Within --While America Sleeps: How Islam, Immigration and Indoctrination Are Destroying America From Withinfor the full account.)Still, Eric Hoffer's The True Believer is written is such a common-sensical way, it may cause the first stirrings of thought, even in high school and college students. And students who are not fully converted to Political Correctness or to Conservatism will find this book the most eye-opening experience of their lives up to this point.So, give this book to someone you love!"},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"I was fortunate enough to hear Eric Hoffer speak in the 1960's,I was just a little kid but his clarity and personal power made such an impression I still remember him to this day.After 9/11 I started seeing reviews of this book crop up again and I bought it and read it. I am glad I did.In a straightforward style he talks about the minds of fanatics of any stripe and looks for the common elements that you will find in the followers of Jim Jones or Osama Bin Laden. He makes a compelling case that people who feel that their own lives are pointless and they cannot make a difference in the world ally themselves with huge, great causes and subsume their own selves into the great cause.He makes concrete lists of characteristics that you will recognize in people you meet every day, encounter in the letters-to-the editor columns of your newspaper as well as those that have closed themselves off in a cult or mass movement.I found the book said things that several months after reading it I still think of often. I highely suggest that anyone read it."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Eric Hoffer's THE TRUE BELIEVER is a handy little book which gives a concise explanation the rise of totalitarianism during the 20th century. Hoffer gives explanations why \\"normal\\" people join mass movements, and the explanations can be frightening.Hoffer is clear that mass movements appeal not only to the poor, but these movements can also appeal to middle class people as well the wealthy. Those who either start such movements are join them may do so because of economic conditions. However, some \\"successful\\" men join such movements out of frustration with their lack of achievement or failure of others to recognize their \\"greatness.\\" In other words, mass movements are not necessarily movements in the name of the poor or dispossesed.An interesting feature of Hoffer's book is the fact that men who join totalitarian movements will quickly \\"change shirts\\" if their movement fails. For example, many communists joined the National Socialists when they the got power in Germany and were initially so successful in the initial stages of the German invasions of the Soviet Union which started on June 22, 1941. On the other hand, many Germans abandoned the Nationalists and become true believers in Communism once the Soviets defeated the Germans during World War II.Hoffer is clear that true believers are often insecure people who must join mass totalitarian movements to improve their self image and to feel safe. These individuals cannot tolerate freedom and independence as they are frightened by the prospect of being responsible for themselves.Hoffer makes a couple of minor errors in the last chapter of this book. For Example, Hoffer comments that Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a radical. The fact is that Luther became a \\"respectable\\" German conservative by 1526 when the Peasants War failed. Another error is Hoffer's remark that the Chinese had too much diversity and too large a land area for anyone to organize a mass movement there. Mao tse-Tung (1893-1976) and the Chinese Communists disprove that contention.In spite of these minor criticisms, Hoffer wrote a good book. This book is a good primer for anyone who wants to start studying the emergence of totalitarianism. This book should be followed by Hannah Arendt's THE ORIGINS OF TOTALITARIANISM,and the third section of Arendt's book is probably the best section. One should also note Hoffer's THE TRUE BELIEVER is readable and informative."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"When, a few years ago, I became aware of the terrorist network of Bin Laden I could not help but think back to this excellent, concise book by Eric Hoffer.It was written in 1951 and I first read it sometime in the early 70s. Hoffer is, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest observers of the human condition ever. All his works are short, concise, with no wasted words or hyperbole.After the attack of September 11 and all of the pundits attempting to tell us why, I kept thinking, &quot;they are missing the real story&quot;. Upon rereading &quot;True Believer&quot; this weekend I was reminded of how right he has it.

All of whom partake in these mass movements without even the smallest amount of doubt. Hoffer helps us realize what these people are thinking. How they are doing it because they lack something in their life. If you have any interest what so ever in reading a well written book that will answer any questions you may have regarding mass movements and their faithful followers, then this book is a must."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Blunt, pessimistic, and refreshingly terse and candid, The True Believer is a masterpiece of human analysis. The subject, those masses of people who give up everything and join movements, political, religious, you name it. Hoffer, who thankfully abjures academic prose in favor of precise aphorisms, lays out the psychological shortcomings of \\"true believers\\": They are misfits with no family or social connections; they have trouble with intimacy; they have nothing vested in society and as such have nothing to lose; they have weak identities and want to escape their failings by disappearing into the cachet that a large organization affords; they are do-gooders without a solid foundation to justify their position; they are often dangerous and fanatical because they are not well grounded and have nothing at stake; frustrated with their own failures, they hold a grudge against the successful and seek to upturn society and create havoc and a \\"revolution\\" in order to spite the successful.In many ways, the profile we get is that of terrorists; thus, Hoffer's classic analysis bears relevance today as we seek to quell the unrest and aggression from the True Believer mindset.Short, easy-to-read, compelling, absent of academic pretentiousness, The True Believer deserves its place as a \\"Perennial Classic.\\""},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Hoffer looks for and finds common themes operating in the minds of various &quot;True Believers&quot; all of whom seem at root, according to Hoffer, to be hating others, even as they hate themselves. Perhaps mainly because they hate themselves, or their families, societies, or blown opportunities. By embracing and extending this hatred, they become tools in the hands of the party organizers (Hitler) or religious fanatics--who assure them it's actually good to be bad. This is why I pick the Paradise Lost reference as the title to this review.The Wall Street Journal carried a review of this by a guy who read it in the 60's, and who saw in it (he now sees) a way to get a handle on developments in the newly lethal world of Islamo-terrorism.Some of the most interesting things in here are the quotes from Hitler and some of his key organizers, on the role assigned to the scapegoats (the Jews). Hoffer interacts with this at the root idea level, which gets beyond the madman-evil characterization of Hitler, and explains his appeal to a demoralized, self-hating Germany. If Germans can fall into this, it's no surprise that technically and educationally less developed societies can, as well. The snake's message in the Garden is, after all, universal.But Hoffer isn't really anti-snake in a religious sense, since he seems to cast his net to trap early Christianity along with Nazi-ism, which makes this book provocative 50 years since it was written."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"I wish I had read \\"The True Believer\\" while I was in college instead all the junk that was required back then. TB is full of \\"useful\\" aphorisms about mass political movements that any self- respecting political science major should appreciate: For example, \\"to wrong those we hate is to add fuel to our hatred. To treat our enemy with magnanimity is to blunt our hatred\\". Or (from Hitler) \\"If the Jew did not exist, we should have had to invent him. We must have a tangible enemy, not merely an abstract one\\". How about: \\"an army is an instrument of preserving the present. Mass movements serve to destroy the present'. Or perhaps \\"it is easier to hate an enemy with some good in him than one who is all bad\\". I could provide more examples; I'm sure the picture is clear. TB is abidingly cynical, yet deadly accurate. There are references to Hitler and Stalin that are chillingly on target. The challenge is to relate the ideas herein to real life or to current world crises. Will we now understand Arafat or the Taliban better than before? This reviewer is not sure how one is to do that. Given the textbook quality of TB, I have reservations as to how a non school age reader, either too old or too young, would handle its' academic nature. For those age groups, this is a 5 star work; for the rest of us a lower rating is more appropriate. Those browsing amazon should be aware that TB first appeared in 1951 (!), with numerous reprintings. Hoffer has plainly authored a serious work. Who would most enjoy it is the question."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Eric Hoffer was a memorable character in the Bay Area of my youth. I read this book and found it to be absorbing and yet disturbing. My youth is chronicled here from my early embrace of Communism, the prolife movement and my present life as a Christian.Hoffer's contention is that the incomplete ego finds its completion in a mass movement. The weak self finds completion in anonymity and a common cause- freed from being \\"condemned to being free.\\" Hoffer focuses this book on Communism, Christianity and Fascism- from St. Paul to the collapse of feudalism in Japan and Russia and then Hitler.Hoffer's Highway crosses some interesting countryside. Quite a fast highway trip through time. The mass movement armed with its army of true believers becomes a compelling motive force in history, yet the damage they cause is ignored by Hoffer.Hoffer never discusses whether the \\"True Believer\\" is actually a follower because what he believes in is at least a partial truth. A partial truth that the believer finds succour in. A truth that is true. The merits of Communism are left alone...not worthy of discussion. Can we believe that class struggle is at least a partial motive force in history while simultaneously believing that the Marxist theory of native Communism is baseless?The remarkable conversion of Paul is simply the result of a weak ego seeking completion rather than the result of a traumatic event according to Hoffer. Hoffer frequently quotes Bible verses as authority to prove his points and we are left to wonder how the conversion of Paul can really fit into Hoffer's mass movement theory.Paul, an allegedly weak ego seeking completion, joins a small, despised movement after leaving a position of power and status as a jewish prosecutor really makes little sense unless a intervening event occurred that radically changed his worldview or perhaps made Paul mentally ill. If Paul was a loon then his subsequent missionary life would not have been possible. Paul shook the Roman Empire to its foundations after travelling over most of it and planting new churches in the bowels of paganism...only to be martyred for a cause he clung to because of a weak ego!It would be as if Senator Joe McCarthy \\"Tail Gunner Joe\\" grew tired of his Communist baiting, with its dubious fame, and left his federal position to become a Communist tract distributor on a lonely street corner in a period of a few days! The joining of a defective ego into a mass movement is described as \\"assimilation\\" by Hoffer. Why would a defective ego leave a position of power to be assimilated as an outcast?The book is riddled with assumptions and dubious history. Christianity was not spread by state power contrary to Hoffer's claim. Rome had lions that knew better. The reader is advised to read any of Peter Bamm's secular history of the New Testament or the book \\"From Christ to Constantine\\". \\"Fox's Book of Martyrs\\" tells us that the state persecution of Christians even went on after the Roman Empire became Christian.Contrary to what this book tells us Judaism was not resistant to the early church. Archaeological evidence from Qumran shows Christianity, Judaism, and the early Essenes closely interconnected as detailed in \\"The Earliest Gospel Manuscript?\\" by Carsten Peter Thiede.The early church arose in a cultural network not as an isolated cult. The ample evidence from the Roman catacombs needs no explanation to show that Jews and Christians were cultural brothers in a pagan sea. The Bible, again quoted by Hoffer, makes numerous references to the cultural influence on the early church by Jews- how was this possible without interaction between Christians and Jews?Similar to the discussion of Christianity, Socialism gets short billing and a too quick overview. We are told that men are \\"universal cowards\\" but not fools and that characteristic allows brutal regimes to last (p 110). The last I heard Hoxha's Albania is no longer around despite being horrific right to the end and never affected by Communist reform \\"de stalinization\\".Hoffer tells us that Hitler could trump Socialism because he promised direction and control that the socialist Wiemar Republic could not command. Hoffer echoes George Orwell on this point... that democratic socialism offered only comfort and not the promise of heroics and therefore could not compete with the demagogues (p 114). Fascist theory is left in its own dark corner, thankfully. Why would \\"universal cowards\\" overthrow a tyrant in Albania or join the Nazis with their promise of dark heroics? Hoffer contradicts himself on this point. It is more reasonable to say that men are optimizers who react to circumstances as they change.What are the historic facts of the NAZI birth? Hitler nearly lost his last election to the Left, the socialist SPD, the Communist KPD, and had to ally himself with the National Party in Germany to gain power...the old landed reactionaries allied with NAZI SA brown shirts against the growing \\"Red Menace.\\"The Nazi war machine was a welfare state as many old Germans attest \\"my father had a job\\". Here in Germany I see Nazi autobahns, public housing \\"NS-wohninkomplex\\", maternity pensions and the boundless legacy of Dr. Ley's work organization all over Europe...occupied Europe built by slave and paid workers from North Africa and the occupied nations. Men who worked for the rational cause of money.The Nazi state was a welfare state for Germany and a Europe wracked by economic chaos. Thankfully, the Nazi defeat brought a new order to Europe marked by the post war welfare state. The Germans who needed the NAZI movement to be \\"free from freedom,\\"as Hoffer states, chose democratic socialism, the SPD, after the war as they almost chose it before Hitler and then accepted NAZI war socialism after Hitler's takeover.\\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\", a good historical reference supports my contentions.A rational choice towards security rather than the annihilation of the self controls mass movements as it did with Nazism.Here in Germany the Reformation is still topical. Hoffer offers us an interesting flawed view of the early reformers...they were a learned humanist elite \\"non clerical humanists\\" allied with the power structure. Luther, Knox, Calvin, Hus were \\"non clerical humanists?\\" Last I heard they were all clerics. These \\"humanists\\" were influenced by printing presses against a church which looked the other way because it was filled with indifferent toadies (p 123). Hmmm...the Inquistion never happened? Foxe's Book of Martyrs is all fantasy?Hoffer's idea of a national works program for the young echoes the New Deal and would have been interesting as a complete paragraph. A national works program like the New Deal Civilian Conservation Corps(CCC)or Work Projects Administration(WPA)could channel energy away from ideology and instability towards productive work. Good idea!Riddled with half history and defective logic, the reader must make a guarded analysis of this seminal work of pyschohistory."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Two more things can be added to the list by reviewer \\"Ron Braithwaite\\": market fundamentalists, and democracy fundamentalists (in addition to \\"Fanatic; True Believer; Religionist; Atheist; Nazi; Communist; Radical Islam\\").It surely feels good to say other people are demented \\"true believers\\", and all other beliefs are just \\"demonstrably false and failed philosophies that have generated tsunammis of faith and fanatism.\\" In a sense, we are all true believers, especially when we resist every attempt to do some self-reflection."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Although Hoffer focuses on the tendency of humans to rely on an outside authority, he ends up describing many ways that we limit ourselves and opportunities we have to expand into greater possibilities.

A clear, concise, well written book that is as valid today as it was 30 yrs. ago. A Philosopher that all can read and understand. His view on the world at that time.

Word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"I found Hoffer's insights into the psychology of mass movement adherents quite interesting, and I think they are correct in some details but not all.However, at times it times as if he is shifting history to fit his theories. For example, his assumption that the 1917 Bolshevik revolution was overwhelmingly won with the support of workers and peasants, i.e. the standard hopeful refrain of Marxist-Leninists today and at the time this work was written. Hoffer's psychological insights are applied to these two categories as explanatory as to how the Bolsheviks took power. In actuality the Bolsheviks were not a mass movement, they gained power through hijacking an earlier revolution (by the Mensheviks and Social Democrats), and their support base included few peasants or workers but a great many somewhat impoverished middle-class intellectuals. Thus his theories in this area fall flat as the premises collapse.Additionally, much of his commentary on Hitler's rise to power and actions, are drawn from Hermann Rauschning's books which allegedly contain remarks made by Hitler to Raushning in the course of extensive conversations between the two. In actuality, R's books are fraudulent and propagandistic, as he had no more than a fleeting acquaintance with Hitler. Thus the theories put forward here too, are without merit.'The True Believer' was first published in around 1951 and the level of knowledge or assumption re the above, matches Hoffer's ideas. The dismantlement of propaganda and disinformation since then, however, invalidate those assumptions and 'facts' and thereofore ideas and theories emanating therefrom lose their value, at least so far as those two revolutionary movements are concerned.The author had nothing to say about Mao Zedong's communist movement in China. This is fortunate perhaps, as he would most likely have gotten that wrong too.Still, all in all, the book's ideas are compelling. That his premises re the National Socialist or Bolshevik movements are wrong, does not necessarily mean his overall ideas are also wrong in all cases. On that basis I found the book a very good read. Really it is must reading for anyone seeking insight into revolution and/or mass behavior."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Service for receiving this book was excellent, as was the condition of the book.

My father only had a high school education yet showed a wisdom far above college-educated people; the same for Hoffer.Now Hoffer has relevance to today. When I see an Obama sticker with \\"Hope\\" under his visionary pose, I think \\"True Believer.\\" Followers of Obama seem strangely familiar to me, bringing me back to those sorry souls who followed communism in the 50s-60s, only to find that what they were worshiping was not really going to help them solve their own angst.Hoffer should be required reading at this scary time."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"I had forgotten how much I owe this book, first read in the mid sixties.

He never seems to have compelling arguments for his generalizations. a book on modern social psychology has much better explanations for his concept of \\"mass movements\\". He spends a lot of time dividing people into categories and classifications. If some of his generalizations don't fit some of his examples, he simply dismisses them. The last paragraph of the book, the capstone you might call it, blew me away. What is he saying? The jews, and later the christians, invented 'this malady of the soul' called fanatacism? I don't know what to think or say. Here we go again with \\"the jews started it.\\""},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"This book was written more or less in the Vietnam era by a Longshoreman who was a self-styled conservative philosopher. Hoffer was turned off by the left-wing fanatacism of that time. This was the era in which Maoism was fashionable among a few western academics who, unlike their Chinese counterparts, did not have to do cultural duty on pig farms and in rice fields.Hoffer is, however, up to date. His argument is not about left-wing fanatacism in particular, but instead discusses the causes of fanatacism in general. The book may help you somewhat to understand the tendency of internally-unhappy people toward ... movements of all stripes, whether ... communist, El Quaida, the [criminal group], the Christian [group], neo-conservative, or others.

Nothing positive can be gained, in Hoffer's view, from self-sacrifice, hope, and working together to change things. Who is really pathological?This book makes it seem like those who join social movements have little better to do and have no other point of living. I think it is difficult to make that case, since those who belong to social movements come from all walks of life and different occupations. It is also difficult to make the case that social movements have never achieved anything of value for the general public. The civil rights movement is probably the least controversial example.The book also makes it seem impossible for one to have individuality and still belong to a social movement. In fact, people dedicate themselves to social movements to varying degrees. Very few members sacrifice themselves to the point where we could say they lacked individuality...Social movements are the essence of democracy, and without social movements democracy is a sham... Without them we can not expect to make things better. To Hoffer, however, we should just take whatever we get (we shouldn't combine together and protest). He actually says this. He views people who hope for a different world as pathological and that no one with a life worth living would ever join a social movement. Perhaps we should have told this to the slaves.And that is all the book is: reactionary propaganda. It pretends to be balanced by treating a variety of conflicting social movements as all the same pathology, but in that it merely supports the status quo benefitting from existing arrangements.Hoffer himself expresses that this book is exaggerated in order to prove his point. It only proves the fact that Hoffer is a propagandist. That is what propagandists do: exaggerate. If it were an academic book it would offer far more evidence and balance. But this was intended for other purposes. Perhaps Hoffer is trying to start his own social movement: atomistic capitalism. He is no different from the National Association of Manufacturers during his time.Lastly, this book says very little of ACTUAL social movements, but is merely propaganda against political parties (including state communism). It says nothing about the Women's Suffrage movement or the abolitionists. Political parties are not social movements, though they sometimes originate from social movements (there is a distinction).And to those who use this to \\"Understand the Al Qaeda\\", I think you will learn little new or insightful. It is simple to dismiss the Al Qaeda as an example of mere social pathology without reading and understanding their actual grievances (and they do have actual grievances which deserve critical examination). It is that very mentality which prevents us from understanding terrorism and stopping it."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Those who would use Eric Hoffer's book \\"The True Believer\\" to attempt to explain why people join terrorist organizations are applying his ideas incorrectly.By its very nature, terrorist organizations are not mass movements and are thus not subject to the theories(not truths!) that Hoffer offers. They are very small, individualistic movements, though the movement itself offers a cause not unlike mass movements and demands similar self-sacrifice. But that is where the similiarities end: there is often no great leader in terrorist organizations, no state propaganda, large degress of self-sufficiency (both social and economic), etc. all of which are traits that Hoffer says are not elements of mass movements.To assume that terrorists join groups like Al Qaeda because they are frustrated as Hoffer says only depicts half the picture. The other half is that terrorism arises due to a lack of political participation, a feeling that one's voice no longer matters. I imagine in a more open political system where it was felt that individuals could affect daily policy, terrorism as we know it would either be far different in form or greatly reduced."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"this work is not meant to be a doctrinaire compilation of truths.

The book outlines the type of person that get's involved in mass movements, and the leaders of the mass movement. He looks at Christianity,Communism,Islam,and Fascism. He shows how the movement self-organizes through what he calls \\"men of words\\". The critical phase for the movement depends on if the \\"fanatic\\" becomes involved. The other type that becomes involved is what he calls \\"men of action\\", if the movement is to become a new order. Then the men of action will have to get rid of the fanatic or it will stay in the active phase. Hoffer says this is how stagnant societies renew themselves.
