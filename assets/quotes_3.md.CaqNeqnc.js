With so much talk nowadays, it is important to be informed.This book, better than any other, clearly and thoroughly outlines the four main arguments for and against homosexuality, and critiques their strengths and weaknesses in a prose style that is both highly personal and incredibly reasoned and intelligent. The Prohibitionists are the one school that is the most decidedly anti-homosexual - seeking to either punish or \\"cure\\" gays and lesibans. The Liberationists seek freedom from social labels and conventions, but, like the Prohibitionists, do not accept the concept of homosexuality as a valid state of being - there are no real homosexuals, only homosexual acts. Sullivan sees them as well meaning, but misguided. The Conservatives believe that homosexuals are entitled to a certain amount of privacy and respect, but homosexuality is still a sin. Homosexuals do exist... but they can't help it. They still disapprove of homosexuality, just not necessarily homosexuals. The Liberals also mean well, and struggle for the rights of homosexuals, but unfortunately blanket them in their larger agenda of \\"helping the little people\\", so to speak - well meaning, but sometimes a bit patronizing.Sullivan does more than criticize, however. He also finds merit in these viewpoints. However, his major argument is that these views either need to be overcome or modified if homosexuals are ever going to have an equally accepted place in society. He also offers ways to overcome these different biases. In the place of these four prevailing positions, he argues for a politics that guarantees the rights and equality of homosexuals - without imposing tolerance.This is an incredibly articulate and brilliantly written book for anyone wishing to know the real truth about a lot of the political and social ramifications concerning homosexuality today, written by a very intelligent man. It is a book for anyone who wishes to sound intelligent and well-informed when discussing this often heated and increasingly important issue."},{"Title":"Virtually Normal","review":"Andrew Sullivan has written a gem with \\"Virtually Normal.\\" In these beautifully written pages, we find an author exploring- his goal being to understand first, question next- four explanations for and proposed methods of dealing with homosexuality. In the end, he finds all four lacking.The doctrines given treatment are: prohibitionism- being gay is a choice of deviance and as such should be treated as a sin, constructionism- gay is merely a social construction and there would be no 'homosexual problem' if we deconstruct sexuality, Conservatism- we should let people be gay but homosexuality should NEVER be encouraged socially. Finally we get to Liberalism. Perhaps Sullivan finds the most trouble here. The liberal doctrine states that as a persecuted group, gays should be tolerated to the point that if social coercion becomes necessary (through 'hate crime' legislation and the like), all the better. Through 'education' (resembling indoctrination) equality can be forced. Save for prohibitionism, I would agree that liberalism is the most dangerous of all.Although it will be obvious that Sullivan has a special distaste for liberalism, he finds serious flaws in each of the four doctrines for good reason. His conclusion breaks sharply with all of them,resembling more of a classical liberal (J.S. Mill) approach. Tolerance should be encouraged, never forced. Government discrimination is the evil, private discrimination will die in the free market because it is always inefficient. Sullivan then devotes time to gay marriange and military service, asserting- very correctly- that untill homosexuals can serve their country openly and marry legally, they will always be on unequal footing. If the potential reader has never heard Sullivan speak on these issues, she should not delay.His afterword is a much needed response to seemingly universal misunderstanding on his book. As he criticizes the four dominant views, he gets criticized by them in turn. Even the 'conservatives,' who as ironic as it is, were the group that his defenders were overwhelmingly from, misunderstood his arguments against liberalism as an affirmation of conservativism. Sullivan, if I had to guess, is a republican with a small 'r', i.e. he believes in a somewhat self governing republic. Whatever your views, this book will challenge, educate, and motivate you."},{"Title":"Virtually Normal","review":"I am not a fan of Andrew Sullivan nor am I a fan of Republicans or Democrats. I am a European-style \\"right-winger\\" whose politics share virtually nothing with anything even remotely mainstream in America. I am the exact person who most of the readers of such books would expect to despise this one. Except that it concerns me politically and as an individual, as I am bisexual. I have never understood the Right's opposition to homosexuality, except the Protestant, Jewish and Islamic Religious Right, of course. The great idea in this book is the idea of the conservativizing of gay couples and gay culture through State-sanctioned marriage. The reason many still despise us is due to the intensely anti-social behavior exhibited worldwide by many of those in the gay community. Watch any gay pride parade in any city and you will see behavior that is repulsive to any person of any moral integrity or respect for the concept of community. This is not a gay/straight issue. It is a human issue. Part of the reason gays tend towards these abhorent public expressions of what should be private behavior is because they have no sense of their legitimacy as citizens and therefore no sense of responsibility toward the community outside of the various gay ghettos. State-sanctioned marriage would gradually end this as it would provide structure to chaos and would end up dramatically decreasing precisely those behaviors that the anti-gay forces object to. It is clearly a win-win situation for all. It would allow us to be who we are comfortably while conforming to the social norms of the majority culture. This is what the anti-gay forces object to, and rightly so: the destabilization of the majority culture. They are misinformed and ignorant but their goal is one that should be desired by all members of the community and gays should recognize that. State-sanctioned gay marriage would be beneficial to the entire community. Gays will be more likely to lose their desire for anti-social behavior and straights will be more likely to become less hostile toward gays or at the very least keep their prejudices at home."},{"Title":"Virtually Normal","review":"Andrew Sullivan believes that acceptance into the American mainstream is critical if gays and lesbians are to overcome the lingering legal and personal discrimination they face.

In closing Mr. Sullivan makes some valid arguments for the legalization of same-sex marriage, which he claims would not undermine heterosexual marriage, but may actually strengthen it.

Thanks for the book. Later"},{"Title":"Virtually Normal","review":"Lucid and analytical, well written, a pleasure toread."},{"Title":"Virtually Normal","review":"In this book, Sullivan divides and defines the political views on homosexuality into 4 views - the prohibitionists, the liberationists, the conservatives, and the liberals (the other reviewers have adequately summarized the 4 views, so I shall not add my own). He goes on to posit his view that all public (as opposed to private) discrimination against homosexuals be ended, particularly in the areas of marriage and the military.Sullivan mercilessly dissects the 4 different views one by one, pointing out their flaws and weaknesses and internal inconsistensies, and why they are all essentially untenable. I found his essay on the liberationists (if they would allow you to label them so) is particularly poignant and even brilliant. He also has good discussions and arguments on the other views, but due to the sheer amount of arguments (and arguments based upon previous arguments), some flawed arguments have slipped in, rendering his conclusions not as convincing as it would seem to an uncritical reader.I feel that the book would have been a great one despite the weaknesses pointed out above, if not for the completely dismal treament on the prohibitionists, which I am about to highlight.Sullivan rightly notes that the prohibitionists are difficult to engage as they generally base their prohibitionistic views on the authority of the Bible. He goes on to show why the Bible does not really condemn homosexuality as much as it seems to.For instance, in p.27 where he deals with the biblical passage in Leviticus 18, claiming that the &quot;abomination&quot; in v.22 is more clearly translated as &quot;ritual impurity&quot;. This interpretation is from John Boswell, who is hardly recognized as an honest scholar, and happens to be gay (and Sullivan fails to mention that fact). Anyone familiar with the biblical languages or the passage in question will find this interpretation impossible.Sullivan (from Boswell) goes on to claim that the context in Leviticus shows that there are &quot;identical provisions against eating pork or engaging in sexual intercourse during menstruation.&quot; I looked up the passage(s) in question, and found that Sullivan forgot to mention that the immediate context is actually a command against offering one's children to Molech (in Lev. 18), and incest (Lev. 20), and bestiality (Lev. 18 & 20). Look it up for yourself.This is not just intellectually biased. This is dishonest.But he's not done -- there's still Romans 1 to deal with:&quot;26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.&quot;The book claims that the passage is not dealing with homosexuality per se, but heterosexuals who engage in homosexual behavior, against their own nature. Meaning that those who are &quot;naturally&quot; or born homosexuals are not condemned in this passage!Simply ingenious, but completely warped. Are we to believe that Paul and his readers didn't know about the clear Levitical injunctions against homosexual acts? Any honest and unbiased reader without an agenda to justify homosexuality can never come to this interpretation.Sullivan has good intentions in engaging the prohibitionist in argument, but doing so by misinterpreting their source of authority (the Bible) is poor argumentation and wishful thinking, and completely misses the point. Very disappointing.Sullivan should have dealt with the real issue behind the prohibitionist ideal -- there is a fixed moral law set by God, and the Bible is God's revelation to man. Sullivan has failed to grasp this point, and thus completely misunderstands and misrepresents the core prohibitionist deal.In as sense I am glad I did not give up on Virtually Normal after the dismal chapter on the prohibitionists (and rating it only 1 star), as the rest of the book was much better - thought-provoking and rather enjoyable (thus I give it a couple more stars).My recommendation - read and enjoy the book by all means, but don't forget your pinch of salt."},{"Title":"Virtually Normal","review":"As much as I may try to sympathize with a fellow gay conservative, this book is poor. It is certainly worse than usual for Sullivan (a smart and fairly good writer): it is flat and ideological. Sullivan's tendency to vilify results in gross and uninteresting caricatures of his opponents: he sets up straw men in what he calls \\"prohibitionists\\" and \\"conservatives,\\" instead of presenting their arguments in the best light, as they themselves would. This might be a good Oxford debate trick, but it will not appeal to his best and most thoughtful readers. Sullivan does not come to grips with the core of the case against gay marriage, and I think that is because he is strikingly deaf to what is at stake in marriage.For instance, Sullivan argues that \\"the openness of the contract\\" and the \\"greater understanding of the need for extramarital outlets between two men than between a man and a woman\\" result in a honesty, flexibility, and equality that would \\"undoubtedly help strengthen and inform many heterosexual bonds\\" (pp. 202-3). To view this as a gain for the marital bond, let alone *only* as a gain, is to be blind to how much would be lost, blind to what is demanded by romantic love itself, and blind to the greater richness and happiness of a fully flourishing family life over the \\"network of gay friendship\\" with all its \\"flexibility\\" and \\"sexual candor\\" (p. 192). It is to see \\"a gamut of possibilities from anonymous sex to bourgeois coupling\\"-and only that; it is a cutting off of the true range, of assuming that the range experienced in homosexual life is the range in life simply, and therefore not seeing the unfortunate but overwhelming limitations of gay life (p. 194).In my experience (and I wish it were not so!), gays tend to share some unpleasant character traits, such as effeminacy or lack of masculinity, cliquishness, and lewdness. Sullivan acknowledges many of these things, but attempts to give them a positive spin. For example, concerning the frivolity of gay life, he praises it for its \\"irony or exhibitionism or irresponsibility\\" and its insight \\"that some things lead nowhere and mean nothing\\" (pp. 204-5). There is something to this, but it is a limited perspective. From the point of view of someone trying to assess the romantic possibilities (--from my point of view), I disagree that something very good can be built on such things."},{"Title":"Virtually Normal","review":"Although I approached this book with an open mind, I was extremely disappointed with it. Sullivan seems to be saying that only a monogamous homosexual, or one who has achieve virtuous ex-gay status can achieve the correct morality as assigned by the his own Roman Catholocism. Yet his own experience with HIV, unsafe sex, and promiscuity seems to contradict this. At a time when so many Roman Catholic Priests are being prosecuted as pedophiles and many teens are stepping forward with tales of abuse, is it logical for Sullivan to be touting his own 'ethics'? What I found most disturbing was his insistence that morality is only a theory or abstract idea and one's own conduct (ie his own websites) must be ignored and excused as 'private' sins which may result in one's death, but are nevertheless innocent 'mistakes'. (...)"},{"Title":"Virtually Normal","review":"While Mr. Sullivan is clearly a moderately intelligent man, his four critiques in this book leave much to be desired. While I am in no position to be challenging his political astuteness, it is his sophmoric analysis and woefully misguided attempt, aided by a lackluster familiarity with Church history, to give theological/religious affirmation to a lifestyle that every major religion, both East and West, recognizes as morally deficient, or wicked at worse, that I take issue with here. It quickly becomes apparent that Mr.Sullivan is no biblical scholar, but chooses to rely upon the liberal biblical scholarship of mainline Protestant scholars to justify an exegetical position that no conservative would ever seriously consider (and it has nothing to do with their bias, but just honest scholarship!). The irony is that Mr. Sullivan prides himself, otherwise, on being a social and cultural conservative (I mean what sort of liberal does his dissertation on Michael Oakeshott?!). More than that, there is something incredibly dishonest and fraudulent about a gay man priding himself on his \\"allegedlly\\" deep Roman Catholic faith, when his very lifestyle runs contrary to both the Church's teaching and its centuries old tradition of moral theology. The fact is plain: homosexuality is a sin! Both Scripture and Holy Tradition, backed by natural law, solidifies this. Mr. Sullivan needs to stop trying to democratize an institution that has as its head, not the US Constitution or the president of the United States, but the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and must repent of his sin which is contrary to nature, a moral danger to the family and society, and an afront to God Almighty!!!"},{"Title":"Alicia en el Pas de las Maravillas (Coleccion Clasicos Juveniles) (Spanish Edition)","review":"I like the tale a lot; is a simple story but with a lot of wisdom.

Although the book is set during WWII and my army days were the Cold War years, what Harris had to say - about the army, about life, about love and war, and innnocence and experience - was universal, and easy to relate to. Pvt Jacob Epp (aka Epstein) should be a classic character of contemporary literature. With a genius IQ and encyclopedic knowledge, 17 year-old Jacob's absolute innocence and inability to connect are nearly heartbreaking. Yet Harris's portrayal of Jacob - and of Joleen and Captain Dodd, who make up an odd love triangle - is laced too with a laugh-out-loud humor. And Harris's pronouncements on war and human nature are every bit as applicable today at they were over a half-century ago. After thirty years, I found the book still full of important insights, many of which I was too young to catch the first time through. I will probably re-visit this book one day.

Rather, he gives out general approaches and beliefs that, if applied, he thinks will lead to success for anyone.And I think he's right--this is the way to do it. It's a principle-centric book, giving you a set of tools, rather than a step-by-step schematic which may or may not apply to your specific situation. Some people may not like it for that reason, however; instead of being told to \\"work hard and save your money\\" they might want a list of 10 steps they can take to become instantly wealthy. JBL knows that these \\"get rich quick\\" schemes are generally fraudulent, so he stays away from them, giving out the less popular but more honest slow-paced strategies for eventual financial freedom. It's like Mom telling you to eat your green beans. Sometimes, it isn't what you want to hear, and it's certainly not glamorous, but it's probably the right advice.As a wrestling fan, I enjoyed hearing a little bit about his background and youth. The thing that made me happiest, though, was getting a real insight into Bradshaw's personality--he shines through the pages. You can tell that he wrote this himself, and that's kind of cool in a day and age where celebrities usually pawn such labor off to underpaid, no-name ghost writers. He's witty, if rough, and genuine. Seems like a good, cool guy that some people just wouldn't be able to stand because they wouldn't get his sense of humor.The one real drawback, and reason I gave it one less star than the full compliment, is due to the books repetitiveness. It's short enough that there's really no call for repeating itself, and yet (like so many other financial advice books, see: Rich Dad, Poor Dad) it does. Early and often.This is a book of good personal advice and fun wrestling anecdotes. Fans of Mr. Layfield, like myself, will love the ability to see what the man is like through his writing. The personal advice, if consistently acted upon, will lead to success for just about anyone, I have no doubt.Recommended."},{"Title":"Have More Money Now : A Common Sense Approach to Financial Management","review":"There are some books that it doesn't really matter when they were written & this is one of them. John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield gives some excellent advice for everyday people. He has great stories & takes a practical approach to money issues. The fact that he started with nothing was very influential in me buying it in the first place.

I stopped reading after having labored thru approximately 1/2 the book. I don't know if it's the nature of the subject matter, or, the book/writing/organization itself. Also, the somewhat fuzzy, thick font style wasn't pleasant either. Basically, each chapter---as far as I got---consists of naming a philosopher, a paragraph or so explanation of what he thought about that area of philosophy, followed by the same type of exposition for each successive philosopher, one after another, until the end of that chapter. It wasn't very interesting or enjoyable, and I enjoy reading this type of stuff. Much of the explanation (perhaps in part due to the subject matter) was vague, unmemorable, dry, and uninteresting. I felt that, if I were to finish the entire book, a month later I would be unable to answer almost any questioin one might ask about what I read. Maybe it's just me, but I was disappointed with this particular purchase."},{"Title":"The Basic Teachings of the Great Philosophers","review":"[A human] \\"must think; and thinking is the pathway to philosophy....Your philosophy, then, is the meaning which the world has for you. It is your answer to the question, 'Why?'\\" (1).So begins S. E. Frost, Jr. inBasic Teachings of the Great Philosophers. He divides the topics of philosophy into ten major problems in order \\"to bring together what each philosopher has written on each of these problems as briefly and concisely as possible\\" (3). Other reviewers take issue with his arrangement, and, indeed, it has its problems (too brief, too concise and sometimes puzzling); however, the previous quote shows Frost's very clear purpose in being brief and concise. If the reader prefers a chronological, historical survey of the ideas of great thinkers, then Durant'sStory of Philosophy (Touchstone Books (Paperback)), Bertrand'sA History of Western Philosophy, orThe Oxford Illustrated History of Western Philosophy (Oxford Illustrated Histories)are the books to consult.However, the book at hand is this one:Basic Teachings of the Great Philosopherswith each chapter a chronological survey of one idea. For example, Chapter 1, \\"The Nature of the Universe,\\" addresses such questions as How did the universe come to be? Who or what made it, and how was it made? and so on. Some of the early answers seem comical, but they formed the basics used by the next thinker. The ancient Greek thinker, Thales, about 600 BC, considered water as the \\"stuff\\" of the universe, Anaxamines thought it \\"air,\\" and Pythagoras and his followers believed the universe was made up of numbers. (Wherever you are, look around and find something not made of numbers.)Heraclitus gave us \\"fire\\" as the \\"stuff\\" because it is always changing, making change the constant. His famous observation (and one which always thrills me) is this: \\"You could not step twice into the same river, for other and yet other waters are ever flowing on.\\" Plato's idea of the copy world in changing, decaying matter and perfect forms in a non-matter, ideal, unchanging world, of course, set the standards for philosophers ever after in addressing the problem of nature. Aristotle tried to merge matter with form and charge it with purpose. A thing's raison d'etre was teleological, or a striving to realize its purpose. Christian thinkers based their proof of God and His world on Greek thought.All these developments led to the schism between faith and science in the medieval period. The forms, ideas, universals of Plato and Aristotle became the basis for religious, philosophical thought in that these universals are what is real and sense objects are mere copies. The soul in heaven is real; man's flesh and blood body is what decays. Science developed from the opposite: that things we experience are what is real and that universals exist in our minds. That is why faith is based on what cannot be proved and science is based on what is set before us and can be measured.Galileo, Newton, Bacon--all their ideas relating to the problem of nature are briefly explained. One thinker of interest here on Amazon is Giordano Bruno, who believed \\"the universe is composed of numerous uncaused and wholly imperishable parts...called monads\\"(29). He also said that the universe remains constant and that only its parts change. Descartes' great contribution to science was his idea of dualism, or the two-fold nature of the mind and body, making each measurable. \\"I think, therefore, I am.\\"Others, Spinoza as the \\"God-intoxicated man,\\" Locke, Hume, Leibnitz, Kant and his \\"categorical imperative,\\" Hegel, Mill, James, Dewey and his Pragmatism, and Santayana are included and summarized.All other nine chapters follow this outline of identifying and introducing the problem, then chronologically showing the development of thought of the most significant philosophers concerning the problem. Other chapters address Man, Good and Evil, the Nature of God, Fate versus Free Will, Soul and Immortality, Man and State, Education, Mind and Matter, and Ideas and Thinking.This book is satisfactory if the reader is seeking a general address of the Great Ideas. According to Socrates: \\"The unexamined life is not worth living.\\" Frost hands us a \\"brief, concise\\" summary of these ideas to think about and form our philosophy."},{"Title":"The Basic Teachings of the Great Philosophers","review":"I read this book about four to six years ago, when I was still in grade school, and this book pretty much got me started on the track of the study of philosophy. It provides a pretty good overview about all of the beliefs of each of the big names under each topic (Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, Hobbes, Locke, Kant, Hegel, including many others), which are conveniently divided for, what was for me, easy reading.Make a note though: some of the views outlined in this book are now considered outdated views of the philosophers. This book was last revised in 1962, so it should not take one much thinking to realize that. Right now in philosophy, there are new interpretations of philosophers like Immanuel Kant and Hegel being brought forth by today's professors of philosophy.

In fact, I wonder if I was really all that well educated before I found it. Inspite of the fact that I was a university honors graduate I found that this book covered a whole universe of new ideas for me. Perhaps this is because I majored in one of the physical sciences and almost everything covered was from the narrow viewpoint of materialism and logical positivism.I especially enjoyed the organization of the book. Each chapter covers a major topic: the nature of the universe; man's place in the universe; what is good and evil; the nature of god; fate versus free will; the soul and immortality; man and the state; man and education; mind and matter; ideas and thinking; and recent approaches to philosophy. The individual philosophers, from classical to modern, addressing the issue are listed right under the chapter heading, then each of their arguements is presented in order. You can't help but start to compare them- to start thinking for yourself at a significant level.Since first reading this volume I've gone on to read more detailed works by the philosophers who appealed more to me such as Plato and Schopenhauer. Indeed, this book opened a whole intellectual world to me that my public university education totally ignored. I find myself wondering if a life lived without serious reflection of the topics presented here is really a life worth living...."},{"Title":"The Basic Teachings of the Great Philosophers","review":"This treatment of philosophers is not terrible, but neither is it all that good. The treatment is cursory, which is inevitable for a work this brief, but is also not particularly insightful.Of course, the ideal is to read the philosophers themselves. Anything other than that is third best (there is no second best).But for those who want a survey without taking the time to read all the philosophers, there are better alternatives.As a more scholarly but still quite readable alternative, consider Bertrand Russell's History of Western Philosophy. His organization is different from Frost's, in that he doesn't deal separately with different issues, but he gives more coherence to each philosopher's approach. Another option is Will Durant's The Story of Philosophy. Although now more than 75 years old, it's still a magnificent introduction to philosophical thinking.For a bit more depth on individual philosophers, consider the Paul Strathern's \\"in 90 minutes\\" series (Plato in 90 minutes, Aristotle in 90 minutes, etc.) These vary somewhat in quality, but are generally readable and will help you understand what these philosopheers were doing and their place in history.If you like the topical approach that Frost uses, go to your library and see whether you can check out the Syntopicon volumes of the \\"Great Books of the Western World\\" series. These are excellent essays, usually about ten pages, on the \\"great ideas,\\" outlining the train of thought over the centuries and containing extensive cross-references to what the primary philosophers and writers have had to say about these issues. These are superb and woefully underutilized volumes.Other recommended general volumes for those who want an introductory look at philosophical thinking include Mortimer Adler's \\"Six Great Ideas\\" and \\"Ten Philosophical Mistakes,\\" and Bertrand Russell's \\"The Problems of Philosophy.\\""},{"Title":"The Basic Teachings of the Great Philosophers","review":"If you are in search of a handy reference work that gives fundamental summaries of the main theories of western philosophy, this book functions adequately. Most of the major philosophers, or at least the major philosophical movements in history, are consulted for their theories on fundamental questions. These include the basic college course stuff like the nature of the universe, good vs. evil, free will, and the like. The thinkers covered stretch from Plato, Aristotle and the other Greek immortals, to the lesser ancient schools, on through the middle ages to relatively recent philosophers such as Kant and Spinoza. A useful bonus is a biographical paragraph in the appendix on every thinker whose work is used in the book. The only flaw with this book is that it was written by a professor back in 1942, and is presented in the dry, humorless, and didactically professional writing style that prevailed in that day."},{"Title":"The Basic Teachings of the Great Philosophers","review":"Frost's book is a chronological parade of Western philosophers, exhibiting their wares along the most important philosophic themes that have absorbed man's thinking throughout history: nature of the universe, man's place in the world, ethics, God, fate vs. free will, soul and immortality, state, education, mind, and origin of ideas.The book is useful both as an historical overview of philosophy and as a comparative tool for self-examination of one's own thinking by all armchair philosophers. Having gone through the comparative exercise, I end up largely aligned with the modern view: For all practical purposes, a real, tangible universe exists separate from man's existence, and concepts like soul, mind and God are more matters of faith than subject to any rigorous scientific proof. On moral guidance, I find value in Kant's \\"categorical imperative\\" that individuals should act in accordance with principles they would similarly prefer others heed to. Based on the fundamental likeness of all humans, I believe that core moral decisions (right vs. wrong, good vs. bad) are more universal than the \\"relativist\\" modern view generally admits. At the same time, I relish the richness that social and political freedom to pursue individual talents brings to our world.The organization of the book along themes in philosophy is best suited to those who wish to explore just one or perhaps a few of the topics. Reading the entire work in the order presented (as the author suggests) proves to be a somewhat tedious exercise, since the basic thinking of prominent philosophers (e.g., Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Leibnitz, Kant, Dewey) is presented many times over, with each philosopher donning a costume only slightly different each time he marches by in successive chapters. Awkwardly, the reader is left on his own to assemble the fragments and reconstruct the \\"whole\\" of any single philosopher's thinking. A summary chart cross-referencing philosophers and their stance on the key philosophic themes would enhance the pedagogical cohesiveness of the book."},{"Title":"The Basic Teachings of the Great Philosophers","review":"I must admit that I was not impressed with Frost's book. As a philosophy student, I found several errors of fairly basic views. Overall, for someone with no knowledge of philosophy, this book could serve as an introduction, but I think even the title \\"Basic Teachings\\" is misleading. This book does little more than make single sentence comments about history's great philosophers, without explanations. Frost effectively reduces many brilliant thinkers to one sentence blurbs.If you are looking for an introductory philosophy book that goes in depth enough to actually begin to understand philosophy, as well as uses some original texts, look into Christopher Biffle's text, \\"Landscapes of Wisdom: A Guided Tour of Western Philosophy.\\" I would also recommend \\"Philosophy for Dummies,\\" by Tom Morris. Both of these books are aimed at an introductory level, but are far more contemporary than Frost, as well as give actual explanations of philosophy and philosophers, rather than just brief statements of their beliefs."},{"Title":"The Basic Teachings of the Great Philosophers","review":"I read this book about four to six years ago, when I was still in grade school, and this book pretty much got me started on the track of the study of philosophy.

Although succeeding at being brief, the descriptions often fail to adequately differentiate various schools or clarify a given philosopher's teaching (e.g. John Scotus Erigena is rather hastily relegated to pantheism).The rendering of Christian thinking/doctrine is grossly--and I emphasize grossly--misrepresented (e.g. Christians, through grace, strive to regain their \\"lost divinity\\"--rubbish!; Abelard being posed as the progenator of \\"situtation ethics\\"--rubbish!; Augustine being quoted as saying that God \\"put\\" evil in the world--rubbish!; claiming that Christianity, one of whose doctrinal apices is the RESURRECTION of the BODY, is a \\"dualist\\" system--rubbish!). The list goes on and on. And while Frost may quote or, more often, paraphrase Aquinas, it is abundantly manifest that he has not actually read Aquinas. Most, if not all, citations from the Christian thinkers are wrenched clear out of context. The only thing that urks me more are Catholic priests and bishops misrepresenting the Church's dogmatic teaching.The book does (barely) manage to present a skeletal, topical overview and basic rote information (e.g. Aristotle's four categories of \\"Cause,\\" Hegel's \\"dialectical process,\\" etc.), but, IMHO--and I am a non-academic, armchair student of philosophy--pitifully lacks sufficient detail and historical backgrounding of the various (glib) discussions. The descriptions strike me as little more than caricatures, and poor caricatures at that.For a well-developed and well-studied read, get Copleston's \\"A History of Philosophy,\\" and prepare to be well informed for a good, long while! Even though a Jesuit, Copleston provides an accurate, fair and objective treatment of the various philosophical schools/movements--even those to which he may not particularly ascribe, unlike Frost whose glaring biases and/or deliberate ignorances ride rough-shod, particularly upon traditional Christian doctrine. : )"},{"Title":"The Basic Teachings of the Great Philosophers","review":"While this book does hold a certain educative value, I did not particularly enjoy reading it. It references the fundamental concepts of philosophy, such as the relationship between the universe and our idea of the universe, our place in the universe, etc. - without much heart and thoughtfulness. The style and language of the book are also a bit dry and not very engaging.The book can be somewhat useful for those who want to familiarize themselves very briefly with the most prominent schools of thought - the Epicurean, Stoic, the Idealist philosophy, etc. However, those who already had done some philosophical reading may find this book useless.The best approach to philosophical studies seems to be reading the actual works of philosophers rather than the often perfunctory compilations of viewpoints on philosophical matters taken from various thinkers. However, in the past I had come across the volumes on the basics of philosophy that were more engaging and sophisticated in their content and style than the book in question (hence my rating); although, I have to add, that they were bigger in volume and so had more \\"room\\" for philosophical ideas and their interpretations."},{"Title":"The Basic Teachings of the Great Philosophers","review":"Let's face it: For most of us understanding what ancient philosophers had to say has the same curiosity value as what was life was like in ancient Sumeria or just how do they manage to get all that white stuff inside a twinkie.In this regard this book on great philosophers is...well...great!In a short, accessible 274 pages Frost manages to take you all the way from the pre Socratics all the way up to then contemporary thinkers like Martin Buber (remember this book was originally written in the 1940s). Not only does he do this but he also manages to take on the philosophers in an issue by issue treatment for example sequentially treating the philosophers on topics like what they had to say about free will.In reading the book it's easy to see just how philosophy has reacted to and not led the crest of scientific inovation.Sure you can pick up other texts on what these guys had to say but this book will be as good as any other of the introductory texts mentioned for learning their inaccurate and now largely irrelevant reflections.Now you just need to find a good Sumerian life book and one on Introductory Twinkie filling to complete your library."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"Unfortunately, I am a bereaved parent.

I wanted to get it for a family who suffered a loss but would it help their particular situation. It has made the difference in more than one case and I'm probably not that diferent from a lot of other people."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"As has been mentioned in almost every previous review, it's really helpful to realize that &quot;I'm not crazy&quot; when we try to deal with the loss of a child. Mrs. Schiff's book can be just as helpful to our friends and relatives too. It's important that they realize that we're not crazy either. In fact, it should be compulsory reading for anyone who is in any way close to a parent who is trying to go on living after the loss of a child.First, a litle personal background: In 1980, my 17 year old son lost his life as the result of an automobile accident. Like so many other recently bereaved parents, I wasn't sure that I wanted to go on living, and, until I found a group called &quot;Compassionate Friends&quot; that was made up of other recently bereaved parents who met to share memories and feelings, I didn't think that there was anyone &quot;out there&quot; who had any idea of what I felt. In addition, as Mrs. Schiff states in this book, married couples who are each going through their own feelings of grief, guilt, anger, etc., are absolutely incapable of meeting the needs of their respective spouses, something that an &quot;outsider&quot; cannot fathom, but will be more aware of after reading this book.To a bereaved parent, almost anything that someone who doesn't share their experience has to offer in the way of sympathy or advice can be thought of as being thoughtless and/or ignorant. Reading this book is one way for a friend to get some idea of how to relate to a bereaved parent and what to say, or more importantly, what not to say.Mrs Schiff mentions that you shouldn't say anything like &quot;I understand what you're going through.&quot; You don't understand what we're going through unless you've been there yourself. On one occasion someone said to me, &quot;I understand what you're going through, my dog died recently.&quot; Can you imagine how I felt hearing that? The other one that I will never forget was the man who said, &quot;You don't know how lucky you are, I have a retarded child and have to deal with that every day.&quot; I didn't consider myself lucky at all, and why someone else's tragedy was supposed to make me feel better, I'll never understand. Don't even think of comparing tragedies.The point of this is that both of these people were well meaning but what they said, out of ignorance, should have been left unsaid. A reading of THE BEREAVED PARENT will let you know that the best thing to say to a bereaved parent is &quot;I know that I'll never understand what you're going through, but I want you to know that I'm always here for you with an easr to listen and a shoulder to cry on.&quot; Then, really be there for them.To summarize; THE BEREAVED PARENT, in addition to being a virtual life saver to one who has lost a child, can also be read as a sort of guide book on how to provide support and love to your friends who are coping with the loss of life's most precious gift, their child."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"When a child dies, the world implodes. The family is cast into a maelstrom of pain from which there seems to be no relief, no hope of ever regaining a sense of normality. At each grieving home, someone should show up the day after the funeral with this book in hand, ready to share.Schiff writes for everyone, regardless of faith or lack of faith, defining and clarifying the issue of how to deal with this kind of devastating bereavement. She puts the pain in perspective, acknowledging the difficulties it causes in relationship to a variety of subjects: To family and friends, the funeral, guilt, anger, communication, religion, marriage, siblings, pleasure, functioning and the all-important &quot;rest of your life.&quot;About holidays Schiff writes, &quot;A very difficult area of functioning is coming to grips with the knowledge that there is absolutely no way of getting around holidays and vacations. Thanksgiving and Christmas and birthdays will come despite your best efforts to avoid them. And they are horrendous times for many years. Their pain cannot be minimized. But they still must be faced.&quot;As a bereaved parent, Schiff's tender and upbeat treatment of this painful and sensitive subject makes her book a classic and lifts it far above others in the genre. If you read only one book on grieving, make it this one."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"I first read this book after the death of my son in 1983. Ms. Schiff makes all those &quot;crazy&quot; feelings normal and understandable. After the death of my daughter (1992), this book was one of the first I turned to again. I have since read many books on grief and bereavement, general ones and those written specifically for parents. So many facets of the grief work are explained clearly and simply here: the effect on siblings, on relationships, etc. This is the book I recommend first for bereaved parents, and for those who, powerless in observing such pain, want to understand."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"When our son died in 1978, this book was the first thing I read that was an honest portrayal of what it really feels like. I began to understand that the Hell we were living in was the Hell of any parents who were trying (with every ounce of strength) to survive the death of a child. There is nothing that will erase the pain but this book made me understand the necessity of grieving --in my own time and in my own way! It made me realize that my grief (as a mother) was no more or less than my husband's (as a father); but it was VERY different. This book was responsible for helping me realize that perhaps we could keep our marriage and family together and move forward and have happiness. The pain is still part of my life but so is joy. I'm grateful for this book and have shared it (over the years) with others."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"Without this book as one of my resource tools I don't know how I would have learned to live again after my 17 year old son was killed. This book differs from other grief writings in that it addresses the fact that the loss of a child is so extremely different from other losses. Mrs. Schiff talks about those things that only another bereaved parent would know about - not just in the shock phase of the loss, but for the long haul. Even after 11 years, and especially as I try to help others just starting their grief walk, her words are the first to come to mind. I find myself using this book now as a reference tool for myself and as a gift to a parent who has newly lost their child."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"This was one of dozens of bereaved-parent and bereavement-in-general books that were given to us after the death of our daughter last winter. This one helped me more in terms of understanding that this is a process, rather than a destination, and helped me with understanding how my husband and I would grieve somewhat differently and how we could keep communication open.I lent it to a friend, who said it helped her a great deal with understanding what my husband and I were dealing with; it &quot;helped her to help us&quot;, in other words."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"I had such a difficult time coping with the death of my mother and son after they were killed in an automobile accident in June of 2000. My grief counselor recommended that I read books written by parents who had lost a child. The author of another book I was reading mentioned how much this book had helped him after the death of his son. I purchased the book right away. I found it to help me realize that all the crazy thoughts in my head did not mean I was crazy. These thoughts and feelings are very normal after such a tragic loss. I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"When my four year-old, Daniel, died in 1997, this book helped me realize I was not alone, not going crazy, but held many of the same feelings other bereaved parents had. I continue to recommend this helpful book with practical advice to all bereaved parents. It was one of the first books on parental bereavement and it is timeless for it has and will continue to be a comfort source to those in pain."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"This book has become my solemate. The thoughts and experiences of the author made the miriad of emotions my wife and I experienced easier to understand. The loss of our 11 year old daughter will be something we never &quot;get over&quot;, this book reaffirms that moving on is not the same as letting go. I would recommend this book to anyone who has,and I quote &quot;stared at hell and survived&quot;."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"My husband and I were sent this book by Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh following the death of our 3-day old daughter, Abbie, in their NICU. This book helped me to see that the feelings I had been experiencing were very common in grieving parents, and helped me to see that I wasn't &quot;going crazy&quot;. I would recommend this book to any grieving family."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"When my son died in 1988 I was given several books about death and dying but I could never get past the first few pages before losing interest. When I opened this book, after the first few pages I knew that the author had an idea how I was feeling and finished it - it is the only book I have ever read on this subject and I remember that it helped me realize that what I was feeling was \\"normal\\", if there is such a feeling after losing a child. Since my son died I have known too many people that have lost children and this is the book I buy for them. If you have lost a child or have a friend or aquaintance that has lost a child I believe that this book will help."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"I received this book from a very good friend,when my son died. It was so helpful to me during that horrific time. Since then I have purchased four more of these books to give to my friends that found themselves in the same situation I was. Losing a child is absolutely the worst thing that could happen to a parent. This book will help in a small way to get parents through some of those rough times."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"I thought that this book might be dated, however it reads like good medicine for a wound few of us acknowledge. My wife had five miscarriages, a couple were more than three months along; plenty of time to get our hopes up. Each time we attended to her needs, physical and emotional. I stuffed my disappointment and sense of loss. While reading this book I got a wealth of information about how to work through my grief around these losses."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"By giving practical advice and necessary information, this book helped my husband and I get through the death of our infant son 27 years ago. As a clergy couple, we have used her information and suggestions in comforting and advicing grieving parents over the years. When our 7 year old granddaughter died suddenly last summer, we were able to use the invaluable practical information to help our daughter and son-in-law get through the funeral and impossible weeks and months following her death. It is written from the knowledge that only the pain, grief, and life-experience of losing a child can bring. We along with many others are blessed by having read it."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"I thought it was good regarding marriages. But I also thought it was very outdated. We lost our only child recently and it wasn't what I thought it would be. I read another book before this one and found that to be more helpful."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"Gave a couple of these away to friends who were grieving and both responded with appreciation and stated that the books have helped them and still continue to do so."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"Definitely recommend. Read this over 22 years ago when our daughter died. Bought for a friend due to their family experience."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"I read 16 books on parental grief when I lost my second child, and I only kept 6. This wasn't one of them. Others may find it helpful, so I donated it to my Compassionate Friends chapter. You might get something usable from it also. I personally found it a little too dry and clinical. I prefer reading ones written BY parents who have been bereaved sometime in the last 10 years."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"Highly recommended reading for parents that have recently lost a child. It greatly helps you to know that other parents suffering the same loss have been able to go on living, finding meaning and purpose in different ways. They explain what have worked for them and what doesn't provide any solace. Valuable in understanding that even though your life has significantly changed, there is hope and multiple ways to honor and cherish your beloved child,giving your life a new sense of purpose and meaning."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"Dit boek is een byzonder boek voor ouders zoals wij, wij hebben plotseling onze zoon verloren en dit boek helpt."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"My son died October 11th of 1996.

I still don't think she read all of it BUT I did and as a &quot;big&quot; sister dealing with my moms bereavment and my brothers and sisters it really helped me face and understand the many different ways people deal with the death of a loved one. I recommend this book for anyone close to bereaved Parents."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"After our teenaged son was killed I read everything I could find in hopes I would find something to ease the pain. This is the only book both my husband and myself (who grieved in very different ways) related to. I routinely take this book to friends who have lost a child in lieu of sending flowers. Even now, years later, I will occasionally reread this book and discover something helpful. Ms. Schiff, put simply, tells it like it is.

This was the book that got me started on the road to recovery, and is one that I purchase to give to parents who have recently lost a child."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"This book covers every aspect of the grieving soul. People sit around thinking they must be going crazy with the thoughts and feelings they have in times of grief. This book explains those feelings and lets the reader know they are not crazy or alone, they are very normal, and things will get better. After my daughters murder in 2003 I read every book I could get my hands on and NOTHING helped me more than this book. It covers all ages, and circumstance, loss of spouse, child, sibling, parent, and does it in a way that flows not separating instances so much that only a portion of the book covers what you truly need. I couldn't put it down until I had read it to the end and I felt so much better. This auther can really get to the heart and soul of the pain of loss and let you know you are normal and the reasons why you feel the way you do. I am so glad I read this book and will continue to share it with those in need. It is the only book I have read except for one other that deals with the loss of an adult child My daughter was 23 and it was perfect. I bought this book because of a review on this site and I am so gratefull.

An easily-read book."},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"Shortly after the death of our son in 1977, I saw Harriet Sarnoff Schiff interviewed about this book on one of the morning news shows. I immediately ordered this book, and it became an invaluable tool for healing from the terrible pain of losing a child for both my husband and me.As time has gone forward, I find myself giving a copy of this book to people who have experienced the loss of a child. It continues to be a book that offers concrete help to those of us who have endured this devastating experience.I just ordered another copy. I will hand it to a young woman who is exactly the same age I was when I first read it years ago. My arms will wrap around her as I struggle to find the best way to extend my loving concern to her and her husband. Beyond that hug, this book is the kindest expression of sympathy I have ever found.Nancy Shaw"},{"Title":"The Bereaved Parent","review":"I have to highly recommend this book for a bereaved parent.

The letters tell as much about human beings as they do about the wiles of the devil, and have been justly famous and loved by Christians since their first publication in 1943. This edition also includes a preface in which Lewis answers an oft asked question: Does he really believe in devils? -- and there is a new section absent from earlier editions: Screwtape Propsoses a Toast. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Angel Up My Sleeve: A Tale","review":"As a young reader ... I never read a book like this one before, exept maybe Alice in wonderland or Harry Potter. But this is better at least to me.The characters even the evil ones are fantastic and wild, amazing really. And somehow they seem real, maybe because even the evil ones are sometimes funny and terrible at the same time.Dana the main character could be you or me. We know her feelings. Sometimes love, sometimes fear. Lots of fear because what she is experiencing is truly out of this world. She has to deal with it and she does.The angel character Ibbur is like her teacher or guide and he has a wisdom about the truth behind the masks. I felt I was learning what Dana learned. Like I went through the adventure too and came out wiser. Ibbur teaches her about her own powers of mind and how to use it for action. Thats the main point of the book I think.So I recomend the book ...becasue theres more that I didn't quite get or understand completely. but it was great and thats my opinion.By the way, I'm a boy."},{"Title":"Angel Up My Sleeve: A Tale","review":"A great adventure with strong elements of spiritual teachings. Dana, the main character, is a not-yet teen girl, is wisked away on an adventure by an angelic being. The turmoil she encounters is our own struggle with life...she gathers gems with magical properties...the author's creativity in this regard is to be commended. The ending brought tears to my eyes...the book will teach us [and our children] that the world is filled with the beauty that we bring into it; and that angelic friends are never very far. I'd HIGHLY recommend this unusual romp with &quot;Dana, Queen of Worlds&quot; [wonderful for our daughters needing strong role models]"},{"Title":"Angel Up My Sleeve: A Tale","review":"While I have found this book to be very entertaining, it is very weak. The author does not spend a great deal of time developing the characters, and I spent most of the book not caring whether or not the heroine succeeds. I never really feel like I get to know the main character or her motivations. I also find it very condescending that everytime the heroine succeeds against the villan it happens just because she is told it can. The author never really explains why. On a whole, I feel the book has a lot of great themes; good vs. evil and good will succeed against evil, but it would probably be suited to a younger audience (under 10 years)."},{"Title":"West Seattle 101: A Hundred and One Things to Do, an Insider's Guide to Recreation, Dining, Education & Enrichment","review":"All fluff and no legitimate content.

It's a book of 101 things to do in West Seattle, each of which Ms. Hinton, the author, found intriguing in some way. If she didn't find the thing to do intriguing, she left it out of the book.

The Left Behind series and its validity (or lack thereof) in relation to modern day society.3. The probability of everything being 50-50.I laughed out loud at least 18 times reading this book. I think you might like it, too."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"well this book was pretty good, but a lot of the time i had some trouble relating to it because i'm a gen y-er not x, so i didn't grow up with those cultural refrences i guess. it was pretty readable though. i'm sure if i could better relate to the material i would have given it a higher rating, but as it is... its ok."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This book completely describes so many people in my generation it's crazy.Great writing, really funny at times. Just an all a round good read!"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"If you've never read Chuck Klosterman, this is a great introduction; if you are familiar with - and enjoy - his work, then this is a must-read. Klosterman's unique, oftentimes hilarious social commentary is on prominent display in this collection of essays ranging from music to Pamela Anderson to soccer to serial killers. My personal favorite was the essay \\"Billy Sim (reality interlude),\\" an essay about the human relationship with the much-heralded computer game, The Sims.Klosterman is at his best when discussing inane topics such as Pamela Anderson or soccer, where he makes observations or comments on popular beliefs that have little or no relevance or consequence in our lives. At times, he can be self-righteous, as if he is the only one smart or creative enough to come up with some of these things, but it really boils down to a formula in most of these essays:1. Chuck identifies a common social belief/acceptance2. Chuck at first states that he disagrees with this premise based on why everyone thinks it.3. Chuck then tells you the real reasons why the prevailing social belief is true.While this comes off as self-righteous as I said before, not all his essays follow this formula. Additionally, his true genius shines through in his random running commentary that he makes in trying to prove his point. He is quite hilarious, and despite his occasional pretentiousness, very funny.In the end, Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs* is an easy-to-read collection of essays that, if not highly informative at times, is at least highly entertaining and will make you think about the world in which you live. A great book to read if you only have a few moments here and there or if you have all the time in the world."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"If you're into pop culture then this is something you really want to put on your must read list. Klosterman writes on everything from the effect of Woody Allen and John Cusack movies on his relationship troubles to whether or not your stance on the Lakers-Celtics rivalry is a sign that you might be a racist. One caveat, be prepared to have Klosterman's fantastic wit probably skewer something you hold near and dear. But if you're ready to roll with the occasional jab to the things you like you realize that Klosterman is punching away with kid gloves--I mean the man admits his love for the TV classic \\"Saved by the Bell\\" (and rightly so!)--so how mean can he really be?Short chapters interspersed with even shorter interludes help make this a light and easy read, and most likely a great conversation starter."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"OK. I am not a drug user...not that being a drug user is a necessary, or even desirable trait to possess while reading and enjoying this book. I was put off by the title originally when I was recommended this book. As a result, I waited way to long to read it. I actually didn't become a Chuck Klosterman fan until I read his monthly articles in Esquire magazine. Finding myself completely engrossed with his writing style and flare for randomness (is that a word?), I was hooked. I picked up Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs and immediately loved it.It is not a cohesive story, but rather a collection of essays ranging from such topics as his hatred of soccer to the wisdom in the popular sitcom Saved By the Bell. I believe anybody between the ages of 21-35 will instantly relate with this self proclaimed Gen Xer. If you read this book, you will laugh, think and pretty much have a ready made comment for any party or social event that you attend. If you love pop culture at all, do yourself a favor and pick up this book!"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"In the book \\"Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs\\" Chuck Klosterman has written a series of essays that compare miscellaneous pop culture happenings to social interactions and events. The book is entirely enjoyable with no section of the book ever getting boring. The first \\"chapter\\" starts off with a bang with Klosterman relating to how he has problem with relationships because of John Cusack and Coldplay and thier spread of \\"fake love\\". From there we get chapters on the ties and connections between Pam Anderson and Marilyn Monroe along with the Dixie Chicks and Van Halen. He also gives us a first hand account of his dabbling with \\"The Sims\\". The book is a fairly easy read - you don't have to worry about having a out-of-this-world ig to understand and like the book. It would help to have some basic knowledge of pop culture though.I would reccomend this book to college students and up. If you grew up during the eighties you will make a lot of personal connections to the book and be able to relate to it more. Chuck Klosterman does a good job of mizing old and new pop culture references so that most people can relate and have a connection to the book.As for any other miscellaneous info on the book and Klosterman? Well, I read this book in my senior year of high school and since then I find myself picking up and reading excerpts out of it from time to time - its a great plane read.After reading this I picked up Klosterman's first book \\"Fargo Rock City\\" and I suggest reading this book before that one. \\"Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs\\" is overall a better written book and I found that this book was easier to make a connection to since he has more recent pop culture references. I don't know that much about hair bands and so it was harder to read \\"Fargo Rock City \\" and understand all of the subtle nuances. So if you want to read one of his books pick up this one first and then try \\"Fargo Rock City\\"."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Klosterman's book was well worth the price on the cover. His essays are very witty; any book that makes you laugh out loud several times is definitely a keeper. The stories are insightful looks at the things that seem to mean so little but always seem to mean so much- television shows, video games, music, and others. Also of interest are the brief \\"asides\\" between each essay, which give even smaller portions of Klosterman's wit.The reason I hesitate to give this book the full five stars is that it seemed a bit uneven to me- that is to say, not all the essays were of the same caliber. However, the best ones are good enough to make you forgive some of the ones that never quite click."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I expected a weak treatise on modern media, and was surprised by an honest, sometimes dark and always entertaining view of pop culture.Traversing from Saved by the Bell, to the Sims to the evil of When Harry Met Sally, Klosterman observes our mass culture, and makes sense of what it means to us. What succeeds in the mass media environment does tell a lot about us, and this book brings some solid points of view to it. View it as a lower brow version of Bobos in Paradise.The book reads quickly and well, as you're drawn into finding his jaded and barbed opinions on all these cultural icons. It'll go quick, and give you a new lens to view what's popular around us."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this book. I can't say I have ever read anyone who comes close to speaking to the generation that I am part of, like Klosterman does. Let's face it, it's a generation that has fond memories of Screech and can count GI Joe as a childhood friend. As such, it's different than any other time, and deserves different treatment, and even different language.This collection of essays touches on points that seemingly come up all the time, but not to the level that Klosterman examines them. His look into why and digressions on it, makes this one brilliant book. I am telling everyone I know about this book, I believe so strongly in it."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"\\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs\\" is an essay collection that draws comparisons between popular culture and important social and interpersonal issues. It also happens to be extremely witty at times. Chuck Klosterman is a writer for Spin magazine, so he clearly knows pop culture and can write quality essays. The best of his work here truly encapsulates life. Who cannot relate to this quote? - \\"Every relationship is fundamentally a power struggle, and the individual in power is whoever likes the other person less.\\" That profundity, by the way, is from an essay that discusses the merits of \\"When Harry Met Sally\\"; another section proffers the genius of Billy Joel. Yes, Klosterman is a bit of a hipster geek.Pop culture references are sprinkled throughout the book, but sometimes it stretches a bit too much for the sake of a clever analogy. In the forward, Klosterman assserts that, at times, he feels as though \\"everything is completely connected.\\" Unfortunately, he is not adept enough to make all of his essays into a cohesive whole (as other reviewers have noted). Ultimately, the book feels like a loose collection of unrelated but very funny skits. Although that debit doesn't sink the book, it does lessen its impact. In addition, Klosterman is sometimes too self-aware for his own good; several times, he makes reference to liking something \\"unironically\\" - such as \\"Saved by the Bell.\\" His definitive goal seems to be achieving irony. While this credo certainly makes \\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs\\" a funny read, it can become rather tedious as well. Overall, I'd recommend this book, but with reservations."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Yeah, that title pretty must covers it.Klosterman's essays are chock full (and I hate to use this term) of Gen-X references to everything we've grown up loving.Now, these aren't essays ON Saved by the Bell and Pamela Anderson, but rather, he uses cultural icons as a jumping off point for rambling, funny and (uh-oh) thought provoking discussions. Klosterman is the kind of guy that you would want to hang out with at a party. Look. You're either going to love this book or you're not. You're either to find the tangential, rambling essays endearing and interesting, or simply tangential and rambling.So what kinds of subjects are you in for? How about the Tori Paradox in which Klosterman deconstructs the idea of Tori on Saved by the Bell? One season, after Tiffany Amber Thiessen and Elizabeth Berkley had left for more naked pastures, Tori shows up. And then, just before a graduation special that was to air on NBC, Tori was gone. And Kelly and Jessie were back. Klosterman argues that Saved by the Bell is a lot like life. First people are there, and then they're not - gone. Only to be forgotten and at the most, vaguely remember. Of course, Klosterman explains much better than me.Just the pure assault of pop-cultural references was enough for me. It's not uncommon for Klosterman to reference such diverse items as the music of Radiohead, Who's the Boss and Trix cereal all in one essay. And I wouldn't be exalting his references if he was just throwing them out. They actually mean something to the people that grew up in the post-Boomer era..."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Glad this was a collection of essays, rather than a novel. I don't think I would have been able to make it through a novel of this type of writing. Also made it easy to read while on the pot.The essays start out with brilliance (especially the first two, about romance and The Sims, respectively), but my interest in them fizzled out. There are a few bright points here and there in the remaining essays (the essay about serial killers and our fascination with them is dead on). There is no doubt Klosterman is an adept writer, can pinpoint emotions, and locate intermittently with a witty finger the pulse of certain social issues (like what the hell tribute bands are all about and WHY). But the tone in which he does so is sometimes reminiscent of...how shall I put it? A smart-ass thirty-year-old who thinks he is very clever with his observations, and justifies it by saying he is a Gen X'er and entitled to his lofty superiority. In other words, if you read Klosterman, you're just the type of person he'd look down on.In trying to deconstruct pop culture, Klosterman sometimes comes across as believing himself an expert about everything American. He also has no qualms about insulting outright the very audience reading his book. Even though he jokes in the beginning that he writes these things late at night in a state of near-delirium, you still get the impression he thinks he is, as he might put it, the &quot;uber-mensch&quot;.Some of the essays are so specialized that I had absolutely no interest in reading them, and skipped right over them as I realized the entire essay was absorbed in deconstructing, say, basketball heroes. So I can't really say I enjoyed the entire book - some of it was unintelligible to me; hence, 3 stars (IMHO).True, Klosterman has been saturated with pop culture through his research and work with major magazines, but most of his off-the-cuff opinions are just that -- opinions and rantings rather than hard facts supported by any type of references, so keep in mind that you're reading personal essays, rather than research articles.Perhaps I was tainted, since I had just finished reading half of Michael Moore's &quot;Stupid White Men,&quot; and the entire of Jon Krakauer's &quot;Under the Banner of Heaven,&quot; so one more book illustrating the hopeless stupidity of the human race may have caused me unfair irritation.Strong essays for the most part, well written, but I lost interest and read them very patchily throughout the last half of the book because the tone grated on my nerves."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"As far as I can tell, there are only two explanations for this book. Either Klosterman was trying to write a satire of what a self-important, but not very intelligent a**hole, would write in a series of essays or Klosterman is a self-important, but not very intelligent a**hole. I'm going w/ the later.Just a few examples:- In one of the essays Klosterman argues that soccer will never make it big in America. On this point we agree. His argument based on his failure as a little league baseball coach. Apparently, Klosterman tried to be one of those hyper-intense coaches who tried to work out his own personal daddy issues by trying to turn a team of 9 year olds into a finely tuned baseball machine. Because this didn't work out, and Klosterman might have a problem with women, soccer will never make it big in America. Um, okay.- Klosterman's discussion of math and probability would embarass a stoned 16 year old with it's facile reasoning.- Like other writers of his generation, of which I am part, Klosterman has somehow confused an obsession with, and Rainman like recall of, certain pop culture elements (cereal, Saved by the Bell, The Real World)with actual knowledge and understanding. Perhaps one day he will read a book or see a movie created before the 1960s."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Klosterman is constantly making references to conversations he's had at parties, which is appropriate since there seems to be a \\"Klosterman\\" at every hipster party I've ever been to... The guy who is funny for the first five minutes you meet him, interesting for the next ten, and then offensively pedantic and self absorbed for the next three hours before you realize you're really either too old or too well adjusted to keep going to these damn hipster parties in the first place.I only finished this book out of a sense of duty to the 9 dollars and 99 cents I spent to download this adolescent diatribe to my Nook. Klosterman's an intellectual lightweight with a Mohammad Ali sized personality, which is why the ideas in the book are forgettable , but the voice of the author sticks with you like gum on the bottom of your shoe. I felt like I was stuck in a room with Rush Limbaugh, if Rush Limbaugh was a tad funnier and a tad smarter but just as obnoxious, sexist, solipsistic, and frivolous.Do not buy this book. Go to the book store, skim the essay about The Sims (which, like so many of these essays, already feels dated but, unlike the rest, is actually though-provoking), and move on with your life and your wallet."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I decided to read this book after considering the many positive reviews along with the accolades of several independent book sellers. I shouldn't have. I'm not going to say this book is bad, but its certainly not anywhere near being good either.This book is a self-described manifesto, which it is not. It is the inane ramblings of someone who does not suffer from lycantrophy. It is dysfunctional, poorly written, and is essentially about nothing at all. I liken it to a Seinfeld episode, in print form, but without the distraction that comes from actual humor or entertainment value. In hind site, I'm starting to wish Klosterman did suffer from lycantrophy.If you don't believe me, I will let a Chuck Klosterman quote from the book serve as a one line synopsis:\\"Do you not see what I am no longer not saying to you? If so-congratulations!\\""},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"It was impossible to read these essays and not imagine that they were typed as spouted, realtime, by a smart, overcaffeinated english major sitting on a couch in a dormitory. You can almost see the (cheap, industrial) carpeting and hear the 'k-cchunk' of the vending machine in the background.This can be fun, but what we all learned in college is that it's important not to take couch-speaker-guy's opinions as seriously as he takes them. That's the case here, too. Klosterman guesses at things when ninety seconds of googling would have given him the facts; he makes assertions and then, rather than backing them up, goes on to further assertions, possibly in hopes that you'll be too busy trying to keep up to start poking holes in his argument; and every now and then, despite his open contempt for people who use words without understanding their meanings, he does this himself (e.g. describing this collection as a 'manifesto')."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I have a 30 yo barely single professional son. He says this book is his Bible - so I read it. What better way to find out who or what this boy worships?Klosterman is an entertaining writer, serving up a unique critique of post-modern popular culture. Although each essay contains a major theme, over 400 individual entries are in the index - songs, movies, personalities from all entertainment venues, sitcoms, concepts, rock bands, periodicals, organizations, events - even a little religion thrown in for the \\"Left Behind\\" crowd.*Billy Joel is popular because he's so good, he doesn't have to be cool - whereas the usual rock band doesn't have to be exceptional if they are consistently cool.*Our author got fired from being a Little League baseball coach one high school summer for trying too hard to win. I'm just impressed when a high school kid takes on that kind of responsibility - but you may have to consider an \\"enhancement factor\\" for this story.*excerpts about self-delusion, evolutionary psychology, and philosophy - without the formal terminology, especially in his bit about Woody Allen. He wouldn't be interested in a girl uncool enough to be interested in him.*tribute to Guns 'N Roses as he travels with a band trying to duplicate their songs and general funk.*instructions on how to be a conversationalist (he has enough material for three dates only): \\"First, make an intellectual concession (makes listener comfortable). Next, make a completely incomprehensible but remarkably specific 'cultural accusation' (makes you insightful). Finally, end the dialogue by interjecting slang lexicon that does not necessarily exist (makes you contemporary). Example: When talking about sports: I mean, come on - you just know that Rodney Rogers is sitting in the locker room before every game reading Nietzsche, and he's totally thinking to himself, \\"If Ron Artest tries to step to me one more time, I'm gonna slap jack his brisket, Philly style.\\"A pervasive nihilistic attitude runs through this book - the angst of single yuppy-hood, deliciously judgemental, documenting the rites of final passage toward marriage, responsibility, and adulthood. I liked it."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"And that \\"certain generation\\" includes me. I think Klosterman is maybe one year younger than me, so I understood virtually all his pop-culture references. The Sims, Saved by the Bell, The Real World, Lloyd Dobler. If you don't know what any of these are, you probably should skip this book. If you do, you should probably read it.I've never read anything by Klosterman before, but I don't know why. I laughed through the whole book. I see some people didn't like the ending chapters, but one of my favorite sections was actually near the end, on what you should really be afraid of in terms of the media (hint: it's not the \\"liberal media\\" bias everyone talks about). I wanted to copy that section and send it to at least 5 of my friends.Also great, though not particularly unique, is his view on why people today have unsatisfying relationships. I've long held similar theories (that we're constantly bombarded by unrealistic ideals of love through movies/music/television), but he presents it better and funnier than I ever could.Do I think, say, my mom would enjoy this book? No. Do I want to give a copy of it to all my friends? Yes."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This book of various essays on pop culture is nearly priceless. Klosterman finds so much relevance in so many throw away items in items in pop culture at times its astonishing. And hilarious. I never thought Saved By the Bell or MTV's Real World could inspire even an interesting paragraph, but Klosterman finds a way to show the significance of these items at the same time conceding their banality in two excellent essays. It's very impressive.The essay on breakfast cereal was completely mindless, and completely laugh out loud funny, especially the descriptions of the socialogy and psychology of various cartoon characters in breakfast cereal ads.Klosterman will take positions you'd never think he'd defend, like describing the brilliance of Billy Joel. I can barely tolerate this artist, but Klosterman has made me reconsider him, and frankly, he was about the last person I'd expect to do this. Nor does he take himself too seriously, as he describes his attendance at a Pop Music Conference for academics and music critics, which he totally skewers, even though he readily admits the conference is made for people like him.And sprinkled through the book are some very insightful comments and insights about the human experience. And Klosterman clearly exposes his personal weaknesses throughout.Is it perfect? No. There are moments where Klosterman comes across like somebody drunk or stoned at a party who thinks he knows it all, and clearly doesn't. Not all of the essays are great. A comparison between Marilyn Monroe and Pamela Anderson as the representative sexpots of their generation isn't anywhere near as profound as Klosterman thinks it is, and is about twice as long as it should be. And the chapter slamming soccer is a pointless, claiming that his experience as a youth baseball coach made him realize how soccer has failed in America. Uh-huh.Let me digress that in the United States, many go to endless lengths to say why soccer in un-American, or fails to capture are collective interest, or will fail as a sport, when the fact of the matter is, the just don't get it. In other countries, people will freely admite they \\"don't get\\" baseball or American football, but Americans feel we need to go to endless lengths to avoid saying \\"I don't get soccer\\". You might say Klosterman inspired me to write this commentary on his commentary.But ANYWAY, read this book, laugh a lot, look at the world a different way, and enjoy a few nuggets of wisdom."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Since cracking open the spine of David Sedaris' Naked, I have had a newfound love for the art of the essay. A friend loaned me this copy, with the advice, \\"Just wait till you get to the Zack Morris part!\\" Despite my temptation, I did read the essays in consecutive order. And overall, this is a funny collection - yes, the Zack Morris essay was definitely my favorite, but I also enjoyed the large section of hypothetical questions. The book is definitely heavy on MTV's Real World references, which didn't interest me as much as Saved By The Bell. I found the collection to be a bit uneven, with some essays definitely stealing the limelight more than others - like the one on the \\"serial killer connections\\"! It will be interesting to see what other topics Klostermann will tackle."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"If you are at the very least familiar with pop culture humor, you are probably know about Chuck Klosterman. I'm not insinuating that you've read all of is works or anything like that, but perhaps you've heard his name before.In \\"Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs,\\" he touches on just about every facet of American society you can think of, from the media to politics to \\"Saved by the Bell\\" to Lakers v. Celtics to a Guns and Roses tribute band. And I left out the other 65,251 pop culture references, many of them music-related in some way.There's no doubt that Klosterman is an excellent writer. His sentences seem to always be the right length, his information and tone is engaging and he gives the reader the opportunity to think along during the travel of any particular column.The only complaint I have is that he overuses irony; and in some places, I don't even think irony applies. I lost count, but it appeared that every column in this book tried to portray irony, which, as a writer, is definitely a good thing to utilize. However, most readers are intelligent enough to decipher some irony, and not need to be reminded of it on every fifth page.I would recommend \\"Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs\\" to anyone who is at least vaguely familiar to American culture, with emphasis from the late '70s to the early '90s. If not, you'll probably miss a lot of the jokes. Oh the irony ... er wait, that's not ironic at all."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"While the language used is simple, giving an appropriate amount of time to the concepts presented required me to set it down and think for a few hours in between chapters. I am torn by this novel. Klosterman is the pied piper of popular culture. I found myself easily drifting towards his school of thought without any protest or hesitation. However, when I finally scrutinized the ideas he was presenting, I realized that I didn't agree with about half of what he was saying. I don't think that the power of the internet and technology is exemplified in amateur porn, but rather a grandfather texting, or youtube.As an artist I am jealous of pop stars and icons. Beyonce will have an opportunity to reach millions more than my art will. For this reason I wanted to read this book. I wanted a serious dissection of popular culture. For the most part, I got it. I loved the sections on The Sims and cover bands. I found those to be the most interesting and have the most implications to my life.I would recommend this book to those who think that pop culture has nothing valid to offer, or those who are obsessed with pop culture. I don't know if I would give it to anyone in between."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I love the style of writing in this book.

Right on and an extremely entertaining read."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I really enjoyed this book for one reason: looking at things that would otherwise be mundane and extrapolating philosophy from them until they become relevant. It's something me and my friends do quite often such as suggesting how different Pok&eacute;mon reflect people we know in real life. Who knew that talks about MTV's Real World, Billy Joel, Saved by the Bell, or the Sims could help us figure out ourselves. I admit that this book is probably geared towards the college-aged crows, as many of the references are things that we either grew up with or know about.Though this book comes across as a cynical, comedic work (and trust me, it does), it has an odd way of being very profound with its assessments on life. I really liked the social commentary that talks about the world that will live in today, with people being shown on the mass media as flat and static characters to be more easily understood.The best parts of the book were actually when he wasn't talking about the topic on hand. Sometimes Klosterman would get off topic and start talking about esoteric revelations of how people come to label themselves; hilarity usually ensued.The essays might not flow from one chapter to the next, but every one will have you thinking and laughing."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Readers who take Chuck Klosterman at his word will have a hard time with this one.

Definitely."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Chuck Klosterman immediately became my favorite author after reading this book. He has a very good grasp of pop culture and deconstructs them in a hillarious way. You can read sections at a time before going to bed. But in my case, the chapters ended up being too good.

It has some very funny chapters, and some of the interludes between chapters are truly great. However, it's really unsatisfying in large doses; after finishing a lot of the chapters, I just felt that I had wasted my time. Klosterman has a nice dry wit, and he's good at BSing about quirky topics. But that's really not enough for me to buy a book.

I absolutely could not put it down through the first half to three-quarters, but I felt it lost steam towards the end. Even so, I would recommend it.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This book started off wonderful and had me laughing out loud. And I continued laughing heartily into the first three chapters. Then, things went downhill for me, and while I still had a few laughs here and there it wasn't consistent.The central idea of this book is a great one. Take pop culture, something that interests nearly everyone, and write a critique of it and make comparisons with your own life. Really great idea. Where the problem lies here is that the subjects are so varied. I'd be reading a chapter about Saved by the Bell that was thoroughly enjoyable, and then you jump to sports. This is fine if you know all about everything he talks about, but if you don't...it's a really tough read. Klosterman makes the assumption that his reader knows everything about every subject he writes about down to the inside jokes. Herein lies a problem. It's hard for me to keep my interest in a subject if I have no idea what you're talking about.But hey, that's just my opinion. Other's may thoroughly enjoy this book, but for me, some parts were just lacking."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I couldn't help picking up Chuck Klosterman's Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto (Now With A Middle). I first became acquainted with the writing of Klosterman in his columns for Esquire magazine-he is always funny and interesting in his digressions of pop culture. He tackles everything from cereal, porn, video games (Simms City), sports (the Boston Celtics/LA Lakers rivalry as a means of self determination-why soccer is lame), music (the non-ironic virtues of Billy Joel, the travails of a Guns& Roses Tribute band, why country music will outlast other types of music), TV (extensive analysis of Saved By The Bell and The Real World), celebrities (why Pamela Anderson tells us who we are), generational analysis (Gen X and its relation to Star Wars, the unrealistic model of maleness in Lloyd Dobler-a character from the movie Say Anything), pop fascination with serial killers, the misconception of a biased media, the unusual world of rock critics, and religion (on the popularity of the Left Behind series of Christian novels. Most of this is quite entertaining, especially if you were born in between 1965-1975. I found myself laughing out loud a lot, but sometimes I was wondered if he really believes all of his cockamamie theories-because it sounds funny or ridiculous. However, several of the essays contain a certain logic. So in some ways the essays can be quite thought provoking. Here's a tidbit about how mass media affects relationships:\\" Pundits are always blaming TV for making people stupid, movies for desensitizing the world to violence, and rock music for making kids take drugs and kill themselves. These things should be the least of our worries. The Main problem with mass media is that it makes it impossible to fall in love with any acumen of normalcy. There is no \\"normal,\\" because everybody is being twisted by the same sources simultaneously. You can't compare your relationship with the playful couple who lives next, because they're probably modeling themselves after Chandler Bing and Monica Geller. Real People are actively trying to live like fake people, so real people are no les fake. Every comparison becomes impractical. This is why impractical has become totally acceptable; impracticality almost seems cool. The best relationship I ever had was with a journalist who was as crazy as me, and some of our coworkers like to compare us to Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungeon. At the time, I used to think, \\"Yeah, that's completely valid: We fight all the time, our love is self-destructive, and-if she was mysteriously killed-I'm sure I'd be wrongly arrested for second-degree murder before dying from an overdose in her parents' basement.\\" We even watched Sid & Nancy in her parents' basement and giggled the whole time. \\"That's us,\\" we said gleefully. And that was the best relationship I ever had. And I suspect it was the best one she ever had, too.\\"At any rate, a fun, easy and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"It is an honor to the be first to review this book on Amazon. This book is not exactly genius, but then again maybe it is. I can't tell what genius is anymore, but this is a kind of genius. Forget the review of the book that appears above from Publisher's Weekly (ok, not completely--they are right that Chuck shines when he is telling personal stories, but they say it is only half a good book). I throughly enjoyed Fargo Rock City and I loved this book of \\"low culture\\" essays. Of course, I probably loved it a great deal because I share some of Chuck's love for the minute cultural details of Gen X and the 1980s. His essay on Billy Joel is actually extraordinary. I love Billy Joel and constantly have to deal with people who tell me what a hack he is. Part of the joy of Chuck is that he revels in things people don't \\"respect\\" (he would say this with air quotes) and respects them because they are meaningful to him. His Saved by the Bell broders on the brillant. Perhaps the best essay in the entire book is the first one, \\"This is Emo\\" about how he will never fall in love because of all the \\"fake love\\" that movies have taught us to expect. He has some wild thoughts, but truly believes in what he says. He is not mean spirited either. He is honest and that rings true. The pop references are awesome of course. Are all the essays perfect? No, but even the weaker ones (the extended riff on alt-country music left me clueless) are often saved by strong passages that hit home. I put Chuck on par with my favorite essayists--Joe Queenan (this book is sort of the anti-Red Lobster, Blue Lagoon) and Sarah Vowell. However, Chuck is a voice all his own. He is the only rock critic I have ever respected. Trust me, that says a ton. Moreover, read the book. It is worth the price to hear an extraordinary voice of a generation."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"(or think they are)This may be a non-sequitur but Chuck's book jacket picture looks like Corey Feldman with blond highlights. (sorry, I just had to get that off my chest) An observation that's less off the wall than Chuck's fresh and crisp writing. He is also clever, funny, twisted, and articulate. His witty essays are full of non-sequiturs but skillfully manages to segue them all in a way that only this sharp Author can.Chuck's vocabulary is to die for. He drops tongue-twisters such as \\"iconoclast\\" like I would use the word \\"like\\". I had my dictionary handy for his use of the words \\"byzantine\\" and \\"zeitgeist\\".Unless you have been living isolated in a cave for these last 30 years, your feelings and passions will be affected by some if not all of his chapters. Each of these droll chapters are stand alone essay topics that are as various as the different channels on cable TV. I also enjoyed it when he shed light on some secrets of the famous and infamous that were either very juicy or just plain weird. Either way, very interesting.His wickedly keen observations range from The Sims phenomena (the most detailed and passionate essay I've ever read about a computer game) to why \\"Sports reporters hate sports\\". He not only takes you behind the scenes but into the minds of various professionals and personas in an uncannily honest and original voice. Before I read this book, I knew nothing about The Sims. I had no idea why my nephew wanted me to buy him this game for his birthday. Now I think I know too much. I finished the chapter with thoughts of God, existence and materialism swimming in my head. (The chapter began with a topic on a game for kids!)You begin each essay thinking Chuck will lead you to one general area, next thing you know this rascal has you questioning the odds on the roll of a dice. The funny thing is, you actually understand his odds predictions. He leaves you doubting everything you learned in that dreaded statistics course you took in College.Within each chapter, Chuck will touch upon something that you can't wait to share with someone you know because you know they will agree with Chuck's discourse on the movie Vanilla Sky or even his slight mention of the band sigur r&oacute;s. (Co-incidently, he does not mention the movie and the band in any related way or even in the same chapter but my favorite sigur r&oacute;s song is on the Vanilla Sky soundtrack. That's a killer soundtrack by the way.)But most of all, I just got the sense that he did not want you to blindly accept the printed word whether those words were on a napkin, a newpaper or the Bible. He doesn't care what you believe or don't believe, as long as that belief is informed and can survive under his under-the-microscope-examinations.He delivers all this in an easy to enjoy and digest, non heavy-handed, tongue-in-cheek way with a wink. But most of all, I just know that if he gets laid because of this book, he'll think this a success."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This book did not let me down.

Did you know that some relationships don't work out because the participants have an unrealistic notion of love due to watching too many movies? If so, you probably don't need to read this book. Even if you didn't know these things, you probably still shouldn't, because you might be naive enough to believe Klosterman's implication that these are somehow distinctly late-twentieth-century, television-era phenomena. Did you know that your musical tastes don't necessarily have to be governed by how \\"cool\\" the artist is, by how the genre and style would tend to affect your \\"image?\\" I would hope so, at least if you're over the age of 22. I read the blurbs about this book and thought to myself, \\"Maybe this is some undiscovered genius of a cultural critic who will really shed light on the modern experience.\\" Nope. Klosterman talks about behaviors that people have been exhibiting for millenia and pretends he's making new observations because he illustrates his points using semi-new pop culture products. This is hack work. If you're the kind of person who would be interested in reading a book on culture, you can probably skip this because you're probably already at least as observant as Klosterman.

This is a great book for anyone who's intelligent enough to laugh at themself as well as at others."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Chuck Klosterman makes an interesting arguement in the introduction to his book \\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs\\". He states that pop culture in many ways is connected, and proceeds to attempt several essays which each relate an appreciation of what most people would kindly refer to as \\"crap\\". Sometimes this reliance on pop culture references can be too cute for its own good, and there will be some moments when you wonder why Mr. Klosterman is not currently residing in a mental ward.Things get off to a promising start, with an examination of why real relationships cannot live up to the fictional representation of such films as \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" and \\"Say Anything\\". The essay sets up Klosterman's usual set-up for each piece: a long paragraph or two about something slightly related to the main topic, then a sudden and revealing link to the main topic. In other words, the type of essay you're supposed to write for creative writing class. The fact is, sometimes Klosterman's tangents are intriguing. But after a while, you might find yourself wondering why the hell he went through all that to get to the main point of discussion.As other reviewers have pointed out, some essays feel like perfectly-constructed examples of pitch-perfect expositions on such topics as \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\", \\"Saved By The Bell\\", and serial killers (as well as a drop-dead hilarious piece on the existential dread of cartoon ceral pitchmen). Other times, though, they seem to be magazine articles culled to fill out the required length of the book (the Guns and Roses cover band essay would not be out of place in \\"Spin\\", where Klosterman is employed, but it seems to not quite fit despite being about something less than reality). All in all, it's a typical case of good essays sometimes being hidden between odd or just plain \\"bad\\" pieces. It's the same with any essay collections for the most part.Klosterman's most interesting piece is the \\"Empire\\" one, which posits it as the inspiration for much of Gen X culture's outlook. To think about it, he has a point: the bad guy wins, the main hero doesn't win because he rejects his parent's way of life, and everything that could go bad does. The last piece, about the rise of \\"Left Behind\\" and Kirk Cameron in contemporary Christian circles, avoids the typically lazy bashing that most other writers use when approaching this subject. He points out that, up to a point, they are to be admired (he points the the moment when that admiration should end, however).Klosterman also offers insight into the media that argues bias on either side of the political spectrum is trumped by the desire to sell papers, sports journalists slowly grow to hate their professions because of atheletes and fans, and newspapers are programmed for illiterates. He makes some good points that should be considered in any journalism classes.Chuck Klosterman puts himself and his tastes out there, and you have to respect that whether you agree or not (Ken Tucker is particularly and oddly viscious about Klosterman in his own book about TV). His writing is bold, incisive, and best taken as the ravings of a slightly mad person who nonetheless sees a lot of meaning in things that most other people take for granted. \\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs\\" is sometimes too cute in its assumptions, but it makes up for that by being unfailingly fun to read. And that's really all you could ask of a book that discusses the ethical dilemmas of Zack Morris or whether John Cusack should apologize for raising the collective expectations of the world's women. There's plenty to enjoy in Chuck Klosterman's work, and you might find yourself looking differently at culture once you finish it."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"The first chapter of this book is by far the best essay I've read concerning love in the twenty first century. Klosterman put down in words what I had been trying to put a finger on for years: while we all love Lloyd Dobler, he, along with asanine coldplay, are doing everything they can to make it so that true love is forever beyond the ordinary man's reach. The rest of the book flows well, but is not quite so my generation as five years before mine."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"There were only three essays I found interesting in this waste of paper (or e-ink, I should say).Other than the saved by the bell, marilyn monroe/pam anderson, and cover band essays, I found this book unreadable.I got so bored reading it I started skipping chapters, hoping to find something that I could stand to read, until I found myself at the end.How so many people rated this book 4 and 5 stars I'll never understand.Don't waste your money and time."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This book is great for those who like to ponder the meaning of life to those who don't even like to read that much. It is funny, witty, the concepts are easy for anyone to grasp, and teaches us that never should we take life so seriously when it is influenced by such silly media. I laughed out loud and read parts aloud to anyone in the room at the time. A great book."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. I think Chuck makes some interesting points & talks about a nice variance of subjects. I would recommend this for anyone into pop culture. I will say however that he comes off as rather pretentious. Anyone who knows that much about Saved By The Bell at his age kinda freaks me out. But over all an entertaining read. If he layed off some of the ridiculous, showy words I probably would have given him 4 stars."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Oh, how I wanted to love this book. I love books about nothing, especially when people write about nothing very well. Nothing can be really amusing, and nothing is the perfect prelude to sleep. This book, however, almost induced a coma with all of its pretentious stupidity and references to Pamela Anderson and various serial killers. While the effort to be Deep and Outrageously Funny shown through like a 5000 watt lightbulb, the actual result amounted to one of the most mind-numbing and tedious expositions on Nothing that I have read in a long time. (Read at your own risk.)"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"While this book offers much insight into human nature, it offers very little pop culture analysis. The stories Klosterman uses are laced with his nostalgia and contain very little relateable knowledge; it is much like a personal diary. Finally, Klosterman uses many of the techniques he comments on in the book and thusly tries to avoid, making the book very hypocritical. Nevertheless, he employs some very interesting views points, which ultimately led me to read the book with a highlighter to remember them."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Chuck Klosterman is brilliant.

He also thinks the things I wish I could think."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Does this book live up to it's hype. In a word no, but it was still an enjoyable read. Some chapters were right on, others didn't work for me.

I discovered CK through listening/reading Bill Simmons, and have enjoyed his take on the random topics they discussed. Needless to say, I had somewhat high hopes for his books and was not disappointed. I was born one year after where CK set his Gen-X cutoff, but I would have to include myself in his targeted demo. Obviously this book is now 8 years old, but I think it holds up well if you consider yourself a Gen-Xer.The book is a collection of essays, some more interesting than others, but overall thought provoking and funny and as random as I expected. I especially enjoyed his SBTB thoughts, the Pam Anderson-as-modern-woman comparison, The Empire Strikes Back as a metaphor for Gen-X, and his description of playing The Sims for the first time. I think SD&CP; was a good starting point, and I look forward to reading all of the other random pop culture/philosophy books CK has churned out over the years."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I don't think I technically belong to Generation X (honestly, I'm not quite sure which generation I belong to, but it's definitely not the Greatest one), so I don't have that in common with Chuck Klosterman, but he and I definitely share a sense of humor. I found myself laughing out loud, a lot, while reading this book.Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs is really a series of short essays. Each essay looks at some piece of pop culture, particularly from Klosterman's youth/college years, and examines its deeper meaning and how it is reflective of real life. Nothing is really off limits and Klosterman finds deeper meaning in things you would never think had anything more than a superficial value. He looks at the Real World and how we now look at the real people in our lives and determine which Real World stereotype they fit instead of the other way around. He explains the two reasons why soccer will never catch in America the way it has in other countries. Klosterman digs into Saved by the Bell and the \\"Tori Paradox\\" only to conclude that the \\"Tori Paradox\\" is no paradox at all. He dissects why Pamela Anderson is the new Marilyn Monroe.Klosterman hits topics from all over the map and he can get down right esoteric in his efforts to peel back the layers of pop culture. In one essay he looks at movies like Memento, The Matrix, and Vanilla Sky and how they're valuable because they try to define or identify reality. Deep stuff, man.Not all of the essays are great - the one about Memento almost read like philosophy and got a little boring. This probably makes the book sound more serious than it is - it's really funny. I was laughing out loud in a number of public places while reading this. The more I read, the more I laughed, and the more I liked it. I ended up tearing through the whole book in just a couple days and I'm planning to read some of his other books as soon as I can.In a nutshell: This is a really funny book - I definitely recommend it. Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"this point of view is so great and i can relate to most of it. a little rambling at times seems like filler but i will definitely be looking for more books from this guy."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Very good and funny at times, very slow and boring at other times.This book is a tribute to older days and in it's own perfect way itis the bipolar teenager it tries to capture.

I'm only halfway through this book, but I am really enjoying it thus far. I agree with a lot of the same things that he says. I'ts funny, entertaining and makes me smile and chuckle a lot. I like the fact that the book is geared toward readers in my age group - 25+. I can't wait to ready his previous books."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The author is very good at provoking thought while being humorous. Most of the pop culture was relatable to me. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Klosterman for president. Loved the book loved his crazy ability to connect pop culture to collective societal conciousness that may only exist to Chuck himself. Nevertheless, I found myself agreeing with him alot of times or just going with it. The essay that really stuck out to me as literary genious was the missing sock one. Histerical. The 23 questions? Brilliant! It made up for the sports references and defending country music(why I gave it 4 stars and not 5). I heart this guy."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Klosterman is at his absolute best with \\"Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs.\\" I've never been much of a reader. Essentially it has been baseball books, \\"Animal Farm\\" and little else. That all changed when I stumbled across SD&CP. I plowed through this book cover-to-cover, absolutely eating up all of the pop-culture references that--for a change--were the same random references I'd been making for years. How often does a book so appropriately praise \\"Saved by the Bell,\\" \\"Steve Perry & Journey,\\" and \\"Britney Spears\\" all in one fell swoop?! It just doesn't happen. Since SD&CP, I've read the rest of Klosterman's work and a bunch of books from the same \\"genre\\" of modern pop-culture authors. Needless to say this book...in addition to reeking of awesomeness...has opened me up to a whole new world of books. Thanks Chucky K!"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I think what sold me on this book was the reviewer's comments on the back cover which mentioned Klosterman's \\"raw associative powers\\". Klosterman certainly has associative powers in spades (and clubs and aces and diamonds) and he puts them to good use in this collection of essays and critiques of pop culture.I am five years removed from \\"Generation X\\" and while I have many ideas and experiences in common with the author, I tend to think that Klosterman spends way too much time obsessing about things that really don't matter at all. I would advise Chuck to spend a little more time walking in the fresh air and a little less time gazing at the TV, his navel, and his CD collection. But given that Klosterman chooses to spend so much mental effort in navel gazing, he certainly comes up with some interesting and surprising ideas and patterns, and the results can be funny, clever, and revealing.However, his style is so dense and prolix that most readers will be better served simply dipping into the book at random and reading for a few minutes, rather that trying to plow straight through.My chief criterion for whether I enjoy an writer is simply this: whether I agree with him or not, is he capable of making me think about things in a new way without being overly pedantic or strident? Klosterman fills that criterion admirably. I don't know if I will bother to seek out any more of his collections but I will hang onto this one and reread every couple of years until/if I finally get bored."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I usually make note of brilliant and memorable lines from the books I read. In the case of Klostermans manifesto, I'd essentially be photocopying the entire book if I wanted to capture every brilliant insight and hilarious witticism. Klosterman attacks every topic under the sun, and he states his random philosophies as absolute fact. He expounds on subjects endlessly, tying together outrageous theories about every aspect of pop culture.Klosterman as a music and culture critic is entirely love-it or hate-it. Read the first essay before you buy this book, and if it grabs you, you're in for a treat.On p 182 Klosterman discusses hitchhiking. He states he was told never to hitchhike because drivers who pick up hitchikers are serial killers. Then he was told that all hitchhikers were serial killers. \\"According to what I learned in public school, every person on the freeway was trolling for destruction. I used to imagine nomadic, sadistic drifters thumbing rides with bloodthirsty Volkswagen drivers, both desperately waiting for the first opportunity to kill eachother. Hitchiking seemed like an ultraviolent race against time.\\""},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Although he covers wildly varied topics, Chuck Klosterman's lively, stylish collection of essays speaks for and largely to one generation: Gen X. The author focuses not just on pop culture, but instead on pop culture's detritus. He doesn't discuss the best pop culture products. Rather, he covers the random bits and pieces that interest him. Some of these subjects merit his attention, such as popular television shows like The Real World, which have shaped later genres. Some of the other topics to which Klosterman turns his intelligence, ready wit (and occasionally profane tongue) are less obviously relevant - such as the meaning of breakfast cereal ads. He would argue that it doesn't matter, that everything in a society is connected and every part of popular culture tells us something about the way of life that produced it. Even so, you could still debate just what these specific items communicate - and while Klosterman's conclusions are always entertaining, many of them are highly debatable. In the areas such as music and celebrity journalism, where he is deeply experienced, his conclusions are more convincing and his ideas are most interesting. In other areas where he seems to spin positions from a more limited perspective, he is intriguing, but much less convincing. Despite this mixed menu and mixed perspective, we recommend this clever manuscript to pleasure readers who want a fun ride through pop land and to serious readers who are trying to understand the Gen X mindset."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"While this book may not be the \\"best\\" book I have ever read, I would say it was the most entertaining. There is one problem though. To fully enjoy it you must think like the author. Klosterman tackles a different topic in each chapter and looks at it in a humrous light each time. While I personally found it hysterical, I could easily see someone else finding it to be nothing more than a set of annoying journal entries. If you are familiar with Klosterman's work and are a fan of his I would no doubt reccomend this book to you as I have to all my friends already. If you are not sure about him yet however, you may want to pick up a Spin magazine and check him out beforehand."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Now, you and I both know that the phrase 'philosopher' gets thrown around much too much these days. Anyone with an idea about life is instantly branded as such, even though they do not really deserve it, which is not to say that there are less intelligent or skilled, they just are not philosophers, people doing battle with man's very purpose and exsisitence and drive (see KRS-ONE). That said, Chuck Klosterman is a philospher. If Socrates had the question \\"What is justice?\\" then Klosterman has \\"What is coolness?\\" Sure, at first that sounds silly, but think about it: can you actually define coolness? I strongly doubt it (no offense). Is it merely being liked? Is it follwing trends or breaking away from them? Klosterman struggles with these questions, analyzing various aspects of soceity to do so (nothing is too minute or too big for him to take on, be it the Trix Rabbit as a William S. Burroughs/Christ figure, the coolness of born-again Christians, or how the 80's NBA rivalry between the Celtics and the Lakers explains everything that needs explaning). In between each essay (which are, for no stated reason, deemed 'tracks' like they would be on an CD), Klosterman offers little vignettes from his life, some no more than two paragraphs, some a couple pages long. They add to Klosterman's own personal identity. Of course, I've totally ignored his humor up till now. The man is freaking hysterical, no if's and's or but's about it. So in conclusion: but this book. It's the best new writing you'll get your hands on in a while."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"\\"When I get up in the morning nothing seems to make sense. At night everything has meaning and seems to be connected. That's why I hate to go to sleep.\\" That's how Chuck Klosterman introduces his series of essays about popular culture, \\"Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs.\\" He has a real knack of teasing profound meanings out of the seeming trash of pop culture. And unlike a lot of other critics who start out writing about rock, he's not trying to prove he's in the Red Guards. He's a philosophical and temperamental moderate. In fact, his analysis of the 1980's rivalry between the Boston Celtics and the L.A. Lakers says that it was a ideological competition between right-wing individualism (Celtics) and corporate liberalism (Lakers); and he sheepishly confesses he's a Celtics man.He also writes about John Cusack's irresistable attraction for the women of his generation (and how we love the image of romance, not the real thing.) He proclaims Billy Joel's greatness in spite of Joel's lack of \\"coolness.\\" He trashes soccer in a very satisfying way for those of us who hate it. He analyzes the strange mythic appeal of \\"Saved By The Bell\\"; it's the stupid popular kid's dream of what life should be like. He theorizes that the doom and gloom of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" could have influenced the famous pessimism of the entire so-called Generation X. On these many subjects Klosterman isn't quite as funny as Kevin Smith or Quentin Tarantino, but he's more articulate. There's much fun to be had in this book."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I heard rave reviews about this book from a large number of people and my roommate had it sitting on his desk so I picked it up and read it. Upon finishing I put it down and thought, \\"wow, that was the most abysmal piece of literature I have ever read.\\" Klosterman is like a 40 year old kid who, quite obviously has no semblence of a life, because not only has seen every episode of every \\"Real World\\" ever not once, but 3 times, and then decided it was worth his time to write an essay on how it has skewed the views of our society. WHAT??!?!!?!? In short Klosterman wastes 253 pages of good trees to tell us his revalatory findings after trying to get laid in the SIMS after sitting in his basement for over a weeks worth of hours playing it and other completely-irrelevent-to-life topics. And then he wonders why he can't get a girlfriend...Go figure."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Generation X: \\"Those born in the Western Hemisphere between 1960 and 1980 who are \`technically' part of the post-WWII baby boomer generation but feel no connections to its cultural icons.\\"This definition should give you pause before picking up Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs, mainly because if you weren't born between 1960 and 1980, much of what is discussed in Chuck Klosterman's book will be lost on you.Publisher's Weekly didn't care for this memoir-turned-manifesto, saying that if you \\"Removed all the dated pop culture analyses, Klosterman's book had enough material for about half a really great memoir.\\" But this completely misses the point of the what the author's trying to get across (leaving me to surmise that the person who reviewed it at Publisher's Weekly might not be a Gen-Xer).What Klosterman's narrative does is fairly extraordinary (more on that in a second) but it also alienates anyone who's not within the age-range specified by the birth years above. My mother is an avid reader, burning through ten or more books a month but I'd never dream of giving her this book to read even though I enjoyed it (mostly).Now, getting back to Publisher's Weekly. You can't remove the pop cultural analyses because that is the foundation upon which the book is built. And since it's a first person, nonfiction narrative, of course it's going to have to cover some memoirs of Klosterman himself. And here's the amazing thing about that: Klosterman isn't that interesting. But his prose is so sharp, witty and meshing, those who are Gen-Xers will probably fall in love with his style.Let me show you what I mean. In chapter 10, Klosterman discusses advertising and it's impact on Gen-X culture: \`...kids don't really understand the nuance of cereal advertising until they reach their twenties; this is when characters like the Trix Rabbit evolve into understated Christ figures. And though the plot is not purposeful on behalf of cereal makers, it's also not accidental. Cereal mascots are generally associated with sugared cereals - while a box of Wheaties might feature anyone from Bruce Jenner to Michelle Kwan, Count Chocula sticks with its mischievous vampire. Super Golden Crisp sells itself with the portrait of a laid-back bear wearing a mock turtleneck; Grape Nuts sells itself with a photograph of Grape Nuts. And this is more proof of cereal's overlooked relationship to American cool: Being cool is mostly ridiculous, and so is sugared cereal. That's why we like it.'This is a single example of how Gen-Xers perceive the world around them and how our icons (yes, I'm a Gen-Xer) don't necessarily match those of our parents'. But that's okay, and Klosterman notes that although things like pop culture mutate from decade to decade, they also stay similar ...with maybe just a few mild changes. Klosterman compares the sex symbology of Marilyn Monroe with that of Pamela Anderson and does so while watching the racy - and pirated - video of Pamela performing oral sex on her then husband, rocker Tommy Lee. Now, most people born before 1960 will probably find this offensive, since Marilyn was the epitome of sex in the post-WWII mind and could never - EVER! - see her executing such a move on President Kennedy or Joe DiMaggio (even though she probably did). But Gen-Xers don't have that affinity for her, and Pamela is the new symbol for sex in the minds of many men (and women). If you find these kinds of comparisons distasteful, then you're probably not a Gen-Xer and shouldn't read this book.I will say that the author lost me in chapter three, though. Never having watched Real World on MTV, these pages fell flat for me because I had no comparisons to draw from whenever Klosterman started in on that irreverent series. But this was the only chapter where that occurred.Everything else - from talking about how Billy Joel \\"is not cool which actually makes him cool\\", to how artless the Left Behind book series are - I followed along eagerly, finishing this 243 page book in a few short days.Gen-Xers, you owe it to yourselves to pick up a copy and gobble down all the sex, drugs and Cocoa Puff comparisons this able author offers up to you."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Manifesto? No. Essay collection? Yes. Can one tread the razor's edge between ironically tragic and tragically ironic, and manage to say something concrete and memorable? Can one deliver profound insight into Life and living by extensive deconstruction of lame TV shows, vapid celebrities, and the way the rest of Idiot America so desperately, needily relates? This seems to be Klosterman's game here, but he doesn't really walk that edge; he just keeps hopping back and forth across it. The conclusion of the foreword clues you in: \\"In and of itself, nothing really matters. What really matters is that nothing is ever \`in and of itself.'\\"Okaaaay, so jump on in.It's something when a book can make me actually laugh out loud, and Klosterman's book did that about a half-dozen times, like when he asks if two titles in the born-again-Christian/Armageddon \\"Left Behind\\" series, The Destroyer is Unleashed and The Beast Takes Possession were Ronnie James Dio albums. I'll give him that much: when he's rolling, he can write some really funny and entertaining stuff, absolutely hilarious. That being said, within a couple of weeks of finishing this book I was struggling to remember what it was all about. I remember an essay aboutThe Sims, ruminations on porn and the Internet, extended dialogs onSaved By the Belland a chance Olympia, Washington (just screaming Sleater-Kinney) encounter with a serial killer, and some stuff about dating and working and scratching a living as a defiant Gen-X slacker, but that's about it.Other reviews have called his essay subjects \\"stupid,\\" but I'd argue that \\"inventive\\" probably would be a more accurate description. He's a serious geek who's totally gay forStar Wars, porn, basketball, reality TV, movies and music, but he's also a guy who doesn't just sit and bob his head; he's got that thinking thing going on, too. That comes through in the rambling and ultimately self-contradictory and confusing--yet thoroughly fun to read--essay on the true musical genius of Billy Joel, where somehowSerpico,Steely Dan, Patrick Henry,the Clash, the suckiness of the Eagles, World War II,the Sex Pistols, the Carter administration's relationship toBorn to Run, Elvis Costello, Randy Newman,Catch-22, and Raymond Carver all orbit cosmically around the Piano Man. And that's just 12 pages of riffing. Later we're informed that Pamela Anderson is the \\"most crucial woman of her generation,\\" and it takes another 12 pages of extended footnoted dissection to attempt to make it all clear.Klosterman is at his best when he lets his own personal details slide into the cultural riffs, when he contextualizes his wide-ranging abstracts with concrete examples of where he's gone, what he's done and seen, and what he truly thinks about the issue at hand. The best parts were his admissions of failure, his admissions of lying and deceit when it comes to women, how most of the pieces he wrote as a movie reviewer were so soundly rejected because they offered insight and analysis, more than a shallow synopsis and a formulaic thumbs up/down. These aren't raw, juicy secrets, just simple personal admissions of failure and disillusion, and I found it to be the most connective writing in the entire book.My absolute favorite part of the book is the list of 23 questions Klosterman has devised to test \\"whether (he) can really love\\" someone. These are great ice-breakers, and good for use in the office as well. They're definitely a way to get to know someone, if they answer truthfully. My only disappointment here was that he offered no answers from either himself or others.There are some little things in this book that did endear Klosterman to me: The table of contents has a credits listing just like album liner notes. He actually uses footnotes for intellectually relevant portions of his discussions, and just for fun, too (man, that comes in handy for that painfulThe Real Worldnarrative). And there's actually an index! This is a brilliant addition, a perfect intellectual counterpoint to the footnotes, but the editorial execution is sloppy; there are tons of names listed in the book which do not make it to the index.Bottom line: If you're older than 45, most likely you're just not going to get it, period. The references that make up Klosterman's cosmology will be a complete mystery. If you're looking for organized, linear, straightforward media and pop-culture analysis, then Klosterman's scattershot, jump-cut, ADHD approach will infuriate you. But, if you're plugged in to TV and music and mainstream American media, and you are able to think past next week's \\"American Idol\\" to questions of what it all means and where all this is headed and what it's doing to us as a society, then this book will resonate with you, and you'll enjoy it, as I did."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Chuck Klosterman's essays strike a chord with me, and most likely with a number of people between the ages of 25-35. He talks about life and the meaning and condition of life as reflected in the various forms of entertainment we have absorbed throughout our lives.There will be something for you to latch onto and other things to disagree with in each essay. Each is similar to topics of conversation at every bar or cocktail party in America. The only frustrating thing is that it's a book, not a dialogue.Because many books of essays are thoroughly new and educational to me, I am content to sit back and read them and let them teach me. But Klosterman's essays are like the conversations I have with people almost on a daily basis. I am not used to having to sit still and listen to someone's theories on the Real World and how it has changed our lives and the way we see ourselves without being able to respond in kind.However, that's also the satisfying thing about these essays. Whether you love Coldplay or hate them, whether you think being a Celtic fan is an expression of your Reagan-era conservatism, or if playing the Sims has ever sparked existential thoughts, or it's just about buying new stuff or torturing your simulated alter ego, in other words, whether you agree with Klosterman's expostulations on his subjects or not, you will at least be sparked to think about these things.By that I mean not just thinking about Saved by the Bell, or Lloyd Dobler or the Real World. I mean thinking about whether in this day and age we can ever be satisfied with a relationship; whether we live our lives in a self-absorbed, self-examining, exhibitionist way as a result of reality shows; and whether people really do drift in and out of our lives without our really noticing, and what that says about our own self-centeredness.It's an interesting book and the only thing I could wish is that it also came with one dinner with the author so that you could reply to him and give commentary on the things he has written."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"klosterman is a genius. now that i've got that out of the way, if you were born to live your childhood through the decadence of the nineties, than this is a book that will enrapture you in the absurdities and realties of it all experienced through one man's eyes. So true, and the hardest i've ever laughed. I can't recommend Klosterman more than the fact that his point of view, his conflicting personal drama and complete unabashed nature makes for the most entertaining read on pop culture i've ever had the pleasure of reading. If you enjoyed this book, than be sure to check out his book about eighties hair bands, Fargo Rock City. Classsssssic."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I thought this insightful and hilarious commentary on modern sociocultural life was so great! From the beginning where he (rightfully) blames Coldplay for ruining the average person's concept of love to the end where he notices how the Left Behind series just reminds us that most of us will never reach heaven by their strict regulations and everything in the middle (The Empire Strikes back sets the tone for a life of disappointment, a Guns and Roses cover band, the Real World sectioning the population into 7 distinct personality types, and my personal favorite, an obsession with serial killers) is literarily stimulating, thought provoking, and hilarious. I wish this guy was my best friend. The book starts off stronger than it ends, but this I think is more a mistake in layout than in the essays in the book. Every chapter makes me smile and want to call my friends and read it to them. I've had several friends ask to borrow it, and after learning how long the list is, went ahead and bought their own copy, and are damn glad they did so."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Chuck certainly has some thought provoking comments and is often entertaining; however, I would argue that he did not accomplish his goal. Overall, this is an entertaining read, but rather than being an examination of our society and public psyche through a discussion of contemporary pop culture, it is largely an expression of the authors nostalgia for the 1990's."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Also jarringly profound at times (see chapter on MTV's \\"The Real World.\\") I read this book while waiting in the hospital for my son to recover from heart surgery and it was a godsend.

His observations on pop culture are insightful and remarkably indepth with a twist. It's the twist in his logic that kept me amused. He's an original and strong voice in the chronicle of our times. That said, some ideas ran too long. I never watched the Real World so the 14 pages dedicated to that were lost. Later, he gives Saved By The Bell the same treatment. Having been a fringe audience to that particular show, I appreciated it more but still. Are we, as a generation, what we watch? Is that the great common denominator? How sad.

In his defense, he's a very good writer, who's analytical, has an interesting take on things, and has a creative way of expressing himself.

A friend of mine left it in my car over the weekend and I decided to take it with me and read on my bus ride to work. Long story short - this book is bad and so is the author.Where do I even start? Chuck starts off with putting the blame for his unsuccessful relationship on Coldplay's live performance in Portland, which \\"his\\" girl chooses to attend rather then spending a weekend with him in New York. (hint: its not Coldplay, Chuck - it's you). The rest of the book is filled with poorly argued points that he keeps making without even a slightest attempt to back them up logically: all Billy Joel's songs sound like an successful suicide attempt (er... No. Have you listened to them?). Pamela Anderson would destroy Michael Jordan had they hooked up (wrong again. All Pam's ex's are living a kickass life). Fans in America hate soccer because they like watching sports where none of the athletes look like them (have you even been outside lately, Chuck? You really think that an average american sports fan looks like a soccer player?!).The absence of logic in this book is so disturbing that by the time you read a chapter about the evolution of internet, you wish you'd never open up its pages.

Mr. Klosterman's garbage can make a reader wish he were as illiterate as the author, that way he wouldn't have to go through the trouble of trying to erase this \\"manifesto\\" from his mind. Attempts at intelligence are feeble. The ramblings seem as though they were written by the least intelligent person you know who has gotten drunk and attempted to be philosophical. Attempts at humor fall far short. One can almost imagine Klosterman giggling to himself at his \\"humor\\" while he is typing. Unfortunately, with the possible exception of a few sycophantic friends, he is the only one. While the joke is obviously on me because I actually paid for this \\"book\\" - which makes me almost feel as though I've been violated, the \\"manifesto\\" is a little more Gummo Marx than Karl.

Otherwise, you're better off hanging out at the local pub with a pint (or other choice beverage) arguing/complaining about how Puck tried to change the face of reality TV."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I'll keep this short since I've already wasted enough time reading this garbage. Chuck Klosterman presents his limited view on a number of uninteresting topics.

The only reason one would purchase a book such as this is to get a laugh. However, there isn't a single funny line in this entire book."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Chuck Klosterman, unlike most people *celebrates* his lack of insight. There is nothing ironic about the subtitle, \\"A Low Culture Manifesto\\".What he tries to do / does:* He tries to examine pop-culture phenomena (any piece of trash that trickled its way to him) in a 'postmodern' light or in a 'philosophy for shallow people' way - except if submitted for a college assignment, he would fail (because of plagiarism). There are no new ideas: It is a rehash of a particularly bad reading of ideas put fort by Baudrillard (about 30 years before Chuck wrote this book) and other culture theorists (post modern or not). It is quite formulaic: Throw in references to 'authentic' crap of later half american pop culture, mix it with punch-line pseudo-pseudo-intellectual 'philosophy', swear around, make sex/drug jokes, finish essay (not nec. in that order)* ...or he simply lauds certain trash, for no good reason apart from \\"I like it, it is not cool, it is not even uncool, hence it is great, so I like it\\". He is pride of being an edgy, authentic hick, of being uncool, and shallow. Admitting, or being pride of mediocrity is used as an excuse, and justification, for his utter lack of insight.*He also comments on women (girls, chicks, and more - he has a particularly well-developed vocabulary of 'bad' terms for women) and is somewhat proud of his unjustified, ignorant sexism. He announced that no woman will ever satisy him (as if that is what women are for, satisfying men, thanks for letting us know, Chuck). He is somewhat obsessed with little girls, little boys, and little children in general, bordering on the pathological, which is very disturbing.ConclusionIt is not even funny. It is a complete waste of your time and money. If you enjoy watching thousands of hours of reality TV, this book is just for you. It is not a manifesto of low culture, it is not even low culture, the book is just parasitic, insincere. The author is not only conceited, but is one of the most profoundly dumb writers I've ever read.

I share many of the author's interests, but I disagree with most of his opinions. In spite of these differences I find his writing to be engrossing.In \\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs\\", author Chuck Klosterman sets about tipping many of the sacred cows of his A-D-D generation with a collection of essays on topics like the Simms, Saved by the Bell, Guns and Roses tribute bands, Billy Joel's coolness (or the lack thereof), The Empire Strikes Back, the Celtics/Lakers rivalry, porn, and little league baseball.My personal favorite of the lot is titled \\"What Happens when People Stop Being Polite.\\" It's about MTV's reality show \\"The Real World\\" that began in the summer of'92. Unless you were too young, didn't have cable, or lived in a cave, there was no escaping this show twenty years ago. I would tune in to try to catch a little \\"Enter Sandman\\" or Soundgarden's latest offering and TRW would inevitable be on. Klosterman contends that \\"The Real World\\" caused a whole generation of young Americans to try to morph themselves into the role of one of the seven strangers picked to live together on the show. Face it, we all know at least one Puck.I'm a pretty jaded dude, but \\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs\\" made me laugh out loud a few times. If you came of age during the late 80's-early 90's, this book is a must read for you. It will help you gain insight on why our generation is going to be ultimately responsible for the coming Armageddon."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"My wife asked me to purchase this and she has teally enjoyed it. book was as described and shipped quickly."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Only 20 pages in && I love it!

Now I really have to consider stealing it so I can read it. My boyfriend swears it's one of the most entertaining books he's ever read."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"An interesting read, good for the beach in the summer. Not very memorable though. I read through it pretty quickly."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Klosterman's take on life through the eyes of a jaded gen-xer is not as depressingly solemn as you might think. It's funny, witty, and in some spots even charming. You could go the rest of your life and never read this book, and some will want to avoid it. (Too many f-bombs for my taste.) These always seem to cheapen anything. However, the rest of his word choice, analogies, and sentence structure are superb.His essays on The Sims game franchise, Pamela Anderson, and MTV's Real World are more than just his opinion about what's in the cesspool of pop-cutlure. Rather, they are the foundation for his discussions on topics that actually matter. He ponders questions like, \\"Is Gen-X lost? How obsessed are we with race? Does what we watch on television actually influence how we act?\\" His answers will cause you to think about your relationship with society at large as it pertains to all things pop. No great answers to life issues, just somewhat thought provoking.This pseudo-psychological/sociological analysis will make you think and laugh about \\"The Coolest Generation.\\" We are not the greatest but we are great at being cool, he says. This is indicative in the movies we watch and the music we listen to. Which he also takes jabs at Billy Joel, stating, he was not a cool rocker but he was great and that's why we liked him. On the other hand, he continues, David Lee Roth was cool and we wanted to be like him.Overall, what he discusses isn't really important but that's the point. Why is Star Wars overrated, what does basketball have to do with cereal, and his hatred for soccer are all just some of the entertaining topics. Plus, they will make you think about yourself and even society. I did find it to be a very narrow-minded take on pop-culture as many of his statements are blanket. I do think he is right to a degree in his conclusions but given that these are one man's opinion, they are obviously not definitive."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This book was highly recommended to me and I love it... It's modern philosophy at its finest. Great price and sent in a timely manner. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"In the footsteps of Klosterman's Midwestern memoir/history of hair metal (Fargo Rock City) comes this collection of eighteen essays bearing the asterixed subtitle &quot;A Low Culture Manifesto&quot;. The subtitle itself speaks volumes about the author's general style:a hyper-ironically witty phrase that displays a certain level of erudition along with a wink-wink, nudge-nudge. Klosterman is almost exactly my age, which means that our broad exposure pop culture exposure has been nearly identical, and while I greatly enjoyed the majority of the essays, there's a tension in his writing between wanting to make fun of low culture, and wanting to treat it seriously. It's the same tension (and flaw) of Fargo Rock City-he's writing about his guilty pleasures, but can't quite commit to the guilt or the pleasure. All that aside, I've probably recommended this book to more friends of mine than any other in recent months.If you browse it in the store be aware that the first essay (about how John Cusak, and emo songsmiths like Coldplay have made the concept of love very tricky for Gen Xers-or at least middle-class white ones), is far and away the best in the book. Which is not to say there isn't a lot of other great stuff. The second essay, about the computer game The Sims, is hugely funny (if only slightly insightful) and the fifth (which first ran in The New York Times Magazine) is an engaging account of a weekend spent on the road with a Guns N' Roses cover band. The sixth is also quite strong, being a comparison of Pamela Anderson with Marilyn Monroe that seeks to explain how the role of celebrity has changed over the half-century between them. His essay on internet porn is brief, funny, and moderately thoughtful. Essay ten, on children's breakfast cereals is almost entirely tongue in cheek, and is hilarious. His thirteenth essay wins the prize for best title (&quot;The Awe-Inspired Beauty of Tom Cruise's Shattered, Troll-like Face&quot;), and is a mostly enjoyable muddle of thoughts about contemporary film. After this is a rather wandering (but good) piece on the popularity of country music. Essays sixteen and seventeen are all about the media. The first is a sort of general purpose &quot;here's the truth about the media from an insider&quot; piece, and the second is a very keen report on music critic's conference. Closing things out is a critique of the wildly popular &quot;Left Behind&quot; series. I would recommend all of these to various of my friends.However, a third of the book isn't so good.. The third essay is about MTV's The Real World series, and fails to make any original points about the reality genre. The fourth is a tortured attempt to explain why Billy Joel is cool, and fails on all levels. The seventh entry is a really weak anti-soccer piece that is a total failure except for a portion where he details his job as a youth baseball coach and subsequent firing. The next essay, about the Lakers/Celtics rivalry of the '80s is equally muddled, and incoherent (probably way more so to those who weren't paying attention to the NBA in the '80s). Essay eleven is about the seminal TV show Saved By the Bell, which I've never watched, so that one went right over my head. This is followed by a rather weak essay attempting to tie Gen X malaise to The Empire Strikes Back.Klosterman's writing style is kind of love it or hate it (I love it). He's too clever and sarcastic by half, and doesn't mind showing it off, which can be kind of refreshing. He's also one of the best writers I've encountered when it comes to profanity-he uses it a lot and quite naturally, which helps to draw you into his bizarre little world. He's also a hilarious footnoter, for example, his essay on Internet porn starts: &quot;When exactly did every housewife in America become a whore?&quot; with the footnote reading &quot;Except of course, my mom.&quot; He's also a very prolific digressor, which may infuriate those who want writers to adhere to their one main point, but I rather enjoy the little side trips. I found the 2/3 of the essays that I liked so engaging that I'm willing to let the other 1/3 slide-this time."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Chuck Klosterman's \\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs\\" is the most culturally precise (and hilarious) piece of literature I've ever read and I suspect it's that way for many other people who read \\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs.\\" I imagine that there are two camps of Klosterman readers; the ones who own up to being caught in the sticky web of cultural relevance and acceptance, and the ones who don't. For the latter, this book will annoy the hell out of you. For the former, you'll be-as I was-relieved to know that one's vast and seemingly infinite knowledge of pop-culture is not denotive of some sort of intellectual deficiency. As Mr. Klosterman, with great hubris, socially dissects some of the guiltiest cultural pleasures to arise in the last 20-30 years while maintaining a pretense that almost guarantees you'll have to refer to a dictionary at least once or twice during a reading.Covering an expanse of topics that range from Billy Joel's inability to be cool, to housewife pornography, to the Timothy LaHaye's apocalyptic \\"Left Behind\\" volumes, Klosterman provides a very personal and perhaps ethnographic view of social trends within the last couple of decades. The book is riddled with a mix of intimate social encounters, cultural inclinations, and philosophical musings, all tied together through the eyes of a really weird guy. He details topics like MTV's hit reality series \\"The Real World\\" and interlaces anecdotes about a former roommate with a proclivity for consuming an inordinate number of hotdogs and how they, like the 1992 cast of \\"The Real World,\\" were consumed by the art of argument. Ostensibly, the material discussed in this book seems rather trite and moreover lowbrow. But it becomes succinctly obvious throughout each essay that while many of us have mindlessly given into the mass appeal of reality programming and Bay Watch babes, there is always room in Chuck Klosterman's brain to tease apart the psychology from the trend. And after he's beaten the proverbial horse of analysis into glue, he makes you laugh with his ridiculously etymological footnotes.Perhaps the crowning glory of \\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs\\" is that it captures the irony of a generation - caught in a malaise of confusion, educated, but still caught up in mass consumerism and pop-culture servitude. We have an enormous amount of potential, but we're cramped by emotional insecurity and require a renewable prescription for Zoloft. We do stupid things and adhere to stupid ideas, but we can use big words to qualify ourselves. We're adults, but we still eat flavored cereal. We're complicated and contradictory. This seems to be Chuck Klosterman's message, and it's a message that's delivered with an unparalleled savvy and humor.An aside: I met Chuck Klosterman at a bookstore reading the other day in Los Angeles. After the reading I asked him to sign my book, and I was incredibly nervous. I wound up saying something about being relieved that I hadn't accidentally spit on him or thrown up. I couldn't help but think about the absurdity of my comments, but I was also thinking about how someone like me had come to revere an author who is renown for his sprawling commentary on stuff on television, the radio, in books, and on the Internet. I am more concerned with pop-culture than I have readily acknowledged in the past. However, Klosterman's insights have made him the savoir-faire for those of us who have been in pop-cultural hiding. I no longer feel like I have to hang my head in shame in discussions where people brag about their neo-ludditism or how their parents never allowed them to watch television as children. I've come to believe that all of those things aren't necessarily bad. In fact, they can be quite thought-provoking conversation pieces with the right set of neural wiring.-Kristen M. Powers"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I was excited to read this book, because I was hoping that it would be a critical look at modern society. This book is critical, and it does dissect some modern societal issues, but unfortunately the bad points of the book rule over the good points. I found the author rather labourious, and I really struggled to see the connections between some of the points that he raised. For example, I found the entire chapter on Bill Joel being great, and not cool, extremely painful to read. I must agree with a previous reviewer in that this book reads as though the author had sat down in front of his computer and typed it out to himself, got carried away, didn't have it proofread (a \\"pigeon\\" language ?? It's pidgin...), and has never had his opinions debated.Also, I stay in South Africa and a lot of the stuff I couldn't relate to, because of the cultural references. I've never watched MTV's Real World, and I'm just younger than the Billy Joel generation, so I don't quite grasp the weight of these issues. But also, I think the book would be better if he approached topics in a broader manner. For example, blaming John Cusack and the films he's been in for society's romantic expections, is a bit narrow minded and silly. Shouldn't this be an attack on the entertainment industry, rather than poor John Cusack who is also trying make a buck ?All in all, I hated this book. I would never recommend it to anyone. It's reminiscent of a tongue-in-cheek, pseudophilosophical/pseudological blogger's ravings that have never been opposed. It's extremely difficult to read, because it's tough to make the connections and remain on the same thought path as the author. The author's extremely arrogant attitude takes a long time to get over.

It became too rhetoric, too much like a lecture in which someone is telling you what's \\"uberly\\" important and what sucks. It became really bland, really fast."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs is a collection of essays on popular culture and its connections to psychology, sociology, and other inner workings of society. This book is mainly geared toward Generation X'ers, and I believe that older people may appreciate it, but significantly younger people (born after, say, 1990) may not, since the references may be too obscure.The book covers a variety of topics, from serial killers to the Lakers/Celtics rivalry to breakfast cereal to Billy Joel to \\"The Real World,\\" and makes an attempt at finding deeper meaning in all of these things. The collection starts out strong with a rant on why John Cusack has ruined the love lives of everyone (men and women) born between 1965 and 1978. This is funny and promising to anyone who feels similarly.The biggest downside of this collection is that Klosterman's writing and his skill at making a coherent point are highly variable. Some essays were very strong and cohesive (\\"What Happens When People Stop Being Polite,\\" on The Real World series; \\"All I Know Is What I Read in the Papers,\\" on the media and why it works; \\"This is Zodiac Speaking,\\" on serial killers; \\"How to Disappear Completely and Never Be Found, on born-again Christianity), and I definitely laughed out loud several times. Other essays (\\"Every Dog Must Have His Every Day...\\" on the genius of Billy Joel; \\"Ten Seconds to Love,\\" comparing Pam Anderson to Marilyn Monroe; \\"33\\" on the Lakers/Celtics rivalry) were incoherent and rambling. Klosterman insists that everything is connected and really does set out to connect, well, everything. He sometimes succeeds and sometimes I was left thinking that this is a man who likes the sound of his own voice (or pen, as it were) and tries to make a lot of pseudo-intellectual (or maybe even true intellectual references) to make the reader believe that what he's saying actually makes sense. The collection improves significantly at the last three or four essays, and I felt that Klosterman dropped any pretension or self-satisfaction and just wrote, which worked a lot better.I definitely feel that someone born in 1980 or earlier would enjoy this collection as a whole, but I would definitely recommend skimming or skipping the ones on topics in which the reader is less than interested."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This book is only mildly funny and outdated. It seems like a bad rendition of the books he references, like \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius.\\" The section on mixtapes is uninspired- \\"Love is a Mixtape,\\" by Rob Sheffield is much more successful. This book produced no mindblowing or even relatively interesting ideas- a waste of time if you ask me."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Klosterman's book reads like a pop culture Bill Hicks, with a sense of humor that makes one laugh first, but then you realize he's being completely serious with the essays he's discussing, making the reader think more about subjects never considered before.Luke Skywalker was the first GenXer. Pamela Anderson is the equal to Marilyn Monroe in sex stars. John Cusack is a large reason why relationships don't last. Average women have taken over mainstream porn. Saved by the Bell re-establishes our American value system.If these sound like conversations you've had with your friends you'll like this book. If not, then maybe you'll start the talks after reading it."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This book is terrible. Klosterman starts out with a few pages eluding to the fact that he is so superficially witty that he has been able to fool several attractive women into sleeping with him despite the fact that he apparently isn't attractive. Congrats, buddy. I suppose his goal here was to assure the reader that he is absolutely shallow enough to cash in on this book despite its weak material. I guess, at the very least, that's a trait I can identify with.Anyway, each chapter in this book contains a fairly self contained essay that is meant to examine a particular aspect of American culture as compared to, affected by, and/or resulting from a particular piece of pop culture. Unfortunately, Klosterman's understanding of most topics (both the deeper social topics he tries to explore and the actual pop culture references) is as superficial as his wit.Basically, you could break the entire content of this book down into one sentence; stupid people emulate what they see on TV because they are often also shallow and because their lives suck. Add in about two hundred pages of topical references you won't understand unless you're between the ages of 30 - 35 and sentences along the lines of 'I'm not cool but here is what a cool, ironic person would say about this topic, which just happens to be the same opinion I hold, or maybe I don't' and you'll be readily prepared for the content of this book."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Chuck K is undoubtedly is a very clever dude and some of the insights here will make you laught at loud. Ultimately however I would advise cherry picking through these essays, as Chuck is so enamored of his beloved'low culture' that it will get both stultifying and extremely banal. Make sure to skip the analyses of bad tv shows (esp The Real World and Saved by the Bell). Chuck tries so hard to show why disposable pap has an influence on society that he torpeoes hiw own argument - his assertion that Gen Y behavior pettern can be correlated to a character on Real World says much more about Klosterman than anything else. Similarly, his essay on the Lakers and Celtics rivalry sets perhaps a new low in 'serious' sports journalism, as the argument that the Lakers reperesent Democratic party values while the Celtics carry the torch for Republicans (CK seems to be a fairly staunch right-winger after his addiction to pop culture is peeled away) is beyond absurd, and his assertion at the end that \\"if you dont' care about the Lakers-Celtics you don't care about anything\\" (this is said unironically) is downright embarassing.Chuck will also be very strident in his declarations of what is 'cool' and 'uncool'. The repeated appearance of these exact words in almost evry essay (sometimes sevral times) becomes very annoying and pointless. Klosterman (by his own admission) of course is 'uncool', but his endless obsession with coolness (and defining it)renders it meaningless.So enjoy, but be careful."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This is an odd little book. I would say it's one of those that make you wonder what the author was smoking, but he says several times that he was smoking pot. That explains a lot. It was funny in places, but I haven't really watched TV since 2000, and I didn't watch much for about 3 years before that, so even as a Gen-X'er, I couldn't relate to much of what he wrote about. I listen to several genres of music, but I'm not heavily into any (though I know several people who would absolutely love the chapters in which he dissected old rock albums) and I didn't recognize several of the bands he mentioned and very few of the albums.The one thing he wrote with which I can completely relate is something I've wondered about myself. To paraphrase: We shouldn't pick up hitchhikers because all hitchhikers are serial killers and/or rapists. But you shouldn't hitchhike because anyone who would pick up a hitchhiker is a serial killer and/or rapist. So basically, everyone on the highway is a potential serial killer and/or rapist?"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I will be so bold as to say that I have a great sense of humor. When I first saw this book I thought it would be fantastic to laugh at myself and at recent culture for some of the silly things that we enjoy. Not taking things too seriously can be a very good thing.But I could not come even close to finishing this book. Klosterman thinks he is cynically hilarious and it's just tacky. He goes on and on and on....... about something so that you forget what the main point is. It's not funny at all. He tries way too hard. I tried to pick out things that I could relate to or would find interesting and nothing helped. I felt like he was the awkward kid in the corner who thinks he's cool, trying to say something that will make everyone laugh but that really you feel sorry for, because he's trying so hard, but you can't help but walk away.The book came up in conversation with a friend of mine, and I offered for him to read it to see what he thought. Needless to say, I wasn't surprised when he basically threw the book back at me a few days later and said that he could barely get through it and didn't come close to finishing it."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"if you are as much of a pop-culture whore as i, and you've read this fantastic memoir about growing up and being influenced by the 1970s - 90s, then you understand completely why i titled this review \\"exactly.\\" i read this book several times and have poured over every page; i just can't get over the fact that I didn't write this myself!!!!!!!!!!!!random fact: i loaned a friend my copy of this book; he never gave it back. i bought another copy, and he insisted that he lost the first, so i let him borrow my new HARD copy; he won't give it back.. he, too, feels as though he coulda written this book.by the way, all of klosterman's books are fantastic...."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I thought this was a good book that captured my generation in a nutshell. I wouldn't take it too seriously. It was very opinionated...most of which I agreed with. I read a lot of it on the subway and found myself laughing out loud. I definitely dont think I gained any insiteful knowledge from reading the book but found it entertaining."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"'A Low Culture Manifesto' is an excellent subtitle for Klosterman's tome on pop culture. Klosterman is an excellent writer that combines personal memoirs with witty analysis on recent pop culture. Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs and Fargo Rock City are 2 of the funniest books I've read in recent years. Fargo is a great read, especially for a reformed metal-head. Cocoa Puffs tackles a wider variety of subject material, thus appealing to any one that's watched a reality tv show, was ever curious about Internet porn, or was a closet Saved by The Bell fan...I'd say that includes just about everyone."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"this book sucks you in from page one! it's entertaining and witty! no need for more detail."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Considering the subject matter, this book could have been a lot worse than it was. Now this doesn't sound like much of a compliment, but in my mind it is. The ability to draw interesting conclusions from the analysis of Billy Joel and Saved By The Bell alone is worthy of appreciation. Although portions of this work are a bit tedious, much (if not most) of it are very worthwhile.My favorite chapter is the one featuring the analysis of the Empire Strikes Back as the basis for the stereotypical Gen-Xer. We are a generation of whiny Lukes, Chuck opines, overeducated idealists who can't seem to shake off their confusion about where their lives are headed. The line: \\"essentially, Luke went to the University of Degobah with a major is Buddhist philosophy and a minor in physical education\\" has to be one of the most hilarious things I have read.The point is, there are pearls of wisdom here, moments that make you (or me at least) sit upright and say \\"yes!! that is so true!\\" What I wonder is whether this book will have much value at all to those who do not have the shared experiences Chuck is describing. In a sense, this \\"manifesto\\" is for insiders only. Sections covering areas of less interest to me (Sims, for example) were harder for me to grasp.But that is small stuff. What we have here is a sharply-written collection of essays finding meaning where none is easily discernable. Genius? No. But for some of us, it's likely to be the most fun book we'll read in years."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Yes, Chuck Klosterman is a narcissist- he admits as much in this book, using seemingly trivial events from his life to reconstruct an alternate universe, where low culture is dissected and assumes great psychological importance throughout the various essays that comprise Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs.Interestingly, there isn't much about any of the eponymous subjects in the book, yet the tome doesn't suffer for it; indeed, the essays stand out by themselves, yet still forming a satisfying whole and forming some kind of perverse narrative. There's quite a bit of tongue in cheek in the theories that Klosterman espouses throughout, and you'd have to be fairly young and unworldly to take him at his word on everything he says.This is cultural riffing at its most satisfying, and while some articles are culturally relevant (the Sims article being an amusing existential exercise in particular) overall this is a light, fun collection for those whose lives are consumed by low culture."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This book is basically for anyone who likes to read about pop culture. When I say pop culture, I don't mean celebrity gossip, I mean random, interesting references to music, movies and books. This book is chock full of the latter. Practically anyone can enjoy Klosterman's takes on \\"coolness\\" and how it relates to sugary cereal, internet porn, serial killers, reality and simulated reality, a Guns N' Roses tribute band, and more. Right now I'm reading this book for the second time in less than 2 weeks. Highly reccommended."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This book, and more realistically, the mind who wrote this book offer a no-holds barred look into the culture we find ourselves surrounded by. I cannot believe how many parts of this book resonate with me, and some that obviously do not. But, Klosterman is just honest with where he is coming from and he is dead on in many of his observations, about video games, dating, reality television, the real world, saved by the bell, going to school in North Dakota, etc. This book falls in the same genre as David Egger's \\"A Heartbreaking Work Of Staggering Genius,\\" But is much faster / and put together. Egger's work is good, don't get me wrong, but this book is specifically nailing the GenX postmodern mindset. Chuck just gets it. Bravo Chuck -"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Klosterman is definitely an intelligent writer, and I enjoyed his style. Some chapters were beyond meaningless-- to the point that I just skipped ahead-- but overall you're bound to learn a thing or two and still be entertained."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I love to read anything Chuck Klosterman writes, even if he can sometimes be inconsistent. That being said, this book is frickin' great and is not the reason I find his writings occassionally inconsistent. I always recommend this to people who enjoy anything about pop culture and or just generally funny reads. So far everyone I have recommended it to has become Chuck fans!"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"As the subtitle implies, Klosterman has spent more time and energy thinking deeply about \\"low culture\\" than most academics have spent studying the so-called \\"important\\" things.This is not an indictment: Pondering things that aren't terribly important -- like what it's like to be in a Guns-N-Roses Tribute Band (for example) -- can be quite refreshing. In fact, I found it to be a welcome diversion from my normal diet of political books.Granted, as a fellow Gen Xer who spent some time in North Dakota, I probably identified with Klosterman more than, say, a 50-year old from New York might. But I figure if every Gen Xer in North Dakota were to purchase this book -- that's at least 250 copies, right there!In all seriousness, I think this book would resonate best with people born between 1968 and 1978."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"In Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs, Chuck Klosterman has collected a series of essays he's written on a myriad of popular culture subjects. From his hatred for John Cusack to his love of \\"The Real World\\", every essay is an absolutely hysterical descent into what made/makes America tick in the late 1990's and early 2000's. Despite my differences with Chuck's views on soccer(football), I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I loved this book. I disagreed with the author on about a good third of the material, especially his views on Soccer, but we're all entitled to our opinions. I did appreciate reading an opposing point of view that was rarely offensive, except again, in his diatribe against soccer.There really isn't much more I can add to these reviews that others haven't put in already. This was one of the smartest and funniest books I have ever read. Its not for the type of person who accepts the world at face value; instead its for the type of person who questions everything, and can live with an opposing viewpoint without tossing the book down in anger."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"The book is worth a read. Chuck Klosterman's insights on pop culture subjects are fun and interesting, and are reminicent of times spent BS-ing with friends at a bar. But, much like many \\"bar\\" conversations, you gain no insight from all that wasted breath. At the bar you spend a lot of time flapping your gums, trying to be witty and astute, but you just wake up the next morning with a hang-over and a vague memory of all the #$%& you made up. So, if you just want to hear a guy's opinions about some random stuff, this is a fun read, but you will find yourself reading it over again, from time to time, because it's a little insipid."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Sex Drugs and Cocoa Puffs is Klostermans collection of laught out loud prose that anyone who likes or dislikes the state of pop culture should read. Whether Klosterman is ranting on about the Sims,classic rock, or Saved by the Bell, he uses his extensive pop culture knowledge and sharp wit to keep his book in your hands. From chapter to chapter of intelligent prose, Klosterman will make you shake your head at the ridiculous state of our pop culture but appreciate the minutiae the we obsess over."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This is an interesting book for people in their twenties. Though taking pop culture references and tying those to societal behavior is nothing new, Klosterman sometimes intelligently places real and intense thoughts about subjects that weren't meant to be dissected socially. He goes into how the Sims, Saved by the Bell, the 80s Lakers-Celtics rivalry all represent or influence society in one form or another. This book contains 18 disjointed, unrelated chapters explaining Klosterman's view of random popular culture phenomenons.The good part about this book is that at some points it's smart and hilarious at the same time. Klosterman's view on Soccer and why neither he nor America will ever accept is worth the price of the book alone. The first half of the book is far superior in that you'll find yourself laughing at loud (like I did on a plane). If you had part of your life influenced by random and useless things like toys or television shows when you were a kid, then this sort of sheds light on how minute items can influence anyone.There are two bad parts about this book though. Since he devotes a chapter to a random idea based on an aspect of culture, you'd be somewhat interested in that aspect. He went on a giant tirade about how classical country music is better than modern Nashville country music. Not only did I not care about that genre of music, I was unaware of the division of classical and modern country, nor did I really want to know about such a division. The worst part of this book is that he does a lot of useless explaining of random facts in detail that really aren't intriguing, funny or interesting, and doesn't incorporate these long winded details to anything noteworthy. In the chapter where he describes religious fanatics, he gives a boring and long summary of a religious movie for almost no reason. The second half of the book is really chalked full of such useless information and provides nothing interesting, funny or thought provoking at all.By the way, there is hardly any mention of Sex, Drugs, or even Cocoa Puffs in this book.All in all, it's interesting and unique, but the latter chapters were so dull that it left a dull taste in my mouth. There were some great chapters, but the inconsistency just makes it an average book at best."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"What a brilliantly clever book .the essay on &quot;The Real World &quot; is worth the cover price alone .if you're ditheringjust buy it !"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"not funny chuck....i want my money back. oh...and your cusak poll is assinine. i am sure jc would agree. i will make sure to read your stuff first before being suckered in on kindle. and sims? shame on you."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This was my first experience with Chuck Klosterman and, man, this guy has a lot to say. His writing style is conversational, introspective and manic. He seems to pick two non-similar contemporary items (cereal, sex, for example) and just gets into a frenzy. Fortunately, he is a great writer. He is not some blogger hack that likes to rant. He can really write! He has had work published in was a staff writer for various publications including Spin, Esquire, GQ, The New York Times Magazine, The Believer, and The Washington Post.One of my favorite essays is entitled \\"George Will vs. Nick Hornby.\\" He answers the often repeated question, \\"why is soccer not as popular in America as other countries.\\" Great question. It seem like every ten years or so a columnist cites some statistics that indicate youth partition in soccer is never higher and this is the harbinger of a new wave of soccer fanaticism in USA. However, as always, TV. viewership of soccer matches is abysmal. What happened to all those little kids that played soccer? Klsoterman nails it. Basically, they were MADE to play soccer by mommies that want them to participate in sports. By the time they are old enough to choose their own hobbies, they hate soccer and never care to see a match again in their lives. In America, soccer has always been the sport that kids play that aren't good enough to play the other sports. As Klosteman more eloquently puts it: \\"To say you love soccer is to say you believe in enforced equality more than you believe in the value of competition and the capacity of the human spirit.\\" Kids that play soccer are the outcasts of others sports, therefore, \\"Mr. Pele's hopeless dystopia\\" will never be popular in America. Great stuff. Some of other questions that Klosterman poses and answers are:How is bland breakfast cereal related to our puritanical repressed sexuality?Why do sports writers hate athletes?Why are celebrities hard to interview?Why have reality shows turned real people into clich&eacute;s?How can a tribute band function in real society?He is the king of the divergent thinking as he seems to make connections among everything. Even the design of the book is a metaphor. The content is a mishmash of articles he wrote for various publications; kind of greatest hits, or more accurately, a mixed tape. At his best, Klosterman's writings encompass his love-hate relationship with reality. His stories often describe a coming to awareness by himself (for example his story about creating an avatar on SIMS and trying to make him happy) or of others (life as a member in a Guns n' Roses tribute band). He approaches contemporary cultural topics with humor (spiced with hilarity) and intelligence (with spurts of genius)."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"For his second book Sex, Drugs and Cocoa puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto, Klosterman put together what is basically a collection of pop-culture based short essays in which he investigates American culture for the most part, and himself. In his first effort, Fargo Rock City the book was more or less linear and felt more united whereas this is a collection of essays that still shows unity to each other because they're all about the same thing essentially, pop culture. I always thought that the way he got through was by demonstrating a point relating it to his personal life, whether he uses the band KISS or MTV's The Real World TV show it works, make us think or laugh to ourselves and comes across as effective. Most of Klosterman's books are at the core of it all, an examination of society through social and cultural events that may or may not be of some relevance to you, yet the author manages to constantly make good points and references. There's just a real honesty about Chuck that makes him sympathetic as an author and that also makes you want to like him as a person which is ultimately his strong point (and his willingness to give readers details about his personal life also helps).Some of the content may seem a little outdated by now because of changing times but some of the topics he covers are interesting and for the most part, reflective of pop culture or society at that point and that makes it relevant in itself. Personally, I can still relate or remember most of what is the book. Not everyone has played Sims or seen The Real World, but through Chuck's prose we understand them and the way he uses those pop culture references to examine either society, himself, or whoever it is he's talking about is always from an intelligent, well thought angle. He certainly provides enough to prove his points. The Pamela Anderson/Marilyn Monroe piece was somewhat striking and the angle he has on them and their impact on culture if you will, was dead onI don't think he will make every reader gain an appreciation for Billy Joel or that I agree entirely with his essay on the man but it doesn't mean it's not enjoyable and that he doesn't have strong points, kinda like most of the book come to think of it. Like how he compares the 1987 Lakers and Celtics to the Democrat and Republican parties respectively, it's just a fun angle he has and it's entertaining.It's not my favorite out of Klosterman's work but it's still a readable, fun, clever effort. I think the biggest problem is that although those essays are in their own ways all funny and good reads that make you evaluate society and how people think, Sex Drugs and Cocoa Puffs isn't as effective as it could or should have been. Instead of linking the essays together or making them cohesive with each other so that we get the bigger picture, we have for the most part a collection of well-written essays but unrelated to each other. Unfortunately it reads as such because they're all clearly separated from each other and. But with that said, it's still an entertaining read and Chuck remains as witty and clever as ever . This time around the topics are not just music related and the author's pop-culture scope is expended which adds another dimension to Chuck's writing.Klosterman himself in one his presentations on reading in North Dakota said that this was from an objective possibly his worst, because it was rushed and contradicted itself at times (like when he says that Pamela Anderson was the 1990's Marilyn Monroe and then proceeds to explain why but tells us that he hates when people compare the two, if that makes sense) etc. Yet it's also his best-selling work and many people enjoy it, and so do I. It's flawed but brilliant and if you're into Chuck's prose and his other books you'll love this one as well. If you're new to Chuck's work or something about pop-culture, it's still a good book but perhaps not the one I would start with. As a concept of a collection of cultural essays, Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs works rather well and some of the points explained through pop-culture are undeniably brilliant or at least engage the reader. As I said it's probably not as effective as some of his other work (at least to me) because although the content is good and interesting, the content is similar but not connected so it really feels as if you're reading a collection of essays. Pop culture junkies will find a lot to like here; I like it very much myself and it's a good read. Much of the ideas Klosterman proposes are still engraved in my head and have made for interesting conversation topics and debates. Not his finest, although some would disagree with me but I'd say it's worth it. 3 stars."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Klosterman is a jaded individual and you can read that in this work especially, but regardless everything he wrote has a bitter taste of reality connected to it.

I will definitely read other works by this author."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I read this book in one sitting and still go back and reread individual essays from time to time. The interesting thing about this collection is that it's so rare to see pop culture dissected in even a semi serious fashion. Usually people just talk about this kind of thing around the water cooler. But what makes Klosterman so successful is he takes the trivial and makes it entertaining. Some essays are better than others. The first one about Coldplay and fake love is a favorite of mine.

However, I don't love the redundancies and the critical analysis of things like the absence of Kelly Kapowski at the end of the \\"Saved by the Bell\\" run. He devoted way too much time to less than interesting topics which made the book drag on. There were some chapters that I absolutely loved, (Especially the one about knowing serial killers)and others that I really couldn't stand.

I can't imagine how anyone could get an ounce of entertainment or enlightenment from this book.The one part that sticks out is the short essay on probabilities.

I assume that if you are capable of reading this review that you understand this is blatantly false.Maybe I should start writing books. Here's my first essay: we don't need weathermen.

I'm sure if I stretched that theory out, added some flowery language, and gave it a catchy title the new yorker would tell all their readers that they need to like my book."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I was entertained by this book, I will give it that...and Chuck Klosterman is aware of that, which is part of the problem with his writing. He's much too pleased with himself and it comes across. I bought this book because it was popular and some revere the author as a god, and, as I said, Chuck Klosterman knows that. When you can read how smug someone is through the pages it's not exactly flattering. I do like his references to pop culture and I think he has a funny writing style, and, like I said, I was entertained, but I couldn't finish the book. I have that problem with Christopher Moore books, but at least Christopher Moore dials it back a bit, and though he can be a bit indulgent in his books, he never comes across as smug. Also, his part near the front of the book where he talks about pulling in hot girls with a few one-liners then how they eventually figure out he's a schlub who sleeps on a mattress on the floor, annoyed me. He's basically admitting he's a douche...but that doesn't even seem to quite register with him. At least with Tucker Max he is upfront that he's a douche, he's also good looking and a lawyer, so, this guy isn't trying to \\"trick\\" anyone. Where, I've met too many pathetic guys like Chuck K. who are really full of themselves, haven't seen a gym since the 5th grade, little to no maintenance or style, yet they only go after really hot women and expect them to fall for their feeble one-liners and really have nothing to offer after that. Trust me, any woman would rather hook up with a funny, good looking jerk, than a funny, schlub who is secretly a jerk, which is how Ben Affleck managed to land Jennifer Garner. So, I've never been compelled to read another of his books. I would much rather read McSweeny, check out a Kate Beaton cartoon, or attempt to read another Christoper Moore book. At least that way I'm entertained and not annoyed."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs is a comedic, yet serious, gathering of essays by Chuck Klosterman. He covers very serious topics often from a new point of view with a very \\"Tell it how it is\\" kind of attitude. He really speaks his mind and isn't afraid to say something strange. My only complaint is that a few of the essays confused me as he does tend to ramble on and some I really had no idea what he was talking about."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Most attempts at addressing popular culture tend to follow the Aldous Huxley snobbery and the standard bearer ofAmusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Businessin which everything is looked upon with suspicion as part of a low culture that is rapidly turning everyone stupid. This makes sense as many of the academics discussing popular culture make their money from an elitism that allows their readers to think that they are smarter than the vulgar herds and the dirty underclass. Click your tongue in disgust at Jerry Springer and you're halfway to tenure. Place Jerry Springer and shows likeThe Wire: The Complete Seriesunder the same rubric and you are serious. Forget the fact that Shakespeare, Dickens, The Bronte Sisters and Charlie Parker were all once considered vulgar pop culture (the last by Aldous Huxley who hated jazz even as he wrote tedious books).In this scene, it's still a novelty to find a critic that takes pop culture seriously.Everything Bad is Good for You: How Today's Popular Culture is Actually Making Us Smartercomes under sharp attack (by English teachers who can't write and rely way too heavily on \\"social science\\"-inspired studies of dubious merit) for stating television, video games, etc. are actually beneficial. Smart Web sites like The AV Club are shuffled aside. And pop culture critics like Nathan Rabin and Chuck Klosterman are more often dismissed as hipsters than taken seriously.This would be a shame as Klosterman is a hilarious and insightful writer. Some of his targets are pretty soft (like blaming his love life and the love life of every guy who has ever held on to a hopeless crush because friends do end up together onWhen Harry Met Sally) and some of them have the air of \\"are you kidding me?\\" (such as his chapter on The Real World where he happily supports the use of incidental music to announce the emotions that you are supposed to be feeling in every segment) but for every easy joke or strange observation, there are dozens of instances of insights so profound that they completely change the way you look at the artwork. Some of my personal favorites include the one about how Woody Allen gave nerdy guys a chance with hot women and how the fact that Billy Joel divorced the woman that he's singing about in \\"Just the Way You Are\\" is awesome because it means that no matter how much you think you might never love another, you are wrong.This is an excellent and intelligent book about pop culture that will survive long after several of the subjects are forgotten."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"If you enjoy pop culture, thoughtful commentary on social behavior, and the a witty author that can uniquely link the two, then you'll enjoy this book. Fun quick read."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"A very enjoyable series of essays about pop-culture from a smart, clever, angry, and extremely talented writer who is a self-confessed junkie of all things Gen-X, Gen-Y, hipster, geekdom, nerdsville and otherwise.\\"Billy Sim\\" dissects the computer gaming phenom of The Sims; \\"Appetite for Repetition\\" takes an up-close-and-personal view of a Guns-n-Roses tribute band; \\"Being Zack Morris\\" explores the odd cultural obsession with \\"Saved By The Bell\\"; and 15 variously-themed essays delve into not only the psyche of Klosterman but, by extension, the psyche of America.In the trade paperback version, there are extra nuggets of Chuck-mania -- after each chapter, a quick shot of dialogue, banter, or, in the case of \\"23 Questions I Ask To Decide if I Can Really Love Them\\" (following Chapter 10) a hilarious, freaked-out rorshach test for the morally ambiguous. Not all the essays hit the mark, but the majority do, so a definite recommend. Cintra Wilson's book \\"A Massive Swelling: Celebrity Re-examined As A Grotesque Crippling Disease and Other Cultural Revelations\\" is funnier and wittier by far, but Klosterman works in a slightly separate universe that is equally satisfying."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I loved this book about pop culture and all it entails. Chuck Klosterman is clever and ridiculously knowledgeable, and he makes you feel like a part of the book. I could relate to so much of the stuff he said, so I guess we have all had a lot of the same experiences with pop culture. Even when I didn't really know what he was talking about (like, say, in the sports chapters), the way he wrote this book made me feel like I did. I only gave it four stars because it is a bit pretentious and obscure in parts, but it is definitely worth reading.Favorite chapter: Being Zack Morris. My only problem with that essay is that he underestimated the far-reaching influence of Saved by the Bell. I'm not kidding; I found that to be a serious flaw. He says, \\"Saved by the Bell is like this little generational secret that's hyperfamiliar to people born between 1970 and 1977, yet generationally unremarkable to anyone born after (and completely alien to all those born before.\\" I was born in 1986, and I have seen every episode of Saved by the Bell about a dozen times. I was very young when it first came on, but they re-ran it like crazy all through the '90s, and everyone my age watched it and still makes references to it (especially the caffeine pills episode). Even the parents of my generation got a good taste of it vicariously through us. I don't think Saved by the Bell can really be called a \\"secret\\" by any stretch of the imagination. If you were alive and in the U.S. in the '90s, you know about it. (I also wish timing had allowed him to know about the Screech sex tape before writing that essay, but I can't really blame Chuck for that...)So, try to focus on how insightful and enjoyable it is, and overlook the flaws if you can. I would definitely tell a friend!"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Chuck Klosterman has obviously read plenty of Jay McInerney and Bret Easton Ellis. He seems to be trying to write the next BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY. I think he tries too hard, though. He's not writing his voice, he's writing an attempt to emulate the voice of other writers. He does a good job and the stories are interesting, but there is the soul of the writer missing from the book that you get when it's a writer's authentic voice and not an imitation. Even the best Elvis Impersonator is still and impersonator. If you want to read the next BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY, buy MY FRACTURED LIFE because it has that authentic voice. I'm not saying don't buy SEX, DRUGS, AND COCO PUFFS, just know you're going to see a tribute show."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This is the clich&eacute;d, set-off-on-its-own, introductory statement of an essay.Here's the real start of the essay, in which dwells somewhat of a thesis. Mostly, though, this paragraph just starts the namedropping of and references to esoteric music or movies or sports figures. Expect this trend to continue through the whole piece. It's just like David Bowie stealing Scott Walker's shtick and scarf collection and running with it. Let's all just assume that makes sense, even though it only tangentially relates.Well, here we are at a paragraph in the middle 80% of the essay. Would you like some more nerdy humor that resides about a step in either direction away from your favorite obscure BBC show (and you thought I couldn't get a sideways reference to Absolutely Fabulous into this review! Silly you) that means so much to your life? And nothing here would be complete without a footnote that serves the same purpose as a parenthetical aside, only it disguises what's being said in some sort of intellectual cloak. Pretend there's a little \\"1\\" next to some word in this paragraph, just like we'll all pretend that Dangerous Toys didn't make any albums past their 1990 debut. Did I just randomly mention some forgotten 80's sleeze-metal band in hopes of being recognized for my unabashed love for that particular style of music? I guess I did. How postmodern. In fact, it's so postmodern that the word \\"postmodern\\" will show up throughout the whole book in what looks to be a unifying theme, but really just ends up being some buzzword to fall back on when discussing the concept of \\"reality.\\" For all the bashing of renowned hippie-school Evergreen, there sure is a lot of the same pointless, quasi-existential wandering going on here.That, of course, leads nicely into the \\"philosophy for shallow people\\" (Klosterman's phrase, not mine). Whereas it's actually pretty amusing and much more telling of an actual point to write about the personal anecdotes that relate to the topic at hand (The Real World, cereal, the Celtics/Lakers rivalry, etc), this paragraph will try to speak for an entire group of people in an attempt to decipher the hidden depth of things that supposedly have no depth. This will go on for pages, peppered with faux-modest shoulder-shrugs, profanity-placement more akin to that of a 13-year-old, and the unrelenting pop-culture references that never stop just like Sylvester Stallone never stops chewing on a wooden match in Cobra (not bad, eh?). While not being hypocritical, the writing here will have to be opinionated, yet noncommittal. Or maybe that's unfair and the information just isn't proven correctly. The oddly-preferred method of trying to measure up the effect of Billy Joel on a generation--as opposed to one person (the self)--is going backwards, but let's stick with it anyways. This middle part will continue as a retarded ideology maelstrom that consists of equal parts irony, authenticity, rock \`n' roll, and all of their opposites.Oh, the end. Before the last words, we'll need to slip some middle-finger comments in about how all the other experts and academics and iconoclasts that diverge from you and I are all missing-the-point, full of (quite possibly their own) s***, and leading a life that is based on the wrong kind of stuff, respectively. Finally, we'll tie this all together, but only after realizing that there really isn't that much to say about the chosen theme. At least not anymore than can be found in the blog of a snarky, jaded dude with an English degree who wants to feel as if the hours he's spent reading about serial killers wasn't all for naught. End with a quirky little last line that simultaneously asks for a disregarding of the entire essay as well as a faithful embrace of it.*************That's exactly what all of the essays in this collection read like, of course, and while the formula isn't criminal, the execution is. There's no problem with the idea of pop-culture having an effect on someone's life, and there's certainly nothing wrong with dissecting it on a personal level. I just feel that it can be done better. As a snarky, jaded dude with an English degree who wants to feel as if the hours he's spent absorbing the same sort of stuff as Klosterman, I wanted to relate to him by hearing about him, not by hearing about us (Chuck Klosterman, Ryan Werner, and anyone else that's between the ages of 23 and 38). Effective writing almost always works to achieve the universal through the personal, not the universal through the universal. If you want to talk about God, you don't just talk about God. You start at the car wash and work your way to God. I'm only sort of saying that Klosterman is a lazy writer, and it's not even the prose that really bothers me. To write about pop culture's place in regard to the question of \\"what does it all mean?\\" (or, as the book prefers, \\"What is reality?\\") means a direct pathway through the person explaining it, with the conclusions left to be drawn by the reader.I liked this collection a bit more than I'm letting on, but it certainly doesn't sit well after turning the last page. Klosterman tried to tell me what I know, and he was usually wrong. However, if he had just told me what he knows, I couldn't have been convinced otherwise, regardless of whether or not I agreed with it."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This is the second book of Klosterman's I've read. The first, and my introduction to Klosterman, was \\"IV.\\" I like both these books equally and for similar reasons. In here, Klosterman observes seemingly mindless and inconsiquential tidbits and expands upon them in a way that inflates their importance to unprecedented levels; i.e. how \\"Saved by the Bell\\" is familiar to anyone in the X or Y generation, but totally alien to anyone outside those specific demographics.Chuck might have you question the real importance of his subjects, but he is always a fun read (except maybe \\"Fargo...\\") and he is, more often than not, and more often than most, insightful and thought provoking."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Klosterman's collection of essays never failed to be anything less than humorous, insightful, and thought-provoking. I literally laughed out loud while gaining a new perspective on everything from breakfast cereal, MTV's The Real World, serial killers, sports journalists and born-again Christians. I definitely think everyone should give this book a chance."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This book would easily be considered a great work if written 50 years earlier. It is a great book, but because the topic seems very silly (the cultural significance of the real world) it could easily be written off. The biggest shock is, it is true. We want to quickly brush off that there is significance in pop culture.. but it is our culture, as much as we want to hate it."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"As a big fan of Chuck's first book \\"Fargo Rock City\\", I was a little let down by his newest essay book. Some of the reviewers seem to be amazed by Chuck's memory of obscure trivia but if you think about it everyone can remember a certain song and who sang it, an obscure sports player and his or her claim to fame, or what type of engine came stock in a 1972 Corvette. All Chuck did was think of something obscure, contemplate it for a few minutes, went on the internet to get the rest of the information and to make sure he was correct and then wrote a short essay. I'm not downing Chuck for this or his book but I'm not going to give him high praise either. There were some interesting essays and then there were a few \\"soggy\\" ones. More importantly, was some of the essays that I liked or found interesting were ones I actually disagreed with. But as with music or art, if something makes you think and have a discussion with your friends or family than it should be given its' kudos. Thus, I give 3.5 stars. There were also some topics in this book that were brought up in his first book."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"It is kind of unfortunate when journalists take themselves too seriously. In Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs, Chuck Klosterman basically tries to show everyone how many useless pieces of pop trivia he can cram into one sentence and make it sound relevant. While this can make for some interesting and funny comparisons, on the whole, the book was self-aggrandizing and really not worth the effort. Contrary to the subtitle, this is not a book about culture, but about how the author believes that because he thinks something is cool, it is culturally significant.He whines about the fact that all of the best artist and musicians in the country seem to come from middle-America, but his home turf gets none of the recognition. He attempts to claim that the only movies that will really \\"matter\\" are those that he liked. He takes on celebrity in the least meaningful ways imaginable. Yet still, the book is well written and at times hilarious. Why? I don't know.If you like reading funny writing with a faux-philosophical bent, this book is for you. If you actually care about anything, I'd suggest passing on the Cocoa Puffs."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This Book is boring not funny and defenitely no worth to read. Don't waste your time"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I thought Chuck was right on the money with so many of the essays in this book. I am fascinated by his thought process and find his work to be highly enjoyable. He seems to be able to articulate the meaning of life's most random thoughts. If you like to think about why people play a life simulation game called, \\"the Sims\\", or ask yourself who listens to Billy Joel than I think you would enjoy this book. Then you need to really look yourself in the mirror and ask yourself if you had a VCR that could tape your dreams but the only way to view the footage would be to sit down and watch it all of your friends and family would you do it? I think you know the answer."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Although I have a penchant for fiction, this book is very high on my list of works to recommend to other avid readers. Nobody can make a point quite like Chuck Klosterman. Granted, he sometimes supports his opinion by saying (in essence), \\"I believe this, therefore it must be so\\" -- but even then, he's so damn believable. (More often than not, though, he provides more than enough evidence to support his claims and opinions.) Chuck's essays in this compilation are easy to read, thought-provoking, humorous, insightful, and just plain fun. I'm a sucker for pop culture, and this book helps me feel better about that, in a way. It gives me proof that my intellectual side can somehow coincide with my lighter, more bubble-gum (read: guilty-pleasure) side. Thanks for that, Chuck -- and also for making me laugh and think at the same time. In my experience, that's rare."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Sometimes I read or purchase a book simply because of the title. That's how I discovered the writings of Don Miller (PRAYER AND THE ART OF VOLKSWAGON MAINTENANCE) and that's how I discovered the writings of Chuck Klosterman. I was browsing through a bookstore at the airport in Portland, Oregon waiting for my departure time to draw near. I had already read the book I had brought with me on the trip here and now I needed something to read on the way home. What to do, what to do. And then I saw this quirky little title, SEX, DRUGS, AND COCOA PUFFS. \\"Cool title,\\" I thought and I bought the book.SEX, DRUGS, AND COCOA PUFFS isn't quite like any other book I've ever read. I've read essays on pop culture (heck, I've even written a few myself) and I've read books that contained several essays about pop culture. However, this is an entire book of essays about pop culture. Not only that, but each aspect of the culture that is examined isn't something that is normally even discussed. When one understands that and then also realizes that each essay either evokes some deeper understanding of reality or has an important point to make, then one begins to see how great a book SEX, DRUGS, AND COCOA PUFFS is.Klosterman examines such ideas in this book as why even though Billy Joel is great he will never be cool, why Pamela Anderson is the post-modern Marilyn Monroe, how WHEN HARRY MET SALLY has screwed up more men and women and their relationships than any other romantic movie in cinema history, the differences between Laker people and Celtic people and why its important to know the difference, how THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is a representation of what it means to be a Gen-Xer, and why even though SAVED BY THE BELL was one of the most un-realistic tv shows ever made it portrayed a very realistic concept about modern life. In pontificating and deconstructing these various aspects of our culture, Klosterman uses plenty of very personal stories that help tie things together. Of course, along the way he also throws in allusions from everything to ALLY McBEAL to THE DARK CRYSTAL to Guns N' Roses to MOMENTO and Radiohead and uses some really big words such as \\"iconoclast\\", \\"byzantine\\", \\"rapscallion\\", \\"solipsism\\", and \\"voracity\\". I found this vocabulary invigorating, but some might be turned off by it and think that Klosterman is purposely trying to be ironic--writing about things that people never normally write about but using big words in those writings to come up with some pretty amazing conclusions. To be honest, I find very little in this book to be ironic. Instead, I find it to be a very fascinating and extremely interesting read. Highly recommended for self-proclaimed \\"geeks\\" everywhere."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"There are two reasons to read this book and two reasons to not read this book. Firstly, the style of writing. The writing is wonderful. I enjoy the style. You really get the feeling that a highly intelligent Gen X journalist is sitting there in your living room in his jeans ant T-shirt and telling you his observations. If that style drives you crazy (in a bad way), you will know it from the sample and can save your money. If that styles drives you crazy (in a good way), you will know it from the sample and safely give B&N your money. Secondly, the wise observations of our modern world. His observations of the absurdity and ridiculousness of current culture is astute. Yes, he over-analyzes, but he does so in an entertaining way. If you think modern mainstream media and culture is awesome, then avoid this like a zombie plague. If you think modern mainstream media and culture are absurd, then this will be a very entertaining and enlightening read."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This was the first Chuck Klosterman book that I have read and i can promise you that it will not be my last, and if you read this also then it will not be your last either. As you read this you discover that Chuck Klosterman has an amazing way of putting things that we would never think of ourselves. From Pamela Anderson to The Sims Chcuk Klosterman talks about it all in this very up-beat and self-fulfilling book. I will not explain much about this one because i do not want to ruin any of it for anyone, and with that being said i do promise you it is an amazing book that you must read. I plan on reading all other books written by Chuck Klosterman and writing (better) reviews about them. Thank you and please read this book, you will not regret it. Also check out his other books."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Face it... you'll love this book or hate it... unless you can enjoy it for what it is and then disgard of it immediately after... then you'll be as ambivalent as I am about this title.Readers who enjoy it: you are vapid and so deeply immersed in pop culture and self un-aware that you are to be parodied for your complete identification w/ this work (the author himself would... and does--thus, the true meaning underlying the subtitle).Readers who deplore it: you are justified in your distaste of it... but only if you are so serious about yourself that you lose sight of what it is you are reading in the first place. CK is acutely aware of all of Cocoa Puffs's shortcomings, and, should he lazy unenough and unoriginal enough (which of course, he is), he could easily come out with a new printing w/ an afterword entitled: Mistakes We Knew We Were Making... In short, either stick to Being and Time or shut up a get a sense of humor... and don't act like you didn't live through the experiences that make up CK's subject matter.This is Reality Bites: A Ten Year Retrospective...

This book cleverly dissects pop culture with a razor eye and slices up everything that's hip, serving it back to us in a slightly recognizable form. From the first page on, I was hooked, hooked to the 26 questions that actually sent me reeling in deep contemplation, to the segue on the similarities between apples and oranges, to the existential dilemmas of The Sims characters, to the Real World, to Pamela Anderson. I could recognize these cultural landmarks, but in the author's skillful hands, they were transformed into brilliance. From on, I know I'll know never to look at pop culture in the same way.

I am only 17, so I didn't really get some of the stuff he was talking about simply because it was before my time. I didn't get the Lakers/Celtics rivarly or the stuff about Billy Joel or some of the music fads of the late 80's and early 90's, but I do watch reruns of Saved by the Bell and have The Sims and eat cereal, so I understood that much and a few other subjects, and I generally enjoyed reading his view of things. I was really suprised when I was not offended by his view of \\"born-again Christians\\", as he likes to call us. He manages to poke fun at us without really being completly against what we're standing for. He made me laugh out loud with his last chapter about the Left Behind series (which I loved) and about what I believe. I knew people thought like he does about us anyway, and he presented them in an amusing way.

The approach is to present geometry as an ideal axiomatic system and show how all statements flow logically from others.

The other book I tried was the Jurgenson text, which is a standard high school textbook, but I found it to be somewhat childish and unfocused. This book is written in a more mature and serious style, and gets right down to it.

The section on how he evolved into a coach is interesting too.But by far the most interesting section for me is his discussion of the Primary Hitter system and how that relieves the setter from a lot of pressure. This is a particularly good system with experienced stud hitters and a relatively new setter. It takes some of the pressure off of the setter and puts it on the primary hitters. This is an advantage for the team at least until the setter develops into a leader and develops some confidence.Overall, an interesting read."},{"Title":"Insights & Strategies for Winning Volleyball","review":"No question Mike Hebert has paid his dues.

He and his wife had just began attending church in Pasadena, CA. Mr. Weidner, as I called him then, was a quiet man. He had to be urged to tell any of his stories. He also had a very heavy accent. You really had to listen hard to understand him. Maybe that is why I can still hear his voice.In all the years I knew John Weidner, I don't think I ever heard the same story twice. In a short time, I was able to understand him with no problem. I really looked up to this man. He was gentle and so loving to everyone. As I look back, he was a true Christian, one of the really good guys who would have given his life 100 times to save one person.Sometimes, the stories were hard to believe. I mean, coming from such a humble, quiet man. But I knew him well enough to know he was to humble to make them up.I count myself fortunate to grow up with this man as a mentor.In all the times I was around John Weidner, I had to read this book to know what a decorated man he was because he never mentioned any of the metals, commendations, etc. that he had received.My wife and I read the book by candle/flashlight in our home during the ice storm of 2009 in S.E. MO. The electricity was off for 51 hrs., it was about 20 outside. I would read a chapter, then she would read a chapter. When she read, I could hear my friend, John's voice.The book is awesome!

By the end of the war, he had assisted in the escape of hundreds of Jews, as well as a large number of Allied pilots and crews. In the process, he lost his sister in a concentration camp, along with many friends.Flee The Captor is author Herbert Ford's depiction of Weidner's actions during this period. I read the \\"updated\\" version (1994). There is no doubt that Weidner was a hero. He put his life on the line, literally, even being tortured in captivity. At the conclusion of the war, his actions were recognized with awards from many countries. \\"'His daring earned him medals from France, Belgium, Britain, and the U.S. - and the ultimate tribute, a 5 million-franc price on his head issued by the Gestapo,' observed Time magazine in an account of his death\\" (p. 372).I had two primary concerns regarding the book itself (certainly no concerns about Weidner). The first is that the story was \\"flatter\\" than it needed to be. Weidner's daring activities never came to life in these pages. The second was the continual reminder of Weidner's faith in God as a driving force in his mission to save persecuted Jews and others in France. Certainly there were many non-religious people working for and with the underground. If the author was attempting to be convincing that Weidner's actions were driven by his religion, I'd probably disagree. He seemed to be the sort of person that would have been brave and resourceful regardless of religion. Author Herbert Ford's characterization of the influence of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in shaping Weidner, I would suspect, was influenced by Ford's position at Pacific Union College, a Seventh-day Adventist facility.Minor complaints. The world needs more people like Johan Weidner, and less like those imitating the Gestapo. Ford clearly demonstrated the differences between these two versions of humanity."},{"Title":"Fishers of Men","review":"Rob Lewis is the pseudonym of a case officer who served in an ultra secret military intelligence unit, known as the Force Research Unit, in northern Ireland.

Due to the secrecy restrictions imposed on him the chapters about his time in the north are a collection of bland anecdotes. If one wishes to read a book by an insider that blows the lid off of the FRU read, Stakeknife, by Martin Ingram."},{"Title":"Fishers of Men","review":"During the 1970's and 1980's, Northern Ireland was a fiery cauldron of religious hatred between Catholics and Protestants with regular bombings, shootings and kidnappings. As well as soldiers, police officers and terrorists, literally dozens of innocent civilians on both sides of the struggle were killed or maimed in the violent struggle for independence. The hatred of the British by many loyal Irish nationalists, had been seething for decades, however it had entered an even more deadly phase after the tragic events of Bloody Sunday in January 1972, when 13 civilians were shot dead by British Paratroopers.British Army Intelligence recognised that amongst all this hatred and division, there were persons close to the Provisional IRA who were ripe for manipulation by specially trained intelligence officers to become covert agents. Rob Lewis was a young Welshman who had initially entered the Army and saw a career ahead in tank regiments and sitting inside a heated turret, but after a short tour in Northern Ireland he became exposed to the world of covert intelligence, and volunteered for selection into this shadowy world.Lewis succeeded in his quest, and joined the highly secretive Force Research Unit (FRU), that were responsible for identifying and approaching potential \\"moles\\" that would be financially rewarded for passing on critical information on terrorist activities conducted by the IRA. Working alongside Special Branch and SAS teams, Lewis and his comrades engaged in an extremely dangerous \\"cat and mouse\\" game that could be met with disaster at any step in the road if approached individuals informed the IRA of the British Army's presence, and an ambush was planned in retaliation.Lewis's autobiography is a relatively easy and entertaining read, and whilst not overly gripping, he does provide an interesting insight into the activities of an army unit charged with a deadly task, and those persons interested in the murky world of covert intelligence will find this quite engrossing. As Lewis was serving in Northern Ireland at the time of many key events ( hunger strike by Bobby Sands, assassination of IRA agents in Gibraltar by SAS teams, the murder of two British corporals caught up in an IRA funeral procession ), he does additionally provide some insight into the tension experienced by serving British agents, and the way in which an undercover agent lives on a knife edge.Recommended reading for those interested in the world of undercover \\"spooks\\"."},{"Title":"Fishers of Men","review":"if you like the stories of old time espionage and the selection of men then this will entertain you.anecdotally based, hard to find book, but worth the wait and it added to my library of hard to finds."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Christmas","review":"These ten stories are the only fiction ever written by poet, essayist, and philosopher James Dillet Freeman.

It is would probably be considered a novelette today due to its short length. The story is that of Monsieur Victor Beaucaire, the barber of the French Ambassador, the Marquis de Mirepoix, who uses the English Duke of Winterset's cheating against him to force the Duke to introduce him to Bath's society, and in particular Lady Mary Carlisle, as Le Duc de Chateaurien.Monsieur Beaucaire initially gains the notice of Lady Mary Carlisle, but this gets the attention of other potential suitors, and Monsieur Beaucaire has to defend the honor of his queen, and his \\"friend\\", the Duke of Winterset. Monsieur Beaucaire is successful in these initial attempts to defend his honor, but at the same time the reader learns that there is probably more to his story than they have initially been told. At the same time, the Duke has not forgotten the embarrassment of being caught cheating at cards, and the way he was used to get him to introduce a commoner into society. still holds a grudge. Winterset's plot to expose Beaucaire works as he expects, but once again the reader is sure that there is something to Beaucaire's story which is not being told. All is revealed in the end, when Beaucaire faces his doubters in front of the Lady Carlisle.This is a very short piece, which can easily be read in one or two sittings, and it is a fun read. It is lighter in tone than Tarkington's first effort, \\"The Gentleman from Indiana\\", which is not surprising given the much shorter length. There is no character development to speak of, and unlike the first novel this is not one from which Tarkington is writing from his own personal experience, nor is it a story from the heartland of America which was his more usual setting. Yet, despite the light and almost superficial story telling, this book has been the basis for two movies. The first starred Rudolph Valentino and is a silent movie from 1924. The second is a Bob Hope movie from 1946. It also served as the basis for an operetta."},{"Title":"Monsieur Beaucaire","review":"This short novelette held much promise.

In particular, anthropological analysis of Native American dispossession seems to treat the Indians as a subject and the European Americans as a control group--somehow above anthropological scrutiny. White, therefore, renders a rare service in treating both the Indians and their European American interlocutors as vulnerable actors, subject to misunderstandings, panic, and folly.Another, more important virtue of this book is to explode persistent notions about the economic organization of pre-industrial peoples. White explodes--as did Polanyi, et al--the Hayekian notion of primitive economic man. We learn that \\"trade\\" among the profiled Indian nations was not driven by prices and scarcity, but by honor and reciprocal obligation. This misconception has continued to plague Western relations either with pre-modern societies (e.g., in West Africa & the Pacific) but also marginalized communities within industrialized societies (e.g., South Central Los Angeles, or North African diaspora communities in urban France).The familiar, morally satisfying analyses of Western/pre-modern contacts, and their abysmal aftermaths, tend to rely on obvious criminality on the part of the Western actors. This is insidious because it minimizes the implications of an historical narrative for modern social relations (by making it seem like a bizarre anomaly) and because it makes it so much harder to witness and protest modern destructive behavior."},{"Title":"The Roots of Dependency: Subsistance, Environment, and Social Change among the Choctaws, Pawnees, and Navajos","review":"In the 1970s, there was a trendy movement in academia to romanticize Native Americans into pure, innocent, saint-like beings. Richard White wrote The Roots of Dependency to butt heads with the romantics, while at the same time presenting the European invaders in a manner that was anything but flattering. He sought to pursue an approach to history having greater balance and accuracy. White examined the history of three tribes, the Choctaws, Pawnees, and Navajos. He described how their traditional subsistence way of life collapsed, and how they eventually became dependent on white society for their survival.The traditional home of the Choctaws is now the state of Mississippi. Before the whites arrived, they had become addicted to a dangerous habit, agriculture, which had harmful side effects, like population growth and ecological destruction. When the chaotic dance of climate delivered drought seasons, the food supply was threatened. All tribes in the scorched regions intensified their hunting, which inevitably lead to conflicts. There was not enough wild game to feed excessive numbers of corn eaters. Famine helped to restore balance.In the sixteenth century, disease-ridden Spanish tourists trekked through the southeast. Before long, 80 percent of the natives had dropped dead. In the absence of significant hunting, the numbers of deer and buffalo exploded. Abundant game allowed the Choctaws the luxury of depending less on farming, a dirty and toilsome occupation. Things were fairly cool for a while, until French and English traders moved in and trashed the neighborhood.In the early days, business activity at the trading posts was modest. The Choctaws brought in some deerskins from time to time. Once a hunter owned a decent knife, he saw no point in acquiring ten more knives. Their frugality mystified the Europeans, because the woods remained crowded with deer -- exploitable wealth. The whites believed that the \\"love of gain\\" was a universal human trait: work more, get more stuff. They suffered from a soul-killing mental illness that came to be known as the Puritan work ethic.Around 1740, trading posts in Creek country were handling 100,000 deerskins per year, while Choctaw country produced a mere 15,000 skins. In order to boost Choctaw business, the traders decided to break two laws: they started carrying liquor, and they offered credit to the hunters: drink now, pay later.Unfortunately, many Choctaws found rum to be irresistible, and they tumbled into an era of drunken brawls, murders, and social breakdown. The proceeds from months of hunting could be guzzled overnight in a whirlwind of oblivion drinking. The hunters had little understanding of numbers or interest rates, and they essentially became slaves. Before long, rum constituted 80 percent of the trading.The traders were aggressive about collecting debts, and they sometimes got land cessions for payment. Crushing debt and rum fever sparked intensive overhunting. Using his new musket, a hunter could kill 20 times more deer than his bow-hunting father. In 1770, a visitor to Choctaw country commented, \\"Almost half of the men had never killed either a deer or a turkey in their entire lives.\\" They were forced to become full-time farmers, making them helpless sitting ducks for the crop-roasting droughts of 1777, 1778, 1782, and 1792.The trading economy blindsided traditional Choctaw society, making a few rich, and more poor. The traditional culture of sharing and cooperation was seriously damaged. Murders became a daily affair. In 1830, the whites seized their land, and sent the tribe off to Indian Territory.Credit has a powerful crazy-making juju. Once upon a time, the major multinational religions banned usury -- Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Christianity. It was virtuous to help others, but charging interest on loans was a devilish enterprise (making money whilst doing no work). In the words of the venerable wise guy Benjamin Franklin: \\"Who goeth a borrowing goeth a sorrowing.\\" It's vitally important to remember that. Borrowing has destroyed countless lives, and brought many large economic systems to their knees.The Pawnees lived in western Nebraska and Kansas. They weren't very interested in trading, and they largely refused liquor. Neighboring tribes were more eager to trade, which led to sharp reductions in the numbers of beaver, otters, elk, and deer. Diseases arrived in the 1750s, and a smallpox epidemic in 1831 killed half of the tribe. Droughts periodically dried up the bliss.The arrival of horses around 1700 created many serious problems. They were seen as being private property, leading to wealth disparity, and the consequent social strains. Prior to horses, the only animals you owned were the ones you killed. Nobody owned the vast roaming herds, and this belief was a mainstay of all happy and sustainable societies.The horses raided the crops, which infuriated the women, and led to the breakup of many marriages. The ecosystem was poorly suited for keeping large numbers of horses year round, and the Pawnees did not cut and store hay. Tall grasses lost their nutritional value when they dried up, and many horses perished during harsh winters.Horses made it much easier to hunt buffalo, but they also made it easier for enemies to visit, and the spread of firearms increased the level of violence. Living in a remote location was no longer safe and secure. In this era, horse-mounted slave raiders snatched Indians from many tribes.The Pawnee's problems became serious when the whites decided to hunt buffalo on an industrial scale. Competition for food became intense. It was not uncommon for hunters returning home to find their women, children, and elders dead, their horses missing, their fields burned, their lodges destroyed, and their stored food gone. The Sioux and their allies were powerful enemies, and they eventually defeated the Pawnees. Three years later, the Americans conquered the Sioux. The Pawnees moved to Indian Territory in the 1870s. By 1900 the tribe had dwindled to 1,000.The Navajo or Din&eacute; remain on their own land. Their reservation covers portions of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. They were farmers when the Spanish colonists arrived with their livestock. Eventually the Navaho acquired livestock and became ranchers, raising horses, goats, and especially sheep. The Navajo were able to thrive on land that the whites thought to be nearly worthless. In 1869 they owned 15,000 to 20,000 sheep, and fifteen years later they had almost a million sheep and goats. Periodic droughts and severe winters killed hundreds of thousands of animals, but the herds were back to a million or more by 1930.Overgrazing contributed to increased erosion and land degradation, and this made the whites nervous. The expensive new Boulder Dam (later called Hoover Dam) was collecting a lot of silt, much of it running off Navajo land. Experts recommended exterminating the vegetation-gobbling prairie dogs, and sharply reducing the size of Navajo herds. Hundreds of thousands of sheep and goats were killed or removed, and countless prairie dogs were poisoned.This did not make the natives happy. They agreed that the range was in poor condition, but believed that the cause of this was drought, not overgrazing. The government aggressively took measures to reduce herds, at the same time that drought made farming nearly impossible. The drought ended in 1941, and the reservation exploded with lush green vegetation. After World War II it became clear that stock reduction had not healed the range, and that the livestock business had a limited future.The tribe became dependent on American society in the 1950s, as wage work and welfare expanded. \\"The Navajo reservation today remains overgrazed, but on the reservation strip-mining, radioactive rivers, and mines which cause cancer dwarf overgrazing as an environmental problem.\\"In the end, the Choctaws, Pawnees, and Navajo became dependent on white society. All three had enjoyed greater stability and freedom prior to 1492. All three were slammed by contagious disease, and by the disease of the market economy -- both were weapons of mass destruction.White focused his attention on the notion of dependency, but another component of this process was disintegration. In traditional Indian society, nobody went hungry unless everybody did. Cooperation and sharing were essential components of every functional culture. The introduction of private property (personal wealth) inspired endless conflicts and roaring craziness. It always does. Harmony in the human sphere disintegrated. On a larger scale, traditional harmony with the ecosystem also disintegrated, as human society increasingly fell out of balance with the family of life.All three tribes practiced primitive agriculture. Prior to 1492, they had no livestock to produce manure for maintaining soil fertility, a serious shortcoming that contributed to rapid depletion of the land. History informs us that agriculture is almost never sustainable in the long run. It creates more problems than it solves. It's vitally important to remember that.All three tribes were seriously affected by normal climate variations. Today, in our temporary energy wonderland, food is promptly shipped in to regions suffering from crop failures, and famine is avoided. Almost all societies in human history lacked this safety net. Instead, intelligent societies created a safety net based on deliberately maintaining a population that was well below the carrying capacity of their wild and healthy ecosystem. Remember that.Richard Adrian ReeseAuthor of What Is Sustainable"},{"Title":"The Domino Conspiracy","review":"After you finish this book you will swear that he did not also write his first great book The Berkut.

This book is not heading to the movie screen any time soon due to its complexity. I think of his writing this, it is what Clancy would be like if he had a Masters in English Lit from Yale. If you are looking for this type of book then you should buy this book, if you are looking for something lighter then many Higgins is for you."},{"Title":"The Domino Conspiracy","review":"It has been many years since reading this pair of books. Incredible how such a talented author is hidden away with his masterpieces out of print. The characters in both The Berkut and The Domino Conspiracy are unique and unforgetable. After 12 years I hope he will allow his followers another opportunity to escape into his rich style of storytelling. Thank you Mr Heywood. I only wish I had hard cover editions and could remember who I loaned the paperbacks to."},{"Title":"The Domino Conspiracy","review":"This is a most talented writer who was unluckily overlooked by most readers since his research direction and subjects both were too truly European or Russian. His BURKU was a rare treat of tour-de-force that really shook me and touched me deeply, and this one was no exception, very professionally prepared and presented with wonderful writing, the scenario and plots, like BURKU, really caused me to rethink the possibilty of reality and made me wonder, IS IT POSSIBLE? May be it's just like what Heywood portrayed...? I'm trying very hard to look for his TAXI DANCER now."},{"Title":"The Domino Conspiracy","review":"Here is a book right up there with Heywood's other book 'The Berkut' and a scary piece of 'what if' fiction.

It took about 45 minutes, so that should be your first clue that this isn't a deep book.That, by itself, isn't objectionable. After all, this is really intended to be a \\"bathroom\\" or coffee table book. However, having read the whole book in one sitting, I was amazed by the number of errors. I was finding mistakes every few minutes.You would think that the authors of a book entitled, \\"How to Sound Smart\\" would be smart enough themselves to proof-read the text throughly. The names of people like Jim Bakker and John Wayne Gacy are misspelled, and the definitions for phrases such as \\"Hobson's Choice\\", \\"beyond the pale\\", and \\"Occam's Razor\\" are incomplete, or just flat-out wrong.Yes, there are a lot of interesting tidbits, but there's a serious problem. If I was able to catch many errors based on what I know, how many more errors are present that I wasn't able to catch? That is, if I know some of the material to be incorrect, I can't be confidently sure that ANY of it is right. This is the kiss of death for any reference work, serious or not.The crudely-drawn, pointless illustrations add little to the book. I rarely write negative reviews, but this book deserves one.Not recommended."},{"Title":"How to Sound Smart: A Quick and Witty Guide","review":"She deploys many of the tactics written about in her poorly-written articles.

Some pros and cons...-Cons-SLOW CHARACTERS: for the people being in high school, they're kinda short in the intelligence end, as some parts to the story are glaringly obvious, yet they can't figure it out.-ODD ENDING: the ending calls for a sequel, as its a cliffhanger, but is there one? The plot leaves no remaining probles for the protagonist to solve, yet somehow it still isn't finished...hmmm.....-Pros-CREATIVITY: even though this is another one of those books in which the hero has to save the whole world, this is VERY original. The ficticional creatures (duh, its sci-fi) and their customs are very imaginative, yet not over-the-top-SUSPENSE: even with all of the flaws mentioned above, I raced thowards the climax & ending. (even though it was a let-down...) You should be able to finish this book very short amount of time.-BOTTOM LINE: This is simply an average book. There's thousands better, and thousands worse.

This book is mostly about Annie and two boxes her uncle leaves her. He says to keep them apart and don't open them. What do you think she did? After she opened them a crab like creature jumped out and ran to the basement.This book was great and very exciting because of the suspense,the ending makes you think about what might happen."},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"William Sleator keeps you guessing throughout this mysterious young adult book.

It had a catchey begining but the middle was a bit boring, but it all worked out with a marvelous ending!"},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"The Boxes is a good Sci-fi book and I gave it five stars. The reason I gave it five stars is that I think that William Sleator had a good use of dialogue. Also he had great description and detail about what the characters looked like. For example &quot;Uncle Marco pushed back his thick hair. He had a narrow face with a strong nose and a cleft chin, and pale blue eyes. He was very good-looking.&quot; An example for dialogue is &quot;Did you leave the boxes with me on purpose? Did you want me to open them?&quot; it made them sound normal. I also liked how he made the creatures telepathic. The story line was extremely good and the flow of the story was moderate. One thing that I would change about the book is the amount of dialogue used in some parts of the story. Another thing is the topic of some chapters changes a little too much. Also he could have described how the creatures looked in more detail. He also could have made the creatures more vicious. I would recommend this book to every body who likes Sci-fi or not. I think that it is a good book for ages twelve and up. My conclusion is that Sleator did an excellent job writing The Boxes."},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"I think the The Boxes was a real interesting book. I liked the way William Sleator used the Greek myth Pandora's Box as sort of a guidline for this story. It was also very dramatic, like when Anne and her friend Henry are running away from the Crutchly Development people. Sleator's discription in The Boxes is imppecable. The way he used Pandora's Box and turned it into something sciene fiction is very intresting, but since science fiction really isn't my deal, I gave it 3 stars. Thuogh The Boxes is a really good book and everything, it's not one of those books that I would like to read over again. The story, overall, was real, nicely done, except the ending, that part was a bit confusing. The &quot;clock&quot; gets pushed into the little creatures &quot;palace&quot; and Uncle Marco, Anne, and Henry go with it. All I want to know is where are they going? What's going to happen? That's ALL I want to know. Anyway, The Boxes was real intresting and I would recomend this book to people who like science fiction and endings you kind of get to make-up."},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"I liked The Boxes because it helps me understand that not obeying your parents can put you in a bad situation. William Sleator is a very good science fiction writer because he has a lot of description and his books easily gets peoples attention. I really didn't like the end because it ended like all of the sudden the end. I recommend this book to people who like books giving life long advice and to people who like science fiction. this book gave me a life long recommendation of always listen to your parents and don't disobey."},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"All I have to say, is that, this is the most incredible book and my favorite book I have ever read!!!!!!!!I'm trying to write a letter to the author himself, if you guys at AMAZON have any info about that, please e-mail me!EVAN :)"},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"It was great!!!!!!!!! You got to read it."},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"I thought this book was very interesting. The ending was hard to understand, but that's what sequels are for. and I think the writer should write a sequel to this. It would make it interesting since there is so much more he could describe about the clock or the creatures or Uncle Marco."},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"Before Uncle Marco goes on another of his constant trips, he leaves Annie two mysterious boxes. Like Pandora, she must keep them safe and never open them. But curiousity gets the better of her. Soon the unspeakable occurs. Grotesque, crablike creatures come out with the ability to communicate to Annie telepathically. Annie could never fathom the power they have. . .This was a good book, partly, because I'm a fan of sci-fi/fantasy books. I couldn't put it down. There was a lot of action and cliffhangers near the end. You never knew what was going to happen next. The creatures and their customs were very creative. It's easy to read for all ages from kids to adults. The only problem was that it ended with a cliffhanger even though all of the problems have been solved by the protagonist."},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"&quot;The Boxes&quot; is a thoroughly enjoyable fantasty fare from my beloved W. Sleator. This book is a sort of reworking of Pandora's Box with some neat elements thrown in. A great book for elementary school kids, even has some sort of ethnocentrism type elements included. Entertaining!"},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"William Sleator is one of my favorite authors. Although this is not one of his best, I couldn't put it down. Annie is an orphan who is sent to live with her Aunt Ruth--not a very pleasant person. Annie's only bright days are spent with her Uncle Marco, when he returns from his frequent mysterious trips abroad. When Marco entrusts his niece with two mysterious boxes and the warning never to a) open them or b) put them in the same room, Annie's resolve to keep them safe lasts for only one day as her curiousity gets the better of her. Once the boxes are opened, there is no going back. This is not a book to read before you go to sleep! The ending was not as satisfying as his other books; it seems like Sleator left it open for a possible sequel. Well-drawn characters let you step right into the story! When will the movie-makers (e.g. Disney) see that Sleator's books would be great for the screen!!"},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"The boxes was an excellent book that I wold love to explain to others. I am giving this book a 4 out of 5 stars. This was a terrific science fiction book. The author wrote great detail on the creatures. Some examples from the book about the description of the creation were when Annie says, &quot; I could see what it really looked like. I felt sick. And yet, even though I wanted to run from it, I couldn't. It legs, planted firmly on the floor. It was rubbing the front two legs totally diffferent personalities. For example, each of Annie's (main character) friends acts differently at things. William Sleator also explains how a money craving company, tries to get what they want if they cam't make a deal. For example on how thhe Crutchley Development Company can't get Annie's family to sell the house so they try to brake in the hose, and follow the family mambers. The book is about Annie, and how she opened the boxes that lead to the opening of a new life in which she has not seen. These new creatures aren't the prettiest things in the world and nicest. Thing that make Annies want to get help. I would do the same thing to. Her Uncle Marco told her not to open the boxs, but Annie thought that there was nothing bad in them, just an artifact or something. So she opened it. I think you whould to. As much as I think this book was good, the ending left you hanging. an example would be how did Annie save her house from being bought by the big company, and what happened to the creatures? The ending was pretty much stated badly. You can't have a perfect story and have a bad ending. It's just can't work. Besides that, it had a wonderful beginning and middle that entrenches you. I would really recommend this book to someone who wants to expand his or her mind or ideas. This book is also realistic. Annie goes to school like a normal day person, has freinds like everbody eles's, and goes through things that you and I would go through at school. In fact her main freinds are so cought up in love that they don't even help Annie out of the problem that she has. The growninups in this book were really out there. You have the company's manerger throwing fits, an uncle joking, making a teen- ager not believing her, and so on. This book also shows how a small community try's to push awway a big company. With a book that expands your mind, and fun to read, I think you should read this. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"This is the kind of book you need on a bus or train or during a winter day when you can't go out. It is stright forward, with stupid characters (as in slow to figure things out), semi-interesting alien race (who have class issues) and a creative idea that could have been handled better or made into an interesting series of books.I got this book because, when I was younger, I found Interstellar Pig interesting and thought the author might be able to write other books at the same level of skill. No go - while The Boxes feels like it had some promise I never really felt anybody was in danger nor was anything really a surprise."},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"\\"The Boxes\\" was quite simply an excellent book. The plot is well thought out and the book flows well. It has a fairly good ending which is something that I find rare for Sleator's books. It is worth the time."},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"This was a good book from my boyfriend's childhood. Made for a great stocking stuffer. He enjoyed reading it again."},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"The Boxes by William Sleator is about a girl named Annie that lived with her Aunt Ruth. Annie's Uncle Marco left her in care of two boxes - one in her closet and the other in her basement. Before Uncle Marco left he urged Annie not to open or tell anyone about the boxes. The next morning she went down to the basement and opened the box where a crab like things ran out and hid. Later that night, Annie had a dream about opening the box in her closest. When she tried the technique she saw in her dream, the box from her closet it worked. In the box was a strange looking clock with hieroglyphics symbols instead of numbers.After school the next day, Annie went down to the basement to look for the creatures she released the day before. Upon arriving in the basement Annie noticed a voice. The voice was saying \\"Greetings, and welcome. I am happy you have finally showed up. Have you eaten?\\" Annie was confused as to who was talking to her. When Annie began to question the voice it replied \\"I don't understand your language, please speak as we do.\\" Annie then realized that the voice was only able to read her thoughts. And as they were communicating through Annie's thought, she began looking around the basement for the creatures. Suddenly she found them and she let out a loud scream. Annie could not believe how much they had grown over night. The creatures wished to make an offering to the lord, the clock in her closet, and asked if Annie would do this for them. The creatures wanted Annie to request a slowdown of the clock.The next afternoon Annie and her friend Henry noticed things seemed to be moving slower than normal. They thought it was because they were sick. It did not accrue to either of them that it was due to the request from the prior night. As they walked home, Annie and Henry noticed they were being followed by a strange vehicle. Once home, Annie discovered that the creatures had constructed a magnificent creation. She applauded them on their work. The creatures then requested for Annie to take the creation and ask the lord for another slowdown. Annie did but the offering was rejected. Instead the lord sought four of the creatures' babies. Annie went to tell the creatures about the lord's response; however they already were aware of the demand. As Annie approached, four of the creatures' babies came to her; she picked them up and headed back up the stairs.Annie showed Henry the boxes, creatures, and the clock. He couldn't believe what he had just seen. On his way out, Henry bumped into a man in Annie's house; the man was running to escape. When Aunt Ruth came home later that day she called Annie downstairs. As they began to talk Aunt Ruth told Annie about an offer Curthely Development had made to buy their house for one million dollars. Annie realized that the man in the house earlier that day must be with Curthely Development and the offer was connected to what he had seen. Annie told Aunt Ruth about the man and why she would not want to do business with them. At the end of their conversation Aunt Ruth said that Curthely Development had requested a meeting with Annie and Henry. After school the following day, Annie and Henry met with Curthely who invited them into his conference room. Curthely was trying to butter them up, the kids just wanted to get on with business. So Henry came out and asked why they had invited to the Curthely Development office. Curthely replied \\"We want the device you used to make time slowdown.\\" Henry and Annie tried to deny knowing what he was referring to but he had evidence. That man in the house the day before had taken pictures of the creatures in the basement as well as the clock in Annie's closet. As Annie and Henry ran out of the meeting they were both very scared.That night when Annie went to bed she realized the clock was missing. The next day she told Henry. After school Annie and Henry went down to the basement to tell the creatures about the clock, but they already read her mind. The kids decided to head to Henry's house. As the approached Henry's, Annie questioned Henry about the strange thing on his roof house. Henry said that sometimes it's there and sometimes it's not. Shortly after arriving, Henry's mother called the house needing Henry's help because she had car troubles. Annie stayed behind. While Henry was gone Annie snooped around looking for a way to the roof. When she got onto the roof she saw a statue that looked like her Uncle Marco with a box beside him. While she investigated the statue she noticed it was slowly moving. At that point Annie realized it was actually her uncle not just a statue. When she looked into the box, she saw a clock that looked like the one she was missing. Uncle Marco told her to go to Curthely and ask it for the deepest longest slowdown ever. On the way out of the house, a man from Curthely was in the house and grabbed her.After escaping from her captivity, Annie and Henry headed back to Annie's house. In the basement, Uncle Marco placed his clock along the wall. This created a portal entrance, Uncle Marco pushed the clock forward, and it began to sink down the incline that the portal had created. All the creatures followed behind the clock saying, \\"Come nervous system you are the three in one.\\" Uncle Marco, Annie, and Henry followed the clock and the creatures. Once inside the portal closed. All they could see was a shimmering light around them, nothing else. They could feel themselves being pulled suddenly and unexpectedly into the depths. The sensation of slow falling, like a dream was the only way they could describe it."},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"I have read all of William Sleator\`s books and most of them are fantastic except intersteller pig and parasite pig but this was very close to being great but not as great as others such The Boy Who Couldn\`t Die which was amazing but disappointing that its not at the kindle store but you should definitely order that online."},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"The Boxes By William SleatorUncle Marco is a middle-aged man. He has black hair and blue eyes, he's tall and skinny and disappears a lot. He goes on mysterious adventures to exotic places in the world. I like the way William Sleator imagines him, which I think is incredible.At the beginning I thought that uncle Marco was going to be a boring character. Once I got more into the book I got more interested in him. It was like he was jumping out of the book to become a real person.Uncle Marco is always in his own slowdown. That is when he watches the world change. It is the same thing that the little aliens do to get more work done for their ruler, who is a clock-like thing that takes little alien runts as a sacrifice. Uncle Marco goes into a slowdown to watch the earth change.I cannot relate to this character. He is too old and mysterious. He gets this cool slowdown machine and I all I have is a Play Station 2, which is not as cool as that.The Boxes is a great book for readers ages 9-12. I really loved it. It was so interesting that I couldn't stop reading it. William Sleator should make a sequel to The Boxes, that's how good it was. I really liked it!"},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"This sci-fi book The Boxes,by William Sleator,is very interesting.

This one was also very well written, and had a great concept and interesting characters. However, it seemed like it was half a book. So many questions and issues are just not resolved. If a sequel does ever get published, maybe in the future the two books could be published as one, and I think then it would be a much more complete feeling read! At least you are left certainly looking forward to more of this story, which is more than you can say for so many books!"},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"Another wonderful book from the mind of William Sleator. Again, his writing is clear and understandable, but his plot twists are wonderfully unexpected. For every child who has been told not to open a door, or look in a box, this book will keep you imagination reaming with posibilties long after you put the book down. A true classic in the sense that you find something new everytime you read it. So go ahead and read it."},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"A Review by DJThis book is mostly about my main character Annie who is left with two boxes from her uncle. Her uncle told her not to open those boxes nor tell any one about those boxes. Well, she broke those rules and opened both of the boxes and something incredible happened. She told her friend about the boxes and what was in it and what was happening with those boxes, something that she wasn't suppose to do, which was a very big mistake on her part.I like this book because it keeps you glued to it, like you always want to read more and more to see what is going to happen. The book is very easy to read for all ages to a kid to a full grown adult. The book is very smooth; the author leads up to the high point of the book very smooth. But you have to keep in mind what happened in the very beginning of the book, or else you will be lost from the get go. There aren't very many characters and I thought that was plus because usually when I read I get lost in the characters because there are so many.I would recommend this book to any one that likes twisted books, and leaves you hanging just a tad bit."},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"This is a wonderful book. It has suspence and it's just a little scary. If you didn't like the ending, don't worry. We had an authorfest at my school last year and William Sleator came. He told us that there *might* be a sequel."},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"I believe The Boxes was a very well written book. It has alot of very descriptive passsages such as the following. &quot;A flabby, dark haired man with a greasy face smiled stiffly at us.&quot; Or &quot;The big old furnace in the main room was like a black monster with lots of tentacles and right now it was hissing and rumbling softly with the effort to heat the house.&quot; These are both terrific examples used to show expression and detail instead of just telling it. Annie is a fifteen year old girl with short, black, hair and dark eyes. She lives in old neighborhood that is trying to be bought by the evil Crutchley Development Company. During this rough time her Uncle Marco leaves her with two odd and mysterious boxes. Before he leaves for some strange, unknown destination, he tells her they must never be opened, ever. Her curiosity is too much to bare and she gives into the irresistible temptation. &quot; It had a disk-like body and six legs. Actually, only the back four limbs seemed to be legs, planted firmly on the floor. It was rubbing it's front two legs together. I couldn't see much of the face, only a ridged triangular head. The mouth seemed to be closed, and the other features, if there were any, were buried in the ridges.&quot; This is the great horror that Annie has unleashed. Now she must suffer the consequences. Though the book was very well written, it just stopped toward the very end. There was no exciting, meaningful lesson or last words to remember. This is not a book that ties up all the loose ends. In a way it was just disappointing. I expected more of a logical scientific ending to sum things up. Even though it had a poor ending, I still give the book 4 out of 5 stars. It was excellently written by author William Sleator. It shows a great use of similes and metaphors. It is a wonderful science fiction novel that has suspense, action , and demonstrates a strong sense of friendship. It also shows that either controlling a situation or losing control, can strongly affect the outcome. The Boxes is a book for all readers even those who don't particulary enjoy science fiction. I suggest that anyone should go out and get a copy today!"},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"When I picked out this book, I was expecting a fast- paced, fun to read, sci-fi adventure. While much of the plotline itself was interesting, I found that the book was extremely difficult to get into. The book bored me for the first four chapters until it finally got into the real plot. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book. I felt that it was just, to sum it up, not interesting enough."},{"Title":"The Boxes","review":"The book The Boxes is a non-fiction book. I don't really know the theme of the book cause it doesn't really have a theme.

One time when he goes he leaves these two boxes under her control and tells hers not to open them. She becomes extremely curious about what is in the boxes and decides to open them. What is in the boxes are mysterious things that now she has to deal with. At the same time she has to deal with a construction that is trying to tear down her neighborhood to build a mall. Another problem is that the construction company wants what is in the boxes and they try to take it. This book is very interesting, and it is really weird and sometimes confusing.

I also like this book because this man leaves these boxes for his nease to hide and don't open them. Even with so much love for her Uncle she chooses to disobey and opens them anyway. This book keeps you guessing on what will hapen next.The best parrt of this book is when the mistirious Uncle Marco comes back to find out what just happened when he was gone.He comes back and the creatures have already built their cities in the basement. Uncle Marco finds out this big developement is trying to buy out the whole town to build a mall, steals the creatures lord because they think it wil make them rich. So Marco's nease and her friend get it back to take it to the creatures in time.One of the most vivid parts of the story is in the begining when Uncle Marco gave Annie the boxes becasue he is a mistiriuos man he alwayshas something to bring home or hide from other people. For a man so mistirious what could be in the boxes? Anthor vivid part would be why Aunt Ruth thinks they are hiding something that she just does not know yet.

So I can't compare it to other works. BUT it is a very enjoyable read. As the cover states there are extensive interviews with people who knew him best, including various ex-wives. Various incidents that are in the movie are described here, so I assume Eastwood, or whoever wrote the script, probably consulted this book. But, what is interesting is that the Book states that Chan and 'Bird' were never legally married. Don't think that fact was in the Movie."},{"Title":"Bird: The Legend of Charlie Parker","review":"In my opinion this is the best biography of Bird yet produced. It is not so much a biography as a compilation of reminiscences by people who knew Bird: mostly fellow musicians, but some non-musicians as well. I think this is the best way to get a true idea of what Bird was like because it focuses on what Bird actually did rather than attempting the impossible task of synthesizing one consistent portrait which can account for the wide spectrum of impressions he made. Unlike many subjects of biographies, one of Bird's striking characteristics was his ability to project different personalities to different people as the situation seemed to warrant, or as his whims and needs dictated. He was both a hipster and a family man, an amoral drug addict and a loving husband and father, a great genius and an ordinary guy, sometimes all in the same day.As an example, one can contrast the recollections of Bird the con artist taking advantage of young fans' gullibility to steal their money, versus Bird the father figure to aspiring young musicians who waited for him at subway stops so they could carry his instrument case.Although Bird's heroin addiction, which stayed with him from the time he was 17 until his death, undoubtedly played a major role in creating this phenomenon, he was also probably spoiled as the only child of a doting mother and an absent father. Being allowed to make his own rules from early in life, he became used to living by his own code, often to the detriment of those around him. (Jay McShann laughingly recalls another bandleader who asked him to release Bird so he could join his band, only to return several weeks later begging to take him back.) It is this side of Bird's personality which led his first biographer, Ross Russell, to label him a \\"classic sociopath\\", a label I reject. But this is only one aspect of this complex and fascinating man.If after reading this book you are interested in additional personal recollections of Bird, read his last wife Chan Parker's autobiography, \\"My Life in E-Flat\\", which gives an excellent insight into how difficult Bird could be, but also what an amazing musician he was."},{"Title":"Bird: The Legend of Charlie Parker","review":"this book was about an epic struggle of a jazz musician in a New York city life.Im 16 and i play a lot of jazz and parker was a geat influence on me and my playin i worship him as a mucican and a jazz ico"},{"Title":"The Gospel of John: Introduction, Exposition and Notes","review":"The late F.F. Bruce, a professor at the University of Manchester and author of many excellent New Testament commentaries, has produced an excellent work in his commentary on the Gospel of John. This book is intended to be read by lay members of the church, so there isn't an awful lot of Greek, nor is there jargon. In fact, he does such a good job avoiding such issues, that he \\"makes it look easy,\\" the mark of one whose scholarly and writing skills have been finely honed.The format is simple: Bruce translates a few verses of John, then offers an explanation (sometimes only a paragraph, sometimes a page or two). He comments on the historical/cultural context, Messianic expectations, the other three Gospel accounts, and other interesting literary or theological issues. One walks away knowing he has a better handle on John.This reader appreciates F.F. Bruce's conservative theology. He argues that the disciple John wrote this Gospel (and effectively supports this argument), he does not speculate get into \\"development of the text\\" issues, and he places a heavy focus on Jesus, his work, and his teachings. Many excellent scholars are so focused on text-criticism issues, that they blind themselves to Christ himself.Also of note is Bruce's treatment of the (controversial) passage concerning the woman caught in adultery. Added to the end as an appendix, he argues that while Johnnine authorship is in doubt, the passage is authentic Gospel and treats it quite fairly. In all, a very good commenary that I would recommend to laity and those who want a good introduction to John."},{"Title":"The Gospel of John: Introduction, Exposition and Notes","review":"This commentary on the Gospel penned by the &quot;disciple whom Jesus loved&quot; strikes a balance between scholarship and accessability and in doing so provides the student of the New Testament a valuable resource that may either be used as a starting place for further study or a stand alone explanation of the issues in what is both the simplest and subtlest of the four accounts of Jesus' life. Based on Bruce's own translation of the Greek, the commentary untangles the more obscure puzzles found in the gospel and guides the reader to a deeper understanding of the possible motives of the writer. If the commentary has any weaknesses it might be in that it is not written with the intent of being devotional in nature. Readers looking for a work with this function would likely be better served using Barclay's Daily Bible Study series."},{"Title":"The Gospel of John: Introduction, Exposition and Notes","review":"This is a very good commentary on John. The author demonstrates his mastery of the original language as well as other translations.

Bruce. In picking up Bruce's \\"The Gospel of John\\" just to check out one particular verse or passage, I often found myself continuing to read several pages or more beyond what was necessary simply because Bruce is such an engaging author - it was hard to put down this book. Although many other lengthier commentaries are available for this popular Gospel, you find that Bruce has covered everything you really need to know and much more!I can sum this up by saying that F.F. Bruce is both concise and engaging - a rare commodity! This is easily the very best commentary on the Gospel of John, or any other book of the bible, that I have ever come across. Bruce is throughly academic throughout without reading like an academic - the result is very easy to read and understand. A paperback bargain."},{"Title":"The Gospel of John: Introduction, Exposition and Notes","review":"If you are a new convert to Christianity, this is a great book to read.

Bruce's treatment of the Gospel of John is a scholarly, concise, and practical--useful for the academic and a small group leader in a church.

His style also leaves room for disagreement regarding interpretation and application of a particular story or teaching ascribed to Jesus."},{"Title":"Surf's Up!: The Beach Boys on Record, 1961-1981","review":"Every recording done by the Beach Boys, their friends and relations through 1981 is documented in this textbook.

Tuscany at its most enchanting moment, a wonder and a joy for my eye. But Mary scarcely opened her eyes to all this beauty. Yet she will write about it, and be evocative and give readers the longing to come and experience for themselves, as I never, never could. Such is the power of the gift for words, and the technique for using them. The accomplished writer need not feel, not muse, nor think as much as I do, but he will make his readers do so, as I cannot. I am led to wonder whether successful writing and dreaming and thinking ever go todether.

It would discourage anyone from wanting to visit the city! While the bitter complaining ceased by chapter two, it was merely replaced by an convoluted nonlinear vesrion of history - there was more jumping around in there than a trampolene toped with 10 five-year-olds. She managed to more or less cover about 250 years of Florentine history in a dizzying circle of names and events. While the stories were interesting - if you didn't know an Italian history, you would certainly be lost, as she forgot to mention dates. I was thrilled when it was over. However, it did manage to easily put me to sleep several nights."},{"Title":"The Stones of Florence","review":"Forget about this edition of the book--which I would love to find another original 1963 edition of to replace the one I gave away.

Fat broken type throughout. Nearly unreadable. Coyote, buck ugly printing. I understand the margins in publishing, but a good selling backlist title like this should elicit some respect from the publisher, even if they have none for their readers.

The good, the bad, the ugly, the downright sad, she observed it all, and The Stones of Florence is her report on the city. The book is not for the faint of heart, as it is as complicated as the history of the city itself. There is no seemingly obvious structure, with history and art intermingled throughout the book. Each chapter has a major theme, such as how Florence is not tourist-friendly, the sculpture, the paintings, the architecture. But she seems to meander in her chapters, ostensibly without a goal in mind, other than to present the city as she saw it. Since the book was written in the 1950s, I suspect that some of what she saw might be different over half a century later. The Stones of Florence is not a travel guide, a history lesson, or a discussion of Florentine art. Other books must be consulted for that information. Instead, it is an essay on the city, written by a perceptive spectator who appreciated the beauty of what she saw. I don't know if I will see the same things in Florence that she did. However, I suspect that I will return to the book upon our return from the city. Only time will tell."},{"Title":"The Stones of Florence","review":"This account of the history of Florence is a good, basic, easy read. The opening chapter lowers any visitors' expectations of the area, especially in comparison to other cities in Italy. Yet, Ms. McCarthy reveals that this area has had a notable rich past. Her research discloses the unique historical events that took place over the centuries that allow us to understand the personalities of the people, the style of the architecture, and the originality of the art and sculpture.Not a Florence guide book by any means, this narritive is aimed for those who are interested in a fresh, unique historical view of the city and surroundings without tedious complexity. However, it will certainly give the novice visitor a realistic insight into the fresh discoveries they are about to experience."},{"Title":"The Stones of Florence","review":"I have the large hard-cover version of this book with absolutely wonderful black and white photographs. They are what originally drew me to it - I had read &quot;The Group&quot; in college but wasn't a big fan of Mary McCarthy. Well, that changed fast!In Florence, more than in any other city I know of, history and art are entwined in such a way that you can't talk about one without talking about the other. In this book, Ms. McCarthy conveys this duality better than I have ever seen done before. Her style is quite literary, in a dreamy way, so it reads smoothly and flows logically. You learn a lot without realizing it. The photographs are somewhat old-fashioned; sharp-focus B&amp;W, many of minute details. The text and the pictures complement each other beautifully - her style is such that even without the pictures, you can see what she's talking about in your imagination - the very best kind of writing.Ms. McCarthy also wrote &quot;Venice Observed,&quot; a similar kind of book. Both are out of print, but are not too hard to find in used book stores, where I found the Venice book. I highly recommend them to anyone with an interest in Florence, art, the Renaissance, history..."},{"Title":"The Stones of Florence","review":"There are several reasons to go for Mary McCarthy's THE STONES OF FLORENCE. You are about to go to, are in or have been to Florence, Italy; you enjoy the literature of travel; you appreciate a well-written book. I fall into the latter two categories and thoroughly enjoyed this idiosyncratic work. McCarthy wrote this in the very early 1960's when the very nature of Tuscany's chief city couldn't help but attract tourists at the same time it seemingly did everything to discourage them. She swiftly dispenses with the contemporary city and spends the book peering back into its Renaissance soul, primarily the 14th through the 16th centuries when Florence was the Western center of intellectual activity. What emerges is the picture of the greats-Dante, Giotto, Brunellseschi, Donatello, Fra Angelico, della Robbia, Botticelli, Da Vinci, Machiavelli, Michelangelo, Cellini, and various Medici to name a few-functioning amidst social, political and occasional natural upheaval. As she suggests about one artist, perhaps the productivity was inspired by the need to make order out of chaos. That and no doubt the fact that the Florentines used and valued art in their daily lives in ways that it is not today. That science, engineering, architecture and art were closely aligned offered cross disciplinary assistance is also key-without the mathematicians, for instance, would artists have been able to as easily co-opt perspective and volume?THE STONES OF FLORENCE is both direct and impressionistic. McCarthy's prose moves right along, never bogged down by a &quot;perhaps&quot; or the need to recite contemporary opinion. Her progress from the 14th to the 16th century is zig-zaggy, so that most of the Renaissance is spoken of as if on a continuum. There is a sly wit at work (in the personality contest, the score is Leonardo 10, Michelangelo 0) and McCarthy presents a strong spine-she is unequivocal about the decline of the Renaissance in the 16th century as the major players moved away from Florence and the populace fell into a &quot;gee-gaw&quot; mentality.This is a travelogue and, after a fashion, an art history catalogue, and yet there are no pictures (in this edition). That and its not too chronological organization would suggest an abstract mess but it is nothing of the kind. I became very much aware of how much of the Renaissance was covered in my early education as every reference brought up old lessons and visits to museums out of the tar pits of memory. I felt at home, not at a loss."},{"Title":"The Stones of Florence","review":"In the first chapter of THE STONES OF FLORENCE Mary McCarthy weighs in against everyone who might want to know about Florence who deeply irritates her: casual tourists, Europeans who love Florence deeply... who, you might wonder, is the book intended for? But once she gets this out of her system (though not ever entirely--as the book continues she often takes little sideswipes at everyone, even including Goethe!), the book settles down to be a very idiosyncratic and informative study of a city Mccarthy loves and knows well. Skip the intro (or at least try not to let it get under your collar) and keep plugging along: this is a highly readable and fun little book."},{"Title":"The Stones of Florence","review":"THE STONES OF FLORENCE is a complex art history book Mary McCarthy first had published in 1959. The original contained photographs and this paperback has none. I think my reading would have been a bit easier if I had seen the photographs, but perhaps they were few or not that good. I've taken enough art history classes that covered Italian art and traveled and visited museums housing Florentine art, so I could visualize many of the works McCarthy discusses. If you have no background on this suject you might find the book tough going. On the other hand, one has to start somewhere (though this may not be the best place). STONES is filled with enough anectdotal material to make it interesting, but if you don't aready know who Giotto, Cimabue, Ucello, Masaccio, Fra Agelico, Donatello and Brunelleschi were, McCarthy's discourse may prove dense at times.McCarthy covers the history of Florence, but she is mainly interested in the Medieval and Renaissance art of the city so she moves very quickly to the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries. My sense is that she is favorably disposed to the Medieval art (13th and 14th), likes the Renaissance art a little less (14th and 15th), and positively dislikes the mad, bad Mannerists (16th). For example, describing the Mannerist Il Rosso's painting &quot;Moses Defending the Daughters of Jethro&quot; she says it reminds one of &quot;the half-carnival atmosphere of an insane asylum or of a brothel during a police raid.&quot;McCarthy says Florentine art collapsed in the 16th Century and never recovered, largely owing to the Medicis--those former pharmacists who thought they understood art. She says perhaps the Mannerists only reflected what they saw--Florence as a commercial hub with no spritiual core.She says Florence, unlike Venice and Sienna is a manly town. Although various illustrious visitors have been attacted to the city over the ages, like Queen Victoria who &quot;did water colors&quot; at Vincigliata, or Florence Nightengale's parents who named her for the city, they mostly preferred to stay in villas in the Tuscan countryside or other cities in Tuscany. Florence has been and remains a commercial city (home of Gucci and Feragamo) and for the most part, it's buildings are blocky, black and white, and businesslike. She says Florence was a Guelph city (for the Pope, one of whom was a Medici) and one of the many Guelph-Ghibilline conflicts that involved Florence took place with Pistoia--source of the word pistol.STONES is an interesting book and one that may provide you with some colorful information about the city of Florence, and perhaps persuade you to take your next vacation in Venice."},{"Title":"The Stones of Florence","review":"Prior to reading this book, my favorite book on Florence was \\"The City of Florence: Historical Vistas and Personal Sightings\\" by R.W.B. Lewis which, like much of what one reads about the city, is generally positive.In searching out books on the subject, I had repeatedly come across references to \\"The Stones of Florence,\\" which I avoided because I viewed Mary McCarthy (1912 - 1989) as a sort of upscale Danielle Steel, a popular novelist incapable of perceptive insights. That assessment was wrong.Instead, from the first page, the reader is confronted with perceptive and knowledgeable opinions that challenge his or her own perceptions (e.g., the Florentines are a cantankerous, miserly bunch). You may not agree with her, but there is no doubt that she is highly intelligent and has seriously thought out her positions. In the end, the reader comes away with strong admiration for her intelligence, candor, and succinct writing style. For example:\\"Up until this time (the age of Michelangelo), sculpture and architecture had been relied on by the Florentines to affirm the strength of the Republic. That is why the Uffizi, beautiful as many of its paintings are, is only a picture gallery, while the Bargello and the Museum of the Works of the Duomo are Florence.\\" (p. 108).\\"The kind of vulgarity in decoration that is today thought of as middle-class seems to stem straight from Tuscany in the time of the Medici grand dukes (citing Cosimo I)... The interiors of the grand-ducal palaces and villas are sumptuously, stuffily ugly in a way that is hard to connect with a period that was contemporary, after all, with classic Palladio in the Veneto.\\" (p. 201)\\"Lorenzo the Magnificent was \`incredibly devoted to the indulgence of an amorous passion', as Roscoe, his eighteenth-century biographer, puts it; his sexuality was uncontrollable, a perpetual bullish rut.\\" (p. 176)This is not a book for readers considering a first trip to Florence or for those whose sole exposure has been a whirlwind tour of the Uffizi, Duomo and David. It presupposes an in-depth knowledge of the city itself, its history and literature. Those who have that knowledge will find it thought-provoking and rewarding.The title of this book is explained by the fact that three years before writing \\"The Stones of Florence,\\" McCarthy wrote \\"Venice Observed,\\" in which she relied heavily on John Ruskin's masterpiece \\"The Stones of Venice.\\"Readers interested in an objective view of the Medici, particularly Lorenzo il Magnifico, should considerMedici Money: Banking, Metaphysics, and Art in Fifteenth-Century Florence (Enterprise)by Tim Parks. The final chapter is spectacular, pulling together what for me had previously been separate strands of history."},{"Title":"The Stones of Florence","review":"I just finished this book prior to a trip to Florence. This is a book of commentary and Mary McCarthy's observations and knowledge about Florence. I found it very useful, and in parts very fascinating. I'd recommend it before taking a trip to Florence.The beginning is a bit slow. But when it picks up, afer the first chapter or so, it goes much faster. I would have gotten more out of it, and it would have gone faster, if I had already read one of my other books about Florence, say \\"Florence: Biography of a City\\" or \\"Florence A Portrait.\\" This is because, especially at the beginning, she comments on artists and places I'm not familiar with.Her commentary about art and artists is really must read information. Especially about Uccello and, later, the Mannerists. There's some great history here, too. I'd STRONGLY recommend reading this book before a trip to Florence."},{"Title":"The Stones of Florence","review":"Of all the works on this great city, this book stands above the rest. It is both a travel guide and a art history book."},{"Title":"The Stones of Florence","review":"After reading The Stones of Florence, I speculated that although author Mary McCarthy has a good feel for words and a certain passion for Florence, she must have been in a bad mood when she started writing.Now, I'm not someone who looks for travel literature that overly romanticizes the places it covers. But painting an accurate picture of a place is one thing, and grumbling under one's breath is rather something else.Yet with The Stones of Florence one can almost imagine Ms. McCarthy's scowl as she rails against other writers who write about Florence, about the tourists who visit the city, the traffic on its streets, and the smog that surrounds it. Although modern environmental laws have improved the air quality in Florence in the years since this book was written in 1964, the city has become an ever more popular subject for writers, the traffic has worsened, and the crowds of tourists have grown larger and less cosmopolitan ... I shudder to imagine what Ms. McCarthy would write today.In my eyes, most of the book's value comes from the fact that it is considered one of the parents of modern travel writing, a blend of history, literature, autobiography, and intelligence gathering. For students of the genre, this would probably make an interesting read. But for anyone thinking of reading this ahead of a long-awaited trip to the storied Tuscan capital, I dare say that seeing the city first from Ms. McCarthy's often jaded point of view could color the experience in an undesirable way."},{"Title":"The Stones of Florence","review":"Mary McCarthy(1912-1989), might well be described as a Renaissance woman, in the sense that she was a teacher, and a writer of intelligent and incisive fiction, nonfiction, and criticism. This is to use \\"renaissance woman\\" in the sense that that tag, \\"renaissance man,\\" was first applied to the world's most famous artist, Leonardo da Vinci, himself a product of the Italian Renaissance as it took root in Florence. Not only was he an outstanding artist, he was also a scientist, engineer, architect, and all-around technology geek-- the best his times allowed. And Florence, for sure, remains one of the world's great destination cities, bursting with celebrated Renaissance art-- works by Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Botticelli-- to name but a few, that's readily accessible to the public. So here we have McCarthy's well-known, greatly-praised take on that city.The author, a witty and sophisticated writer, published seven novels from 1942-1979, of which the most widely known is the semi-autobiographical,sexually outspoken \\"The Group,\\"made into a movie, about the lives of her Vassar classmates. She also published many works of nonfiction, many magazine articles, taught at several colleges, and won many awards. She was born in Seattle, Washington, orphaned at the age of six: her parents were killed in the great flu epidemic of 1918. Her private life was to continue to be eventful; she had many love affairs and several husbands, including, as her second, the esteemed critic Edmund Wilson. She also had a well-publicized friendship with Hannah Arendt, a respected writer-philosopher; and an even better publicized quarrel with the influential writer and playwright Lillian Hellman, of whom she told tv host Dick Cavett in 1980, \\"every word she writes is a lie, including and and the.\\" (Hellman sued her for this, but the case was dropped at the playwright's death.)Florence provided McCarthy with perfect subject matter, and the first thing to be said about this book is that every paragraph displays prodigious learning. Her discussions of the art, politics, geography and history of the city are unparalleled. Be warned though, there is, unfortunately, some repetition, as she's keeping so many subjects in play at once.McCarthy's thesis is that, although Florence is a treasury of great art and architecture, it is neither easy nor pleasant to view it; after two lengthy visits there myself, Renaissance student that I am, every criticism of hers rings true. The people are as obdurate as their local stone, interested in their own concerns, and not necessarily thrilled by the throngs of tourists clogging their streets. The streets and sidewalks themselves are generally made of stone, very noisy, wherever you are. Sidewalks are just two to three feet wide: if you're forced into the roadway you risk your life under the wheels of the motorbikes and motorcycles whizzing by. You will never find a soft, non-stone bench to rest your feet. And the city grew in the valley of the river Arno: it's suffocatingly hot in summer, chilly, damp, rainy otherwise. Furthermore the Arno is prone to flooding of historic proportions.Still, to be sure, this city is a magnet for visitors from around the world. If you dream of it too, prepare yourself: read this book first. No English-speaking writer better understood Florence, or had wider, denser scholarship to offer on the subject."},{"Title":"The Stones of Florence","review":"Reading \\"The Stones of Florence\\" by Mary McCarthy is, unfortunately, like a pedestrian climb to San Mineato, all uphill going. Ms McCarthy begins her book with a long chapter pointing out every fault and flaw of the city of Florence. Florence is too hot in the summer, too congested with traffic, the sidewalks are too narrow, the people are too unwelcoming and argumentative, on and on, for about twenty-five relentless pages.By the time one arrives at the end of Chapter One--similar again to the climb to San Mineato, one is out of breath and wondering if the trip was worth the trouble, and not perhaps as impressed by the lovely surroundings as our erstwhile guide might have intended.Of course there are other ways of getting to San Mineato (do go, dear traveler and take the bus, please, it is cheap and effective, sit in the nave in late afternoon to hear the monks sing vespers and then watch the sun set as you have dinner at the quaint terrace restaurant just to the left of the Piazzale Michelangelo, where you will find great pasta and refreshing drinks of granita... Surprisingly low, good prices and great views of the entire city, before retuning to the old city). And there are other, better ways of reading about Florence than this book which should have been subtitled, \\"Only I Know Florence So The Rest of You Bums Ought to Stay Away\\". Nanny nanny boo boo.For it is only at page twenty-six (chapter two) that McCarthy finally launches into her Ms Know-It-All tone about the city's history. By then the reader is so enervated he or she cares but little about what one will see, or who was who, and either too frustrated or too exhausted or both to pay her much attention. The reader continues reading only because supposed experts have said that this is a book worth considering. Well, what do they know?It is all too much like having Mummy and Daddy insist \\"Eat Your Vegetables!\\" or having your grumpiest crone of an aunt plunk you down in front of a mediocre painting and prod with her cane and insist an appreciative response from you because she is doing it \\"for your own good\\". Dreadful.Maybe Mary was having a bad day, or week, or life, I don't know; but by the time one is done with this dreary work one wonders why Mary wrote the book at all. Maybe she needed the money, badly. One wonders even more why any publisher accepted it. It is rather inconceivable that any editor thought this book worth the time, bother, paper and ink.Oh, well, yes, there are a few smatterings of truth to all that she says. Florence can be too hot. The last time I was in Florence it was July and the heat was of the record-breaking variety. All the more reason to stroll over to Vivoli's and have a gelato, or two. The traffic was hectic, but then, all the more reason to duck into a shop and come out with something new in gorgeous Florentine leather. The sidewalks are narrow, all the more reason to slow down, and drink in the details of this marvelous, indescribably fascinating city that has surprises for the first time or returning visitor at every turn. One could spend a month just enjoying the vast variety of door knockers on the ancient palaces, or for that matter, sampling the byways that offer relief from the tourist trail. But then, why pretend one is not a tourist--there is nothing wrong with visiting a place to experience it, with all of its surprises and wonders. And as for the people--yes there are street vendors who ought not be there, but on the whole we find the Florentines to be welcoming and pleasant, as we find all of the Italians--who respond to Americans as if their long lost cousin has just stopped in for a visit.A visitor to any city could produce a long list of dislikes and turn them into a \\"Ten Things I Hate About You\\". Mary McCarthy's approach has no sense whatsoever that she loves or even likes the famous center of the Italian Renaissance. What a contrast it is to R W B Lewis' fabulous, thoroughly enjoyable, readable book on the same subject--filled with history and art that is more than facts and travel that takes one where the natives go, which I recommend highly to one and all and without qualification as the best single volume about Florence written in modern times. McCarthy is the reader's adversary. Lewis is the reader's friend; you can find it here...The City of Florence: Historical Vistas and Personal Sightings, by R W B Lewis - don't miss it!The title of Mistress Mary's book is, of course, a play on dear old Johnny Ruskin and his writings about Venice, but this is NOT a masterpiece of English literature. Far from it. It is a disappointment from start to finish, especially when read in comparison to the Lewis book.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction."},{"Title":"The American Heritage College Thesaurus, Deluxe Edition","review":"Why use a Thesaurus?A thesaurus is a book of synonyms. A synonym is a word that has the same, or nearly the same, meaning as another word. When we write, we sometimes use the same words repeatedly, or use boring words when more exciting words would make the writing more interesting. So, using a thesaurus can help us make our writing more exciting, when finding the right word for the occasion. It is true that using a Thesaurus could be risky, if the user does not appreciate the historical literary richness and diversity of the English language. Other than glossary making, and vocabulary enrichment, some non traditional uses of a thesaurus are as quiz builder, an Anagram Solver, even a crossword puzzle helper.A Thesaurus Adventure:Accordingly, in spite of an elaborate reference bookshelf I have at the tip of my fingers, I walked to the near bye World class Borders Bookshop, in order to fortify my grasp of the English language, especially after becoming an Amazon Vine Voice, I decided to stop being a boring reviewer, and repetitive guide writer. After examination of the Houghton Mifflin gem, I concluded it will help me in selection of Synonyms, clearly and precisely defined, with a cross reference that fortifies my English vocabulary, by allowing aa search in a broader way.American Heritage College Thesaurus:This is a new addition to the American Heritage English usage books. Organized in an easy-to-use alphabetical format, The American Heritage College Thesaurus provides a wide range of synonyms, with colorful alternatives that make English richer and more versatile language.

The author explains ground-risk management from project feasibility through maintenance and operation in an engaging and interesting way that should be directly useful to the spectrum of construction professionals. The presentation is systematic and thorough, clearly organized around the \\"GeoQ risk management process,\\" which includes six information processing steps successively embed in six project phase (see the TOC). What distinguishes this book is that it is not a mathematical treatise on risk theory (of which there are hundreds and hundreds), but a practical and well written \\"story\\" packed full of important concepts and understanding, both technical and social-psychological, with illuminating graphics. It is real-world. While many elements are useful by themselves, fully implemented as a risk management systems process, the ideas could support a resilient, dynamic adaptive management approach to project development and operation. Having practiced geotechnical engineering for 40 years, I was delighted by this book, which is thoughtful, educational, and fun to read--highly recommended."},{"Title":"Uncertainty and Ground Conditions: A Risk Management Approach","review":"I have used the book as practicing engineer, especially on projects where risk management appears to become one of the biggest and very confusing challenge due to the many different stakeholders with their conflicting interests. Since any internationally accepted uniform guidelines in this context as reference are missing, managing risk appears to become a thorn in the side of engineers. With his book, the author manages in a very clear and integer way to take this \\"displeasure\\". With the GeoQ concept, the core piece of his book, the reader learns how foreseeable ground risks can be managed in an effective and efficient way and how to combine the \\"hard\\", easily quantifiable aspects with the \\"soft\\" risk perception components and how to integrate them into risk management. Especially useful are the lively flowcharts, which are kept general enough to be widely applicable, but at the same time specific enough to give a clear red thread to follow. Numerous practical examples allow the reader furthermore to see the introduced concepts put into practice.This book is up-to-date and has proven valuable to me and my work."},{"Title":"Pan Michael: An historical novel of Poland, the Ukraine, and Turkey. A sequel to \\"With fire and sword\\" and \\"The deluge\\"","review":"A wonderful read, &quot;Pan Michael&quot; rounds out the Trilogy that has bridged stylistic centuries and proven there is an ageless recipe for plot, drama, character and objective. NO reader, regardless of ethnic background can fail to feel for the incredibly detailed main characters in this novel, such as Pan Michael or the daring woman, Basha. Action is not stinted and combines with the other elements in this colorful and sweeping epic to demonstrate history in one of the least well-documented areas of 17th century Europe. In Poland and Lithuania, where the edges of three great religions, and dozens of ethnic groups ebbed and flowed over the multicolored plains in endless kaleidescopes of struggle, Sinkiewicz paints a vast landscape of dramatic and epic action. He does this without losing the artist's eye for color or the political opportunist's artful demonstration of back-room dealings and rationales used by the shakers and movers of the novel's time-period (for it IS an historical novel). Not only is this clearly done with analogies for the time in which the novel was written (pointed examples clearly exist to parallel conditions in 19th century occupied Poland), but it resonantes with us in our hearts across the intervening century-plus, and in this, or any great republic. There is no doubt the reader will be more curious about the history of the period, and will want to read the other two novels in The Trilogy (With Fire and Sword, and The Deluge), but this is a stand-alone novel as well. The other books do not need to be read, but if I could impose upon the reader only one bit of advice: all of these books are precious, and they are in chronological order. All three will cause sleepless nights where you will be unable to put down the books, so it might be best to schedule them for a vacation! Written by the novelist who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1905 for Quo Vadis, these earlier books (The Trilogy, of which Pan Michael is the third book) for which he received grief from the critics but kudos from the reading public, were probably greater works, and are certainly recommended by this writer for all who would have the common reader love their creations."},{"Title":"Pan Michael: An historical novel of Poland, the Ukraine, and Turkey. A sequel to \\"With fire and sword\\" and \\"The deluge\\"","review":"Pan Michael is the third volume in what is simply known as \\"The Trilogy,\\" a series of three historical war epics by Polish Nobel Prize winner Henryk Sienkiewicz. Published in 1888, this book completes the saga that began in With Fire and Sword and continued in The Deluge. Originally titled Pan Wolodyjowski, it has also been published in English under the title Fire in the Steppe. The title character, Michael Volodyovski, was a supporting character in the first two books; here he finally gets a starring role. (This review is based on the English translation by Jeremiah Curtin, so I am using his spellings of proper names.) The story takes place from 1668 to 1673, during a war between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire.This final volume of Sienkiewicz's spectacular trilogy differs from the first two installments in that, for most of the book, warfare takes a back seat to romance. Like the two previous books, Pan Michael is an epic adventure of love threatened by war, so the first order of business is to find a love interest for Michael. At the end of The Deluge, he was engaged to Anusia Borzobogati, but, perhaps because Sienkiewicz didn't feel she was a sympathetic enough character, she dies of a mysterious illness in chapter one. Stricken by grief, love is the last thing on Michael's mind, but the indomitable Pan Zagloba makes it his personal mission to find a new bride for his old friend. The first twenty chapters of Pan Michael constitute a sort of self-contained romance novel worthy of Balzac or Anthony Trollope. Michael, the \\"little knight\\" renowned as the finest swordsman in all the Commonwealth, doesn't see any combat until about halfway through the book, but once he unsheathes his sword sparks fly and blood flows. The final quarter of the book is devoted to the epic warfare this trilogy is famous for, and the battles are as intense, brutal, and powerful as anything Sienkiewicz has written.The books in The Trilogy take place in roughly the same time period as Alexandre Dumas's Three Musketeers novels, and they share much of the same atmosphere of swashbuckling adventure and brotherly camaraderie. Sienkiewicz's books, however, are much more realistic in their portrayal of military life, more accurate in their depiction of historical events, and more solemnly respectful of life and death. There is a gravitas to the Polish trilogy that is missing from the Musketeers books. While his books are still fun to read, Sienkiewicz deals much more seriously with universal themes like love, honor, duty, and vengeance. At times Pan Michael is reminiscent of Homer's Iliad. Religion is a constant presence in this novel, not in a preachy way, but as an accurate representation of the importance of Catholicism in Polish culture, particularly during this time period. Though the motivations of the Turks are handled with far more brevity, Sienkiewicz shows equal respect to the religious piety of his Muslim characters. While both sides refer to each other as \\"dogs,\\" \\"infidels,\\" or \\"non-believers,\\" Sienkiewicz demonstrates how both forces are motivated by their conception of God, and those soldiers of either side who remain faithful to their ideals are worthy of honor and reverence.The best volume in Sienkiewicz's trilogy is The Deluge, but Pan Michael takes a close second. These books constitute a truly monumental achievement. Together they offer months of exciting reading and about a semester's worth of education in Eastern European history. For anyone who loves historical literature and epic adventure, Sienkiewicz's trilogy is an essential read."},{"Title":"Pan Michael: An historical novel of Poland, the Ukraine, and Turkey. A sequel to \\"With fire and sword\\" and \\"The deluge\\"","review":"Pan Michael, like any Sienkiewicz work, is a wonderful read due to its prose, his wonderful characterization and due to his ability to bring color to his works.Reading Pan Michael, like reading Teutonic Knights or Fire and Sword, is like opening a doorway into another time......this particular time....medieval Poland. Stepping through this doorway, you encounter all of the sights, the sounds and the lives of the characters within.I highly recommend Pan Michael, and any other book you may find by Sienkiewicz."},{"Title":"Pan Michael: An historical novel of Poland, the Ukraine, and Turkey.

I did some online research of the subject, and I found that Welchon and Krickenberger have a unique understanding of the subject, and online websites end up being a presentation of information that is droll and uninspiring.Also, I compared this book with some modern texts, like Shaum's Outlines book on \\"Geometry\\" Third Edition, and I swear, that it seems like a paraphrase of the Welchons & Krickenberger book on \\"Plane Geometry\\".As with so many subjects, I find that when I buy books published before the age of Computers, and even Television, and sometimes published even before Radio, the knowledge presented is better.I find myself doing a great deal of visualization while studying this subject, trying to recover what the Ancient Greeks had as a vision.I got lucky, and in fact, I think my discovery of the Welchon & Krickenberger books was the answer to a longstanding prayer.

Complete yet cheap it gives you a whole image of Yeats poet, starting from \\"The Rose\\" and \\"The Wild Swans of Coole\\" to his Last Poems of 38-39. The developement or rather evolution of his genious covers such a wide range that it would have been enough for some 10 fine poets. If you know his early poems, you don't know Yeats. If you know his late poems you do not know him either. He is a Proteus, and you need to get aquointed with as many disguises of him as you can.I must mention, that the explanatory notes are not sufficient to my taste."},{"Title":"The collected poems of W. B. Yeats (The Greatest books of the twentieth century)","review":"I must admit that I have a bit of a family bias toward Yeats. My family is from County Sligo, where Yeats partially grew up and wherein he is buried. My grandfather even marched in his funeral, and I have visited his grave in Drumcliffe several times.With that confession out of the way, I'll make my contentious claim, that Yeats is the best poet of the 20th century. I cannot claim to have read all the poetry of the century (none can), nor even all of the greats, but I have read enough to feel myself at least partially justified in this claim! :)His poems have a wonderful power to them, weight in the emotional and the lyrical senses, those two factors on which I judge poems most primarily. They flow wonderfully, display the full beauty of the English language, and contain a depth of thought not seen, some would say, since Wordsworth (I say since Keats or maybe Tennyson, but I cite the former claim from Harold Bloom).Take the following, one of his earliest poems and, though good, not his best:When you are old and grey and full of sleep,And nodding by the fire, take down this book,And slowly read, and dream of the soft lookYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;How many loved your moments of glad grace,And loved your beauty with love false or true,But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,And loved the sorrows of your changing face;And bending down beside the glowing bars,Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fledAnd paced upon the mountains overheadAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.There is obviously a powerful Romanticism in this poem, and it is not his most original nor his most deep, but it is a wonderful poem nonetheless. Just speak it aloud to yourself; listen to how well it flows. Think of it emotionally, as though you yourself were the woman reading it, or you were the one writing it to your lover to be read after your death.THE WINDING STAIR AND OTHER POEMS is his best book overall, and it is included in its entirety here, but almost all of these poems retain some value. Highly, highly recommend; besides Keats (no, it doesn't rhyme with Yeats! :)), Blake, Milton, and Shakespeare, I'd have to say he is my favourite poet!A Further Recommendation:If you are a fan of Yeats--and even if you are not--I highly recommend visiting Co. Sligo and his grave in Drumcliffe. The graveyard wherein he is buried and the surrounding area is the most beautiful, tranquil, and wonderful place I have yet seen on this planet, and I don't suspect I'll ever renounce that judgement. If you go there, walk a short way from the graveyard toward the main road, across from the round tower, and there is a road to a little creek with a pathway running along it. Walk down it, and think of the poems of Yeats and of things you love, and I promise you an unforgettable experience :)Cast a cold EyeOn Life, on Death.Horseman, pass by."},{"Title":"The collected poems of W.

This book simply presents W.B. in all of his glory, allowing the reader to view every poem simply and purely, as they were intended to be seen."},{"Title":"The collected poems of W. B. Yeats (The Greatest books of the twentieth century)","review":"Before a reasoned, intelligent assessment of Yeats (or any other master poet such as Hardy, Frost,de la Mare, Wilbur, et al) can be made, one must ask the right preliminary question: What is Genius-level poetry? There are at least 6 primary components: 1)It withholds something from us at first, yielding its secrets slowly, like an attractive lover or an ocean (sand, shoreline, shallows, surfzone, shelf, offshore, blue depths);2)It surprises and satisfies simultaneously - it repays multiple re-readings: 'I knew that but I didn't know until now that I knew it'; 3) It is words set to life's music - it sounds, or sings, special, through appropriate rhythm and rhyme. Follow the music and the other senses follow along; follow the voice til you have no choice; 4)It is memorable, both in detailed words, metaphors, images, literary referents, phrasings, lines, sections/stanzas, and as a sum of things which exceeds the excellencies of the parts. It is memorizable. 5)It speaks to life's questions: what could be worse than answering questions no one is asking?; above all relevance synthesizes with reverence to create resonance. Its subject matter matters. Nothing is missing more in most poetry published today than lack of compression, resolution, depth: too much verse is a pretty pond acres wide, inches deep. Especially powerful verse has simplicity in perichoresis (interpenetration) with complexity or multiplicity, ambidextrously able to use telescope or microscope to bring the subject into focus for the reader. The best of Seuss appeals also to adults; the arcanest of Einstein, E=mc2, can even be grasped by children;Lastly,6) It fulfills its expectations and arrives: it reaches the reader at some point, in different ways at different times. Though woods are lovely, dark and deep;with miles to go before I sleep, there are still promises to keep. Yeats lovers will find all six of these criteria fulfilled consistently throughout the Collected Works; skeptics and seekers can objectively test Irish Airman Predicts His Death; Sailing to Byzantium; Song of Wandering Aengus; Innisfree and other typically anthologized masterpieces to see if they meet at least 4 of the 6 standards. I hope many new readers are pleasantly surprised and many old friends of Yeats come away with a new appreciation of what Ireland gave the world from 1865-1939. His 1923 Nobel Prize was not bestowed by biased eyes, but the award was nobly earned, though by so many undiscerned."},{"Title":"The collected poems of W. B.

Yeats (The Greatest books of the twentieth century)","review":"Yeats is a great poet--no sane person would deny or argue against this statement. I own this edition plus the complete poems and plays edition. I would recommend the latter, though the collected poems includes all of his best poems and is generally comprehensive.I must say, however, that this edition like the editions of most great/famous poets LACKS adequate Notes (and I don't mean Monarch notes), notes that for all readers. i.e.,professors who have written books on Yeats as well as those readers coming to his poems for the first time would greatly enhance their understanding of and pleasure in reading Yeats's poems. T.S. Eliot attempted to poke fun at readers who want notes by supplying his own for The Wasteland-- but his satirical purpose in providing the notes was undermined by their usefulness and turned Eliot's over-clever objective on its head.With Yeats, many, if not virtually all, can be enjoyed without consulting reference, as well as explanatory, note. I attended UCLA and lived for many years within a few miles of the university, so I was able to take advantage of their library, which by the way is far from comprehensive with most poets, even ( And perhaps especially) Shakespeare.I have taught English at the high school level and most of my students would never bother to search for notes and explications of the literary works we read. And, of course, I didn't want them to rush to the library (or, today, go on-line) to find explications, critical studies etc. Like most teachers I wanted their virtually unalloyed responses to the poems. I still urge using the dictionary and looking up specific time, place, etc. references contained in a poem. And, moreover, I provided them with a few notes that I prepared (using many sources) and that were all they needed to read and understand (and hopefully enjoy) the literature we studied.Still, having railed against notes, I feel strongly that a judicious inclusion of notes is often quite helpful, if not essential, in reading a piece of literature. SEE especially Douglas Bush's notes in the Riverside edition of Keat's Selected poems, which is probably out of print. Finally, and to undermine completely my campaign against notes, I read Geoffrey Hill's poetry often and assiduously, and many of his poems would benefit from meaning, reference and explanatory notes. So rather unhappily and filled with frustration, I must conclude that notes to literary works are often needed."},{"Title":"The collected poems of W. B.

Yeats (The Greatest books of the twentieth century)","review":"The short space that is offered here for reviews is nowhere near sufficient to review the life's works of one of Ireland's and the world's greatest poets. However I must at least try to describe the beauty that is the poetry of William Butler Yeats.Perhaps Yeats is at his finest when reflecting on love, usually unrequited. Yeats manages to produce love poems that have a genuine passion that is surprisingly rare in poetry, specifically that of the modern day. Perhaps Yeats is representative of a type of romanticism that is moribund in modern literature, this is surely a tragic shame.However Yeats' examination of the human condition is not restricted to the romantic. In 'What Then?', Yeats examines the frantic and vain human search for an ultimate meaning or significance. He manages this in a far more poetic and succinct way than many poets who have gone before him. In 'A Man Young and Old', Yeats runs us through the gamut of human experience in a wonderous,yet harrowing manner.These are but a handful of examples of this beautiful poetry that demands to be read by any lover of literature."},{"Title":"The collected poems of W.

As wily as Joyce, as visionary as the Romantics, and with a silvery ear for the language that can only be compared with the likes of Donne, Milton and Shakespeare, Yeats is the greatest poet of the 20th Century, to say the least.

For &quot;The Waste Land&quot; captured a spiritual doubt and hunger that started between the wars and remained with us as a kind of heavy inertia; how can we make our lives meaningful, Eliot asked, and showed us that we have no idea where to start. But now such lethargy seems almost quaint; we don't now doubt what to do, but rather we do and doubt where it shall take us. What if all our global, unified and unifying efforts are taking us somewhere terrible? Yeats's poem &quot;The Second Coming&quot; now seems the true herald of our time.Finneran's edition includes this poem in context, in its order in the development of Yeats's work. Read it as Yeat meant it to be read: followed by his equally great poem &quot;A Prayer for my Daughter,&quot; where he offers hope in the beauty and innocence of personal ceremony.

Whether you call him the greatest poet of the 20th century, or the greatest since Wordsworth, Milton or Shakespeare, his accomplishments are clear.Beyond that, why should anyone buy this edition as opposed to any of the other available? First, the collected poems gives you a sense of his development and interests, not just the highlights of his greates poems. Second, and more importantly, this edition is well-annotated. The notes are thorough without being unduly interpretive--they tell you what an allusion refers to, not how it affects the meaning of the poem. The notes aim to be useful to any reader, regardless of background. As a result, western readers will come across odd sounding notes such as &quot;Jesus Christ is the founder of Christianity&quot; or &quot;Hamlet is the hero of William Shakespeare's tragedy of the same name.&quot; Still, you'll be thankful for such prosaic entries as they explain Irish myth and locate historical allusions.

I literally had this book out of the Amazon box for a matter of hours before the cover started to curl of its own accord, as though possessed by a poetry-hating demon. The paper is low-grade and coarse, with an unappealing brownish tinge.Despite my love of Yeats, I find that I unconsciously tend to keep this book on the shelf just to keep its ugliness out of site, and I am by no means an aesthete.

Perhaps more importantly, I was also younger and more romantically inclined than I am nowadays. His early poetry seemed to possess an airy beauty, sweet in the best sense of the word and reminiscent of his contemporary Tagore. I felt bewitched.Some time later, I read his poems again and felt deceived. They were whimsical, immature, unfinished. I could not understand why he was so highly praised. Whenever somebody told me he/she liked Yeats, I felt an embarrassment. I wondered if I had failed Yeats or if he was the deceiver.However, when I approached him for the third time, I had a strange experience I can only compare with reading Nietzsche. I read a line or two, they seem too simple and crude. I read them a second time, they become opaque. A third time, they yield and I feel as if playing with a caleidoscope. Now at least I am wiser; I know I will be profoundly touched, annoyed and bored in turns, but I also know I will always return to Yeats, because a quarrel with him is better than a constant love for another poet."},{"Title":"The collected poems of W.

It is an experience not to be missed to sit and read his better-known poetry all in one sitting. The beauty of the words and imagery is then much more apparent. Yeats writes a lot about mysticism and the occult, and ancient Ireland comes alive as you read his beautiful words. I read that Yeats, although he wrote poetry all his life, would only put down three or four lines per day. He was such a perfectionist that he wanted to make sure that his lines were perfect. It seems such a tedious procss, but what beautiful words he wrote! His time could not have been better spent than in creating three beautiful and perfect lines per day. His poetry changed as he aged, but it kept getting better and better. His earlier poetry portrayed a lot about faeries and the dream world the he lived in himself when he was young. The lyrics were tuneful and romantic. As he aged, the romanticism changed considerably and his poems were harder-driven with very deep messages underneath the words. These are truly masterpieces, and Yeats comes by his reputation as one of the greatest English writing poets of all time."},{"Title":"The collected poems of W. B.

Yeats (The Greatest books of the twentieth century)","review":"W. B. Yeats enjoyed a long, successful, and productive poetic career lasting from the late Victorian era through 1939. More notably, besides Thomas Hardy and in great contrast to, say, William Wordsworth and Alfred Tennyson, he is probably the only English poet who not only continued to write up until his death but also produced some of his best work in later years. Many, including me, indeed think his last work his best. He wrote some of the most famous poems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and is certainly one of the greatest poets of the latter. His long career, coupled with the many personal, philosophical, political, and other changes he went through, ensured that his work can be conveniently divided into three distinct eras. The first has a self-consciously ornate style heavily influenced by Romanticism and pre-Raphaelite imagery. Some of his earliest works have cosmopolitan subjects, but most of the first era is concerned with Irish folklore and mythology. Yeats had a deep abiding interest in this material and is one of its most articulate and memorable exponents, playing a large role in its becoming an important part of Western culture. His second period is often described as being influenced by younger Modernist poets, but I see little connection between his work and theirs, particularly as he remained wed to traditional forms. However, it is certain that his work underwent a major change. Most obviously, he became more concise, turning exclusively to short, mostly lyrical works at once more direct and more allusive than early writings. These poems have great beauty that can be appreciated on a very simple level but also reveal complex meanings on close study. His subjects also branched out, notably including several great political works, though he retained a strong Irish focus. Yeats' third period may almost be seen as a mix of the first two. He returned to some early subject matter, but the style was more like the second era's. More importantly, his work became more and more personal, even at times confessional - as well as more explicitly sexual, very interesting considering his old age. This shows itself not least in the mystical thought that came to dominate his last few decades. He had always been interested the occult, but many of his poems just before and after his 1925 non-fiction work A Vision are heavily colored by what might almost be called a self-created mythology. Some deride this, finding it intellectually shallow or even simply crackpot, but it certainly led to many interesting and important poems and set him apart.A collected edition is thus ideal for many reasons, his consistent excellence being most obvious. Perhaps no poet is more suited to being read in full, because it brings out several elements that would be overlooked, or even missed altogether, by reading Yeats sporadically. First, despite his three widely different periods, he always focused intensely on a small number of themes, love and Ireland being primary. Second and relatedly, unlike many poets, he is notable for constantly returning to a handful of metaphors - rose, gyre, tower, etc. -, constantly refining and expanding their meaning. It is fascinating to see how his use and understanding of these symbols developed and how their various uses play off each other.There are several widely available collected editions that differ more in presentation than content. This features all the poems Yeats authorized, painstakingly edited to ensure accuracy - nearly four hundred in all over about 450 pages including the short closet drama The Shadowy Waters. As this suggests, Yeats was not especially prolific for someone with such a long career, but he was a consummate craftsman. The poems are laid out chronologically, following the order Yeats set out in his 1933 collected works plus later additions. We thus basically get every Yeats poem just as he wanted them to be read. It is an extremely valuable collection - a veritable goldmine for anyone who loves great poetry, Irish history and culture, or simply great literature period.Whether this particular collected edition is ideal depends on what is needed. It includes many pages of notes with basic information about allusions and historical references. Anyone wanting to know only what one must be aware of to understand the poems will find them invaluable. On the other hand, anyone wanting detailed criticism or biographical exposition will be disappointed, especially as there is no scholarly introduction or biographical sketch. However, even some of the former may be annoyed by the format. The information is given as endnotes without identifying marks in the text. This is great for those without need for notes, as no marks or footnotes clog the page. Conversely, it is extremely frustrating to those who want them, as they must constantly flip to the back without knowing when there is a note. The notes also point out things that are extremely obvious to many people - e.g., \\"Jesus Christ is Son of God in the Christian religion\\" -, but the editor justifies this by saying Yeats has a worldwide audience, and what is obvious to some is not obvious to all. This is true but will hardly lessen annoyance for many. The editor also elects to repeat information rather than cross-referencing, which will also likely invoke ambivalent reactions. There are two appendices: Yeats' notes to his collected poems up to 1933, with further editorial notes, and musical notation for some of his poems that had been scored. The latter is mostly superfluous, the former extremely valuable. There are also indices by title and first line. Finally, it is easy to object to the book's division into \\"Lyric\\" and \\"Dramatic and Narrative,\\" the latter with only about a dozen entries. It disrupts chronology and is also somewhat arbitrary; several poems in each section arguably belong in the other, and only one in the latter is significantly longer than those in the former. That said, this was Yeats' own system.All told, this is an excellent edition for anyone wanting Yeats' poems in one book in a portable, readable, inexpensive format. Font size is ample, making for easy reading and giving plenty of room for annotations. Line numbers are also included. These are luxuries usually only available in expensive editions and greatly appreciated. On the negative side, the binding is quite cheap, and one must be somewhat careful with the book if it is to last through multiple readings over years. However, this is a small complaint for such a low-priced, inclusive edition. Those seeking higher quality paper can easily find a more expensive edition to suit them, but the content itself cannot be bettered, and the value is almost unbelievable."},{"Title":"The collected poems of W.

Power Tools for Negotiating International Business Deals","review":"I rank this book as one of the most important business guides that I have ever read. As a Canadian SME we have been exporting services for over a decade but we had no idea there were so many pitfalls that we could have been our death trap.

Chapters 1 and 2 on &quot;The Basics of International Business Deals&quot; and &quot;Negotiating International Sales of Goods and Services&quot; should be mandatory reading for all your international sales staff. If you need to go beyond that to agency, consulting, distribution, licencing and joint ventures - all the information is there, but you can pick and choose what is important to you. You don't need to read the whole book at once, it can be a long term reference as your international work expands. There are excellent references in the book, so it is easy to find more information.

Yet it has some rather disturbing flaws. Firstly, even though I read the 1998 edition, outdated information from earlier editions had not been updated. At times I felt like I was reading a book describing rock climbing in some parallel universe: Long refers to brands and items of gear not currently in existence (what's a Salewa Antz?) and some recommended techniques (tying into a trad anchor with the rope rather than with slings or a cordelette) are very rarely, in my experience, used. The text often makes references which will prove confusing for the beginner, and would benefit from a better glossary. The 1998 edition also has some sections so full of misspellings that they appear to have been written by a quasi-literate person. In summary, everything in this book is good information, but some of it is not entirely relevant to the way climbing is done today, and some of it is presented in an unclear manner."},{"Title":"How to Rock Climb!, 4th (How To Climb Series)","review":"I'm a beginner at rock climbing and reading this book for instructional purposes.

Yet admittedly, as he clarifies in his introduction, The Nature of God: An Inquiry into Divine Attributes is a reactionary work. Likewise, it should not be considered an exhaustive discussion or review of the topic; he aims to develop a solid response to contemporary and opposing philosophies, of which there is not shortage of supply. A Reformed reader will benefit to know the various facets of this discussion, the pitfalls of certain logical gateways, and the ramifications for an underdeveloped theology.He begins with the attribute of omnipotence, for which he immediately provides a discussion of its definition. Many who ponder the reality of God's omnipotence will suffice themselves to think that God may do anything. At some point or another they will be asked, \\"could God create for Himself a stone which He could not lift?\\" and they will be forced to admit the issue is deeper than appears on the surface. Wierenga explains that the attribute of omnipotence is not contingent on the breaking of the laws of logic. In other words, omnipotence should be seen as utmost ability. God has all the ability and all the strength required to cause any possible affair given the current state of affairs and state of the world.He devotes the second chapter to the issue of God's omniscience, which lies as a foundation for the next several chapters. Wierenga essentially argues an orthodox understanding of God's omniscience: that He knows all propositional facts, believes no falsehoods, did not learn these facts, and did not deduce these facts from previous knowledge. Contemporary philosophers such as W. V. Quine have argued that there are divisions of de dicto knowledge, de se and de re, but Wierenga demonstrates that both are reducible to de dicto knowledge and therefore affirms God's knowledge of all propositions.A great deal of the following three chapters are generated about the topics of free will and foreknowledge. He has laid a foundation for this discussion by now, that in chapter one it was established impossible for both God to force someone into making a decision, and for that person to make the decision freely; and that in chapter two it was established that God does not learn, and thus has knowledge of future propositions just as equally as present or past propositions. Rather than make a compatibilist argument for accidental necessity and free will, Wierenga aims to demonstrate by disproving several common contemporary positions that there is simply no acceptable argument for accidental necessity. In other words, if God's knowledge of all propositions are equally present to Him, there is no valid argument for \\"past knowledge\\" being accidentally necessary for present or future action. He further states that any alternative to this conclusion does not successfully reconcile divine foreknowledge and human free action.More than the idea that all propositions are equally present to God, Wierenga argues for what Francesco Suarez and Luis de Molina described as \\"Middle Knowledge\\"--that God knows not only actual propositions, but also possible ones. He takes on several more contemporary discussions of the topic and describes how the scenario plays itself out in hypothetical worlds, concluding that there must be at least some true counterfactuals to freedom in order to accommodate a world that has both free will and evil. This is true where, as Wierenga describes, propositions \\"(i) God is omnipotent, (ii) God is omniscient, (iii) God is wholly good, and (iv) there is evil\\" (p. 126) coexist and must be reconciled.This is followed with an intriguing inquiry into the timelessness of God. Naturally, the doctrine of timelessness carries philosophical and even logical dilemmas in tandem with the doctrines of immutability and omniscience. This is because the Biblical account of God seems to, at the very least anthropomorphically, reveal that He acts in time. The question then is whether or not this act represents a state of God at one time t that does not exist for Him at another time t1. By addressing key issues in a multitude of contemporary arguments, Wierenga ultimately concludes that the doctrines of immutability and omniscience do not necessarily conflict with the attribute of timelessness, but that a satisfactory argument for or against it has yet to be shown and deserves further scrutiny.Wierenga spends the final two chapters discussing how his theses thus far practically flesh themselves out in matters of morality. Essentially, he argues that God's goodness is a matter of moral perfection and that human morality exists directly by the divine command. In other words, adultery is wrong because God commands us not to commit adultery.It seems that Wierenga does not possess an affinity for labels, for he neglects throughout his many philosophical and logical discourses to strongly posit his position. At the very least, the reader would benefit from a disclaimer of the author's positions in the introduction, and perhaps even a clearer title that suggests an affirmation of Molinist theology. However, it is plausible that Wierenga's intentions were to reach an audience of Reformed or Arminian theologians, or a third audience of uneducated or unconvinced, for whom would be more likely to digest a seemingly multi-faceted and holistic discussion of contemporary philosophical debates. William Lane Craig, himself an advocate of Molinist thought, claims that many Arminians and Calvinists who were previously ignorant to the theology are favorably disposed to it upon discovery.[1]Determinist Calvinist theology forks in one of two directions: either the proponent must be satisfied with the mystery of compatibilism, or else suffer the quandaries of God's seemingly active causality of evil. 17th century Reformed theologian Francis Turretin put it this way:that God on the one hand by his providence not only decreed, but most certainly secures, the event of all things, whether free or contingent; on the other hand, however, man is always free in acting and many effects are contingent. Although I cannot understand how these can be mutually connected together, yet (on account of ignorance of the mode) the thing itself is (which is certain from another source, i.e., from the Word) not either to be called in question or wholly denied[2]Wierenga effectively provides an alternate solution to the determinist Calvinist, suggesting instead an additional step to God's creative process called Middle Knowledge, which relieves some of the mystery and some of compatibilism and provides at least a somewhat coherent answer to the problem of evil.Proponents of Arminianism will find that a Middle Knowledge theology provides ample room for human choice while granting a stronger view of God's sovereignty. Further, many Arminians may find that a Middle Knowledge theology is a natural philosophical progression from their current theological convictions given the admission that God chooses which world to actualize given the knowledge of what it's created agents would choose--either to reject or accept Christ--according to the yield of greatest good. Molinism also maintains God's sovereignty, purporting that God's choice is not contingent on man's free will due to His use of natural knowledge in contrast to foreknowledge.However, the position is not without it's own problems, and Wierenga admits these. His concluding position is essentially that, though there are no pat answers to the ultimate ends of logical analysis to the Molinist position, it is yet more conclusive than the many other positions that have been suggested throughout Christian thought thus far. This conclusion is appropriate given Wierenga's overall literary strategy of process of elimination, which addresses philosophical debates rather than biblical proofs. For a position that is neither entirely supported nor refutable from Scriptural account, it does rely heavily on logical analysis of philosophical concepts. The reader will benefit from his more-than-fly-by analysis of some of the strongest opposing positions. No matter one's traditional position, he will certainly be challenged to think through each of the logical ends of his position.As was mentioned at the onset, Wierenga by no means makes a full survey of the topics. This presents one major weakness: more than arguing for his own theological positions, he argues against his opposition. Likewise, there is plenty of room for further contribution on these subjects, and Wierenga himself invites such scrutiny and believes that each of the topics warrants further criticism. However, The Nature of God makes for a great introduction to the various positions that are available in today's philosophy and is a recommended resource for any interested theologian. The casual reader may prefer to acquire a less academically oriented work for a less technical overview of said topics.Reviewed by Darrin Koehler at TheologyNotebook (dot com)_____________________________________[1] Craig, William. \\"Reasonable Faith -- Molinism vs. Calvinism.\\" [...](accessed November 1, 2012).[2] Turretin, Francis.

Just to see if the book still had legs, I gave it to a teenaged nephew who also thought it great.One of the other reviewers compares him to Mad Magazine...hmm. No. Mad Magazine never had the degree of erudite wit and droll humor that Cuppy provides. But that's fine, chacun a son gout. Here's a passage from his chapter on Lucrecia Borgia, in which he discusses the phenomenon of out-of-wedlock children (the preferred term of the day was 'natural children') of whom the Borgia family had a bunch:\\"Lucrezia was born in 1480, four years after Cesare, a natural son of the same parents. While they were at it, Rodrigo and Vannozza had a couple of other natural children, Giovanni and Goffredo, who never amounted to much. Rodrigo had quite a few more by various lady friends whom I have been unable to trace with any degree of accuracy. He probably couldn't do it himself.All children are natural, but some are more so than others and are therefore known as natural children. These appeared in large numbers during the Italian Renaissance, that great flowering of this and that, when men began to awaken to the possibilities of life as it might be lived if you went right ahead and lived it. Inevitably, natural children were soon popping up all over the place. This tendency among the Italians of that period may well be called the Spirit of the Renaissance.\\"Now humor is admittedly a personal thing. I personally found that passage to be snort-milk-out-your-nose funny, but your mileage may vary. If you don't find it funny, don't bother buying the book. If you don't buy the book, though, you'll never learn such fascinating facts as the Greeks had a nickname for Pericles--\\"Squill Head\\"--because his head was shaped like a sea onion. They also called him \\"Cone Head\\" --and this was a couple of millenia before SNL.If I were forced to choose only a hundred books for a desert isle, this would certainly be one of them.

The facts are correct and the voice of the author is tart and comedic. I have purchased several of these books for friends and family for Christmas just because I'm a GREAT Santa.

Cuppy's use of footnotes to provide the 'punchline' to many of his wry jokes is genius. His humour never grows tiresome, and pulls the reader through the book, which will be devoured quickly. It's nice to be reminded that many of our cultural and historical heroes and heroines were, at their core, human beings. Oh, and DON'T LET THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT PUT YOU OFF!

Biting and sly, he pokes fun at many of the greatest people in history.He starts in ancient Egypt and quickly works his way through to Greece, the Middle Ages, on and on throughout the ages without a single dull spot. He is less outright-laugh-inducing than such comedians as Dave Barry or Gene Weingarten; rather, his wit is more likely to elicit snickers and &quot;hee hee&quot;s rather than belly laughs.Perhaps the only flaw in this glorious work of humor is that sadly, Cuppy never finished it.

This book is organized into miniature stories of the demise of individuals commonly found in history textbooks and popluar lore. At times, Cuppy expands on the story we already know with some interesting anecdotes but he also exposes some real shockers and wonderful stories you cannot easily find elsewhere. It would have been nice to see all of the references as this book could have been a great research tool, but it ends up serving as a neat, quick read that is honestly more entertainment than scholarly. This is not necessarily to say I didn't like the book (I did), but it is obvious it was made for a specific niche market.

But this thing, this beast, this pretension of a book? What drugs are you on? I'm giving this book two stars because Mr. Cuppy manages to use English language and grammar in a reasonably literate fashion. But, please, talk about thuddingly ham fisted. If you like the fey humor the New Yorker dishes up on a bad day; if you like inscrutable comic rhythms such as the old NBC Dave Letterman show had with Brother Theodore (come to think of it, the new CBS Dave Letterman still has inscrutable comic rhythms) this might be for you but to me Mr. Cuppy's droll little footnotes and attempts at tongue in cheek humor are just insufferable. E.g., \\"I heard different.\\" \\"It goes to show you never know.\\" \\"Pronounced Chumley.\\"??? Oh, dammit, I'm ROFLMAO! Not!

Mr. Cuppy is the most under-rated of all American writers in this century, because he wrote humor, and especially because so much of his humor is dry and requires a little thought on the part of the reader. (This last requirement doubtless is fatal for the sales and popularity of any book.) Will Cuppy's secret was to read ABSOLUTELY everything on a subject, known and obscure, and then write an essay of 1 to 5 pages about it. He knew how to skewer pretension, academic pedantry, and indeed all the excesses of the academic community better than any other writer. While he was at it, he also had great skill at exposing the foibles of his famous subjects.

The author makes free use of dubious sources for many of the people he writes about, but he does give a general historical overview of each person AND he is VERY funny. This is a good book for reading aloud to a friend or family member. (Again, though, it helps if the person to whom you are reading is also fairly well versed in history.)"},{"Title":"The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody","review":"This is a fantastic book for anyone who enjoys, educated humor. Since history is my passion, I've found this book -- accurate, entertaining, and sharply witty -- to be a wonderful method of reflecting on serious courses in a different light. And yet those who dislike history lessons can expect to enjoy this too, from what I've heard. (Plebeians. ::cough::)For those with a good sense of irony, sarcasm, and very dry humor, Willy Cuppy's comments (and the funny, tangential runoff of his writing, found in the footnotes of every page) feel almost tailor-made. There's a sense of very personal humor, as though you're party to a running monologue with this writer, in some warm room somewhere with burnished leather easy chairs.It's just sad Cuppy didn't get the acclaim he deserved within his lifetime."},{"Title":"The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody","review":"I must have read this book twenty times at least, and I never get tired of it.

His wonderful dry comments are hilarious, as on Charlemagne who was born in the dark ages when people were not very bright. They have been getting brighter and brighter ever since, until finally the are like they are now'Or on the American revolution , started because the colonists had to pay takes to which their consent had not been asked ' today we pay taxes but our consent has been asked, and we have told the government to go ahead and tax us all they want to.

This is laugh-out-loud humor for the educated. This book is totally irreverent towards everything but the truth -- and even though it was written in the 1940s, it remains fresh and timely: Cuppy does not show us the builders of Western Civilization as heroes nor as villains, but as people who got into some very funny stuff (in all senses of the word). As soon as I discovered Cuppy I knew I had to get as much of his material as I could get my hands on -- and he has never disappointed me. Brainy and funny, this is an author deserving of being much better known."},{"Title":"The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody","review":"I wish Will Cuppy had written 100 books.

Not that his own stuff is bad (I could accept bioengineering), but it IS his, not Burroughs'. Still, it is the one place you can find pretty much all the nit-picky, only-fans-would-care stuff in one place.

The book looks to be out-of-print now, but I don't know that it's been superseded by anything better and you can easily get it used cheaply here or elsewhere.The book is organized into several chapters, each of them offering a guide to various aspects of the Barsoomian world created by Edgar Rice Burroughs in 11 books published from 1912-64, and all previously published in magazine form. I think the chapter format works fairly well, given the small paperback edition that I believe is the only way this book was published, though I tend to usually prefer a strict alphabetical \\"encyclopedic\\" format in such exercises. In any case, the chapters are:I - A Brief History of pre-Carter BarsoomII - A Geography of BarsoomIII - A Biography of BarsoomIV - The Flora and Fauna of BarsoomV - Measurements on BarsoomVI - The Languages, Religions and Customs of BarsoomVII - A General Barsoomian GlossaryVIII - Quotations, Proverbs and ExpletivesIX - Barsoomian Science and InventionX - Through Space to Barsoom?XI - \\"Edgar Rice Burroughs\\": A Brief Biographical SpaceThere are maps in sections II, though they are just simple hemispherical ones with little detail, and aren't well reproduced and are too small to be terribly useful. Similarly the illustrations scattered throughout by Neal MacDonald are really lovely, but just don't come off well in this format. I would have liked to see a chronology of the events in the books included in section I. Section XI is a bio of the \\"Edgar Rice Burroughs\\" to whom most of the stories in the books are told, with asides about his activities involving Tarzan, David Innes, Carson Napier, etc. It's rather amusing (the \\"real\\" Burroughs of the books is last heard from in 1969 at the age of 114!) and puts one to mind of Philip Jose Farmer's \\"Wold Newton\\" concept, stitching together all kinds of fictional characters with vast lifespans into one consistent literary universe. The other sections are all reasonably complete, I think; few if any characters or concepts of any importance in the series aren't touched on.On the whole then, small problems in part having to do with the cheapness of the mass-market paperback production aside, a valuable book for all Barsoomian fanatics and Burroughsians."},{"Title":"A Guide to Barsoom","review":"If you have ever raced over the dead sea bottoms of Barsoom (Mars) in company with the fighting Virginian, John Carter, and have (like me) collected, read, and reread all eleven books in Edgar Rice Burroughs' fictional account of life on Mars, \\"A Guide to Barsoom\\" should be the twelfth book in your collection.

It is written with illustrations on every page making it a lot like a comic book. It is very well done and detailed and this reviewer suspects it would be appealing to a young crowd who has an interest is science. It appears that it may also inspire and interest in science. The explanation of how evolution works and how integral to science this theory is, becomes the strong point of the book.The fact that the authors proclaim that once evolution and natural selection is understood, the reader would have to abandon all religious thoughts. While that seems obvious to me it may imperil this book from a wider audience. Given that there are many people who understand and support the theory of evolution and maintain religious idealogy simultaneously I think the book may limit its audience to the \\"choir\\".A better book would explain the theory, the obvious conclusions that sensible people see as a result of that theory and let the reader (student) decide for themselves whether this requires or negates a supreme being."},{"Title":"Introducing Evolution","review":"I am a fan of books like 'For Beginners' series, which combine art and facts for a beautiful and fun introduction to a subject. However, I found \\"Introducing Evolution\\" (Introducing series) okay, not that great. It had less words and information, and more pictures. It also smacked of promoting a sense of 'atheism' rather than evolutionary science. Not a bad book, but not a great one either in my opinion."},{"Title":"Introducing Evolution","review":"This is one of the best books I have read on evolution. I bought the book day before yesterday, and believe me - I finished it in one sitting; I literally glued. If I could I would have given the book 6 star.What I liked most of this book was the author covered philosophical aspects of theory of evolution and cutting edge theories concerning evolutionary psychology, evolution of culture, altruism and moral sentiments or even evolutionary robotics in addition to provide a basic idea on biological evolution. He quite convincingly established why Darwin's idea (evolution through natural selection) can be compared as \\"Universal Acid\\" (proposed by Daniel Dennett) and how Drwin's \\"dangerous idea\\" literally pushes Willium Paley's God literally out of window. I know many will be uncomfortable with the bold approach of the author, (just as one of the previous reviewer who gave one star) but hey - accept the reality! We can indeed explain our existence and complexities in living things by the theory of natural selection! Laplace truly uttered, we do not need that (God) hypothesis (anymore)!!!!I basically agree with Steven Weinberg (American elementary particle physicist; Nobel Laureate of 1979) who said, Biological Evolution refutes the idea of an interested God much more decisively than physics does. And this is only because of Darwin and his Universal Acid - theory of evolution thru natural selection.Novice readers, who have not started reading evolution yet, can try this. This book will be real fun to read. Bonus is Howard Selina's excellent artworks."},{"Title":"Introducing Evolution","review":"I found the explanations and basic/simple stories in this book very amusing and helpful.

Professor McCluskey draws upon her years of experience and expertise when she was formerly the director of the Black Film Center Archive at Indiana University to present a series of movie posters for the 'race movies' that were a part of cinematic history from the late 1920s through the early 1940s when African-Americans were largely barred from mainstream Hollywood productions (except for stereotypical roles as maids, butlers, and comic relief characters), necessitating independent and small budget productions featuring African-American casts. Posters were a widespread means of advertising and promotion, designed to persuade members of the public to buy a ticket and see the film publicized by the images depicted in the poster material. \\"Imaging Blackness\\" shows the steady evolution of how African-American men and women were pictured on those posters in incremental changes that paralleled the discrimination and slow progress of change of the broader American culture. A fascinating approach to film history that accords with vigorous academic standards of scholarship, \\"Imaging Blackness\\" is an especially recommended addition to academic and community library African-American Studies and American Film History reference collections and supplemental reading lists."},{"Title":"Imaging Blackness: Race and Racial Representation in Film Poster Art","review":"A must have for any collection of film and African American book collection."},{"Title":"The Expositor's Bible Commentary (Volume 10) - Romans through Galatians","review":"Let me start by saying that I have owned the full 12-volume set for about a year and use it quite frequently as a resource. I've used this particular volume as a reference, but have not taught through a book using this commentary yet. However, as there seem to be no competent reviews on the set as a whole, I did want to add my impressions of this terrific resource.I can say that I'm very satisfied with my purchase of the 12 volumes in this set. Every portion has been quite helpful, and this is an amazingly simple and inexpensive way to assemble a good library of commentaries on the entire Bible. Obviously the commentaries are not as thorough as one may find in other series, such as the excellent (although not yet quite complete) \\"New International Commentary on the New Testament\\" or a similar series. However, for most Christians who teach or lead small groups in their churches, this set can serve as a great resource to get started with, and one that can easily be supplimented with specific volumes that treat a book of the Bible in greater depth as those books are needed. Additionally, this resource can be more useful than a larger volume in situations where one is interested in looking at a few chapters of scripture at a time, or where one just needs to understand what a verse or two might mean. Thanks to the very clear and practical verse by verse organization, it's a terrific tool to do just that.Also, I will add that (at the time of this writing) it should be possible to buy the entire set for around $150 or less, so I would suggest shopping a bit if you plan to purchase all 12 volumes.Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"The Expositor's Bible Commentary (Volume 10) - Romans through Galatians","review":"This is a great study guide to the understanding the scriptures and increasing my understanding of the Bible for use in discussions and teaching."},{"Title":"The Expositor's Bible Commentary (Volume 10) - Romans through Galatians","review":"Promptly sent, very kind customer service, books are in great condition and look fabulous!

Afterwards he was sentenced to death for assassinating two prisoners for collaboration with Americans. His death sentence was changed on review from Washington, but his life was inexorably changed. He was finally released only after he had found God and was to became a Seventh Day Adventist pastor. It is a story of terror, horror, defiance, courage, betrayal, despair and finally redemption and absolution. I heartily recommend this book to anyone but especially to those Marines who fought on Saipan. At last, a human face on the fierce enemy. I hope Sharon Fujimoto-Johnson brings us more like this!Originally published in 1998 in Japanese as Jigoku-no Niji, it is a gripping read and well written. The translation must have been difficult, but Sharon Fujimoto-Johnson managed to retain the emotion, excitement and one of the best personal descriptions of warfare I have seen. You can almost feel Saburo's terror as he saw the American armada offshore. It is strange for me to feel terror of Americans especially knowing from Marine accounts that those boys heading in on the landing craft were just as terrified. Finally, the close and intimate telling of his discovery of Christianity is inspiring!As a personal aside, it is enlightening to read of this famous battle from the Japanese side. I have long been fascinated by that last great banzai charge on Saipan. Banzai charges served the Japanese army well in China as it did western armies through WWI but against Marine firepower they turned out to be slaughters. They continued as a Japanese tactical measure until Saipan. At Iwo Jima and Okinawa they were dropped in favor of a defense in depth that proved much better from the Japanese viewpoint and much much worse for the Americans. This story about Japanese youth on Saipan mentions the banzai charge only in passing but brings new light to it. In this case, the banzai charge here was less a tactic that a sad, desperate last attempt to die for the emperor and some four thousand were successful."},{"Title":"Rainbow over Hell: The Death Row Deliverance of a World War II Assassin","review":"A Japanese youth, Saburo Arakaki, is the subject of this World War II story. He became a student on Saipan when the war engulfed him. Loyal to the emperor, and to Japan, he joined the military and fought with intense hatred against the Americans. Many times he faced death, but somehow managed to escape. When the tide of war turned against the Japanese all hope died for Saburo. He must die rather than allow his enemy to take him prisoner.Near the end of the war, he found himself standing at the edge of Suicide Cliff. Dead bodies lay broken on the rocks below. Despair seized him. A light rain began to fall and in the mist a rainbow took shape. Could there be any hope?Finding out that the war had ended, Saburo and his group of gorillas surrended. Later, the fact that Saburo had murdered two of his own countrymen, because he thought they collaborated with the U. S., was discovered. He was sentenced to die. Eventually, his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in Hawaai.Heartsick and bitter, he wondered why his life had been spared. An American Japanese brought him a pamphlet in his native tongue that he eagerly read. Gradually, his bitterness drained away until he found his enemy's God and surrendered to him. Not only did he become free emotionally, but miraculously and literally free!This book RAINBOW OVER HELL, By Tsuneyuki Mohri, Translated by Sharon Fujimoto-Johnson, demonstrated to me that those we often classify as enemies, are people like ourselves. I ask myself, Is it possible to love my enemy? Needing to be honest, I must answer, Yes, by God's grace. Obviously, God loves us all!Don't read this book if you want to keep your prejudice. However, if you choose to lose it, you will benefit by this graphically written account.Betty L.

This touching true story is both timeless and meaningful, regardless of race or religion as it tackles hatred, suffering, betrayal, despair, and ultimately, forgiveness and peace.\\"Rainbow over Hell\\" is a two-fold story. First, be deeply moved by this first-hand account of one of the bloodiest battles in World War II - Saipan, Japan. Experience what Saburo Arakaki endured, a young civilian thrust into the life of a soldier during a horrific attack. Taste his fear, flee with his exhaustive endurance, and fight with his nationalistic heart. Witness his ultimate crimes against another human being and then cry at his betrayal as this young boy's innocence is lost. Later, witness the total transformation of his soul - from deep-seated hatred to loving forgiveness and learn that the peace so desperately sought after can eventually be achieved. Finally and many years later, Pastor Saburo Arakaki comes full circle when he returns to the scene of his tumultuous past.The second part of this two-fold story is a message of faith and hope. \\"We may experience many forms of hell in life but a ray of hope always pierces through.\\" The atrocities endured for a time cannot last forever and more is awaiting the sufferer after their trials are over. Saburo's multiple brushes with death only strengthen the case that he was meant to do and to be so much more. Divine love conquers all.Fujimoto-Johnson brilliantly maintains an array of strong emotions while recounting this life-changing story. \\"Rainbow over Hell\\" will not only appeal to history buffs but to those in need of loving encouragement: \\"there is always a rainbow, somewhere...\\" The original Japanese version has been credited with saving a man from suicide and for bringing many to Christianity. This new translated version is just as powerful.Award-winning author Tsuneyuki Mohri and translator Sharon Fujimoto-Johnson shine as they team up to release \\"Rainbow over Hell\\" in English. Extraordinarily touching and uplifting, even for those not interested in history or accounts of war, this beloved Japanese story will tug at the heartstrings and bring hope to the hopeless. \\"Rainbow over Hell\\" adds glorious color to lives of grey.Book received free of charge"},{"Title":"Rainbow over Hell: The Death Row Deliverance of a World War II Assassin","review":"What an AMAZING story! I would reccommend it to all. We so often hear the stories of WWII from an American point of view, I was facinated to read this from the point of view of a Japanese civilian. It is NOT an anti-American story. It tells of the realities of war and the power of God to bring peace from all the horror. It really hit me that God forgave me and DIED in MY PLACE. My favorite quote from the book is, \\"Believing himself forgiven by God, Saburo, in turn, forgave and succeeded in breaking the cycle of hatred and revenge that leads humans to war against each other time and again. Saburo was a mirror of God's forgiveness.\\" If you enjoy this book you may also enjoy, \\"The Unlikeliest Hero.\\" The story of Desmond Doss - the only non-combatant to recieve the Medal of Honor.

Later, Plain Talk Publishing, Des Moines, Iowa, also printed this same book.NOTE that the oblong picture shown on Amazon as a choice of books is misleading.The picture of a table with a kerosene lamp between two banners for Aladdin lamps,is simply the inside page of this 1971 book. Or one of it's repeated printings.Note that it is published by Wallace-Homestead Co.and that the picture that shows the content pages end at page 168.Courter had continued to vastly research Aladdin lamps and their history,and gained so much additional informationthat he separated the two categories of electric and kerosene.The end result became two books that are basically the 'bibles' of Aladdin electric,and Aladdin kerosene lamps.They are as follows:Courter's SECOND book published in 1987 is \\"Aladdin Electric Lamps\\".The front cover of this book pictures ONLY electric lamps.These 229 pages were published by Plain Talk Publishing, Des Moines, Iowa.This book is 8 3/4\\" wide x 11 1/4\\" tall x 3/4\\" thick hardback.This book covers many facets of collecting Aladdin items,but mainly focuses on Aladdin electric lamps.For now, out of print.There have been 5 price guides, numbered 1 to 5, as companions to this book.The latest is #5, from 2006, 5 1/2\\" x 8 1/2\\" 47 pages.

One or two essays are mediocre at best, one or two are great, and the rest fall somewhere in between. I find Haraway unreadable, the ultimate in academic hype (write enough gibberish and people will think you're a genius), and the interview with her isn't much better, but fortunately she isn't the whole book. Hartouni's thoughts on reproductive discourse are worth reading, and Penley's piece is great -- it revealed a really nifty subculture I'd never realized existed in addition to clarifying just what it was about Mr. Spock that made him so desirable to men and women alike. Overall,I thought this was a fun book to read, although I don't think it'll ever achieve classic status."},{"Title":"Technoculture (Studies in Classical Philology)","review":"Collected under the theme of technoculture Constance Penley and Andrew Ross have collected various case studies circulating around the promises and threats, facts and fictions of contemporary technological culture.

In many regions of Latin America the informal urban economy is often the main form of economic activity in the city streets and shanty towns where economic activity is not controlled by law or taxation.J. J. Thomas challenges the popular argument that the informal sector economy is desirable in order to provide a breeding ground for entrepreneurs, by examining what is actually happening in the urban informal sector. Addressing key themes such as the debt crisis and structural adjustment, poverty, gender, children, social protection, housing and the future of the urban informal sector, and framing the study within the context of present developments in the Latin American economy, this text provides a succint and accessible introduction to the subject.--- from book's back cover"},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"Mr. Shannon shot out of the gate with this one, and if I hadn't already been familiar with his work, this one would have made me seek more out. I love the tone and feel of this book, and it truly is a wonderful homage to the books of that era and genre. Just know what you're going in for, and settle down and get it. Then move on to the next Shannon piece. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"Welcome to Two Trees, Nevada...or more appropriately, welcome back.This is the very type of tale that brings me back to the years of puberty in upstate New York. While some, maybe even most boys my age were hiding tattered copies of Playboy or Penthouse underneath their mattresses, I was one to hide scary, gory stories my mother would have never approved of. Like any doting mom, she'd have confiscated Shannon's \\"Night of the Beast\\" just as assuredly as she would had she found porn.Night of the Beast is a great roll in the hay of those memories. The characters are unique and vivid; the main theme might well be ascertainable but is told in such a way as to be timelessly enjoyable.A dark and seething story, Night of the Beast is a truly entertaining read, one most suited for a dark and stormy night. Full of evil, yet full of hope, join the successful yet lost soul of Peter Rourke as he is inexplicably drawn back to his roots in this withering Nevada town from the allure of Los Angeles.Salvation he may well find, but not before confronting an ancient and timeless evil that has survived dormant for decades. Driven and surviving on past bloodshed and insanity, this evil with a name will once more rise to mar the landscape of Two Trees, and the only thing existing to stop it is Rourke...and an eight year old ally.After all: \\"The Lord doesn't waste His time checking out those who haven't got much to offer.\\" (Quote is from The Night of the Beast)"},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"When I read this book this spring, I planned on taking my time and using it as something to keep me busy on a week long working trip back East.

While not original, it a marvelous story of &quot;coming home&quot; and personal redemption. It's also an homage to the pulps of earlier years and this is where it shines.I was drawn in right from the start and the characters are very nicely developed. There is the requisite amount of scares and gore but done in such a way as to enhance the story. Frightening, dark, and just the right amount of humor.

It's more fun than the colorized version of 'Night of the living Dead' on Halloween. In fact, like all the 80's classics, it quite nicely walks that slender line between sly homage and genuine barn-burning horror. It also has some serious spirituality sneaking around in it, but nothing so heavy-handed as to interfere with the good-humoured, intense storytelling. Hey, 'Night of the Beast' would make one [heck] of a movie (pun fully intended). It is morbid, horrifying, emotionally moving, fast and at times even laugh-out-loud funny.

I am very sad to say that it was just that: hype. I am shocked at all the the great reviews for this book. I have never posted a review of a book before but could not hold back warning readers about this one.I found the book to be totally unreadable. I only got to page 50 before I talked myself into thinking that the money I spent on the book was well worth not having to finish it. I found the writing dilettantish, with an overall lack of flow and continuity. I will concede that: a) perhaps 50 pages is not enough to judge an almost 400 page book, and b) &quot;campy&quot; is not my thing. Believe the reviews that say this book is cheesy and pulpy. It is, but unfortunately not in a good way.I have heard nice things about Mr. Shannon, and would still give some of his other works a try. This one was just not my cup of tea -- make sure it is yours before you purchase it.(For those interested: books that do live up to the hype are Jack Ketchum's THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, Ray Garton's LIVE GIRLS, and F.

Nolan, Ed Gorman, etc. I'm about 30 pages from finishing it (the only reason I'm finishing it is that I paid good money for it) and have got to say it's just about the worst book I've read in the past couple of years. I read probably an average of 100 books a year, so that's saying something. The writing is juvenile, almost childish. Dialogue is hackneyed and unrealistic. Metaphors and images are inappropriate and strained. Characters placed (literally) on-stage are totally stock, practically caricatures, and wouldn't even make it onto the script pages of the worst B-movie you could possibly imagine. Character development is practically non-existent. Motivation is non-existent. Jump-cuts from scene to scene are totally arbitrary and bear little or no relation to each other. Character interactions are forced and wooden and make Pinocchio's relationship with Gepetto seem an ideal of familial interaction. I mourn the number of trees that were sacrificed to the production of this abomination."},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"A great novel. Give it a try and you won't be disappointed. It had me on the edge of my chair throughout the read. If you want a good horror novel, look no further. And don't listen to these negative reviews where people are personally dissing the novel. Just a bunch of jealous YA HOOS. You can still pick up a Laymon or Ketchum novel as well, but why not take a chance on a great new author.We love ya Harry!"},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"Great thriller, the kind of page-turner that keeps you up way past bedtime.

Could a new author pack the punch this promised?Oh yeah. Mr. Shannon kept true to his promise. He grabbed me from the start. I found the action true and momentous. The dialogue was fresh, but hinting at MacDonald noir. The settings were well described. Whether Hollywood or the Desert, I had no doubt he knew what he was writing and I felt placed within each.Just the right amount of gore, ennui and love. Mr. Shannon's writing is a great blend of pulp noir with post modern pacing.Yeah. I definitely liked this one."},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"Harry Shannon writes his first novel as if it were going to be his last. We've got everything here: a serial killer, a psychic, a demon, vampires...you name it.

I can't wait to read Shannon's later works."},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"Harry Shannon's Night of the Beast is a return to those great books we all used to read late at night huddled under the blankets with a flashlight turned on. It's an ensemble piece, which is difficult to write (well). The characters here really come to life, and Shannon's lightning fast pace never lets up or flinches for a moment.

Harry Shannon's story of murder, ghouls and antiheros in a small desert town is nothing short of mesmerizing.

This is horror \\"pulp\\" at it's finest! I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"Having received Harry Shannon&#65533;s Night of the Beast and also having heard so many good things about it, I picked it up yesterday and I&#65533;m about 100 pages from completing it. I had little doubt that I&#65533;d like it, as so many astute readers and authors have praised it.Sacred Indian Grounds and Ancient Evil are just about the hoariest clich&eacute;s in the horror field. Right up there with bloodsucking vampires. In Night of the Beast, Harry Shannon proves that there are no tired ideas or genres; only poorly executed ones. Which excludes this fun book. Harry obviously loves the genre and this story could have come up in the glory days of the mid 1080&#65533;s. A burnt out songwriter flees LA to his boyhood home, where something seems to be VERY wrong. Many of his old friends are still there, and they are glad to see him, but strange things are happening to them.No, this isn&#65533;t a blazingly original plot, but Harry clearly states in his introduction that Night of the Beast wasn&#65533;t intended to be. It is a labor of love and is intended to be a lot of fun. Does he succeed? I&#65533;d say, YES. I&#65533;m enjoying the hell out of NotB and I heartily recommend it to those old enough to remember the old days and also to younger readers who are just looking to have a great, scary time reading a pulpy novel. The pages fly, but not at the expense of the characters, which is really where the heart of this novel seems to be. I&#65533;ve said it again and again, that&#65533;s what great fiction is all about; the characters and whether we care enough about them to keep reading until the end. Harry Shannon has assembled a lovable assortment of small town eccentrics that keeps this novel&#65533;s pace going strong.If I had to compare Night of the Beast with any other author&#65533;s works that I&#65533;ve read, I&#65533;d say Rick Hautala or Joseph Citro or even Bentley Little. I even see a bit of early Stephen King in these pages.If one cares enough to look for these things, I see Night of the Beast working on different levels as well. It appears to me to be about redemption and exorcising personal demons from our minds and our past. In his intro, Harry is pretty forthright about the hurdles he had to overcome during the long passage of this book&#65533;s struggle for life. I get the feeling that even had this novel never seen publication, it would have been remarkably therapeutic for the author to create.However, Night of the Beast did see publication, from a small press horror outlet. That&#65533;s very nice, but this book deserves more. It would be a perfect entry in Leisure Books&#65533; line of paperback titles. Even before I&#65533;m actually finished it, I can tell it&#65533;s a lot more engaging than some of the Leisure Books I&#65533;ve read in the last couple of years."},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"One of the best things about Harry Shannon's book NIGHT OF THE BEAST, is that he is supremely adept at drawing the reader into their own memories while a character goes through the same. One of the earliest examples of this occurs when a character comes across a dead dog and recalls his own childhood experience with a mangy mutt and the perfect little girl who helped him care for the animal. In the short space of two pages, Shannon plunges your emotions on a roller-coaster ride of happiness, excitement, love, heartbreak, and agony - and that's just one simple flashback! Throughout this fine book, Shannon weaves a tale of horror - yes - but this book is also a masterpiece of human condition. The intricate and interesting lives of several characters coincide beautifully, producing a scary page-turner reminiscent of the great horror novels of yesteryear. This is a multi-layered book that reaches into the hearts and minds of all readers, leading them along a twisted maze of chills and excitement. Don't miss this excellent read by one of horror's brightest new stars."},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"Harry Shannon's &quot;Night of the Beast&quot; is proof positive that a well-worn genre like horror fiction can be infused with fresh life. This one jumps off the page, gripping the reader's imagination and never letting go. And at the same time, it transcends the genre, becoming much more than just a thriller. Harry Shannon is easily the equal of Stephen King. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"Not being one who usually reads horrors/thrillers, when Night of the Beast was recommended to me, I hesitated to read it. Needless to say, I found myself drawn into Harry Shannon's small Nevada town and the characters he has created. From start to finish, I was enthralled,and I read the book quickly and voraciously. Night of the Beast is a book I highly recommend, especially to all those out there like me, who usually steer away from this genre. Read it. You'll definitely be taken in as his story unfolds, and as the truth is revealed, you'll learn something about the darkness we all have lurking within."},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"This book is thrilling terrifying. And, it doesn't just scare you while you are reading it. It sneaks up on you later when you are driving around or doing the dishes. Very creepy. Shannon threads the horror elements through such a richly constructed and identifiable world, it's hard to leave it behind when you put the book down. I'm still trying."},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"This is an interesting and well written book. I read the book in a week, which is fast for me. I thought the characters were very well developed and the story moved along at a quick pace.The atmosphere the author sets up through the novel is great. This is a no holds barred horror novel. I found it an unperdicatble fun read.If you are looking for new authors to try out I would recommend giving this book a try. It is Shannon's first novel and in my opinion shows alot of promise. I have already bought his second book and plan on starting that one soon.I am always trying to find new authors of horror fiction to read. the most recent ones I have tried were Bentley Little and Douglas Clegg. I found Shannon to be a far superiour story teller to these two writers.Check this one out."},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"Harry Shannon must have loved those 1980's horror novels as much as I did, because with Night Of the Beast he pays great respect to those old books, taking what was great from the good ones and winking at the bad ones.Night Of The Beast has all of the plot elements you would expect to find from horror books from that time period; supernatual entities, monsters, vampires, hell, just about all sorts of creatures in a plot loaded with multiple plot lines and enough characters to fill up a church on Sunday morning.And even though it is a tribute to those old novels, Night Of The Beast is the real deal...it's thrilling, scary, and just as importantly, a lot of fun to read.So, If you love reading horror that doesn't try to force it self on you with scenes that are meant to gross you out, or uses extreme violence or hardcore sex to get its message across, then give Night Of The Beast a shot. It earns it horror credentials the old fashion way, with great atmosphere, excellent characterization, and some pretty darn good plotting."},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"Don't pass this one up nor any of Harry Shannon's books. This is a monster of a book; a thrill-ride that can't be topped by the best amusement park. Read it if you dare! Read it in one sitting!"},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"I bought this book in the hopes that I'd be able to revisit the old pulp horror days when horror novels made the hair stand on the back of your neck. It didn't. Night of the Beast didn't make the hair stand up, it plucked them out, attacked my dog and snarled in my face before beating me across the head and shoulders with a table lamp.This scared the bejesus out of me.Get this book if you want to have to sleep with the lights on for the next couple of months."},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"There is a bright new voice in horror fiction. His name? Harry Shannon. Author of the great collection Bad Seed and of numerous short stories (ALL OF THEM GREAT, I have to add), Shannon's first novel does everything except disappoint. It is a horror tour de force that brings you back to what horror is all about; being scared and having one heck of a great time!An evil force settles over a small American town, taking every citizen in its thrall. This evil thrives on bad dreams and nightmares, on fears and sadness. It plays with your mind in the worst of ways, making you see and experience your most darkest, inner fears.It is up to Rourke and a few other citizens (like Maggie, the young woman who steals Rourke's heart and her brother Michael, Timmy, a little boy who's family is about to be touched by the evil, and the Sheriff himself, a man who's demons are too powerful to withhold) to try and put a stop to the strange things happening all around them. But how do you fight an evil that can't be seen? An evil that gets you when you least suspect it?Night of The Beast is classic horror at its best. But the most surprising thing about the book is how Harry Shannon is able to take you right into these characters' minds, to make you feel and experience everything they feel. It's a rare thing to find a horror book where the writing seems to be singing to you.Night of the Beast does for this small town what Stephen King did to his Castle Rock. It is a story with dozens of characters, all of them believable, all of them completely real. Their lives become entangled in this nightmare, up to the final, amazing finale that will leave you breathless. Don't read Night of the Beast in the Dark. Or better yet, do!

With this kind of talent, the guy is bound to break through at any time."},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"A rocker stomper funfest for fans of traditional pulp horror ala the 1980's. I bought this with a lot of suspicion because I had been over-hyped, but the danged thing almost lived up to every word of the substantial advance praise. REALLY FUN, and more than worth your time and money. Seems like a real contender for a Stoker nomination in Best First Novel and it deserves it. Don't walk, run and get yourself a copy. My wife and I read it aloud to one another and LOVED the sucker."},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"Geez Louise! I can tell a difference like night and day between Harry Shannon's debut novel here and Night of the Werewolf, his second novel, which is a far cry better. Night of the Beast was written for the most part early in Shannon life at a time when he had problems with drugs and alcohol.....and this book shows it. I got about 140 pages into this turd and tossed it aside....permanently. The characters seem like paper cut outs rather than nicely developed characters. The supposed \\"Beast\\" in this book is not even frightnening or scary and doesn't even really show any of its mayhem until over half way through the book. The book is just plain boring and suffers from poor writing. However, like I mentioned previously this was his first effort during a bad time in his life and is excusable considering he wrote the awesome Night of the Werewolf. I give it 1 star because of all the hype surrounding it. I can't wait to read his newest and 3rd and final in the series Night of the Daemon, which will be out in a few weeks. I guess I should clarify something since I didn't know it until I had started reading the second book. I always thought trilogy meant sequels between interlinking stories that have mostly the same characters. I guess I was wrong. This trilogy is not interconnected and can be read out of order. In other words parts 1, 2, and 3 having nothing to do with one another. This is part of the reason I was disappointed with this book and apprehensive about reading Night of the Werewolf. I thought all of the tales would connect together into one big hellacious grand finale. Boy was I wrong! Avoid Night of the Beast like it contained the Bird Flu. This title should have been reprinted and retitled and called Night of the Mare. Because thats exactly what it gave me trying to drudge through it. This book is a prime example of practice makes perfect....or at least makes you a better writer if you try and try again. Now go out and find a copy of Night of the Werewolf and preorder Night of the Daemon(I think it'll be good) and enjoy! Wait a minute! You can't preorder it because its.....SOLD OUT! If it ends up sucking I'll sell you my copy."},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"I'd read and enjoyed quite a few short stories by Harry Shannon, but now I've finally gotten around to reading one of his novels. I don't know why I waited so long--this is a very compelling story, with great characters and a fully-realized small town where the horrors all converge.The author is a therapist in real life, so as you might expect the characters are realistic and sympathetically drawn--which makes it all the more involving when you just *know* that bad things will happen to most of them. This novel's plot burns on a slow fuse, which is something I like very much in a horror/suspense novel: the sense of dread builds very subtly as the book moves forward. And when things explode, it's a huge, satisfying payoff. I'm really looking forward to the other novels in this series (which I hear are even better!)."},{"Title":"Night of the Beast","review":"I really wanted to like this novel, but found it hard to. It seemed to just plod along. Maybe it was because I just read 2 Simon R. Green novels immediately prior to reading this novel, but is just seemed to crawl.

At that time as a middle school student, I experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit while I was in the prayer meeting in the end of the day of Church summer training. At the right time, I did not noticed what had happened to me and I could not understood God was trying to talk to me. Around 10 year later since then, I was able to pray every day morning to receive answer for my desperate life problems, and during my praying time, I came to convince that God have been continuously trying to speak to me. God showed his evidences so that I may not ignore His voice and signs any more. Samuel , the author of 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, could answer to God after 3 times of God's call. But for me it took more than 10 years. Before I read this book, I myself had similar experiences as the Mrs. Joy wrote in this book. I was not sure what is the exact spiritual meaning is. Before I read the books of Mrs Joy, I made progress in the knowledge of the Spirit day by day very little. And as a result. I start to undertand a little part of spiritual things described in bible, by Jesus, Paul, prophets of old testament. The slow speed was majorly because I did not make enough memo and prayer concerning the all things which was happened to me.

Like many writers, Joy does not fully express the fullness of scripture. On one occasion, she quotes James 4:7 -- as \\"Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.\\" as an act of fear (love, awe) of God. However, she omits \\"Submit yourselves therefore to God.\\"... as the full quotation. Hence, James 4:7 reads \\"Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. (ESV)\\" WE SUBMIT TO GOD.....(God's Holy Spirit enables us to)...RESIST THE DEVIL. On many occasions, I find her long winded stories extremely unbelievable. She makes herself out to be HOLY-GHOST-JUNIOR. So often Preachers and writers try to paint themselves as to be so in tuned to God that they stretch even their own experiences as well as their own imaginations. These characters have infested every church in American. Their are several in my church. They have the intellect, but not the heart God seeks. IF YOU LOVE LONG DRAWN OUT (UNBELIEVABLE) STORIES, \\"Intimate Friendship with God: Through Understanding the Fear of the Lord\\" is ripe for your reading. If you desire a more Biblical, more stable (more believable), more concise and soul reaching book, I would recommend \\"The Joy of Fearing God\\" by Jerry Bridges. He has a Study Guide and a text.

Co-authors, Ashok Wahi and Veru Narula, tease the readers with their own multidimensional curiosity of theological discussions.This unparalleled and unique story speaks to today's troubled society, and awakens mankind to the concept of non-violence through yoga's Vital Breath.I highly recommend this book to lovers of yoga and the new age society, and to all those trying in their own way to unravel the eternal truth. Fellow readers, just follow the plot and then enjoy the the mysticism, the magic and most importantly - the message.\\"The Vital Breath\\" poses that centuries old question - \\"Do you believe in the equality of the human soul?\\" With asounding insight, this novel answers this very question in an unimaginable way.I definitely rate this as a \\"five stars\\" exceptional book. Please note that you can visit their website to preview the first four chapters.A must read."},{"Title":"The Vital Breath","review":"I loved this book, and I interviewed Ashok Wahi for the Hillsborough Beacon in New Jersey. I retain the rights to the article, and here it is partially reprinted and edited for brevity:*************The Vital Breath interweaves the lives of four dynamic young people from different religions and moves back and forth from India in 1857 to America in the years that immediately follow the World Trade Center bombing in 2001.The four religions explored are Sufi Muslim, Judaism, Hinduism, and Roman Catholicism.\\"These are four different religions; four different karmas,\\" Mr. Wahi said. \\"If they can come together and find the commonality of tolerance for other's beliefs, then everything seems to fall into place.\\"Historical events are recounted pitting Palestinians against Jews, Muslims against Hindus, and outlining cultural differences throughout time. Two pairs of lovers must come to grips with their differences, and they do so through yoga. In 1857, one couple's love is cut short, while in the 21st century, they are, in a sense, given a second chance.However, you must read the book to discover how all this comes about.[Mr. Wahi explains] that the [main] inspiration for the book is the trip he took to India upon the death of his older sister. Thoughts and conversations turned toward reincarnation, and people bound by love (soul mates).He even stayed in Khalsi, the Indian village in which the story begins. Mr. Narula lived in New York City, and the two authors drew on their combined experiences to write the book.\\"We conceived the story part of it together, and then we divvied up the research,\\" Mr. Wahi said. \\"I concentrated on Hinduism and Yoga, and he went toward Islam and Judaism. We were exchanging thoughts all the time, and every day we uncovered elements of similarity that we had not known existed in the various religions.\\"Throughout the book, there are themes of reincarnation, breathing and yoga and their effect on the soul and spirit, and above all - acceptance. The question posed to the reader throughout the book is \\"Do you believe in the quality of the human soul?\\" The authors ask that question and then give concrete reasons why the answer should be - must be -- \\"yes.\\"\\"This book poses that one question to the entire mankind, and I want the media to talk about it, I want the writers to talk about it, I want the people to talk about it. It's a question one has to pose to himself. If you believe in the equality of the human soul, why would a Muslim be revengeful to a Christian, and vice versa. Or why would a Muslim be so revengeful to a Hindu, and so on?\\"There is obvious symbolism in the book and its packaging. The first 444 introductory copies printed pay homage to the 444-day hostage situation in Iran that took place beginning Nov. 4, 1979.The release date for the book is Sept. 11, and the list price is \\"USA $14.92; Canada $17.76,\\" which are significant dates in America's history. A wedding between two characters is planned for July 4, a meaningful date in America's quest for independence.In deference to the World Trade Center bombing (Sept. 11, 2001), Mr. Wahi stressed the practice of non-violence.\\"All mainstream religions preach non-violence,\\" he maintained. \\"Violence is the coward's way out. It is not a strong person's way out. To be violent, you have to have a plan, you have to have money, you have to have dynamite, but to be non-violent, you merely have to do nothing except love, and loving is as natural as breathing.\\"Ah, the \\"vital breath\\" ... What is it really? If he had to summarize the vital breath in one word, it is \\"love,\\" and he said the best place to learn it is through yoga.\\"Yoga teaches the value of breath,\\" Mr. Wahi said. \\"\\"How can we breathe 24,000 times a day and not even think about it? Elsewhere in the world, someone else is breathing the same air we breathe, so we are all connected. And each breath is reincarnated through the process of nature. When you lose connection to the vital breath, the world is in chaos.\\"According to Mr. Wahi, breathing is not just inhaling and exhaling. Hindu prophets and the teachings of Buddha, as well as most major religions, have stressed the importance of breathing, and even in the Bible, God breathes life into Adam.He also speaks of tolerance: \\"The idea that people should believe what we believe is triggered by our own ego; the belief that we are right,\\" he said. \\"We are all of one essence. We should not be judging others, but rather judging ourselves only.\\"Bob Paulson, one of Mr. Wahi's partners in the publishing division of Princeton Design Group Inc., is the lead publicist/marketing manager for the book. He said the book's targeted audience is aimed at new age women, yoga lovers, and \\"anyone with an open mind.\\"\\"I don't like yoga; I couldn't do the lotus [position],\\" he said, laughing. \\"I couldn't even pronounce some of the words, but after reading the first few chapters, it touched my heart. It's an amazing book.\\"***************As for my own views on the book, I loved it, but some of it was very cerebral. You have to think about it if you want to appreciate it on its many levels. On a basic story level, it deals with finding one's soul mate and true love.However, half the fun of reading the book is finding the parallels between the characters who live more than a century apart, for on a deeper level, \\"The Vital Breath\\" is about reincarnation and second chances.Through yoga techniques, both couples meet, live, and discover \\"the vital breath.\\" Messrs. Wahi and Narula incorporate yoga techniques with gentle lessons about the value of embracing other cultures and religions for all time.This book is a wonderful way to discover \\"the vital breath\\" within all of us, for we all have the capacity to find it.The beautiful descriptions and the tremendous insight into the characters' thoughts and feelings is well worth the read.

As such, it has attracted attention from development practitioners, economists and politicians. Disappointingly, most books on the subject can be best described as infomercials - rarely do they go beyond success stories of happy women in brightly coloured clothes who are now running home enterprises. But practitioners know that there is far more to microfinance than simply providing loans - just as there is far more to development than simply pouring money into a country. There are pitfalls to microfinance: it can crowd out local business, it can catapult poor people further into poverty if incorrectly adminstered, and there are a host of governance issues surrounding it.This book provides a comprehensive analysis of the economics of microfinance, as the title suggests. It is a technical book: it expects a high level of economic understanding, but it synthesises a vast amount of information on the subject and communicates it succintly. This is without a doubt one of the best technical economics books I have read - and I have read an awful lot of them.I've given this book to my PhD students working in this area as essential background reading before they commence research. I commend this book to any economist or development practitioner who is interested in the economics behind the stories and photos, who want to find solutions that will really catalyse economic development, who want to see successful projects implemented and who want to learn from the expertise of others to make sure they do the best for their clients."},{"Title":"The Economics of Microfinance","review":"Microfinance is one of the newest strategies for development and Princeton economist Morduch takes a look at how it impacts societies. While he only looks briefly at the social issues he makes several compelling economic arguments for why we should consider microfinance as a viable option. The book is very well written although I think it does leave out some of the long term structural and institutional changes that need to be addressed. This is a field where new research comes out every day but Morduch's book is likely to be a staple for a very long time. This is a must have for anyone studying microfinance and will be for a long time to come."},{"Title":"The Economics of Microfinance","review":"Microfinance is most famous as microlending, whose most famous representative is Bangladesh's Grameen Bank. Grameen, and its founder Mohammad Yunus, won a Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for their aid to the poor. The idea, with which most people are probably familiar, is that the bank loans some of the world's most destitute people small amounts of money -- $100 or less, typically -- for some vital bit of capital. Borrowers might use the money to buy a sewing machine, for instance, which they can then use to produce far more clothing than they had produced by hand. Grameen's default rate has been remarkably low -- \\"the poor always pay back\\", to use the phrase from Grameen II.The economic logic here is actually revealing as a study of what's unspoken in economic logic, hence how misleading economic postulates are. \\"All else being equal\\" (such a magical phrase), the first bit of capital that I get will yield more benefits to me than the second bit. Assuming I'm rational, I will spend the first money I get on more-productive capital, then spend subsequent bits on less productive capital. That is, the marginal returns to capital are decreasing (or at least nonincreasing). Hence, if I'm a rational bank and all else is equal, I should be more willing to lend to the poor than to the wealthy: I'll get a greater return from lending that little bit of capital.Needless to say, that's not how it works: Citibank is in no rush to lend to Bangladeshi farmers. Why not? Obviously it's because all else is not equal. Among many other things, Citibank relies on the vast infrastructure provided by advanced capitalist economies: before they loan to me, they check with credit-reporting agencies that have a special competence validating people's reputations. Those credit-reporting agencies can follow me around because I was born with a number, namely a Social Security Number, which I can't escape from without some work. Hence the infrastructure beneath me makes it hard for me to default on a loan without other banks noticing. This infrastructure is missing from Bangladesh. Consequently, the cost of gathering all the necessary information about a loan applicant is much higher -- transaction costs per dollar of loan are astronomical if the loans are administered in the way that Citibank specializes in.Grameen handles this in a novel way, for which they're justly famous. It's called \\"group lending\\": in Classic Grameen, they loan to groups of five people. If any one of the applicants defaults, the others are forbidden from ever receiving loans again. The informational burden is transferred from the bank onto the applicants.Can't those five people conspire to default on loans together? Yes, they surely can, and here we run into another difficulty of the classic economic picture. If they cut and run on a loan, they could run to another microlender and get another loan -- and so on for as long as they want, so long as the microlenders don't share information. The more microlenders that service a given area, the more challenging this problem becomes. So competition actually works against microlenders here, by making collusion possible. To solve this problem, microlenders need a set of institutions that make validating reputations less costly. Credit-reporting agencies would help, as would the whole arsenal of Western identity policies. Which isn't to say that those are the only systems that will solve microlenders' problems, by any means; just as group lending is a novel approach to the developing world's specific problems, so we might expect them to land on different solutions to the reputation problem.The Economics of Microfinance is filled with interesting discoveries like this. It starts with a less-developed form of microlending, namely the Rotating Savings and Credit Association, evolves through group lending, and discusses where Grameen and its ilk (BRAC et al.) are today. Most interesting for me was microsaving, as opposed to microlending. The poor often need savings accounts more than they need loans. Indeed, they are willing to receive negative interest rates on their money, just to ensure that the money stays in a safe place. Armend&aacute;riz and Morduch give a remarkable example: in certain rural villages, savings collectors will offer to take money out of the villagers' hands, hold it for a time, take a fee, and return the now-smaller pile of money. Presumably this negative interest rate is less negative than the alternative, namely theft or neighbors begging for a loan. Microsaving is most often used to keep money away from husbands, according to Armend&aacute;riz and Morduch. Indeed, microfinance generally is most associated with rural women; they constitute an overwhelming percentage of Grameen's (and other microbanks') client base.By the end of the book, however, it's not clear that anyone can quantify the value of microfinance programs. Would those who participate in microfinance have done just as well without it? To gauge the actual impact of microfinance, one needs to answer that sort of counterfactual -- which is, for obvious reasons, difficult if not impossible. There's also a problem of what we're modeling: if we're trying to quantify, say, small-business growth before and after the introduction of a microfinance program, that's one thing, and is relatively easy to answer. If we're trying to measure empowerment of women, that's quite another, and it's not at all clear that we even know how to start measuring that. Should we measure it, for instance, by the rate of reported domestic violence? Empowerment may increase reporting rates. It may also cause a shift in the balance of power at home, which may increase violence.The difficulties are manifest, as Armend&aacute;riz and Morduch are well aware. The great virtue of this book is that it doesn't shy away from pointing out areas of ignorance and future challenges.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Economics of Microfinance","review":"The first three chapters lay down the causes and characteristics of market failure in the finance context, give economic explation fot them, and describe the history of microfinance. I found Chapters 4 and 5 (\\"Group Lenging\\" and \\"Beyond Group Lending\\" respectively) extremely useful for applied contract theorists.The word \\"microcredit\\" refers manly to lending. In Chapter 6 (\\"Savings and Insurance\\"), the authors introduce another concepts: savings and insurance. In the following chapters to the end, they go on to various issues such as gender and goverment subsidy.Overall, the book is an excellent survey of microfinace as it is. Yet, it lacks a big picture, especially regarding the future of microfinance. Whether the human society can keep microfinance on the sound truck will probably matter in the first order sense to how much human beings as a whole can prosper in the 21st century. My own guess is that key to the success will be a good combination of self-interest and sympathy to others, which is exactly the spirit of Adam Smith."},{"Title":"The Economics of Microfinance","review":"It is well-written in a way that it present the materials clearly in words and in mathematical formula.

The book requires some knowledge of economics and econometrics, but most of it can be read and understood even with just the kind of background a good econ undergraduate will have.The field is developing quickly, and so there are already several contributions which are not covered (see e.g. work that folks such as Dean Karlan and coauthors are doing), but overall the coverage is excellent for what had been done until the publication date.Those who think that micro-finance is \\"clearly\\" the way ahead, and that its history has been only a history of great successes, will find some surprises here. I do love the idea underlying micro-finance, but it turns out that some of the media hype is not supported by careful studies.Still the field deserves to be studied, and this book is a highly recommended overview, which will also give you plenty of references to deepen your knowledge and to identify area that need research."},{"Title":"THE GORGON - and Other Beastly Tales: Anna Medea; Meow; The Hunting of Death: The Unicorn; Magritte's Secret Agent; Money's Stagger; Sirriamnis; Because Our Skins Are Finer; Quatt Sup; Draco Draco; La Reine Blanche","review":"One of my most cherished books, &quot;The Gorgon&quot; was my first taste of Tanith Lee's talent.

Goodbye!!\\"The witches fly to a beach shack that's \\"damp and moldy...full of sand and spiders and ants\\"...and \\"smells of wet old towels,\\" says Lavinia. \\"It's adorable!\\" But the witches can't leave bad enough alone. Wanting to make absolutely sure that Emma et al. are \\"miserable,\\" they fly back and dump bags of wet sand on her and her friends. Emma's feline friend looks directly at the reader and says, \\"I say we ought to get even, if you catch my drift.\\" With the help of her friends, including some newly recruited geese, and a shopping bag full of items bought by Emma, the victims fly to the beach to \\"get even.\\" They manage to convince Lavinia and Dolores that there are poisonous jellyfish in the water (a -be-speckled goose with a straw hat confirms this), that they need to cover themselves in \\"anti-mosquito cream\\" (sold, of course, by one of the geese), and that a very dangerous sea monster is after them.While this may seem a little mean-spirited, Stevenson's casual illustrations and lettering, and his usual absurd resolution (aided by the somewhat unbelievable gullibility of the witches) give a fun, light tone to the story. The story is best when Emma and her friends band together, and, with the most meager of resources, show what some imagination and teamwork can accomplish (on the next to last page, Stevenson explains just what Emma bought). While I didn't enjoy this as much as books in his \\"Grandpa and Wainey\\" series, Stevenson again shows his winning, offbeat sense of humor in this clever and enjoyable story."},{"Title":"Emma at the Beach","review":"James Stevenson's books are great!

He encouraged Dalys all over the world to send in details of their family trees to be published in this very detailed work. It is about 568 pages, bound in dark green hardcover with b&w photos and some large fold out pedigrees of the Irish branches of the family e.g. Dalys of Raford, Dunsandle. The chapters are arranged by Irish county and by country across the globe, and includes details of the ancient poetry and other writings written by the (O')Dalys who were the most famous medieval poetic family in Ireland. The book was published privately through Tuttle, Morehouse & Taylor of New Haven, Conn., USA and is quite rare. Copies are available in some central libraries and a new reprint is available through a company called CafePress for about $65 but I have not seen it so cannot comment on its quality. I would say the book appeals to a rather small group of people wanting to do detailed research into the history and genealogy of this surname (originally O'Dalaigh) which dates in its modern form from the 12th century."},{"Title":"What Makes Us Catholic: Eight Gifts for Life","review":"I picked up this book and initially LOVED the preface about a young man who had grown up in a traditional, Boston-Irish-Catholic family. He \\"automatically put down Catholic\\" when asked his religious preference on a hospital form but questioned whether that really held any meaning for him. When questioned why he didn't just put \\"no preference\\" or skip the question, the young man answered, \\"Aw gawd, I could never do that. And what if something went wrong during the operation? ... Yeh never know, yeh never know.\\"This rang so familiar to my own story:I grew up in a Boston-Italian-Irish-Catholic family. (Redundancy?) My parents were non-practicing, so I never had a very good sense of what it really meant to be Catholic. I attended CCD and sometimes went to mass with my girlfriend in high school (who had to get a bulletin to prove to her mom she had been there!. Then I attended Catholic universities for undergrad and grad school, studying art history. Through art history, I was introduced to many of the saints, stories, and rites celebrated in the Churhc. Later on, I married a German-Catholic man from Ohio, who went to Catholic schools his whole life. We now have 2 sons, who attend Catholic elementary schools. Through them I have gained not only the saints and stories, as before, but also a genuine joy of the spirit of the mass of thanksgiving.Now, my friends and family back in Massachusetts think of me as the \\"religious one\\" in the family. They have recently begun to come to me to ask questions that are very difficult for the average lay person to answer. They seek answers because they have lived, for the past 20 years in a culture which informs them that they \\"don't need to go to church to be Catholic,\\" they \\"don't need to go through a priest to confess to God,\\" they \\"don't need to\\" be Sunday mass-goers to be good people,\\" and they are \\"more spiritual than when they attended mass.\\" Now they ask me about the significance of Confirmation, about Annulment, and about the Church's stance on many issues. They are conduits of years of prevalent anti-Catholic misconceptions such as that which supposes our statues and rosaries are superstitious symbols. The old Boston-Italian-Catholic or Boston-Irish Catholic families have wandered so far from the Church, they ask what it REALLY means to be Catholic? In fact, 14% of people living in the North East list \\"no religious preference\\" when asked their religion.Thomas H. Groome seems to have his finger on the pulse of the spirituality that lapsed New England Catholic seek. I loved the examination of the roots of \\"Catholic\\" to \\"katha holos,\\" meaning \\"gathering in the whole,\\" or \\"all are welcome,\\" conferring an inclusion (rather than a universality) of the Church. I appreciated some of the chapters on Living as Graceful People, Taking a Sacramental View, Getting Together for Good, Mining the Treasury of Scripture and Tradition, Loving Beyond Borders, and (most appropriately for my purpose) Growing a Spirituality for Life.On the negative side, I agree with other reviewers that the author tends to insert his very untraditional opinions in places. He not only mentions the future possibility for women to become priests but makes a serious plug for the income tax! Personally, I found the whole CHAPTER on \\"our\\" politics completely inappropriate for a book about \\"what makes us Catholic\\" and was disturbed that he used this outlet to further his own political agenda.In all, I would consider the below book, Rediscovering Catholicism, a better read.Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star"},{"Title":"What Makes Us Catholic: Eight Gifts for Life","review":"I was recently talking with someone who had read Thomas Groome's WHAT MAKES US CATHOLIC. She said \\"I did not recognize the Church in this book.\\" While this may sound like a good reason not to purchase the book, it was actually a ringing endorsement. This woman was recently returning to the Church and it helped her realize the richness of her faith, a faith that has been tested, and in recent years marred by scandal, but none the less a faith that at its best mirrors Jesus Christ.While Groome himself is a professor of theology and religious education at Boston College, the work is not a catechism of sorts. It does not explicitly talk about what the Church teaches, but how the Catholic faith can shape a person. Groome focuses on eight areas that affect the lives of Catholics: grace, the sacramental way of life, community, scripture and tradition, social justice, reaching out to others, and spirituality. In each are he focuses on hat it means to live each of these areas, which for a Catholic is essential, since the Catholic faith is one that is based on lived experience (contrary to what some may think). Her also uses the gift of Catholic imagination, so much a part of Catholicism, but often neglected. The end result may be a Catholic faith that is not instantly recognizable, but if one looks through history and the way in which many Catholics live today, it is a Catholicism that is real and very much a part of human life.The book was first published in 2002, just as the current scandal in the Church was making the headlines in newspapers across the country, and throughout the world for that matter. For many who read Groome's book at that time, it was a reminder of what the Church has to offer and why it needs to be saved. This alone makes the book a gift to the Church. From a spiritual point of view, it is a great book to re-infuse a person's faith and give it a fresh perspective. Catachetically it is a great book to be used in RCIA programs. It is a readable book that will be an important resource for years to come."},{"Title":"What Makes Us Catholic: Eight Gifts for Life","review":"This book was a joy to read. Groome &quot;unpacks&quot; several key defining characteristics of the Catholic faith, including the sacramental view of God as present in the world around us, the thirst for social justice, the need to recognize and include people of all cultures. This book is a wonderful synthesis of what makes Catholics Catholic, and even though I was familiar with these ideas before reading the book, I found Groome's thoughtful explanation of each characteristic in its Scriptural and historical context to be particularly enlightening. Very refreshing was his empowerment of the laity to actively live their faith,and he offers many practical ideas on how to do so. Groome is also very honest about times when the Catholic church has fallen short of its own ideals, both in the past and in the present day, but the overall message is one of hope: the Holy Spirit is continuing to move throughout the Church and, as was stated at Vatican II, &quot;as the centuries succeed one another, the Church constantly moves forward toward the fullness of divine truth.&quot; This book is truly a refreshing drink for a thirsty soul."},{"Title":"What Makes Us Catholic: Eight Gifts for Life","review":"Welcome to a celebration of what makes Catholicism beautiful. Boston College Theology professor and religious educator, Thomas Groome presents \\"What Makes Us Catholic: Eight Gifts For Life\\" as a passionate declaration of the Catholic spirit. This book attempts to describes eight distinctive emphases he says are shared by all Catholics, from Ted Kennedy to Pat Buchanan, from pop-star Madonna to Mother Angelica.The book began in response to a quip in a bar. \\"Maybe you should write a book about that -- what it means to be Catholic, even after you've left the church\\" (xiii). \\"What Makes Us Catholic\\" is a book for those people of God who have hung up their rosaries and stopped attending Mass, but who have not left the spirit of Catholicism. The author describes his audience as ranging from the devout to the alienated, radical reformers to defenders of the status quo; from liberal baby-boomers who feel that Vatican II has been betrayed to conservative Gen Xers who wonder what the boomers are whining about. Groome suggests that today people don't disagree with the Church, they ignores it. While Groome is an engaging thinker with strong credentials, his all inclusive vision will probably not be well appreciated by conservative readers.Groome begins by asking the \\"Big questions\\" of human existence, and then organizes the responses which have been drawn from the depths of Catholicism's rich legacy. Sacramentality, community; justice, an appreciation of human potential and fallibility; a reverence for tradition, universal care, a Catholic imagination, and a faith-based spirituality that permeates every day are the eight attitudes or qualities that mark the Catholic Christian. Each chapter begins with a personal story illustrating the particular way of thinking, which is further explained in the chapter. Sewn within the warm narration are reflection questions. Each chapter then concludes with suggested practices to exercise that particular quality of faith.Groome presents what he sees as the best of the Catholic tradition, downplaying the hierarchy and emphasizing aspects he finds more palatable to contemporary tastes such as the Church's affirmation of all great religions and inclusiveness. Catholic Christianity is marked by an overwhelmingly positive attitude toward the human condition and the world. Life is to be celebrated and enjoyed, cherished and defended. The Catholic faith insists that people are essentially good, drawing a contrast with the Calvinist emphasis prevalent in America which stresses our totally fallen nature. Because it is free of religious jargon the book will not intimidate those who feel they have little theological background. It would be an excellent discussion starter for adult education programs, faith sharing groups and youth retreats.It is written for those who are searching for essential values, for people who, if it really came down to it, might want to put their faith to work. \\"What Makes Us Catholic: Eight Gifts For Life\\" is for those who treasure their Catholic heritage even though they don't practice the Catholic faith as they should. Sensitively written with an ecumenical spirit this book should appeal to non-Catholic readers and practicing Catholics as well."},{"Title":"What Makes Us Catholic: Eight Gifts for Life","review":"This book should not be considered an authoritative guide into \\"what makes us Catholic\\". Rather, this seemed to be one man's personal, watered- down Catholic opinions. He does not echo or boldly state the Church's teachings, which is invaluable toward the end his book's title suggests. I wanted a book that would help me delve deeper into the beauty of being Catholic. I was sorely disappointed."},{"Title":"What Makes Us Catholic: Eight Gifts for Life","review":"This author is soooo ambiguous on what it means to be Catholic that at points it seems he does not even want to be catholic. He misses the mark. In fact, i don't even think he is aiming at target. He quotes dissenting authors and Protestants on how they see Catholicism. The only time he capitalizes \\"Church\\" is when he is talking about both Protestants and Catholics together holding hands- pg. 9. His discreet language at times is misleading on what the church really teaches. he also keeps bringing up the church killing \\"millions of witches.\\" this is just historically wrong. he has a revisionist history of almost every time period in church history, promotes women's ordination, and following modern scholarship on the Jesus of history and the Christ of faith. i bought it used and it was still a waste of 4 dollars and a couple hours of my life. i can't believe this guy is a professor. sad."},{"Title":"What Makes Us Catholic: Eight Gifts for Life","review":"Groome's new book on the Catholic community could also, it seems to me, be a portrait of the ideal 'catholic' community: that is, the Church, wherever it finds itself, behaving as the koinonia it was intended to be. The Church is a beloved community, an event more than a place, in which the Holy Spirit unites humans with one another and with God in bonds of love that then radiate outwards to embrace and heal the rest of the world. In reminding Roman Catholics of their essential witness, Groome has reminded Christians of all denominations of their essential calling.How different the world would be if catholics (Roman and otherwise) took seriously the proclamation that God is present in the world, thereby making the everyday holy and properly eliciting forth from us reverence and awe, a passion for social justice, and such a deep-seated joy in the &quot;little&quot; (sacramental) things of life that our consumerist mania would drop by the way! Groome's book aims to help us recapture this vision. His anecdotes, prayers, exercises are helpful rather than maudlin or pietistic.A very good book for Lenten meditation, but an even better one, I suspect, for Pentecost: what better time to reflect on the true nature of Church and koinonia? Highly recommended."},{"Title":"What Makes Us Catholic: Eight Gifts for Life","review":"What Makes Us Catholic? by Thomas Groome is a book that is being read by many in our diocese at the suggestion of diocesan leadership. A book that is promoted to such a wide variety of Catholics and is recommended for formation and discussion groups should be faithful to and respectful of church teaching. Groome's book does not fit either category.The author negatively portrays most Catholics as struggling with the Church and it's teachings. The over use of inclusive language in this book is very cumbersome. When I went to the index to find how Groome handled different \\"hot\\" topics I found references to statements like these:(p.102) It would appear that the Western church is insisting upon celibacy and maleness for priesthood at the expense of people's access of Eucharist - so central to Catholic identity and spirituality.(p.114) There can be problems in making an argument from nature to favor society or social arrangements. For example, there has been much gender and racial bias in how the dominant culture has interpreted \\"nature.\\" As late as 1880, the Massachusetts Medical Society argued that women were unsuited \`by nature\\" to be physicians. This is not unlike the argument that the Catholic Church still makes against women becoming priests.(p.263) \\" Catholics can have an air of know-it-all, acting as if ours is the only and completely true faith, replete with all the answers. Surely, this is more the sin of pride than a truly catholic spirituality. Some of the hubris is encouraged by a teaching magisterium that typically sounds absolutely certain in its pronouncements, as if faith is no longer a \\"leap\\" and all can be assured. The joke rings true that when the Catholic Church finally agrees to ordain women, the pronouncement will begin with, \\"As we have always taught...\\"There was no attempt made to present the Catholic Church's point of view. These statements give us a glimpse of the author's attitude toward church leadership/authority.The book has good points but it looses its credibility when statements like the above are made. I cannot find justification in recommending a book that is unfaithful to church teaching. The author is a master storyteller. It is too bad that the stories tend to be negative toward the church. One review I read actually stated, \\"However, despite the author's claim that he writes for Catholics \\"who span the spectrum,\\" his views may alienate more conservative members.\\" The reviewer is right. Where are the stories of life long Catholics who love the Catholic Church and have a respect for the authority of the \\"Keys,\\" as given by Christ to His Catholic Church? Where are the stories of protestant clergy converts who study their way into the Catholic Church not because it is one of many good churches but because it is the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic church.Wanting to end on a positive note, I would like to recommend Matthew Kelly's book, \\"Rediscovering Catholicism\\" as one that will help us to love, live and better understand what it means to live out our treasure filled Catholic faith."},{"Title":"What Makes Us Catholic: Eight Gifts for Life","review":"I just finished Thomas Groome's &quot;What Makes Us Catholic&quot; and found it to be worthwhile reading. Groome describes a good priest as one who 'companions people like a soul friend and serves the community's spiritual hunger through Word and Sacrament... enabling the gifts of all to work well together--with &quot;holy order&quot;.'Primarily, though, the book is about each person's call to holiness, regardless of station in life, and how our Catholic faith assists us in that life long journey.I've added to my &quot;to do&quot; list Groome's suggestion of writing a personal foundation prayer or morning offering as described on p. 202.A soundbite for this book would be &quot;choose for life for all&quot;."},{"Title":"What Makes Us Catholic: Eight Gifts for Life","review":"I purchased this book, before I really knew anything about Catholicism. When I entered the Church last year, from the Anglican church, and actually studied the Faith objectively, I began to read this book. The author is a classic cafeteria Catholic, picking and choosing various teaching and discarding the rest. Take for example this statement: \\"Remember too, that there are three major expressions of Catholic Christianity, each with it's own distinctiveness - Anglicanism, Eastern Orthodoxy and the Roman communion.\\" There are a numble of obvious blunders here in light of what the Church really teaches. 1) Anglicanism is not recognized by the Catholic Church as an \\"expression\\" of the historic Church, but rather an \\"expression\\" of the English Reformation, caused by Henry the VIII who placed himself as head of the church in 1533 resulting in excommunication. After this time, Protestant influences made it necessary for the Church to officially refuse recognition of Anglican sacraments. 2) Eastern Orthodoxy (big O, as opposed to Eastern Rite orthodox Catholics in full Communion with Rome) is not recognised as an \\"expression\\" of the Church's full unity, due to the schism of 1054 resulting in their excommunication. Unlike the Anglican church, however, Orthodox Sacraments are recognized because they were not affected in any way, shape or form from Protestanism.There are other comments such as how terrible it is we have no women priests. Jesus Christ was a man. Christ breathed on 12 Apostles giving them authority......they were all men. Sure, there were women disciples of Jesus who followed Him faithfully, but they were not included among the 12 Apostles which God Incarnate bestowed authority, and was passed down through Apostoloc Succession. Therefore, I'm afraid the author is out of his league. Christ is the Revealer, and we are His humble mail carriers. Peter Kreeft, professor of philosophy at Boston College says it well: \\"we do not have the right to edit God's Mail.\\" and that includes this author. Beware of the labels, for there is only one Catholic Faith. There isn't, as the author suggests, a \\"liberal\\" Catholic, or \\"Conservative\\" Catholic, but only \\"Catholic\\" Catholic. As the Redemptorist Fr. Pablo Straub says: \\"Jesus didn't say on this Rock I will build my debating society.\\" Those attempting to change the Church of Christ, the Catholic Church, into a relativistic debating platform such as this author, need to at least have enough respect to give the Church the last word on Her objective stances. The author has failed in this regard."},{"Title":"What Makes Us Catholic: Eight Gifts for Life","review":"I bought this book because the nun that teaches religious classes highly recommended it when I was asking alot of questions.

It reminds us that each Catholic is an integral part of the Church (body of Christ)."},{"Title":"What Makes Us Catholic: Eight Gifts for Life","review":"This book reads very much like a previous one he wrote, although this is much shorter. Groome approaches being Catholic from the usual approach theologians do, the anthropological one. Here, as in the previous book, Groome updates Catholic language and speaks of a Catholic world view in terms of prayer, justice, relationships, etc. His ideas concerning church tradition are interesting He does not believe that the magisterium belongs exclusively to the hierarchy. He encourages lay people to seize it, too. He asserts that this tradition is developing. This is an easy book to read for those with a background in theology. A neophyte could also read this book with interest."},{"Title":"What Makes Us Catholic: Eight Gifts for Life","review":"After several generations of Catholics have received sloppy to bad instruction in the Faith, it's sad that authors like Groome are reduced to adopting a lowest-common-denominator approach to defining Catholicism. Simply put, there's more to being a Catholic than simply calling yourself one.What ought to \\"make us Catholic\\"? According to the Catholic Church:You need to strive to know, love, and serve God the Father through His Son Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit (Jn 6:27, 17:3; 1 Cor 8:3; CCC 1).You need to commit yourself to being a disciple of Jesus Christ. Since Christ continues to act in the world through the Church with which He is one body, Catholics believe complete discipleship involves adhering to Christ's Word as presented in the teachings of the Catholic Church (Eph 4:11-16).You need to follow the teachings of the Church. This means assenting to all that the Magisterium (the pope and the bishops united with him) teaches as true concerning faith and morals and, by God's grace, living accordingly (Mt 18:15-18; 2 Thess 3:6; CCC 150, 892). To his disciples Christ said, \\"Whoever listens to you, listens to Me. Whoever rejects you, rejects Me. And whoever rejects Me, rejects the One who sent Me.\\" (Lk 10:16) The Magisterium carries on this mission. When the Magisterium teaches, it is Christ teaching us through it.You need to receive Christ's grace through the sacraments. This includes receiving the sacraments of initiation - Baptism (Acts 22:16), Confirmation (Acts 8:14-19), and the Holy Eucharist (Acts 2:42)); the sacraments of healing - Reconciliation (Jn 20:21-23) and Anointing of the Sick (Jas 5:14-15)); and those related to the particular vocation to which God is calling you - Holy Matrimony (Eph 5:31-32) or Holy Orders (1 Tm 4:14)). The sacraments are visible, effective signs of Christ's invisible action (CCC 1113, 1127, 1129).Finally, Christ exercises His pastoral and kingly authority over His followers through the pastors of His Church (Eph 1:22-23, 4:11-12). You need to obey their lawful authority as a way of obeying Christ (1 Jn 4:6). Following the pastors includes observing the six precepts of the Church (Jn 14:16):1. Attend Mass on Sundays and Holy Days (Ex 31:13-17; CCC 2180).2. Confess one's sins at least once a year (if one is conscious of mortal sin) (Jas 5:14-16; CCC 1457).3. Receive Holy Communion during the Easter season (Acts 2:42; CCC 1389).4. Observe appointed days of fasting and abstinence (Acts 13:2-3; CCC 2043).5. Contribute to the support of the Church (Gal 6:6).6. Observe the marriage laws of the Church (Rom 7:2-3).These precepts are all ways our basic Christian commitment to follow Christ is lived out in His Church.It is important to remember that these precepts are minimal acts of discipleship. Some people adopt a sort of legalistic approach to such requirements and ask \\"What is the bare minimum I have do?\\" This is something like a husband asking, \\"How often do I have to kiss my wife?\\" This is not a sign of a particularly healthy relationship. The precepts of the Church are more like a sketch, a basic outline of a portrait of a disciple. It is the task of each of us to use the gifts God has given us to fill in that portrait with the oil paint of faith, hope, and charity, and make it as beautiful as we can.** To find out more about \\"what it means to be Catholic\\", try reading books like \\"Catholic Christianity\\" by Peter Kreeft\\" and \\"Living the Catholic Faith\\" by Archbishop Charles J.

Even though the author uses the words Catholic and Christian synonymously he is promoting Catholicism as the true religion. However, Presbyterians, Pentecostals, Baptists, Lutherans, and a whole host of other denominations also call themselves Christians. Then I must ask myself, &quot;What's the difference between a 'Catholic' Christian and a 'Pentecostal' Christian?&quot; Obviously both consider themselves Christian, yet if you look at the two religions they have very little in common. I read the gospels and I couldn't find where Jesus made distinctions between those who followed Him, He preached only one consistent gospel."},{"Title":"HARRIET","review":"it is a sad thing that Jenkins' 1934 novel is not better known! perhaps the darkness, realism, and tragedy that form the basis of this novel's insights on humanity's often predatory nature has precluded it from being embraced.the premise is simple enough. take a \\"natural\\" from any given Austen novel - those simple-minded, childish, often greedy, but also often innately sweet women who the central heroines usually have to protect or at least work around - and set her in a starkly realistic setting approximately 50 years later, filled with characters who truly will do what they feel they have to do to obtain money and comfort. although the language is similar - charmingly nuanced and understated dialogue; descriptive passages that are wry and subtle; characters who are pleasingly well-spoken and well-mannered - the result is very far from a comedy of manners. Harriet's narrative is instead a grueling series of escalating predations and degradations, politely told... because most people with no sense but some money do not have a Jane Austen heroine around to guide and protect them.the discomfort this novel creates comes not just from the horrors that are visited upon the heroine but also from the inclusion of classic characters and situations that are instantly recognizable from the range of light comedies of manner that have been read and re-read over time. greed is a killer and predators will do anything to rationalize their predatory behavior (even to themselves) - particularly in a milieu where polite conversation and manners are as important as currency.a dark and forgotten classic, one that is pitiless and passionless in its depictions of human cruelty. the novel is both subtle and furious in its underlying assessment of the avariciousness that can drive that cruelty."},{"Title":"The Second Most Important Book You Will Ever Read: A Personal Challenge to Read the Bible","review":"Recently, there have been several reviews written on this book that are clearly biased against God and Dan Patrick. If you read these reviews they clearly have a negative slant towards Mr. Patrick, who also host a radio program in Houston. These reviews do not give a fair and objective review of the book on it's merits. If you look at the earlier reviews of this book, most give it 4 or 5 stars. The book has been very successful because it clearly tells the reader why they must read God's Word to discover His plan for their life. Dan answers the excuses people give for not reading the Bible, the major benefits of reading the Bible and gives a review of all 66 books, main characters and concepts of the Bible. He also shares interviews he has had with celebrities, sports stars and politicians (including our current President) about their faith. This is a great book for everyone no matter where they are in their spiritual journey."},{"Title":"The Second Most Important Book You Will Ever Read: A Personal Challenge to Read the Bible","review":"This book is a excellent book for anyone who is looking for answers and wondering what the Bible has to offer.

The life experiences presented in the book by both the author and many of the famous people he has met during his life, makes this a very enjoyable.

This book launched first only in Houston in December. It was an immediate best seller and #1 seller in most stores. It is now in the process of national distribution through major chains. In these troubling times, my sole purpose is to inspire people to read the Bible and understand how they can apply God's Word for their lives.

It is precisely what it claims to be: a challenge to read the bible and why the author thinks this is important. Patrick supports his thesis with personal stories, interviews he has done and humorous accounts.

It only takes a moment of listening to him talk (or reading this book) to understand where he stands.The title says it all - ALL books are &quot;The Second Most Important Book ...&quot;If you are looking for theology or a biblical scholar's attempt to explain the Bible to you, keep looking.

I am not sure if he is trying to prove that he and the people he knows are very important because of their faith or is actually trying to facilitate the reader's understanding of the bible. Basically any real connection to God is obscured by the writers pride. The book was lacking in any real depth of spirit, and suggests that the writer, while probablly a man of faith, has little understanding on how to communicate it on any but the most surface level. The book suggests that his understanding of the Bible is concrete and fails to uncover the beauty and wisdom that lies beneath a literal interpretation."},{"Title":"The Second Most Important Book You Will Ever Read: A Personal Challenge to Read the Bible","review":"This book will help you to understand and make reading the bible FUN!

A little old lady neighbor that meant well gave me a copy that she picked up at a church rummage sale. The book contains superficial overviews of the Bible corrupted by Dan Patrick's vanity and self-centeredness. This is blasphemous exploitation at its worst. The book really saddens me,since, in all religions, goodness starts with love and humility. This book, since it perverts our most sacred values, poisons our society. At least nobody seems to be reading it. Try again, God."},{"Title":"The Second Most Important Book You Will Ever Read: A Personal Challenge to Read the Bible","review":"There are other more informative bible study guides available. Books more helpful at facilitating the reader in finding her or his own path to God. The book's reviews of the 66 books of the bible are sketchy, less informative than basic Sunday school syllabi. The interviews are self -aggrandizing, and have less to do with faith than with trumpeting ones own fame. Reading the author's own review of his book, it is clear that his intent in writing the book was to gain notoriety and not to aid others on the path to spiritual discovery. The minimal success of this book appears to be due to the support of the author's talk radio audience, as exhibited by the close minded and cowardly review \\"Anti God reviewers trying to stop this book's success\\" by a reader in Houston (where the author's radio show airs), who has rushed to the defense of the author by bashing those who disagree and objectively critique the book by questioning their faith, when the reviewer should perhaps spend that energy examining their own expression of Christian tenets. At the bottom line, the power to develop a solid relationship with the words of God and to God is within us all and will not be aided by reading this book."},{"Title":"The Second Most Important Book You Will Ever Read: A Personal Challenge to Read the Bible","review":"Hmmm, let's see. What other Christian books are more important than the so-called &quot;Second Most Important Book You'll Ever Read.&quot;Try Saint Augustine's Confessions.How about Chesterton's Orthodoxy.Or maybe Blaise Pascal's brilliant calling to God, the Pensees.And surely Dan Patrick doesn't think his self-titled book is more important than the works of Christian literary giants like C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien.Or is it more important than all the great Christian writers and speakers of history? Is it more important than the texts of the early church fathers? How about Anselm of Canterbury? Maybe denominational founders like Martin Luther? Or John Calvin? Does it surpass the great Christian philosophers like Thomas Aquinas? Or how about Hillare Bellock? Or John Henry Newman? Maybe legendary preachers like Jonathan Edwards? Or how about Billy Graham? They all have famous Christian texts to their name, but are they not more important than what is claimed in the title of this book?The answer is this: The long list of great and important texts in Christian literature spans millenia and extends to all denominations of the Christian faith. But for an arrogantly titled book from an equally arrogant radio DJ to somehow falls in the #2 slot of that list behind only the Bible itself is beyond ridicilous.If you truly seek an introduction to the faith seek it in your Bible and seek it in the writings of the great classical Christian figures, only a few of whom are named above. Whatever your denomination or affiliation be, be it Protestant or Catholic, evangelical fundamentalist or traditional, there are great and important writers out there for you.

She gave no indication. The second reviewer was dead on but she didn't give details. When pregnant with my third child, I wanted to find a good big sister book for my daughter (my second child). We loaded up on big brother books before she was born and they were a big help to my son. I NEVER read this book to my daughter because I didn't want the negative thoughts that it depicts to enter her mind. In the first pages of the book, the little girl is shown in very clearly resentful and ugly moods, looking over at the new baby with Mommy and Daddy with pure venom. Mid-book, there are several spreads dedicated to how incredibly busy everyone always is with the new baby and how big sister is made to wait frequently and for long, long, (seriously) long periods of time while baby is dealt with. She is, of course, told that it is difficult sometimes to wait but that it is part of being a big girl and that the baby can't wait for things. Then, the worst part...\\"One afternoon I needed Mommy to read a book, but Daniel was crying. So Mommy had to rock him. She rocked and rocked. Daniel cried and cried.\\" Big sister is shown on the next page waiting with the book, in three different poses, implying that she's waiting quite a while. \\"I had to wait. I waited and waited.\\" On the following spread, \\"While Mommy rocked, I brought Daniel's new blanket\\" (presumably to help comfort the crying baby). The poor dear is shown coming in with the blanket and slipping on the book she wanted Mommy to read to her. She falls on the floor next to Mommy and baby in the rocking chair. Still, does Mommy get up and console her? Does Mommy invite her to join them in the rocking chair? Nope. Mommy looks sort of proud on the next page as she watches her daughter try to pull herself together while sitting on the floor nearby, \\"reading\\" the book (upside down) and sobbing by herself, drying her eyes on the blanket. Well, I'm sorry, but my two older children did not cease to be my babies too when my new babies came home and that's definitely not an image I wanted my daughter to remember when her baby brother came home.I'm not naive. I've got three kids now. I know about resentful feelings. They will happen even when parents have the best of intentions. However, this book doesn't introduce our daughters to the idea of being big sisters with the best of intentions. Try Joanna Cole's \\"I'm a Big Sister\\" for that. I'm irked by the bottle-feeding in that book and the pictures seem outdated but the message is fantastic. It addresses waiting and crying in a MUCH more positive way. I also really liked \\"Hello Baby\\" by Lizzy Rockwell. It discusses pregnancy, in utero growth, and the baby's homecoming. It may seem too long and advanced for young children but that didn't bother me. I used it for both of my first two children and just let them look at the pictures while I modified the story to suit their respective ages. Also, if your kids are older and dealing with issues of sibling rivalry and who Mommy or Daddy loves best, I highly recommend \\"I Love You the Purplest\\" by Barbara Joosse. It gives perhaps the best lesson of all time to help parents combat resentment between children.I will say that I can see a use for this book if I had a daughter who (despite my best intentions in preparing her for big-sisterhood) was having very seriously negative feelings about being a big sister. This book could help her understand that those feeling can be normal and that things will improve with time. I wouldn't buy it until then though. I also have a Master's Degree in Social Work and I know about giving a voice to feelings. I would never discourage my children from voicing their resentment, irritation, anger, etc. about the new baby. However, I also know that children model behavior, even that which is found in the books we read to them. If you introduce them to the idea that they're going to be left out and made to wait when their new sibling comes along, they will be expecting trouble and the resentment depicted in the book will almost surely become a self-fulfilling prophecy. I absolutely believe in allowing, even ENCOURAGING, children to voice negative feelings; I just feel it's counter-productive and unnecessary to introduce them before they crop up on their own. So, to the reviewer who plans to give this book as a gift to all the expectant parents she knows, I implore you to stick to the parents' registry. It is much more respectful of their wishes to do so. Just because you think this book would be valuable for them does not mean they will agree. This book was a gift to me from someone who thought we would enjoy it and it was just a waste of money. I could really use more crib sheets though! Registry...Also, speaking of modeling behavior... Any parent sensitive enough to be cruising Amazon looking for a good book to help a daughter prepare for her new sibling would not exhibit the kind of cruel neglect of the daughter's feelings that you see in this book. I have much more of a problem with the behavior of the parents in this book than I do with the big sister's behavior. Who can blame the poor girl for the resentment she's experiencing?Yes, a child having a new sibling has been compared to a husband or wife bringing a new spouse home. However, it's not exactly that extreme or fewer people would do it, some several times over. Also, I don't see myself EVER frolicking with my husband's new wife in the sandbox or us happily tooling around after each other on tricycles a mere two years after our introduction. Kids adjust because we prepare them and nurture them and express to them in a myriad of ways that siblings are a gift to one another. Even if the comparison was accurate, the logical conclusion should not be to tell a child, \\"Oh, yeah, it's going to be wretched and you'll be second fiddle for a while but don't worry because it will get better.\\" The solution is to prepare them with some information about the needs of new babies and then to do your absolute best to give them an abundance of love and attention once the new baby comes. I'm on my third and I truly haven't found it that big of a challenge to make time and room on my lap for my older ones--many times even while nursing the newborn. Yes, the house is in shambles sometimes and I can get pretty exhausted but the priority here is taking good care of all three of my babies."},{"Title":"Big Sister Now: A Story about Me and Our New Baby","review":"Our daughter was 3 yrs & 1 week old when our son was born and we bought this book because it was about a big sister with a little brother. Our daughter loves this book and so do we. We do not think that it is negative - rather realistic in that there will be frustrations and adjustments that the older child will have to make when the baby arrives. She recites the parts about being patient and having special time with Mommy and Daddy. She has been reading the book for over 6 months now and continues to enjoy it. We really loves the illustrations - the \\"big sister\\" wears a dress-up skirt over her PJs and our daughter does this all of the time. We strongly recommend this book as our family has greatly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Big Sister Now: A Story about Me and Our New Baby","review":"\\"Big Sister Now\\" is on my list of \\"gotta haves\\" and \\"gotta give\\" to all friends and friends'kids who are bringing second and third and forth babies home to older sibblings. The story is so engaging, the senarios realistic. The character gives a voice and permission to older sibblings who may not know how to positively express what they're feeling. This book is sure to delight, educate and open doors of communication between parents and the older sibbling.For those concerned about the negative face of the character let me remind you what the noted (late) child psychologist, Dr. Hiam Ginott (Between Parent and Child)said about bringing a second baby home. He believed that is was like your husband bringing home another woman and telling you that you'll love it because she'll help with the cooking, housework and babysitting.He believe that ALL children harbor feelings of displacement whether they appear to express them or not. The child willing to happily fetch diapers and bottles and even those expressing \\"I love the baby\\" may ONLY be doing it to please Mommy and Daddy, not because they feel that way.The beauty in \\"Big Sister Now,\\" is that through the adorable main character, children are NOT given negative ideas but rather given a VOICE and PERMISSION to express what they may really be feeling. As tough as it is for us as parents to accept, children do feel displaced, and if they are harboring feelings of resentment, it's healthier to give them a positive avenue for expression. \\"Big Sister Now\\" doesn't tell children how they should be feeling, it allows children to express what may already be inside their head.The illustrations are amazingly fresh. The back story in all the illustrations is wonderfully clever. Anyone who is a mother can relate to the dishelveled house. So much more is happening within the illustrations than in the story itself.\\"Big Sister Now\\" is on my \\"MUST HAVE\\" list!"},{"Title":"Big Sister Now: A Story about Me and Our New Baby","review":"Big People will find Big Sister Now as delightful a read as Big Sisters and Brothers.Author Annette Sheldon dared go where few have gone before-she successfully entered the mind of a 2 year old and stayed there throughout the entire book.

She said I am thinking about a book that is written for a girl who is about to have a new brother, so see what you can find. Long story short Amazon comes through again, and that night I did a search for a book. I found Big Sister Now and I liked what I saw with this book, in spite of one of the reviews that had been written. The book arrived and my friend was so delighted as it was exactly what she was looking to find.

It's a great book."},{"Title":"Big Sister Now: A Story about Me and Our New Baby","review":"I bought this book for my grandchild when she became a big sister at 2 1/2. She had me read it to her immediately, then took it to grandpa to read it, then dad, then mom. She listened over and over again and loved the book."},{"Title":"Big Sister Now: A Story about Me and Our New Baby","review":"I somewhat agree with the negative reviews of this book. The little girl is resentful. The mother does attend to the baby over the child (in ways I personally would try not to). But I still think this book has merit for some families and situations. I have three young children, so have introduced the \\"new sibling\\" situation twice in our family.\\"Loving\\" books about how the baby \\"needs\\" the whole family were of the most help with my oldest daughter. She naturally adored her new role, even at barely 2yo. Those same books did not cut it with my second daughter when her little brother arrived. At newly 3yo, she wanted nothing to do with the baby. And those books about how tough it is to be the bigger sibling because babies can be work and trouble but someday the younger sibling will show how much he/she adores big brother/sister and then everything will be hunky-dory? She saw right through those.That left me with the style of book I refer to as \\"haters.\\" The older sibling does not like the new baby so they list the ways in which the younger sibling is inferior. They are not allowed in my house.So, onto my review: We checked this out from the library for no reason when my youngest two children were 2 and 5. This book spoke to my middle child even 2 years after the baby arrived. We never taught or encouraged her to feel resentful, though we were understanding and accepting of her feelings. And did she ever feel resentful! We never abandoned her needs to deal with the baby's needs. But in those instances when we physically couldn't pour her cereal or read her book RIGHT THEN, she did not see us trying to juggle everything to get to her asap. She felt abandoned.She really enjoyed this book. It gave her a to springboard to talk about her feelings and sparked a lot of good discussions in our family that we have all walked away from feeling better. I wish we had read this book shortly after she became a big sister and was dealing with these feelings.I WOULD NOT use this book to introduce the concept of a new sibling. But I would keep it in my parenting toolkit to pull out if I had a child that was already feeling the way the protagonist does in this book. It's a very healthy book in that regard."},{"Title":"Big Sister Now: A Story about Me and Our New Baby","review":"I thought this book was great. I understand what previous reviewers are saying about the sister seeming to be ignored, but I think what we have to keep in mind is that she is probably not waiting as long as we think she is - the book is written from her perspective, not the parents'. If mom has to nurse for 1 more minute, it might seem like 30 to a two year old. And personally, I am not able to pour cereal while nursing so if my daughter wants some, she has to wait.I felt like this really gave my daughter (age 3) some good preparation for what to expect when her baby brother arrived. I also think that it helped her understand that it was OK to express some resentment toward him at first. The illustrations were fantastic - I enjoyed seeing the disorganized house and harried parents."},{"Title":"Big Sister Now: A Story about Me and Our New Baby","review":"My husband and I found out we would be having our second grandchild. We went in search of a great book to help our grandson,age three, deal with a new baby sister. We searched a lot of stores and found the best story in the book \\"Big Sister Now\\". Even though it was about a big sister, it was easy to have our grandson understand that big sisters and big brothers seem to have the same things happen to them. He now says that his friend Kate has a baby brother Daniel and he Nicholas. is having a baby sister How wonderful this made us feel.The illstrations made us able to discuss the problems Kate was having and that sometimes we have to be patient. It also showed that big brothers and sisters get to do more grown-up thingsand babies to have to sleep alot.In looking at the pictures and reading the story I felt the autor and illistrator worked hand in hand with a lot of love to produce a fun and helpful book for children of all ages. They must have experienced alot of the story for it to have so many of the feelings that you hear moms talk about after a new baby arrives and a little girl becomes \\"A Big Sister Now.\\"Charlene ChernockAshtabula,Oh."},{"Title":"Big Sister Now: A Story about Me and Our New Baby","review":"I've searched for a big sister book for several months and this is by far the best one I've seen. The love of the parents for both big sister and baby is obvious on every page. The illustrations are compelling and the story is warmly reassuring. The big sister is genuinely helped by both parents and grandma--she's not forced to grow up too quickly, she's neither ignored nor pampered. She's loved and equipped for loving. Just the right balance of family members getting along. The illustrations of waiting are so what a child would feel and a mom would help with. That the child is allowed to dress herself is even better. Just delightful. The children I've read it to ask for it to be read again and again.

This fact helps us to understand a littlle more of his work as an anthropologist aware of the importance of a renewed history. Eric Wolf left Europe after an experience in the nazi's concentration camp in World War II. In this camp, he met and had classes with Norbert Elias. Some people say this is a fundamental fact on Wolf's career, because, as we can see, the problematic of power undergoes all along his opus. In Peasant Wars, Eric, worried about the US involvement in the Vietnam conflict, tries to understand how peasant people get involved with revolution.

Too often, any study of gays focuses on New York City and San Francisco, but nowhere else. Too often, \\"people of color\\" focuses on Blacks only, or Blacks and Latinos only. This study is a nice retreat from those problems. It is a multi-city study. It speaks of Blacks, Latinos, Asians, and Native Americans.I'm glad it exists, but it is just a dry policy study. The book has no photos and is just a power point lecture put in text form.Too many, this also feels terribly dated. While the study strongly emphasizes that many men who kick it with men don't identify as gay or bisexual, it never uses the new term \\"the down low.\\" Further, I think this study was printed before more effective AIDS drugs called HAART therapy were produced. Luckily, I think this study has an awesome update in the studies compiled in the book by Sana Loue."},{"Title":"Fence Style: Surround Yourself With Charm & Elegance","review":"Yes a book about fences. Even I was surprised when I picked it up and took it home. I was in a hurry and had a blonde moment because I thought it said French Style. But... it turned out to be a book I actually like.Just shy of 130 pages it is a book of beautiful photos of all kinds of fences. Some fences are the New England classics and some are wild west and awesome. Some are plain white and some are vivid purple hues.Then there are instructions on how to build a stone fence , dry retaining wall, wet retaining wall, metal fences, and classic picket, vertical board, stacked rails, post and rail, slat, lattice, basket weave and stake.On page 86 the issue of lumber grade is discussed. As well as dimensional lumber 24 inches and 2-4 inches thick, boards less than 2 inches thick. And the frosting on the cake is what kind of finish to give the fences and how to apply it.I love fences myself and the book reminded me of rural fences in Montana and the Dakotas, the fences we see along the coast of California and the hooty tooty fences in areas like Woodside and up in Marine County. The stone fences we saw in Maine and which dot the landscape in the Yorkshire Dales on England.It's a charming and useful book.UPDATE April 2002 We are settled into our new Sierra mountain cottage and I am actually using this book as I re-design the fencing and the additional new gates."},{"Title":"Fence Style: Surround Yourself With Charm & Elegance","review":"This book tried to be two different things and, as a result, accomplished neither. On the one hand, it appears that the authors wanted to publish a book of arty fence photographs (and indeed the book includes a number of lush, imaginative shots), while at the same time offering a how-to guide for fence building. Unfortunately, the how-to portion keeps the book from being a bona fide artistic endeavor, while the space and presentation given to artsy fence portraits prevents the book from ever developing into a sufficiently comprehensive building guide. Bottom line: don't expect this book to deliver an adequate lesson in actual fence-building techniques, if you don't have building skills to begin with; but if you just want to look at pictures of a bunch of other people's fences, you probably won't be too disappointed."},{"Title":"The Dance of the Rose and the Nightingale (Gender, Culture, and Politics in the Middle East)","review":"Nesta Ramazani has written a true gem of memoir and history. With her extremely capable pen, she takes us on both a personal journey into her own diverse, eclectic, and inspiring life and also into revealing vignettes of Iranian life of the 1940's and 1950's -- a period lamentably ignored by too many historians.The book does what the best memoirs should do: it tells a great tale, weaves the background history nicely, and illuminates slices of life and Iranian society in all its color and diversity.It is touching, funny, enlightening, and exquisitely told. The book should be on the reading list of anyone interested in good memoirs, in Iran, in women's studies, in the Middle East, or simply in good writing.

They had absolutely no idea that what they were doing would come to be called the \\"Green Revolution\\", or that their efforts to help the hungry feed themselves would be hijacked. They did not have any sense of the controversies that would dog their efforts in the decades ahead. Quite frankly, their motivation was kindness, as can be seen in the following quotes:1) \\"The wisdom of our actions in the first three years of peace will determine the course of world history for half a century.\\"--Henry A. Wallace (pg. 334)2) \\"You can't build a peaceful world on empty stomachs and human misery.\\"--Norman Borlaug (pg. 334)3) Exacerbating all of these issues was a reality that stunned Norm [Borlaug]. Coming from a family that valued education above almost all else, it seemed unfathomable to Norm that only about twenty percent of the Mexican farmers were literate. In a letter to Margaret, Norm expressed his bewilderment at the challenge that lay ahead. \\"These places I've seen have clubbed my mind--they are so poor and depressing. No wonder the people are the way they are. Can you imagine a poor Mexican guy struggling to feed his family? I don't know what we can do to help these people, but we've got to do something!\\" (pg. 337)4) The bombs had yet to fall on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that horrible summer of 1945. Therefore, Edward Lorenz was still at his station in the Pacific. He was still trying to predict the weather for the Army Air Corp. He had yet to articulate the theory of \\"sensitive dependence on initial conditions.\\" It is thus surprising that one day, while explaining to a group of Champingo College staff the reasoning behind the \\"high-volume crossbreeding\\" approach, Norm (Borlaug) almost seemed to intuit the highly random and chaotic essence of the \\"butterfly effect.\\"\\"There are millions of wheat plants here. Each head will grow a couple of dozen grains of seed, and there will not be one seed in billions that will be totally acceptable for what we need in Mexico. Perfection is a butterfly the academics chase and never catch. If we go on looking for the ideal wheat for Mexico, your countrymen will go on being hungry for a long time. We will have to do the best we can with what we have.\\" (pg. 340)__________________________By the way, the Green Revolution did not actually begin with Norman Borlaug in Mexico, it began in Des Moines, Iowa. In May 1926 when seven men met in the offices of Wallaces' Farmer:\\"They formed a corporation--Hi-Bred Corn Company. They agreed to sell themselves seventy shares of stock at $100 per share. By purchasing fifty shares himself, Henry [Wallace] was the majority stock holder. The other men purchased the remaining twenty shares. By the end of the first year the company had sold 650 bushels of hybrid seed corn, for a net profit of about $30. The partners were delighted.

Overall, the book lets the world know, GMO is bad news."},{"Title":"Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies About the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You're Eating","review":"Seeds of Deception is a completely one-sided expose damning anything and everything involving genetic engineering. Successes and achievements of GMOs are completely ignored while mishaps are relentlessly hammered upon.The basic premise of the book is that the process of genetic engineering somehow corrupts the target organism and everything derived from it thereafter. By blasting the biotech industry and government agencies, Smith paints a picture of wanton disregard for safety issues and shifty cover-ups aimed at keeping the public ignorant. The author sort of oscillates between a tone of hysterical panic pronouncing that we're all sure to perish soon if something isn't done and a more reasonable tone that suggests further tests are needed to demonstrate the safety of GMO products. Each chapter is preceded by a cute little story about some animal or another preferring natural over GMO food. No corroboration is provided for these word of mouth stories and I'm sure that if you looked hard enough you could find examples in which animals chose GMO over non. The book concludes with a call for activism by the reader. I just pray that potential activists do not base their conclusions solely on this book.Vague claims are used to bash biotechnology. What does it mean that only \\"1% of people think that GMOs are good for society\\"? Does this mean that 99% think that it is bad? What exactly do the \\"superficial government studies\\" entail? What is the basis for the claim that a single fruit fly gene may code for 38,000 distinct proteins? By using strong sounding but vague arguments such as these, Smith aims to convince the reader to follow his view by providing carefully selected bits of information.Smith's explanations of molecular biology and techniques used in genetic engineering are pathetic and presented in a way to influence the reader to distrust GM products. As a molecular biologist, I can assure you that Smith's claim that \\"no control over how many genes, in what order, or where they are inserted\\" is bogus. Relatively simple and straight-forward experiments (Southern blotting and PCR) can be and are conducted to determine exactly these things.The idea that there is some sort of conspiracy between industry, government, the media, and even independent scientists is absolutely ridiculous. Smith attributes the fact that you don't hear many scientists voicing concerns over GMO food products to some sort threat by evil and powerful men, while in reality it stems from the fact that scientists as a whole support GM technology and would generally argue in favor of its safety. Scare tactics, distorted \\"facts\\" and partial information can make a strong impression on someone not familiar with the topic of genetic engineering. Not so much on scientists well-versed in molecular biology (sorry Jeffrey).Basically, this is a dangerous book that will influence many people to fear GMOs and may result in governments passing laws that will slow progress in a field that has so much potential to accomplish good for the world. Jeffrey Smith is certainly not an objective journalist \\"exposing industry and government lies\\", he is an activist with a singular purpose in mind: Convincing people that GMOs are harmful to them and the future of the world."},{"Title":"Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies About the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You're Eating","review":"I'd rather take from real scientists. this guy is not even a doctor and has no scientific backgrounds to tell me that what I all eat now is dangerous.1 star reviews here in his other book is worth seeingGenetic Roulette: The Documented Health Risks of Genetically Engineered Foods"},{"Title":"Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies About the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You're Eating","review":"Jeffrey Smith has zero scientific credentials, yet his books are analyses of scientific papers.

I highly recommend it if you are interested in your health.As a biologist who has worked with DNA, and respect it, I place great value on Smith's easy to understand explanation on the genetic engineering process on DNA. Smith has also carefully researched FDA reports and quoted several people in his analysis of GMOs and their impact on society. With methodological precision, his research reveals the close ties of the U.S. government with biotechnology industry in several aspects of GMO production. Even more disturbing is the influence of biotechnology companies such as Monsanto, Novartis, Dow, and DuPont having on the government - they gave more than 3.5 million dollars (from 1995-2000) towards campaign contributions, with 3/4 going to Republicans.His research also reveals the impact of the genetically modifed amino acid L-tryptophan in 1989-1990 that debilitated thousands of people with EMS, a disease that produces severe muscle pain, and even death. Forty people died from taking this L-tryptophan. This product was never labled that it was genetically modified and the Japanese manufacturer - Showa Denko KK did not use the proper filtration level to remove the impurities. Subsequent from these health risks, the product was removed from shelves.My favorite quotes from this book came from George Wald, Nobel Laureate in Medicine. He said for genetic engineeering - \\"The results will be essentially new organisms, self-perpetuating and hence permanent. Once created, they cannot be recalled\\" and \\"Up to now, living organisms have evolved very slowly and new forms have had plenty of time to settle in. Now whole proteins will be transposed overnight into wholly new associations, with consequences no one can foretell, either for the host organism, or their neighbors.\\" Those are powerful words and cannot be forgotten.Read this book.

During the late 70s and early 80s, when genetic engineering was coming on the scene, I was a strong supporter.Over the years I talked to various biotech scientists who were becoming worried about whether the genetically-modified foods entering the food chain were safe. As the science developed, it was discovered the process of genetic engineering is anything but as straightforward as scientists originally thought. Chunks of genetic material jump all over the place once they are inserted into plants, and there is no predicting where they will go, or what effect they will have. There has been almost no research on the safety of genetically-modified foods, and what little has been done has shown these foods can cause a number of health problems ranging from allergies to food intolerances to cancer.Both Canadian and US government agencies have taken the position (urged on by the biotech companies) that these new food crops are 'substantially similar' to existing crops, so do not need any study for food safety. And both governments are strong supporters of the industry, as I used to be.The scientists I talked to became less and less willing to voice their concerns for fear of reprisals.A few years ago, because of the knowledge I had gained, I began to make a point of avoiding GMOs, which is increasingly difficult, as they are spreading everywhere.We are being screwed over and lied to by the biotech industry and our governments, and this book tells the story well and thoroughly."},{"Title":"Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies About the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You're Eating","review":"Jeffrey Smith, the author of this book, is a plain-spoken but hardly elegant writer. He doesn't need to be; the facts he reports about GM (genetically modified) foods and the relentless efforts of Monsanto Corp. to get them into American and world markets need no dressing up in fancy prose. It's hard to decide which is scariest: the grave doubts about the safety of specific products such as the FlavrSavr tomato and StarLink corn; the myriad possibilities for unpredictable results to the environment and the general food supply, given the current scanty knowledge of genes, genetics and the possible consequences of unchecked modification of basic biological codes; or the systematic, epidemic failure of governmental agencies charged with protecting the health of the general public in the U.S. and Canada to act.It would be easy to dismiss &quot;Seeds of Deception&quot; as a partisan rant against Republican governments and big business, but Smith is evenhanded in his indictments. According to him, Monsanto Corp. has engaged in a systematic campaign to pressure both Democratic and Republican administrations in the United States to allow GM foods to be marketed without proper safeguards and testing. What seems to have saved the world so far is the vigorous resistance of European and overseas markets to the entry of genetically modified food products that have not been properly tested, consquently making several highly promoted products uneconomical to produce. Nevertheless, modified genes have already &quot;escaped&quot; into the general food supply to an alarming degree.In the final portion of the book Smith gives suggestions on how the reader can protect him/herself against unknowingly consuming GM foodstuffs, and also asks for contributions so that copies of his book can be sent to those in positions of power. I'm sending him a check."},{"Title":"Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies About the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You're Eating","review":"I have not tracked the genetically engineered food issue carefully, having only seen mainstream media reporting.BEFORE I started reading this book, I thought that:1. The genetic engineering technique is very precise and duplicatable, inserting single genes into a plant's DNA that do a precise job.2. Genetically modified (GM) food is essentialy the same as the non-GM counterpart.3. There are few if any known serious health risks from eating most GM food4. GM practices can reduce pesticide use because the plant has its own pesticide. This is an environmental benefit.5. GM food can increase yields, given the same amount of land for growing - which has been a great benefit in some third world countries.6. There are considerable environmental risks that have probably not been ade1quately studied. For example, monarch butterflies were being harmed in GM fields.Overall I felt that the issue was not very clear cut, there were great advantages, but caution is also advised.AFTER I read this book, I learned that:1. The GM technique is extremely imprecise, it is like shooting a shotgun of genes at a bunch of DNA strands, and hoping a few stick. Furthermore, the surrounding genes suffer considerable collateral damage that is impossible to predict the effects of.2. This collateral damage results in GM food often being very different from the non-GM version, especially in increase of toxins and allergens.3. There are a number of well documented cases of people getting very sick, and some cases dying from these toxins and allergens.Yet, the FDA and GM biotech industry and mainstream media continues to say that there is little evidence of health risk.4. One of the most pervasive GM foods is Monsanto's Ready Roundup soy bean. It is specifically designed to be resistant to Monsanto's brand of pesticide. This results in MORE of that pesticide being used.5. The argument about increased yields to save the planet is often used as a last resort when you point out the truth about GM being an imprecise technique, and that there are serious health risks. It is a way of bringing in a moral dimension that most people will buy. Yet, the planet already has much more food than it needs to feed everyone. This is not the reason for GM foods. Profit is.6. The environmental risks may be many and unstudied, to be sure. Much more shocking is that there are hardly any careful studies demonstrating that GM food is safe. Basically, scientificaly weak arguments are use to argue that there is no reason to conduct such studies.This is barely scratching the surface, this book is extremely well written and documented. It tells a sobering story of:* Corporate greed,* Rampant conflict of interest with industry being in bed with the FDA, for example:- Scientists warnings are routinely ignored- Monsanto officials come to work at the FDA to make policy, then return to Monsanto- The doctoring of information is much like what the current Bush adminstration has done with scentific reports about global warming.* Most funding for research in GM comes from industry.* People are afraid to do research that might discover inconvenient truths about the safety of GM foods - because they are bullied, threatened and can lose their careers.* Massive media manipulation filters out virtually all anti-GM stories; books have gone unpublished for fear of lawsuits by pro-GM companies* Pro-biotech companies and the FDA itself have ample evidence of safety concerns, and they consistently lie about it. It reminds me of the tobacco situation.Some may complain that this book does not present a balanced view. You be the judge. And anyway, even if it is one one-sided, its about that that this side was aired.But don't take it from me, or from the author. Read the book, check the references, and reach your own conclusions. Even if only a few things in this book are true, it has major consequences.I recommend that anyone who cares about their health, and their future read this book right away!!!

Pick up any Adbusters or Mother Jones magazine and you'll find a plethora of ways corporations have sold the environment, animals and human health to the highest bidder. What's fun (or horrific, depending on your mood) is learning the specifics. Seeds of Deception delves into the details of genetically modified (GM) food: what we should know about the politics, science and investment behind the industry.One of the many issues the book raises is that GM food is almost impossible to distinguish, since it's generally not labeled here in the United States. Companies, such as Monsanto, spend millions, if not billions, of dollars keeping the public happy and ignorant about the lack of testing behind their products. They even have some pretty smart folks believing GM food is going to feed the world and cure blindness in Third World countries. It's taken a lot of dough to create that groupthink. As we've learned from pharmaceuticals, the cigarette industry and the meat and dairy industries, when a company is willing to spend that kind of money on public relations, someone's putting frosting on a mud pie.Peppered with anecdotes about animals choosing non-GM food over GM food, Smith's evidence of scientific and political cover-up is startling. It's impossible to ignore the evidence in this book. Even if only a fraction of it is true, we're in some serious crap. The problem comes down to a simple statement Smith quotes from geneticist, David Suzuki: \\"Any politician or scientist who tells you these products are safe is either very stupid or lying. The experiments have simply not been done.\\"Seeds of Deception's chapter \\"Muscling the Media\\" discusses corporate strategy to eliminate media reporting on GM food in the United States. \\"Under the auspices of the public relations and lobby firm Capitoline/MS&L;, they [GM giant Monsanto] created a plan to identify and then stifle those reporters and reports that were critical of rbGH.\\" (rbGH is the infamous growth hormone that makes cows produce more milk - horrible stuff.) The question remains: Doesn't Smith worry about being slammed and discarded like the many journalists and writers he describes? His book isn't going to show up on Oprah anytime soon - or is it? If enough people consider the seriousness of the topic, Seeds of Deception won't fall by the wayside.If you have room for another New Year's resolution, please let it be to follow the suggestions in this book. Eat organic, locally-produced food. Feed your children organic food and encourage schools to look into the realities of GM food in their cafeterias. Avoid certain foods altogether (like non-organic papaya from Hawaii, for example, which has a 50% chance of being GM) and encourage restaurants to eliminate GM food from their menus.Seeds of Deception will open your eyes - eyes that, from then on, will search for organic alternatives to take-your-chances, you-might-be-a-guinea-pig ingredients.

For the first time there is well-researched publication with sources cited and ducks in a row that provides the reader with a through, in-depth look into how today's scientific community is damaging our food supply with their manipulative practices designed to milk farmers - and the American public - for every last red cent possible.Other countries do not have the problems with obesity, diabetes and other similar diseases that Americans do. While the media takes the approach that its just the way we are, some are not willing to accept that explanation as fact. Seeds of Deception goes a long way towards exploring the possibility that this is not just another evolutionary fact of life on our green and blue planet, but something a bit more down to earth, man made and much more sinister."},{"Title":"Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies About the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You're Eating","review":"The subtitle, \\"Exposing Industry and Government Lies About the Safety of the GeneticallyEngineered Foods You're Eating\\", is covered pretty well in this attack book. Some corporationsare greedy and unethical. It is easy to believe bad things about FDA. The CYA attitudethat bureaucracy fosters in bureaucrats, and the common pattern of industries coopting theregulators, make the accusations against the FDA easy to believe, and even easy to expect.What is not so easy to believe is the overall message of the book. All genetically modifiedfoods are bad for you. They are less nutritious than the natural alternative, and will harmyou in one or many ways such as allergies, cancer, nervous disorders, ulcers, reduced intelligence.sexual problems, misformed children, or many more, and any evidence to the contrary is fakedby our corrupt government and the evil corporations in this vast biotech conspiracy.There are interesting parallels between the beliefs in this book and the beliefs of creationismor intelligent design, and also with the catastrophic anthropomorphic global warming alarmists.There are extensive notes of sources and an index, so you can use this book to help you argueagainst engineered foods, or to search for arguments against the claims in the book. The phrase\\"precautionary principle\\" does not appear in the index, and I do not recall seeing it in thetext, but the idea is stated repeatedly: genetic engineering should not be done until it hasbeen proven safe for many generations. Essentially, nothing should ever be done for the firsttime.While most of attack is against genetically engineered foods in general, with the usual weaselwords such as \\"might\\", \\"could\\", \\"linked\\", and \\"Believed\\", there are also specific claims againstcertain foods. There might be more such specific claims than recalls of organic foods after thedeath of consumers, but I'm not sure of it.The last chapter is a commercial for the book. You should buy lots of copies and give them toeveryone that is not aware of the evil plot. There is also information about how to avoid theevil food. Unless you are already in the know, you are probably eating it now. That makes mewonder where all the bodies are hid, and why life expectancy keeps going up.Smith has another book out, same topic. I have not seen it yet. In response to it, there is aclaim that Smith claims he can fly (yoga, not airplane), and other hard to believe powers.The attack on Smith seems like the attacks he accuses Montsano of, so I checked it. The DailyIllini says the article describing his \\"powers\\" was published by them on page 4, Oct 28, 1996.Smith's strange beliefs do not make his book wrong, but they might lead some to find him lessreliable than some others. I was almost at the 90% mark of the book when I encountered the slam.The book reduced my confidence in bioengineering, reduced even further my confidence in government,and left me still skeptical of attacks on bioengineering."},{"Title":"Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies About the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You're Eating","review":"Despite the fact that genetically modified foods have been banned by most other industrialized nations, we're exposed to lots of them in America, often without realizing it. \\"Seeds of Deception\\" explains the genetic modification process clearly, in a manner understandable to even a reader without an extensive scientific background.

The story of the FDA and Monsanto turning a blind eye to issues of public health and consumer safety, abandoning sound scientific practice, and aggressively silencing scientists who have spoken out against the safety of GMO foods reads like a Ludlum novel.

As I read the book, I entered into a world of deception regarding the regulation of our food safety. It made me realize how corrupt our government really is. The FDA doesn't have our health in mind, it is all about greed. The biotech industry's corporate leaders and scientists have formed a revolving door with positions at the FDA. This infiltration of biotech advocates into the government allowed incomplete testing and manipulated data that was pushed through regulation before anyone could object. When their own scientists showed concerns about the safety of the GMO products, they were fired. Monsanto and the other big biotech companies didn't want anything to stand in their way. They had plans to replace every seed in nature with a genetically modified organism (GMO)version. This way they controlled the seeds, they controlled the food, and therefore the world.The increase in disease in America has been on the rise since GMOs were introduced into our food. Independent studies have repeatedly shown that GMOs have a direct correlation to the rise in GI problems, immune system degradation, cancerous tumors of the breast, decreased fertility, damaged organs, multiple system failure, and dysfunctional regulation of cholesterol and insulin over the lifetime of a rat. Monsanto's studies were only 90 days long, which was insufficient to determine that these products are safe. The research shows that the adverse effects in the rats weren't apparent until the 4th month and continually got worse over the 2 year life span of the rats. There haven't been any human studies on GMOs, it was pushed on the market in the name of \\"progress\\". Unfortunately, we are the study...we are the lab rats.This book reveals it all, and how it is up to the individuals to collectively use our purchasing power to arrive at a tipping point. The power belongs to the people, but we have to speak up, speak out and form a united front to put this abomination to rest by getting the right to know what's in our food. We need to gather together with petitions and get labeling laws passed. The majority of Americans would not buy products with GMOs if they knew a product contained them. The recent long term studies have confirmed that we have been a science experiment and people do not want to gamble with their lives, they want control...they don't want pesiticides on their plate.A must read for everyone...I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies About the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You're Eating","review":"this book covers the subject in depth and is a must read for anyone interested in health, environment, and government interference and coverups - well written - makes you think."},{"Title":"Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies About the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You're Eating","review":"Jeffrey Smith has added a voice to what we should know about the foods that are in our diets and are Genetically Modified.

The author provides many corroborative sources for this book. It left no doubt in my mind that companies like Monsanto, and GM foods they and companies like them are producing, are not being regulated properly by government agencies (i.e. FDA), and are putting the public at long-term risk. The author also provides a section for what consumers can do to make a difference. The documentary DVD, \\"Food, Inc.\\" first introduced me to Monsanto and unveiled what I feel many in the United States general public don not know about the food industry. I wanted to continue this theme to learn more, and after searching through Amazon, I found \\"Seeds of Deception\\". You won't be disappointed. However I am very disappointed in the agencies (i.e. FDA) that are in collusion with these companies and are not being proactive to protect the public. I would not hesitate to highly recommend this book. One criticism I have, albeit a minor one, is that in some parts of the Kindle version, the formatting is off a little.

Learned societies - like the Royal Society - and the mass-media, are bought and prostituted. The biotechs, in the process, are accumulating the patents, which - in cahoots with an emerging global governance - would permit them to control the world's food supply, without actually enhancing it!Meanwhile, unexplained new diseases are appearing - such as the proliferating range of encephalopathies - which are linked to faults in genetic translation, but which, owing to politico-commercial pressure, are not being investigated for links with the increasing array of wierdly-constituted GMO's.Signal warning - must-read!"},{"Title":"Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies About the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You're Eating","review":"Quite simply a great book with life altering data..

This book does a great job of clearly explaining the complex process of genetically modifying a food's DNA and the unintended consequences that happen along the way. It also goes into great detail explaining the politics involved and the massive influence biotech companies have had on the FDA and EPA. Additionally these biotechs influence research coming out of universities. Biotech companies provide grants to the universities and can thus decide what gets published and what does not. The simple fact is that testing of these GE foods has been left to the biotech companies that create them. Most people would consider this a conflict of interest however this is the policy of the FDA (this policy was mostly shaped by a former Monsanto lawyer). The use of GE growth hormones is also widely used in cattle to increase milk production. The main takeaway from this is rBGH (a GE growth hormone) causes mastitis (udder infection) causing pus to be released into milk. Feel like a milkshake now? Prior to reading this book I had no idea how many foods contained GMOs. The main GE crops are corn, soybeans, canola, and cotton. Corn and soy are in a ton of foods so most of us have been consuming GE foods for years without knowing it. Sadly, the US and Canada are two of the few countries that do not label GE food. Even China labels food containing GE ingredients! The biotechs have lead a massive smear campaign against anyone speaking out on the dangers of GMOs, including distinguished biotech scientist, calling them Luddites and accusing them of hidden agendas. There is a great opportunity coming up to vote on whether or not foods containing GMOs should be labeled. The vote is in CA and it is Prop 37. If you live in CA please do your own due diligence and vote on this very important matter that affects us all.

(Smith is not a scientist)Seeds of Deception exposes the \\"dirty deals\\" between industry and government as well as the science of genetic modification. While I find some of the \\"dirty deal\\" aspects believable and concerning (as well as well written),I found the \\"science\\" aspects unbelievable and poorly written.The first chapter is devoted to Arpad Pusztai, whom Smith wants you to believe is a scientist who proved that GMOs are dangerous, but was fired in order to shut him up. (Because there is a giant global conspiracy) In reality, Pusztai's work is severely flawed by the lack of controls, extremely small sample size (6 rats per group) and unsupported conclusions. Pusztai claims that not only the particular GM plant he studied could be dangerous, but the very process of genetic engineering causes toxic food and can give you cancer!The cancer connection comes from Pusztai's study of cell proliferation in the rat intestines. He measured this because it is an indication of the quality of nutrition in the diet of GM-fed rats. His conclusion was that it had \\"both proliferative and antiproliferative effects\\". In reality, the numbers he got were simply variable, with no statistical correlation. In order to pull a conclusion from his data, he made what I call a \\"Bizzaro-World Model\\" and said that the same molecule did the exact opposite thing depending on the location of the gut. OK. This would be like taking aspirin and it giving you less pain in your right brain and more pain in your left. Also, the whole point of looking at cell proliferation was to have an indirect measure of nutrition. But Pusztai apparently feels the need to come up with a new explanation for cell proliferation by saying that the GMOs are causing cancer!Pusztai was fired because he went on TV and made statements unsupported by evidence, caused near-hysteria, and did bad science. He is not a whistle-blower. His work is not controversial; no scientist can defend it...But a Non-Scientist can, especially if he doesn't include any data and doesn't care about scientific principles such as controls and statistics.Based off the Pusztai conclusions, Smtih proposes what I call an \\"Anything Can Happen Model\\" of GMOs. This is based on alternative splicing, or the way one gene can code for multiple proteins. Smith gets this absolutely wrong by saying that an mRNA can be re-arranged so that it codes for whichever protein the cell needs at the moment. Real alternative splicing leads to the exclusion or inclusion of a functional domain of a protein (leading to different cellular localization or loss of 1 of 2 functions, depending on cell type).Smith talks-down to the common reader by explaining science in baby-language. He makes nonsense analogies and calls a spliceosome a \\"code-scrambler\\", introns \\"signal beacons\\" and glycosylation \\"hitchhikers\\". The second chapter is devoted to 20 ways genetic engineering can go wrong. He ends up naming various cellular processes and trying to connect it with reasons why GMOs are dangerous. It feels like a total stretch. Smith spins you around in this new scary world of science, where scientists don't know what the heck they're dealing with and every molecule is out to get you! The EFFECT IS NOT TO TEACH, IT IS TO CONFUSE!This book is an exciting read...If only real science were as exciting! Discussing the danger or safety of genetic modification is a scientific topic. If you really want to participate in it (which is great), then you will have to consider that it will take a lot of time and effort to gain the necessary background information. Safety of GMOs must be decided on a case-by-case basis, based on the presence of the transgenic protein. Also, consider that GMOs are a complex topic, with pros and cons, with the pros including reduced pesticide use (which is well-documented, not just Monsanto propaganda). Oh, and so you know, allergenicity testing is a requirement of the FDA for the release of GM crops.Pusztai Reference: [...]"},{"Title":"Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies About the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You're Eating","review":"Jeffrey Smith has given us a devastating and authoritative indictment of the safety of Genetically Modified foods, the corruption and greed of big business and of the failure of government agencies to protect us. To cover GM soy in my book \\"The Whole Soy Story,\\" I investigated Monsanto's testing methods and found numerous examples of experimental manipulation, misinterpretation, falsified conclusions and flagrant disregard of data. So I have no doubt that the testing of the FlavrSavr tomato, StarLink corn and other GM seeds was similarly inadequate, incomplete and rigged to reach favorable conclusions. I am particularly pleased that Smith honors the brilliance and integrity of Dr. Arpad Pusztai, whose honest revelation that GM potatoes cause immune, brain, and reproductive damage cost him his job and exposed him to vicious attacks by Monsanto and the British government. Here in the USA, the FDA bills itself as \\"The Nation's Foremost Consumer Protection Agency.\\" Yet its handling of GM seeds shows that it is not only being asleep on the job but in bed with big business. As consumers, we must demand independent safety assessments, let food manufacturers know that we will not eat GM foods and, most important, vote with our pocketbooks. Thank you Jeffrey Smith for giving us the evidence and motivation to do so."},{"Title":"Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies About the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You're Eating","review":"Monsanto doesn't want you to read this book. They know you will be angry. And you will be totally right to be angry.First of all, let's examine closely what a corporation like Monsanto is. Big corporations always try to get hold on a monopoly. The advantage of a monopoly is that the free market is eliminated. Think oil, central banks, patented drugs, patented pesticides, etc. More recently genetically modified seeds were developed, 75 % of which are engineered to withstand the otherwise deadly application of an herbicide - naturally : the brand the same corporation produces (\\"Roundup Ready\\"). Excellent news for stockholders of Monsanto, but what's in it for us, poor consumers ? Well, actually, as this book explains very well : absolutely nothing.This was a huge challenge for the marketing department of Monsanto to start with. They try to sell us the idea that GM crops will \\"eliminate hunger in the Third World\\". This is absurd : hunger is not caused by lack of food, but by its unequal distribution. Therefore, the Rockefeller Foundation came up with another strategy. They funded the development of \\"golden rice\\", which would \\"prevent blindness and infection in millions of children' suffering from vitamin-A deficiency\\". Or how to complicate a simple problem. Why not educate poor people to grow vegetables on the margins of their rice fields ? Or why not considering distributing vitamin A tablets ? \\"At a cost of only $.05 per tablet, only $25,000 is needed to prevent 500,000 children from going blind per year. Contrast this with golden rice, which has cost more than $100 million dollars so far, and is not yet ready\\", the author says. On top of this, the \\"golden rice\\" provides so little vitamin A a two-year-old child would need to eat seven pounds per day. Likewise, an adult would need to eat nearly twenty pounds to get the daily recommended dose.On top of that, the scarce investigation available shows that GM crops have *less nutritional value* than natural crops. Dr. Arpad Pusztai discovered that GM potatoes provide 20 % less proteins than natural species. Roundup Ready soy has also significantly lower levels of protein and other important nutrients, but higher levels of a potentially damaging lectin.Animals sense the potential danger of GM crops. If cows, hogs, mice, squirrels, elk, deer and raccoons can choose, they leave the GM crops alone. This is a huge problem when experiments are performed on GM crops. Rats didn't want to eat the \\"immortal\\" tomato - still fresh, red and ripe... 150 days after picking... They had to be force-fed this artificial \\"food\\". The rodents knew something was wrong, and they were right. Seven of forty animals died within two weeks. Consequently, the tomato was approved. Huh ? Yeah, I am sorry. If you still believe the FDA was there to protect your health, time to wake up ! The FDA considers GM crops \\"substantially equivalent\\" to natural crops, and no experiment whatsoever will change its view on this matter. The FDA has in fact turned into the Washington branch office of Monsanto and Big Pharma.Probably, you won't be aware that GM crops are abundant in the current diet, in *your* current diet. \\"GM foods are a regular part of the U.S. diet. Approximately 80 percent of the soy and 38 percent of the corn planted in the U.S. in 2003 is genetically engineered. Derivatives from these two crops are found in about 70 percent of processed foods. In addition, 70 percent of the cotton crop and more than 60 percent of the canola crop, both used for cooking oil, are also genetically modified\\".Scientists like Dr. Arpad Pusztai are astonished : \\"I find that it is very, very unfair to use our fellow citizens as guinea pigs.

The first is a very clear explanation of GM, and its risks. There is no sensationalizing, the author is well-informed and presents the information straighforwardly. That alone is quite enough to make one realize that we are in a very risky health situation. The second aspect of the book is an absolutely damning description of the FDA and the EPA and their failure in the role of protecting the food supply and the environment. These organizations have unfortunately reached the stage of being completely co-opted by corporations like Monsanto.

The author does an outstanding job in researching and documenting the stunning amount of explicit deceit on the part of the regulators, GM companies and many scientists that are involved in GM research.The way that the GM companies like Monsanto unashamedly persecute and bully those who raise safely concerns is extremely disturbing considering the potential dangers that the product poses. What is even more worrying is the distinct lack of research into the effects on humans, and what worries me even more than this is when research is done showing the harm that GM products cause, GM companies flagrantly throw their weight around to either stop the paper being published or blatantly fabricate or distort evidence to discredit the paper, even when they know that their product is unsafe. Now I'm sure that this happens in aspects of all industries, but this is entirely unacceptable with a food product, especially one as radical as GM foods.There are so many severe risks associated with GM foods that it makes me wonder if there could ever be a situation which would warrant the gamble of using GM foods.The main concern that I have about this book is it's age, although it is only six years old, six years in science years is a long time, much of the information that is presented in this book could well be obsolete by now.The author explains the complex world of biology and genetics in very easy to understand English, he gives the reader a firsthand understanding of how GM is done and the problems that manifest themselves at the fundamental gene level.I would really be hard-pressed to give this book anything less than five stars. The author addresses the issue with the uttermost impartiality and integrity.Five Stars"},{"Title":"Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies About the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You're Eating","review":"Seeds of Deception is foremost a very important book. It is important for anyone who eats food to read! It is well written and keeps one's interest all the way thru. How could it not!Learn about how our dairy farmers are injecting their cows with rBGH, a genetically engineered bovine growth hormone to increase milk production. It also gives them boob infections called mastitis. So the farmers give them shots of anitbiotics, various kinds depending on the farmer, or availability. rBGH is called \\"cow crack\\" because it speeds them up. It makes them miserable and it is all to increase milk production so that farmers get more milk subsidies from the government, not because we need more milk. And does pasteurization get rid of the rBGH? No. Are we drinking it? Yes. Are we also drinking the antibiotics? Yes. Should we be drinking organic milk? Yes. Personally I have been buying organic milk only, for over four years, and it tastes better than 'ordinary' milk. Every carton is delicious, unlike regular milk which half the time I dump down the sink because it tastes terrible.Back to the book: \\"Contrary to the assurances of the biotech companies that genetic engineering is precise and simply extends traditional breeding techniques, it is actually quite different. When genetic crops are engineered, the gene is inserted randomly, out of a sequence that has evolved over hundreds of millions of years. Although engineers assumed that each gene creates a single protein, the very recent discovery that human beings have only some 30,000 genes...shows that this premise was wrong. (until a few yrs ago it was believed that humans had approx 100,000 genes).\\"Further, genes interact; one gene may trigger other unpredicted and undesired effects.\\"....\\"The random position and lack of control of the gene's functions could change any character of the plant and might not be evident immediately.\\" \\"for example , unexpected deformities in GM soy, and cotton crops.\\" ....the accidental switching on of a host organism's gene at random...... horizontal gene transfer, where genes can jump between organisms with unpredictable consequences.G.M. DNA does in fact transfer to bacteria in the human gut - previously thought impossible.\\"... genetically modified organisms are not rigorously tested. They are not as nutritious as our old fashioned food. (In my opinion they don't taste very good either). Baby food, allergies, ...might affect sexual development in children and bowell obstruction...... food derived illnesses are doubled (cdc) in the past 7 yrs..... rise in allergies - 50% increase in soy allergies.Researchers doctor their studies to avoid finding problems with GM foods. (they could lose their research grants and/or their jobs). example: re rBGH study, cows that got sick were dropped from rBGH studies while cows that were pregnant before treatment were counted as support that the drug didn't interfere with fertility.....Conflicts of interest gallore. Suppression and vilification of scientists who try to convey research info to the public that is deemed to harm the industry. FDA corruption. \\"Former FDA Commissioner ' The thing that bugs me is that people think the FDA is protecting them. It isn't. What the FDA is doing and what the public thinks it's doing are as different as night and day.\\"Biotech industry folks working in high positions in the U.S. government. \\"Muscling the Media; threats to sue keep absolutely everyone quiet except for a brave few (like this author). Do we ever hear discussions about gm foods on television? NO. ...do animals enjoy eating gm food? No. Is the government relying on the biotech companies to test their own products? Yes. Are they actually testing their products? No.The White House, no matter the President , has always supported the biotech industry \\"at the expense of human health\\". Campaign contributions, bribery, billions of lobby dollars, threats, corruption, beyond belief. And not only in the U.S.. In Canada, Dr. Margaret Haydon tried to refuse to approve rBGH \\"due to her concerns for human health. She was taken off the case.\\"\\"Genetic engineering presents probably the largest ethical problem that science has ever had to face.\\" \\"Going ahead in this direction may be not only unwise, but dangerous. Potentially, it could breed new animal and plant diseases, new sources of cancer, novel epidemics.\\"And of course the growers of gm crops must use specific insecticides (Roundup) manufactured by the same biotech companies that made the seeds.

For $10 I expected better editing. There are numerous typos which in some cases loose the meaning of whole paragraphs. Also, this book desperately needs a new edition. The most recent information is from 2003 and most of the sitings in Seeds of Deception are from the 1990s.The sitings from the 1980s and 1990s make an excellent historic record showing the pervasive fraud and negligence in scientific studies submitted by Biotech firms such as Monsanto to the FDA ... but it is now 2012 and I would like more current information along with the historical.The book is worth buying, however, as a single cohesive publication on the Food Safety issues of genetically modified foods and food additives. It also contains practical appendixes at the end to help customers identify GM products and links to the author's website and a non GMO buying guide. Very helpful. As a health-conscious consumer I had the notion that I didn't care to purchase GMO foods but had no concrete knowledge which foods were GMO or how to avoid them. I will make some changes to my shopping & eating habits after reading this book! The real eye-opener for me was that much rennet and enzymes used in USA cheese processing are now GM. I had no idea.Seeds of Deception also refutes in a logical way the BioTech industry claims that GM food will solve world hunger - it won't. I always suspect PR gimmicks when giant corps claim altruistic goals - if they care that much why don't they just donate a percentage of profits to charity?Seeds of Deceptions deconstructs the marketing schemes which play on people's sympathy to sell unsafe products.So while I encourage buying this book to educate ourselves on food safety, it is a pretty shoddy product for the cost. Also, the writer is no Michael Pollen (who I consider the foremost writer in the field). This book would have gotten 4-5 star review with better editing and an updated edition containing more recent developments."},{"Title":"Your Personality, Your Health","review":"This book explained auras, personality and how these can affect health in a very simple and logical manner. Much has been written on auras, and I usually associate the topic of auras with books stores who sell incense... kind of &quot;New Age&quot;.

I am convinced, after reading this book, that my personality surely effects my health. I wouldn't be surprised if it had everything to do with health. At a time when much emphasis is placed on outer appearance, this book teaches one how to take care of the &quot;inside&quot;, which obviously relates to the external, and not the other way around.

There are so many tough concepts in physics and sometimes all it takes is a simple activity that the kids can see. The way I use the activities in this book, along with the others in this series, are to set them up as stations and have the kids rotate through them. It's an easy way to create hands-on learning and the kids LOVE it! This book is divided up into these categories: electricity, magnets, buoyancy, gravity, balance, flight, simple machines, inertia, motion, light, heat, and sound.

BORING! i wanted to make a compass but there wasn't even an experiment for that. here's more: to demonstrate gravity drop a book and a piece of paper. to demonstrate simple machines try to break a toothpick between your fingers. to demonstrate inertia put a tennis ball in a wagon and quickly move the wagon forward. to demonstrate light filters put your hand over a flashlight in a dark room. to demonstrate energy changes place a rubber band against your forehead. to demonstrate sound rub your wet finger around the rim of a thin glass. to demonstrate pitch blow in a straw (the book warns you may have to change the pressure of your lips and blow several times before you produce any sound...) well, this book blows! if you ask me. its just full of useless experiments, things all kids do naturally w/o instruction, like blow in straws, hold apples and cover flashlights w/their hands. to be fair i gave this book 2 stars because i haven't read or tried all the experiments in it so i don't really know if they're ALL JUNK or not. and i probably never will because i shelved the crap soon after reviewing it.

This is a gripping story...I was glued to the book till the very end."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I really enjoy Nora Roberts, but had been disappointed with some of her books that I had read lately. (Of course, they were her earlier works or the Harlequins, so it's kind of understandable.)BIRTHRIGHT delivers!If you enjoy a mystery involving kidnapping, illlegal adoptions, some murder and mayhem, AND the excitement and intrigue of an archaelogical dig, this is definitely the book for you!The dialogue is fun, \\"real\\" and snappy at times; sweet and relevatory at others.The best part about the book is that the \\"secondary\\" couple are just as interesting and just as well developed as the \\"primary\\" couple. This is unusial in this \\"type\\" of book and unusual in hers to this degree.Plus it's a real page turner! I read it in one sitting, and believe me, after just having major surgery and being quite uncomfortable, that's saying something!Buy it, enjoy it! I think you'll LOVE it! It's a great read for folks who aren't fans of hers az well!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Nora Roberts jumped on the \\"stolen baby\\" bandwagon with BIRTHRIGHT. When an archeology dig brings Callie Dunbrook to Woodsboro, Maryland, there's more in store than old bones in the ground, there are a few skeletons in Callie's closet as well. Callie comes to the dig site only to find her ex-husband, Jacob Greystone already there and part of the team. Callie agrees to work with Jake since this is the most important dig in her career.Suzanne Cullen, a successful cookie entrepreneur, sees the news reports of the dig and believes that Callie is her long lost daughter - the one taken from her stroller in a mall when she was only a few months old. Suzanne begins her quest to prove her daughter has returned.This is where it gets a bit confusing. Jake is still in love with Callie and does everything in his power to win her back. Suzanne is convinced Callie is her daughter and refuses to listen to anyone who says otherwise. Callie hires a lawyer, Lana, who is dating Doug Cullen, Suzanne's son and possibly Callie's brother. And there are other subplots too numerous to recant.There is an overload of characters in this tale and many come to the forefront and focus becomes lost. The reader is tossed from one plot to another like a piece of paper in the wind. There is the Callie/Jake angle, the Callie as a stolen baby angle, the Doug/Lana angle, the murder of a worker, and other small inconsequential stories.Even with the abundance of characters, most are well developed - the reader can understand Callie's anger with Jake, can sympathize with Jake when we are told what really happened to cause the separation, can empathize with Suzanne over the loss of her daughter and her determination to find her, and the frustration of Doug as you realize that his mother has spent her life focusing on her lost daughter instead of the son in front of her.The plot and sub plots are a bit convoluted and at times some seem minor and unnecessary. I'm not sure if Roberts had a minimum page requirement, or if she was just unfocused at times.Overall, this is a very good book and will entertain. It's not a brain quest to figure out the villain behind the murder, but it is enjoyable. BIRTHRIGHT is not Nora Roberts' best, but then again, even an average Nora Roberts book is better than most authors' most outstanding work."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Yes, I'm a huge Nora Roberts fan, but I'm willing to say when I don't like a book. Not the case with Birthright. I loved it! It made me cry tears of joy and tears of sadness for the characters. It might have something to do with my own adoption, but I really felt connected with Callie. Great job Nora!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"A good page turner but most of the character plots seemed to neat and obvious. You can almost guess the ending before it begins."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Downside: Jake &amp; Callie were very immature during their marriage. She accuses him of being unfaithful based on his past reputation and the manipulations of a vindictive woman instead of trusting him. Instead of telling her it wasn't true, he says nothing, walks out on her and sends her divorce papers. And she lets it happen.Fast forward, they're now working on a dig together. They each still blame the other for the break-up of their marriage, neither will take any responsiblity. I also didn't get Callie's attitude. She avoided love and commitment like the plague, and was rabidly independent. Why? She wasn't raised that way nor had an experience that would explain it. And it wasn't a genetic trait.Upside: It was an incredible plot. Heartbreaking, thrilling, funny and romantic all at once. The information on the dig was fascinating. I loved the secondary romance and ached for Suzanne and Jay, what a horrible experience. And although I figured out the culprit about half way through the book, the why alluded me until the end."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I love Nora Roberts. This book just didn't make it for me. I didn't care one iota about any of the characters. I felt like the dialogue was coming out of nowhere.I really liked the plot. It was the best part.

I'm just glad I got this from the library instead of shelling out $25.95."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I am a fairly new Nora Roberts fan in the last 1-2 years, and can't seem to read and listen (audiobooks) fast enough. I enjoy her ability to build characters and connect the dots in drawing them together. When I first read about \\"Birthright\\" and it being about baby kidnapping, I wasn't sure I wanted to read it, thinking perhaps it would be disturbing. But I'm glad I did. I purchased the audiobook and \\"couldn't put the tape down\\". Nora is skilled in her ability to take this horrific experience in a family's life and evolve it into one of love and hope, while trying to figure out who did this and why it happened. And then Nora also brings in the suspense of murder to the story, as the culprits try to keep anyone from finding out the answers to these questions. Though a great story, including the interesting archeological studies, there were two points of disappointment for me. The first was the ending. There is so much \\"meat\\" in the story all the way through until the epilog. It seemed flat and rushed. The second disappointment was that I wished I had read the book this time rather than listened. Other audio tapes of her books are absolutely excellent, but I found this was hard to listen too. The women's voices are fine, but it's hard to imagine a sexy young stud when he sounds like a 90 year old man with throat cancer :) For this one book, read it!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"True to her reputation, Nora hits the nail on the head with another smash. I loved the book. (I always love her books.) The first paragraph drew me in and I couldn't wait to keep reading. Like all of her other books, Roberts makes you want to devour the story and leaves you craving more. If she keeps turning out the excitement and romance, I 'll keep reading and buying the books."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Nora Roberts has long been one of my favorite romance authors. I recently read Birthright and found as Ms. Roberts has done again and again that she had me gulping down the pages till the end. I not only found myself savoring the romance portion of the book but also was equally intrigued by the suspense, which this book provided.Callie Dunbrook is an archeologist hired to work at a site where relics of an early Indian community are discovered. Expecting a certain amount of the unknown, she doesn't expect certain other events occurring at the same time. Chief among these events is a woman who seeks her out and bears a remarkable resemblance to Callie. In time the woman tells Callie that she thinks she is her daughter who was kidnapped many years before. And as if that wasn't enough suddenly Callie has to deal with the arrival of her ex-husband. While they were married he all but ignored her but now seems to be very much in love with her. And then there are a series of mysterious murders that take place at the dig, which can't be explained.Once again Ms. Roberts has presented well-depicted characters with a plot both suspenseful and interesting. Touching on topics such as illegal adoptions, the rights of preservationists vs. land developers and legal issues concerning who profits from found antiquities, Birthright is another good Nora Roberts book which takes its rightful place among so many others good titles."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I won't bore readers with my own synopsis of the book; others have already done much better than I could. However, a best selling author should have her facts checked carefully. I'm sure she can afford good researchers. No aboriginal peoples could have chiseled a cow for archaeologists to find (as they did in this book). They had never seen one. No cows in North America before 1611.Secondly, no university would permit a dig to continue with people dying all over the site. Liability!If you don't mind suspending reality, you may enjoy Birthright. In my humble opinion, Nora Robert's Birthright doesn't hold a candle to any of Beverly Connor's archaeological mystery novels."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I can't believe I'm writing a less than stellar review of any Nora Roberts book, but this one just didn't work for me. I adore NR &amp; all of her books - trilogies, magic, mysteries, etc. and was excited to read &quot;Birthright&quot;, however, less than halfway through I was totally annoyed with the book. The main characters were so unlikeable, particulary the woman (why is rude &amp; nasty loveable in some of NR's books?) &amp; the storyline just bounced around too much. I found myself, for the first time w/a NR book, skimming through some of the pages.Now that being said, I am enjoying NR's newest trilogy (I've just started the 2nd book) and never find these magical storylines boring - different strokes for different folks I guess."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I liked this book the best of any Nora Roberts I've read - and I've read, and own, them all. I marveled as I read this at how much Nora has grown as an author, how complex and layered the story she told in this great book. Other authors have compared old bones to current suspenseful stories, but none has made me care so much about the current stories.In Birthright, there are not one but two complete love stories, and a third implied, all woven together with a sophisticated, suspenseful plot that kept me turning pages, absolutely riveted. What I particularly loved about the main characters in this story was the witty irreverent humor, the smart-alec tone, the brains behind the exchanges. &quot;Well that's...fetched,&quot; says the hero. &quot;Fetched?&quot; inquires the heroine. &quot;Not quite far-fetched, but fetched.&quot; Wonderful, witty stuff. You can tell that Nora's smart, and it's a joy to read these kinds of exchanges.For anyone who loves an intricate and suspenseful story that never takes its eye off the romance, for those who love brainy characters not afraid to act smart, and for *any* Nora Roberts fan, this is an outstanding book. Buy it! Read it! You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I just reread this book for the second time. I haven't read it since it came out a few years ago. I enjoyed it this time around as much as I did the first time. The book has everything, mystery, romance, humor, and sadness. It's an emotionally charged book that keeps you hanging on til the end. The main plot is around Callie an archeologist who has her life turned around after appearing on TV. She is approached by a woman (Suzanne)who is convinced she is the daughter who was taken from her stroller in a mall when she was an infant. After some investigating and tests, Suzanne is proved correct. But a baby stealing/selling scheme is uncovered in the process. Callie is determined to get to the bottom of it. While that is going on she has to deal with her ex-husband Jake being brought in on her dig, he's an anthropologist. I don't want to get into too much detail and ruin all the surprises but there are several wonderful relationships being developed, reconciled and explored. Callie has a new family and it is interesting to watch everyone get to know eachother and heal after this upheaval. It is a wonderful love story and mystery. I think this book would appeal to anyone who just loves good fiction."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Normally I like Nora Roberts, but this book was a very tough read. Callie, the main character, was not likeable whatsoever. She was nasty throughout the entire book with a filthy mouth. She did not come across as strong or self-sufficient, just nasty. It was not entertaining, just tiresome. I started skimming towards the end because I just wanted to get through it.The end was anti-clamatic, didn't really settle the issue of two sets of parents.

Her ex husband Jake is also contracted to work at the dig where they are certain that the ruins of the site of a pre-historic village will be uncovered.A local builder and several of his employees are disgruntled at the prospect of the dig becoming of historical importance, therebye causing the cessation of a plan to build an estate of affordable housing for the locals.Several murders occurr on the site, threatening to close it down and, as well, Callie is confronted with secrets from her childhood involving a baby kidnapping ring. It's an ok story but I must confess to finding the heroine irritating to say the least and after she'd kicked her ex husband in the ankles repeatedly, thought that she deserved a good slap around the legs herself !"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"This book seemed great from the description I read of it before it was published. The main characters (especially Callie) had promise and I liked a lot of Roberts' ideas. However I think there was too much going on at once in this book - archaeology, a new building development, a romance between two ex's, a long and complex kidnapping plot and several murders. I felt the archaeology dig was a rather dry and boring setting. I felt that the last few pages, as people here have mentioned, were really \\"mailed in\\". The ending was contrived to the point that you couldn't figure out whodunnit because you didn't even know more than a few chracters in the book anyways (and the ones you did know were the 2 couples). Jake wasn't all that well-developed, usually I think one of Roberts' greatest strengths is developing the males so well. I agree with the reviewer who said he/she was getting sick of all the Irish or mysticism stories, so I was hoping this book would be a nice change. However it was also disappointing to me.Frankly I'm kind of surprised by all the really positive reviews for this book because I found it contrived, jumbled, unbelievable and not very engaging. I think some of Roberts' best books are: True Betrayals, the Dream series, Public Secrets, Honest Illusions, and most especially, the In Death series. For books featuring sets of couples, I think Montana Sky and Sanctuary were great and Three Fates was quite good. Birthright is, to me, quite forgettable and not worth picking up, especially in hardcover."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"In an innocuous mall, a mother comforts her three-year-old son taking her eyes off her three-month-old daughter, when someone kidnaps the baby. Twenty-nine years later Suzanne Cullen watches a TV news clip about a Maryland archeological dig when she instantly recognizes her daughter, the site's archeologist Callie Dunbrook. When Suzanne makes contact with Callie, the forensic archeologist is sure the woman is lying because she knows she is not adopted.Suzanne plants just enough doubt in Callie's mind for her to sneak into her father's private files where she is shocked to see the adoption papers. Her parents swear that they adopted her in good faith through a lawyer who specialized in private adoptions. Callie vows that she will find the people connected to the black market scheme and expose them. Her ex-husband Jake is backing her all the way. There are some people who want the past to stay buried and are perfectly willing to kill to make that happen.Nora Roberts has written a very creative romantic suspense thriller where innocent bystanders having nothing to do with the black market adoption scam are killed; thus adding a touch of authenticity to the taut plot. The heroine and her ex-husband, who are slowly working their way back to each other, realize that some amoral person lacking any conscience is using misdirection to confuse and wear them down. Callie is a strong resilient woman who bends but never breaks even when the shocks and traumas keep happening. BIRTHRIGHT is a splendid drama that cannot be put down until the finale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Birthright is one of the best books I've read all year! A spellbinding pageturner that I couldn't put down! It's multi-faceted with interesting settings, strong (and quite headstrong) characterizations, and the perfect blend of action, drama, emotions and suspense. The details given to the main plots - the archaelogical dig and the babyselling ring - are impeccible."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"This is one of those books that once you start reading its very hard to put down. It has romance, adventure and murder. Callie Dunbrook is an archaeologist who while on a dig dicovers more than century old bones. It turns out she may have been kidnapped as a 3 month old infant from her biological parents and sold to another family. Its a very intriguing story because the more she tries to connect to her past the more certain people try to stop her adding danger to her life and her loved ones. Complicating her life is her ex-husband Jake who is also an archaeologist working with her side by side. The attraction is still there from both sides causing Callie to really think about her life. There are lots of twists and turns making this a very enjoyable reading experience. If you like Nora Roberts you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"The things I learned from reading this book is unbelievable.

Not being to thrilled at having her rest interrupted she still makes the appointment. After finding out what has happened she is ready to go.She soon discovers that this is a true archaeology find, and calls to have a team started on digging carefully through the dirt. The only drawback to having her superiors choose a team is the fact that they send her worst enemy, her Ex-husband Jacob Graystone. Now the dirt will fly, for although she still loves him she cannot trust him because of what she thinks he did.Graystone, is more than happy to be working with his ex wife. He never wanted to separate to begin with. He just needs time to get Callie to trust him, and working on this dig may just give them time to do that.Soon it becomes known that not all is as it should be. Between the truth of Callie's childhood and things that are happening at the dig, danger is everywhere and we are wondering while we read if everything is all tied in together.As I guessed before I started reading, this was another great read by Nora Roberts. She is one of those Authors that you can always depend on to write a spellbinding novel for her fans. This reviewer would recommend BIRTHRIGHT to anyone searching for that perfect book to sit read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"This book was great until it came to the end.

She is about to discover how much she is loved.**** This is a tender story about a quest for truth, and defining love. Ms Roberts uses none of the melodrama typical of long lost child stories.

Half of the town thought it was great that they were building some new homes in the area - the building brought jobs and the new families would breathe new life into the little town. The other half of the town wanted to preserve the beautiful area which sat by a tranquil pond as a nature conservation area. However, nature lost out to commercialism and the Antietam Creek development was underway when a construction worker found a human skull while he was digging.When archaeologist Callie Dunbrook discovered that the skull was 5,000 years old, she jumped at the chance to go and excavate. This could be the find of the century and make her career. Not even the discovery that Jake Greystone, her ex-husband, would be the anthropologist on site could keep her away. Callie throws herself into her work, but quickly has her world pulled out from under her. Suzanne Cullen, owner and founder of Suzanne's Kitchen, a successful bakery business, spots Callie on TV and knows that Callie is her long lost Jessica, her baby who was stolen when she was only a few months old.Callie refuses to believe it. Her parents never said anything about adoption and she thinks that Suzanne is not very mentally stable to boot. Unfortunately, Callie soon learns that she was adopted and that her parents paid a quarter of a million dollars for the privilege. Callie knows that she cannot be the daughter that Suzanne has always waited for, but she is determined to bring those responsible to justice. But as Callie uncovers dark secrets she discovers that someone is determined to keep the past buried - even if they have to kill for it...I think that this is one of Nora Roberts best romantic thrillers. Her characters are absolutely riveting in this book and I identified with and loved them all. Callie, who loved her parents and thought that being independent was the only way to be free; Jake, who thought that expressions of love didn't have to be verbal and that if there was no trust there was no love; Suzanne, a woman who had sacrificed everything including her husband and her other child to find the child that she had lost; Lana Campbell, Callie's beautiful, capable lawyer who had lost her husband in a senseless shooting and now found herself falling in love again; Doug Cullen, as Callie's older brother, he hated himself for not taking care of the baby Jessica and didn't know if he wanted a sister in his life; and many, many other characters. Lana and Doug had a nice secondary romance going on and Suzanne started to fit her life back together again in the book. The villains were great, evil and a little insane and a complete surprise (to me, at least). The icing on the cake was the archaeological and anthropological detail that Roberts included, which was absolutely fascinating. A great read - well worth your time!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Nora Roberts has become my favorite female author and with each new release she proves anew her sublime mastery as a writer. I love the evolution of her dialog between parties. It is hip, ultra sophisticated, educational, always informative and just plain real. Personally, I adore her as J.D. Robb and her Lt. Eve Dallas stories most of all, but it is impossible to ignore anything she writes.This novel is like a tour de force, both texbook and site exploration, of an archeological dig with a murder mystery and hot,hot,hot romances tossed in to keep all the intensity glowing. It is also a very emotional exploration of abducted/adopted children and the reunion that confronts those who must meet their birth parents or child whether or not they wish to on either side of the issue.Callie, the heroine is just perfect with her sharp intellect and the veneer of tough as nails professional role. Her background as an archeologist who beds down in sleeping bags rather than in plush comfort accorded her throughout her life by her rich adoptive parents showcases Roberts' amazing skills as an author. She makes characters who are palpably real, multidimensional and believable and she can walk in any one's shoes. That is an incredible imagination.The author's own emotional maturity shines best when Callie is thrown for a loop upon learning of her abduction and adoption. She is struggling to develop a more compassionate self toward her bad-boy ex-husband who has been hired as the anthropologist on site for the dig's duration, and she is tormented by her lingering passion for him that has never been extinguished.Her greatest trial apart from being stalked by a murderer with herself as a target is in being forced to meet her birth mother who is a bit unhinged from her grief over her daughter's abduction nearly 30 years ago, and the reality that she is alive. Callie's struggle is to be open to her birth mother and yet remain true to her own parents. The pain is very deep and one can feel it.Overall, this is a bittersweet tale but one that is so rich with facts and facets woven so skillfully throughout her prose that it is another of Roberts' books that I found simply irresistible."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Though the hero &amp; heroine deserve to have their mouths washed with soap for their frequent use of foul language, this book is definitely worth reading as it's entertaining. It's suspenseful as well as emotive. There were no boring moments as the story does not drag. It's no wonder that Nora Roberts is one of the few authors whom I would shell out the big bucks to buy her works in hard cover rather than wait for it to be printed in paperback."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"When a worker at an Antietam Creek construction site uncovered a five thousand-year-old human skull, construction work stopped and experts were called in.

I read it by candlelight during a power outage. If that doesn't tell how good this book is nothing else will."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I found it difficult to like and stay interested in a main character who was rude, immature, self centered, frequently lost her temper like a child and who used foul language indiscriminately. I was also dumbfounded that a person intelligent enough to obtain her doctorate would be stupid enough to go to an isolated constuction site alone and confront a bunch of construction workers, yell at them using foul language and actually physically push one of them. And that was not the only time Callie put herself in mortal danger with very illogical behavior. I was sorry I wasted my time on this one."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Birthright started out in a very exciting way - a spirited, independent, unique heroine, an archaeological find in a construction site, a discovery and a dig, and a handsome ex-husband - wow! Then it went downhill. There were too many plots, subplots and characters - it was hard to keep it all straight. Lana and Doug were interesting, but I could not sense any chemistry between them - their romance seemed contrived and fake. Callie and Jake fared better, and their dialogue was really sharp and fun (and I liked it that Callie had her faults - it made her more human), but Suzanne was just plain weird, and the mystery was a disappointment - there was no clue about the murderer until the last pages. Also, it was tiring to wade through the clutter of characters and plots - I found myself skimming parts of the book. I think cutting out the Lana/Doug romance (keeping the characters - I liked them, and maybe hitching Lana with someone totally unlikely, like Digger, for comic relief), and cutting out some of the extraneous characters and plots, and strengthening the mystery, would have made it a much stronger book."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Though nothing can top the Reef as Roberts' best book to date, I found Birthright to be an exciting read. The characters were not quite so static as usual, although Jake could have been more well developed as Callie's ex-husband. I only wish that Roberts had written the first part of their relationship together, instead of keeping us guessing as to what actually happenend. Even flashbacks would have worked nicely. The only disappointment to this book was the ending. It was abrupt, confusing, and unsuspenseful. It seemed like Nora got tired of writing, and left us readers in the dust. I usually spend the entire book guessing &quot;who did it?&quot; but with Birthright that was nearly impossible, because the supporting characters were not well developed. The book had a bit too much going on at once-- an archeological dig, finding Jake, Lana's relationship, Callie's new mother, the murders-- all were a bit overwhelming. But Callie was a very real character, as was Lana, and they worked nicely. I hope Roberts continues to write &quot;fun&quot; books though, as this was a bit sappy. We need adventure in our lives, and we rely on Roberts to bring a little piece in. An enjoyable read, 3 1/2 stars!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I was looking forward to Birthright because the plot sounded really good. A thirty year old Callie Dunbrook finds out that she was adopted and learns she was kidnapped from her stroller at three months.It was a major disappointment. There were too many plot lines going on that you got lost. I didn't like the main charactor Callie at all. She was raised in a loving home so why did she have a hard time accepting love and trust? Neither of her birth or adoptive parents had problems in that department. Even her reason for it didn't make any sense. She blamed it on her adoptive parents' relationship but not once during the whole book did you ever see an example of it.Her language was bad and mouthing off to anyone and everyone got old really fast.The real reason behind the murders was so farfetched it didn't make any sense neither did the end of the story. From the final climax you expect me to believe one person managed to knock out, drug and tie up four people?Would of liked Callie's relationship with her birth parents to of been worked out more. More of Suzanne and Jay working out their problems and getting back together.I did like the charactor Lana. Usually the dead husband is protrayed as evil or a jerk it was a nice (an realistic) change that she loved her late husband and realized she could move on with her life and Doug.I did like that Suzanne and Jay were portrayed very realistically as parents who's child was kidnapped but I think they deserved a little bit more at the end.The fact the person responsible for the kidnapping and black market ring will never have to pay for the crimes made the story fall flat. After all the suffering all those years Suzanne and Jay deserved to face the man who arranged their daughter's kidnapping.I felt like they were playing down the crime. Sure Callie ended up having a great life but that doesn't change the fact she was kidnapped and sold on the black market. She spends more time whining then being angry about the whole crime. Her immature additude at Jake was annoying. Jake came across as a good guy but I couldn't imagine why he liked Callie especially since I didn't even like her.Defently not the best Nora Roberts book. No where near True Betrayels, Public Secrets and all the other great books. Hopefully the next one will be much better"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"This is the first book I've read by Nora Roberts and probably the last. I picked up the book because the topics of archeology, Maryland and Robert's popularity were intriguing. After 50 pages, I just speed-read the book to get the plot (mostly about an adoption/kidnapping, which was not what I expected). I found I could skip page upon page and still get the story (which maybe could be witten in 10 or 15 pages). I know Roberts is popular, but this book was like a worn-out, unnecessary, mediocre, lukewarm &quot;romance&quot; with potenitally semi-serious plot (archeology, land disputes, legal-medical issues around adoption) which drown amidst the &quot;need&quot; for romance. Also Roberts tries to sound too &quot;hip&quot; citing rock groups, etc. I felt like this book was really pandering to the readers. So, guess what, I don't recommend it!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I had to drive to Sacramento and back and so picked up a Nora Roberts book to listen to on the drive. Roberts is a great standby for these sorts of trips because her books are predictably entertaining and fun. Unfortunately, \\"Birthright\\" gave me trouble. Don't get me wrong; the story itself was of the usual Roberts high caliber if not even a little better than some. The problem stemmed from the reader of the audio version. Sometimes I've found that readers try just a little too hard and in this book, it showed.I appreciate the reader trying to differentiate between the characters by using slightly modified voices, but in this recording, it was incredibly overdone to the point of distraction. There got to be times when I would grimace when a certain character or another came back into the plot because the faked dialect was so irritating.If I had it to do over, I'd save this book to curl up with on the couch on a rainy day and choose another to listen to for 14 hours in the car. You may want to consider doing the same."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Nora Roberts continues to amaze me! I love the way she rights about families. She was recently in our local Wal*Mart store for a book signing and was so courteous to everyone and patiently signed everyone's book even over her alloted time frame.

What an imagination!Was very pleased to learn thru an article in November 2002 Good Housekeeping that the Kayla to whom she dedicates \\"Birthright\\" is her new grandchild! Many thanks to Nora and hopefully she will continue to blow us away with her many talents!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I didn't enjoy this book as much as I'd hoped. On the plus side: good sense of place, good characters (except Callie), good if improbable plot. Too much downside, though.Callie, the main female protagonist, I found beyond irritating. Why is it that too many authors in this genre have to make heroines like this? Instead of smart and strong, we have to have aggressive, profane, out-of-control. Physically and emotionally abusive. And of course, in moments of crisis, her thought faculties turn off. She has panic attacks, can't think, goes all wildly reactive and does incredibly stupid stuff. From which, of course, the male protagonist, who unlike the female, remains lucid and focused, rescues her. Gawd... phuleeeze.The good plot got overwhelmed by far, far too much inner dialog, too much discussion of \\"feeeeeelings.\\" Not that these were an inappropriate focus in the book, just that too much time was focused on them. I kept wanting to get past the naval-gazing and get back to the story.I've read plenty of Roberts, but this is far, far from her best effort."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"In a smalltown in America, there is some controversy over whether or not 30 more houses should be built in the surrounding countryside. So when the builders dig up the remains of what turns out to be a neolithic settlement, they are very frustrated while their opponents are only too happy to call in archeologists. One of them is Callie Dunbrook, a young woman who's very successful in her field. She is soon joined by several other archeologists, including her ex-husband Jake. Soon the sparks begin to fly again between the two who never stopped loving each other but were unable to get along the first time around. While they are trying to do things better this time and in the midst of the conflict between those who want the area to be protected while others want to build, Callie is confronted with her unknown past. A local woman whose baby daughter was stolen 29 years ago sees the similarity between Callie and the women in her family. When Callie starts digging, she finds out that she actually was adopted - illegally. But the people who are still making money by stealing and selling babies won't stop at anything to stop her investigation - not even murder...Nora Roberts writes a lot of books, a lot of them really good, some rather mediocre. This is one of the good ones, in my opinion. The archeological elements are well done and believable, the thriller elements are great, and the romantic elements are also very enjoyable and convincing. In this respect it's not just Callie's and Jake's story, which I enjoyed very much because it shows two people who really love each other, but need to take the time to really get to know each other and work on themselves to make their relationship work. You don't find that kind of depth very often in modern romance books. In addition you get the love story between Callie's brother Doug and her lawyer Lana. Here we have a man who saw the relationship between his parents go to pieces over his sister's kidnapping and who also has to develop as a human being to be able to risk loving someone. Lana is a widow with a young kid who finds it difficult to love someone again after her husband's murder. To a small degree, the relationship between Callie's birthparents also plays a role. So all in all, these are adult relationships in which there's not just blind passion and happy forevers, but people with problems who are willing to work on their relationships. I really liked this book for that alone. So I'd definitely recommend it as a good read. If you enjoy this, you might want to try the books she writes under the name J. D. Robb, starting with Innocent in death. To me they're by far the best Nora Roberts has written.Innocent In Death"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"As the previous reviewers have already stated, this story encompasses many plots; all of which are interesting and somehow tie to one another. Callie Dunbrook, archeologist, out on a dig of a lifetime with a surprise addition to her team - her ex-husband/anthropologist, Jake Graystone. Not only do Callie and Jake discover each other and the remnants of a lost settlement in the town of Woodsboro, MD, Callie has a bigger surprise in store for her - the discovery of a birth mother, father and brother that could possibly be more fact than fiction. This story plays many different angles, but Nora ties them all together with some really lovable characters - Doug, Lana, little Ty, Suzanne, Jay, Vivian and Elliott as the parents and siblings as well as the team, and I especially like Digger! Definitely a Nora book you won't want to miss - Birthright is a great find."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Archaeologist Callie Dunbrook has always been fascinated with the past, which is one of the things that makes her one of the best in her profession. When she is called to Antietam Creek, Maryland where a construction crew has found a five thousand year old human skull, she has no idea the turn her life is going to take. Once on site, she gets a visit from Suzanne Cullen, who saw her on the news and is convinced that she is the daughter that was taken from her when she was three months old. Callie is first incredulous and then, when it starts to seem like the truth, devestated. When she feels herself falling apart, she not only has her work to retreat to, but she also has Jake, her ex-husband, whom she never stopped loving.Anthropologist Jacob Graystone has been called to Antietam Creek, which gives him not only the chance to do the job that he loves, but to win Callie back. When Callie learns the secret that has her world crashing down around her, Jake vows that he will be there for her to lean on, and finally, to trust. Together, Jake and Callie start to unravel the mystery behind Callie's kidnapping when she was an infant. The tale that Roberts' has woven will horrify the reader as it is so easy to imagine it being reality.Roberts keeps the reader hooked with the danger, sexual tension, and emotion, not only between these two people, but the secondary characters as well. Callie is the heroine that the reader loves to read about, someone who is strong and feels comfortable in her own skin. Jake is the hero that we all want to know, an intensely dangerous man who just oozes sex appeal. Roberts definitely has a hit in Birthright!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"It barely took me two days to read this. I couldn't put it down. From the first chapter she had me hooked once again!!!

Here I feel that the standard has dropped somewhat - that's not to say it was'nt readable - it just was'nt great and that is what I've come to expect from this consistently talented author.The book had too many plotlines going on all at once for me - there was Callie the archeologist on an exciting dig, meeting up with ex-hubby Jake on the site, finding out she was adopted, dealing with her adoptive parents who had never told her this news, meeting her birth mother and her brother, brothers susequent relationship with the lawyer Callie hires to find out her past - she was stolen and sold as a black market baby - and then the murders start.......... I'm exhausted just trying to remember it all.As a result of all this, the characters personalities were under-developed and it was harder to get &quot;into&quot; the storyline, the supporting players who normally provide good back-drop and suspects for all the murder and mayhem barely left an impression and so when the &quot;final curtain&quot; came it was all a bit anti-climatic....Having said all that, it did hold the interest to the end and if it were a first novel by anyone else it would be a 4 star..... it's just not vintage Nora."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I was impressed by this new N.R. book. I have been reading NR for many years now and felt her stories were on the decline, but this book was definitely a winner. The story involves an anthropologist/archeologist, and by far their work and the insight into what they do was the best part. The storyline was fairly decent as well - following the female lead as she searched for answers about her parentage. There were actually several strong love stories in this book - the one between the lead characters, the sibling, and even the parents - there was no shortage of romance, and the writing was believable for the lead characters since they were ex's and already had a history together. The only downfall in this book was the ending - particularly the last 3 pages - it was completely fake and didn't flow with the rest of the book at all; the ending was very rushed and didn't seem realistic given the intelligence of the lead characters."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"The plot sounded really good a thirty year old Callie Dunbrook finds out that she was adopted and learns she was kidnapped from her stroller at three months.

I thought Callie was, frankly, very annoying. As a big fan of the &quot;In Death&quot; series, I thought I saw a little recycling of &quot;Eve&quot; in Callie, but without her humor and heart. I thought the story line about Callie running into her true parents while on the &quot;dig&quot; a bit far fetched and ultimately I wasn't particularly touched by any of that story line. As always, Mrs. Robert's does her research and the technical look at a &quot;dig&quot; was interesting. Given all the books this prolific author turns out every year, I guess I can't complain when one of them lets me down. She is still one of the best writers out there for romance and mainstream romance/thriller genre."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I really enjoyed this mystery, Lots of twist.

And, I really enjoyed it.I did not care for the main character. She was too virile, and she seems like she is mad at the entire world. And for what? Maybe if the author had really delved into her personality a bit more, I could understand where the anger was coming from.I have rarely found any authors that write good dialogue. So, her dialogue could have been fine-tuned.So, I'll give this story 3-stars."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"My father and I both loved this story.

Yes, I have read better book this so far is HER best."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Dr. Callie Dunbrook is an archaeologist. When she is called back from sabbatical to head the Antietam Creek dig, she knows it is the opportunity of a lifetime. Finding a 5,000-year-old human skeleton in Woodsboro, Maryland is just too fantastic to believe. It is such a great scientific discovery, but as Callie will find, it is to become even more of a self-discovery than she could have ever dreamed possible.Once on site, Callie learns that her ex-husband, Jacob (Jake) Greystone, will be the lead anthropologist on the dig. She is very upset because their divorce was anything but agreeable. However he is one of the best, if not the best, anthropologist in the country, so he has certainly earned the job. Except for sparks flying with her ex-husband, all goes well on the project until Suzanne Cullen sees Callie during an interview with the local TV news. Suzanne is convinced that Callie is her daughter who was stolen 28 years ago when \\"little Jessica\\" was only three months old.Things begin to get even more complicated when the landowner of the Antietam Creek dig is murdered. He had planned to build houses on the site until the bones were discovered. Why was he sneaking around the dig site? Who would want to murder him, and why? Could Callie possibly be the same Jessica that Suzanne Cullen has been seeking all these years? How can Callie fulfill her responsibilities as head archaeologist without killing, or at least maiming, her ex-husband?This is the first Nora Roberts book I have read. If her other books are anything like this one, I have lots of enjoyable reading to catch up on. This book is excellent. The writing is wonderful. The character development and the plot are first rate. I am not usually one who cares a lot about romance but the author did attraction/repulsion so well in the story that it was truly complimentary to the plot and enhanced the characters' personalities. The mystery piece of the story was spun as well as any master storyteller could have weaved the threads.Unfortunately I wasn't expecting a lot when I began to read BIRTHRIGHT. Some highly well known authors have sorely disappointed me lately. Since I have never read anything by Ms. Roberts before, I was afraid it would be more of the same. What a refreshing experience to find this was not so. Her words flow so smoothly and the characters are real enough to touch. She made me care about the characters and how the story would be resolved. I can't say enough good things about the book, so I will just say to read it for yourself. You'll be glad you did.--- Reviewed by Barb Wright"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I was given Birthright by a friend. Although I read a lot, I had never read any books by Nora Roberts. I found the book to be an excellent read. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. It had a believable plot and I could easily see the characters as I was reading. This won't be the last book of Nora Roberts that I read."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Wonderful story, believable characters, great romance with an excellent twist at the end. This is a must have for NoraRobert fans!!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Well, I just skipped the whole summary thing and go straight to what I think about it ...I think it was one of Nora's most creative books. The story flows on and on and on, I realized that I just spent my sleeping time finishing this book. Although I didn't care that much for murder stuffs ... I enjoyed reading each characters, and of course, the the love stories. Callie and Jake sparked all the way. Lana and Doug were lovable. Heck, I even liked Digger!! Great one liners (\\"No coffee, no brain. I'm lucky I can speak in simple declarative sentences\\") ... some crackled me up. And I loved the the last 3 pages ... I think it was kinda cute.A simple favorite"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Where is the fire, the magic of our beloved Nora? It's not in Birthright. I plodded through it, page by page. Too many details. I could excavate an archialogical dig myself from this book - I guess some would say that's great - I'd agree. Once.The characters were pretty good, her typical fiery woman and man. But we keep asking ourselves, should we care?I finished the book and was glad when I did. Then I re-read some awesome older Nora works because she is the best - no matter what. And you have to read the best. Since she has plenty of other womderful works out there, don't bother with this one.Find one of her jewels and read it!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"The characters were very appealing in this book, and it was nice to get a Nora novel that was neither mystical nor Irish, nor the Irish mysticism combination. I'm not opposed to either of those things, but after reading over a hundred books from Roberts it starts to look the same. And the forthcoming \\"Key\\" series, god help us, looks to be more of the mystical same. That said, I would say that the main weakness of the book was a totally contrived resolution of the murder plot--- if you buy the motivations here, you're more generous a reader than I am. But I also, as with other recent books, wanted more of the main couple. If I'm going to buy a book in hardback, the couple has to be at the center and the suspense has to be well done. I keep looking for Roberts to return to the glory days of Public Secrets--- one of her best. The Villa began to approach the kind of Nora I like, but yet again, the main couple didn't get enough time. After Montana Sky-- which was great--- she seemed unable to sustain a hardback that placed one couple in the center. So I'm hoping she takes more time to develop her characters and the suspense plot in the future--- two things that have gotten more inconsistent over the years. (And another minor quibble--- as usual, her portrayal of academics, is ridiculous. They are all at the top of their fields by thirty, getting their Ph.D.s in five seconds, and NONE of them like to teach [and in this book, they somehow manage to be academics who never have to be in the classroom]. What do you have against teachers, Nora? While you've had a bunch of them in your books, they are always fleeing from the profession. I know teaching might not be exciting for a romantic suspense novel, but can't you ever have people going happily back to teaching when they are done with the danger and living happily ever after? Yes, I am a teacher, so this is a pet peeve.)"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I love Nora Roberts work and I am always amazed by the quality to the number of books she cranks out a year. I really have to say she has out done herself this year as I think this was one of her best books yet. I also felt this way about her last \\"In Death \\" installment to her mystery series written as J. D. Robb. This book was a thriller all the way though, turning the pages and not wanting to put the book down.In a mall around Christmas time a mother rushes to her three year old son who is scared of Santa. She turns back and her three month old daughter is gone! 28 years later this mother is watching TV and she sees her daughter. DR Callie Dunbrook, who is an archeologist on a site in Maryland where this child had been taken years ago. This mother Suzanne Cullen contacts Callie and Callie knows this woman is grasping at straws because she is not adopted.Well, Callie who snoops around, she is a digger now, finds out she was adopted. Her parents promise she was adopted in good faith. Callie is determined to get to the bottom of this black market baby stealing for everybody's peace of mind. Callie's ex husband is assigned to the same dig and he backs her all the way. But there are people who do not want Callie digging around and will even kill to stop her.This book was very creatively written, a true Nora Roberts romantic suspense thriller. Where innocent people was tangled up in this drama and even killed along the way. This was a book you could not put down for a minute. You do not want to miss this one. I really think it was one of her best!!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Nora Roberts' prolific generation of novels has run the gamut from witchcraft on the New England coast to futuristic mysteries sizzling with attraction. Her latest endeavor carries uniqueness all its own, with its crafty combination of suspense and sensual romance.Archaeologist Callie Dunbrook's current assignment is to supervise a dig at an Antietam Creek, Maryland construction site. Finding human remains over five thousand years old, Callie needs more help at the site. When that help comes in the form of her sexy ex-husband Jake, Callie is furious with her supervisor, even as she continues to fight her attraction for Jake. While locals are angry at their loss of employment with the construction halted, seemingly innocuous pranks turn into murderous \\"accidents\\". Coinciding with the archeological find is the claim by local businesswomen Suzanne Cullen, that Callie is really her long-lost daughter, stolen as an infant.Tough, beautiful, and brilliant, Callie is the epitome of a strong female lead character. Her romantic sparring with Jake creates a sexual tension that keeps an even pace with the mystery, as Callie discovers that the accidents at the site may be related to her unearthing of her past including an illegal adoption ring. Earthy, compelling characters are the driving forces behind this mystery/romance, entrancing the reader from the get go, in a package that is quite possibly Ms. Roberts' best effort to date..."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Callie Dunbrook is an acclaimed archaeologist at the top of her game, but one appearance on television changes her life forever.

It is now one of my favorites. I have been on geology digs, so I really liked the setting of this story. There was good rapport and chemistry between Jake and Callie. They made a very likeable couple. The secondary characters were also an important part of the story.

Suzanne never recovers from this shattering loss and the rest of her family suffers in numerous ways. Twenty-nine years later, archaeologist Callie Dunbrook is called in to investigate the discovery of a 5,000 year old civilization found buried in Suzanne's hometown. Can Callie be the kidnapped baby Suzanne has never stopped searching for? Can the young woman reared in an upperclass Boston home face the possiblity that she has another family, that the only family she has ever known has lied to her and could even be baby thieves? When Callie Dunbrook begins to uncover her past she uncovers truths which reveal the sordid side of the medical profession and human nature. Meanwhile, her mission of uncovering truths about the buried civilization throws her into contact with her unforgettable ex-husband Jacob Graystone. Their fiery and passionate feelings for each other let Nora Roberts take you to the depths of the lusty romance that has made her beloved by millions of readers.Callie unearths many deceptions and sorrows as she struggles to reconstruct the incident that changed her life. Assisting her is beautiful lawyer Lana Campbell, a young widow with a fascinating attraction to Callie's brother. Two torrid romances and one heart-stopping suspense story make this an exciting book from its poignant opening to its final shocking discovery."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I was almost ready to stop reading Nora Roberts, because it felt as though her plots were getting tired, and so many of her heros were jerks (at least according to me). Imagine my surprise when I read \\"Birthright,\\" an interesting story that weaves together plot threads of Callie Dunbrook discovering a new identity with the very interesting archeological dig, while rekindling her relationship with her very sexy ex-husband, Jacob. The story is interesting, and the characters well-developed - I particularly liked the episode where Lana has a bad day, instead of being as perfect as so many of Nora Robert's heroines are. The major attraction of the book for me, though, was watching Callie and Jake attempt to get beyond their problems and established patterns and really work on their relationship. That really sold me.I'm giving this four stars rather than five, because the ending was rushed and the climax UNBELIEVABLY contrived, but, other than that, I really enjoyed this book. I hope she writes more like it."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"This is the best Nora Roberts has done in a very long time. Not that anything she writes is bad, but this one is simply classic Nora, along the lines of \\"Sanctuary\\" and others of her best works.Simply put (there are lots of satisfying plot lines to sort out), feisty and beautiful Callie Dunbrook, a thirty-something archaeologist, begins work on what promises to be one of the decade's major finds--smack in the middle of the Civil War town of Antietam Creek--and discovers much more than bones and artifacts. A shocking truth about her past, combined with the equally shocking appearance at the dig of her ex-husband, anthropologist Jake Graystone, has her in a turmoil.As Callie and Jake struggle to work together without letting their equally hot tempers explode in the stifling heat, the mystery of Callie's past threatens to surround and destroy everything they are working for and everything they are. And they are only two of a group of equally engrossing people, both on the dig and off.Absolutely first-rate Nora, and the perfect beach book. Buy it and give yourself a real summer treat."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Nora Robert's books are always winners, I am never disappointed with her stories or the caliber of her writing and this book is no exception. I am amazed how she can keep writing new and exciting stories.Years ago, a baby girl was stolen/kidnapped from the local mall during christmas- leaving a devestated mother, brother. Now, Callie Dunbrook is an archeologist who is digging a site with her ex husband. Suzanne sees Callie and immediately knows it is her kidnapped daughter- she contacts Callie, but callie know she is mistaken, she is not adopted!Of course, she is mistaken and Callie ( with the help of her ex husband, Jake) begins to uncover the mystery of her life. However, this immediately puts her life in danger as there are others who do not want this illegal baby scheme exposed.A nice subplot to this is Doug- Callie's natural brother whose life was turned around by his baby sisters disappearance. His love story is a great subplot in this book.All in all, a great book if you like mysterys, suspence, romance and intrigue- this book has it all."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I was quick to complain over Roberts' \\"Three Fates\\" book, so I owe her enthusiastic praise for her latest, \\"Birthright.\\" Roberts is at her best with this story that mingles the discovery of the remains of an ancient civilization in rural Maryland with the heroine's shocking discovery of her true identity. There's history mixed with murder, mystery, love, sex and the question of what makes us who we are. I couldn't put this book down. I loved Callie, she's a tough and tender mix of brains and beauty with a quick wit. Jake Graystone, the love of her life, is a hero any romance reader would admire. The secondary love story is well developed and fun to follow. While there is never any doubt of the outcome between the pairs of lovers, there is a good mystery that twists and turns to the very end. Thank you, Nora Roberts, for a great read."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"As someone who has enjoyed many of Nora Robert's works in the past, I found myself disappointed with the audio version of Birthright. I found the Narrator's voice to be extremely irritating and just did NOT work work for this reader. The voice she uses for Callie, sounds like she smokes six packs a day, and the hero (especially Graystone), sounds like a hick with laryngitis. Awful.The plotline, had potential, but it didn't live up to it. I was quite interested in the archaeological dig, and the community of archaeological workers, but this plotline got buried quickly under the subplot over Callie's identity. For me Callie's long-suffering mother reliving the pain of her baby's abduction over and over was quite maudlin, had me wanting to hit the fast forward button. I know it is callous of me, but I simply DID NOT CARE about Callie's origins, or what had happened to Callie 30 years ago. What I wanted to read was romance. NOW.Callie and Graystone's 'relationship' was unsuspensful, unless you like 'bedhopping and 'big misunderstanding' subplots. Graystone had potential, but the constant bickering between this couple left me cold. (There is nothing sexy or attractive of listening to two people bicker and torture each other). I also felt, that Callie as a major character of supposed intelligence acted rather stupid half the time. An example: Callie ran into the woods after a bad guy, armed with a can of 'bug spray' *groan*.The other romantic character Lana, I actually liked. She was oodles more mature than Callie, and handled her affairs in a professional way. Her love interest Doug, however had zero personality. This character could easily been left out. Perhaps this novel would've been more interesting if the romance had been between Lana and Graystone?Overall, I guess I found this book a disappointment. It had potential, but got bogged down with mindless melodrama over Callie's origins, and a senseless secondary romance and endless, endless whining and hand-wringing.Rating: Average, but poor narration loses it a star."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"It is a shame that a book as wonderful as Birthright has such a horrible narrator like Bernadette Quigley. I had the unfortunate chance to hear Ms. Quigley on the Three Fates audio and it was done so poorly, I actually returned it to the store. I didn't check to see who was reading Birthright, much to my chagrin. Ms. Quigley does not seem to have a range of voices to pull from, such as a fellow reader of Nora Roberts, Sandra Burr. In this reading Jake sounds like an eighty year old man and it's actually kinda creepy. Most of the male characters all have the same \`voice' and you aren't sure who is supposed to be talking until their name is spoken. Ms. Quigley does an excellent job of reading Callie. She uses just the right amount of sarcasm in her voice and Lana is pretty well done too, but beyond that, it's terrible. I HIGHLY recommend the book, but stay far away from the audio!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Archaeologist Callie Dunbrook is called to Antietam Creek to investigate the bones accidentally dug up at a controversial construction project.

The main characters are well developed and easy to like. There is a perfect combination of romance and suspense and the plot twists keep the reader's attention until the final page."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I love the setting in Maryland and how she describes the people andcountryside, almost makes me want to move....Having this much going on in one's life is definitely intriguing,just being able to enjoy how the story is written and told makes itall the more interesting...."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Before I picked up this book for the first time, I knew that I could expect a beautifully written, completely engrossing read from Nora Roberts. The story within a story that bound up a group of compelling characters was masterfully executed.

Her birth mother recognised her, but while the reunion was what Susan had yearned for for twenty nine years, Callie had to reevaluate her entire life, and in doing so, began to unravel the web of a dangerous and profitable black market baby operation. At the same time her sexy ex-husband, Anthropoligist Jake Greystone was determined to get back into her life. I have read this book about 3 or 4 times already, and envy you if this is your first time to read it, you are in for a rare treat."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I will be honest that I was rather reluctant to start this book after reading so many negative reviews. However, I have been pleasntly surprised. Unlike many readers I found the character of Callie to be interesting. Just because a woman is educated, doesn't make them perfect people. I for one liked reading about an intelligent woman with flaws. Everyone saw Callie as selfish, but I didn't see that at all. I saw her as someone struggling to deal with a situation that she had no control over. I did not like the character of Doug at all. I thought the romance between him and Lana was just put in to fill pages. Lana would have been better off with someone who had a little more personality. It was very nice to read a Nora Roberts book that didn't have the paranormal mumbo jumbo that she sticks in so many of her books."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Callie Dunbrooke is called to Woodsboro, Maryland after a skull is found by a real estate developer while clearing a site. She's an archaeologist and quickly determines the skull is a major find. Things get complicated when her ex-husband, Jake Grayson, is assigned to her excavation team and the developer gets aggressive about his work site being taken over. Vandalism escalates to things more sinister and Callie is also confronted with some surprises involving her family.Jake and Callie's relationship is complicated and fiery. Their marriage ended a year before because of communication breakdowns and it's obvious they're not over each other. Jake is even more endearing as he is committed to doing things differently to win Callie back and, in the process of doing so, wins the hearts of readers. His support of Callie when she's dealt some pretty emotional personal blows was unwavering and done in a way that best suited her needs. Roberts does her typical great job of crafting a compelling hero but falls a bit short with Callie, who comes across as difficult and insensitive instead of the competent, self-assured woman that you'd imagine she is in actuality. It was one of the issues for me with this story and I found myself overcompensating to make the romance work.There were actually three relationships involved in this story, which made it even more interesting and engaging. Additionally, the subplot involving Callie's personal background added quite a bit of tension and substance. Lastly, the mystery surrounding the sinister events at the dig site provided more layers to this complicated story. The complexities of the relationships were at the forefront and Roberts struck the right balance between them and they converged seamlessly. While I learned about the archaelogical process, I didn't feel overwhelmed by it and it provided a good backdrop for the story.I really liked this book and its emphasis on characters, relationships and family. The personal trauma the characters faced were heartbreaking and their reactions were realistically drawn. I liked the people in the story, even Callie, in spite of the flaws in how she was characterized. It's an extremely interesting book and is now one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Callie Dunbrook is an acclaimed archaeologist at the top of her game, but one appearance on television changes her life forever.

This was refreshingly new and I read it twice before putting it down.There are several different curves thrown into the mix of this book. Everything from Black-market baby selling, to ancient civilizations & their cultures, to theories of ghosts & curses, to dealing with ex-romances in the workplace. Only Roberts could intertwine this many storylines without making it confusing.Here is the cliff-notes version: Witty and beautiful archaeologist Callie Dunnbrook, is sent to small town Woodsboro to investigate claims of 5000 year old bones found at a construction site. Unfortunately, the town isn't that friendly. When people start vanishing, many wonder...could it be a local or a curse from the disturbed graves? Not only must she wrestle with a possibly cursed dig site; but her partner for the dig, sent from the university, is none other than her ex-husband, Jake!! To make matters worse local, famous baker, Suzanne (think-Mrs. Smith's) claims Callie is her daughter who was kidnapped as an infant. Only problem is Callie wasn't adopted...or was she?Poor Callie must decipher clues to the past; Suzanne's, Jake's, the remains in the ground, and her own. As the old adage proves true, secrets never last forever!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Birthright is a novel about Cali, an archeologist who is hired to do a job in a small town where really old bones were found. As the team members for the excavation come together, personal histories between Cali and one of her co workers is revealed. Soon there after conflicts arise and Cali discovers something about her past. In the mean time a confrontational, entertaining, and sexy love affair is re-ignited.There is also a sub-love plot between two other characters that is also interesting and cleverly intertwines with the rest of the plot. The characters are well formed and interesting, and very different from each other. Even our Heroine is very different from other Robert's characters. I personally liked her toughness, and how at the same time she was vulnerable. Kind of reminded me of Eve Dallas in the Death series Roberts writes under the pen name J.D. Robb.This book has a few traits that I've picked up in other Roberts' novels: The delineation between the softer character, who is very feminine and often wears the color pink, and the stronger one that wears jeans, and stronger (sometimes abrupt) colors such as red. There is also the element of conflict between mother and daughter, and her greatly developed strong but tolerant male figure.As most of Robert's books, the plot is well developed, intricate and has a few surprises. I think that this is one of her best novels (that I've read so far)."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I think this is one of Nora Robert's best mysteries. The book starts out with a tale of a very young boy waiting in line with his mom and three-month old baby sister to see Santa Claus. A familiar situation to any mom as the boy needs to go to the bathroom but won't say so as he doesn't want to miss seeing Santa. The little boy gets up to Santa and is suddenly so scared he falls and wets himself. His mom rushes up to gather him to her tenderly. She stands up and turns around and her infant daughter is gone. What a horrible tragedy! I feel for that mom right away how devastated she must be.The story comes back to the present with a very old skull found while land is being turned over for a housing development. When the skull is shown to be 5,000 years old, enter the expert archeologist, Callie Dunbrook. Her boss and friend, Leo, brings her and a whole crew in to work on the Antietam Creek lands. The owner and developer of the lands is not happy and neither are the workers he was employing to develop the land. Leo also brings in Callie's ex-husband, Jacob \\"Jake\\" Graystone, as the lead anthropologist. Some of this story is about the discoveries and how they are treated but along with it are two main sidelines: murders that occur on the Antietam land and what connection, if any, is there between Callie and the infant girl kidnapped at the beginning of the book?Of course, we also have the romantic plot line as Jake tries to convince Callie that he is there for her. All the complexities of this plot are well developed and woven seamlessly into this story with the emotions of the Dunbrooks (Callie's parents), the Cullens (whose baby daughter was kidnapped and may be her birth parents), her possible brother, Doug Cullen, and Callie herself. We also have the follow up on who kidnapped Callie and why and how her adoptive parents were fooled. Underlying this is the anger some of the people from the town of Woodsboro have towards the hold up of the housing development.A great read - hard to put down!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Well, quite opposite of the other reviews of this book, I liked it. I was excited to see that archaeology was the medium used to anchor the story. As someone who's been on archaeological digs before, the portrayal of the site, events, and all characters was quite realistic (if a little fantastic at times). Callie fit the bill perfectly. Women who get involved in and make it in the world of archaeology are tough and sometimes they're mean. I liked that she never stood still, stood up for herself, and really did care for the other characters around her. Jake was also great, even though he could have been a little more developed. I thought the story was good. Was it realistic? I don't know that for sure but why read a romance novel if what you're after is realism? Taken at face value for what it is, Birthright was an entertaining story and a great escape from reality."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"This was a great book, and I just read it for the first time, even though it's older.

Too much going on and it drags. Three relationships, baby kidnapping, archaeological digs, murders and more. Too many threads and the pacing is thrown off by it. I find the lawyer/brother relationship completely superfluous and detracted from the pacing. It's plodding to the point where I am wondering why I am still trying to get through the book and no longer care about any of the tangle of threads going on in this book.I am listening to the audiobook version and I also have to add the narrator is awful. The hero (after you figure out who the actual hero is because of all the threads in the story) sounds AWFUL. All the male voices are terrible. Gravelly and I want a throat lozenge after listening."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"As an avid Nora Reader, this is one of my favorites. The story reminded me vaguely of \\"The Face on the Milk Carton\\" by Caroline B. Cooney, but this is the adult version. And to be honest, this version was much more interesting. I love when Nora is able to tell a great story, tug at our heart strings, and weave together not one love story, but two or three.The characters are strong and the story is intriguing. Nora is able to tackle something as sensitive as child abduction with tenderness and tact and create a story of love, family, and mystery.This is one where the book jacket description doesn't do the book near enough justice."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I must say I did enjoy this book, contrary to some of the reviewers. I didn't find it boring or stupid! There was a baby snatching ring in the USA some years back, so the plot was feasible. The main characters were - for me - likeable, though I preferred the lawyer to the archeologist, who was a pretty mean woman. I particularly liked the men in this novel, particularly the brother of the main character :)Over all, yep, it was fine."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"It's Nora Roberts....of course it was amazing. Very gripping. I couldn't put the book down! I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"The book is another great masterpiece of Roberts. The mysterious goings on in the story keep you turning pages. The expectations of finding out you'd been adopted after being kidnapped, is overwhelming for Callie who learns of this and sets out to find the ones who created this unsettling situation for her, her birth family and her adopted family."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Updating books that I have read and rate them for amazon. So I can some recommedations for other books. Always looking for something new and different."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I enjoy reading Nora Roberts, as well as when she writes as JD Robb. Birthright is a suspenseful love story and was interesting from the beginning to the end."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"lovable characters especially the main man! talk about steamy! great character depth with an adorable side love story. you really feel for the characters. great plot with some amazing twists. another incredible book from nora roberts. this title is definitely going on my top 10 list"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Kudos to Nora Roberts - I bought the audio book because of the long commute i was experiencing with my previous job and because of this book along with a few others of hers, i enjoyed every second of my ride! to the point i would still be listening to it even after i arrive to my destination.If you haven't read this book because your hesitant, then go for it, it's worth every penny and every minute of your spare time!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"This is probably one of Nora Robert's best books! This book was also the first of the Nora Robert series I've read and this is the book that got me totally hook to Nora Robert's series.Callie Dunbrook is an argeologist and one that is stubborn. But when a man that's trying to build a building discovers a thousands of years old site. So, with some difficulities, Callie was forced to work with he ex, Jake, again. First it was bumpy but as time goes on, Callie discovers something that shakes that hot head of hers. It seem to be that she was adopted in an illegal adoption. Through hard times, Callie along with her Jake finds the answer to the questions. And meanwhile doing so...falls back into the one person's arm so never knew she would. Jake"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I stumbled upon my first Nora Roberts novel by accident, and became an instant fan. Her stories are fantastic and fun to read with never a dull moment, and Birthright was by far one of my favorites. The mystery surrounding Callie Dunbrook's past and her &quot;quest&quot; to uncover the secrets made this book a page turner, and the romance between Callie and Jake and Lana and Doug added just enough heat to make me burn through the pages. A definite must read for any Nora Roberts fan!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"When I started &quot;Birthright&quot; I was kind of skeptical of the nature of the novel. Boy...was I surprised....not only was it fast-paced...it was interesting as well. Though quite long for a NR book...it was well worth the time spent to get to the finish."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I felt the story line was very believeable. I have many friends that are adopted and often wonder &quot;what if&quot; this kind of story were to &quot;happen&quot; to them as they get older. We live in a very, very large world but sometimes the world is indeed very small.Nora Roberts obviously researched adoption on the black market very carefully. Only if you understand how a couple of any social standing could want a baby so bad to go to any length to get one, can you sympathize with the main characters' parents.I really enjoyed Callie and Jacob's characters. The way Jacob felt about his wife was very touching. It was like two separate souls looking for each other but somehow missing the point. I would love to read about their future together. Jacob's background would be a great book to explore also.As always, when Nora Roberts really researches a subject and brings her wonderful insights into the story, you can't help but enjoy every page of her books.Thank you for a great read. Keep it up Nora."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I love Nora Roberts and she didn't let me down with this book. I didn't want to put it down. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The sparks between calli Dunebrook and Jacob Graystone are great!! Alsot he secondary romance between Lynn and Doug. The end was at a great pace. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the consatnt use of G**D***. I don't think I a being a prude but it was not necessary there are other words that would suffice. Otherwise it was a great book."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"This book is my first hardback by Nora, and what an excellent one. I bought this book at my store, and lo, and behold my other hardback arrived the same day so it took me over a week to read it. Callie is an excellent heroine and Jake a perfect gentleman'through in couple of confused and broken up parents, one who gave her birth,and the ones who raised her, and finally a few confusing bad guys and you have an excellent story. The only wish that I could make for thiswould have more one on one with Callie and or Jessie as she was originally and her parents. I was hoping that Nora would include a final chapter on how she was relate to all four of her new family. I also loved how her two mothers responded to each. If you love reading Nora's book this one is a keeper."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Nora Roberts has written another good romantic suspense mixing archaeology, murder, a stolen baby ring, and, of course, romance.Something holds me back from giving it 5 stars, though. Perhaps because it would not make my top ten favorite N. Roberts. Perhaps it is a little bit lengthy. Still a good book that I would recommend."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"When a 5,000-year-old skull is unearthed at a housing development on Antietem Creek, archeologist Callie Dunbrook is called in to organize an extensive dig. But not everyone supports the dig, which has halted construction and taken away local jobs. Soon Callie is up to her ears in trouble--threats, then murder.If that weren't enough trouble, Callie's anthropologist ex-husband, Jake Graystone, is also hired to work the site. And she's being stalked by a woman who claims Callie is her long-lost daughter, kidnapped at three months and sold in a black-market baby scam.You can always count on author Nora Roberts for a solid, emotional read, and Birthright is that. The murder mystery was intriguing, though there was, in my opinion, absolutely no clues that lead to the real murderer. The details about archeology and anthropology give the story a sense of credibility. However, the lead characters are impossibly gorgeous, smart, and perfect. Callie and Jake are in their late twenties--ridiculously young to be considered experts in any scientific field. Their sense of history--their memories of prior digs and what-not--would have fit better on characters ten years older.Still, a pleasant read."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I was disappointed in this book--which never ever happens with a Nora Roberts story. I figured out 95 percent of the mystery almost immediately--and the romances were a big let down. This is the one books of Ms. Roberts that I wish I had waited for the paperback verion--and saved myself some money."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Every time I see a Nora Roberts novel that I haven't read, I grab it. I know that traditionally Robert's novels offer romance, suspense and easy to follow plots, and this was no exception.The story begins with infant, Jessica Cullen stolen from her stroller while her family tried to take Christmas pictures with Santa. Distracted for a moment by her distraught son, Suzanne is devastated to find her daughter is missing without a trace. Faced with grief and guilt, Suzanne eventually separates from her husband but starts a successful baking career. Imagine after several years of disappointing leads her excitement when she turns on the news to see a woman who reminds her of herself and her missing daughter Jessica. Enters, Callie Dunbrook, archaeologist extraordinaire, has been summoned to a \\"find\\" at Antietam Creek, the site of future homes. Faced with the fact that her whole life may have been a lie and she may be the infant taken years earlier, Callie must re-evaluate her entire life, and solve the mystery of who took her and why. Sent to assist Callie on their most recent discovery is Jake Graystone, Callie's estranged ex-husband who intends to woo her back. With support from Jake and a host of other supporting characters (a widowed attorney with a child, Lana; a newly discovered big brother, Doug), Callie is determined to discover the truth. As deaths start to plague the site, Callie and Jake soon realize that her abduction could be the catalyst of all recent events.I enjoyed this Roberts novel and would definitely recommend it to readers who like romance and suspense. It's a quick and easy read and has just the tight amount of twists and turns to keep you guessing, and a nice well wrapped up ending. I would suggest this Robert novel to all those that traditionally enjoy her works."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Callie Dunbrook is an acclaimed archaeologist at the top of her game, but one appearance on television changes her life forever. While working on a historic dig in Maryland, she discovers she was kidnapped when she was an infant and raised by another family. As she struggles to deal with her new family ties, the sudden appearance of her anthropologist ex-husband Jake Graystone, she also has to try to find out who is sabotaging the site.I really enjoyed this book! It is now one of my favorites. I have been on geology digs, so I really liked the setting of this story. There was good rapport and chemistry between Jake and Callie. They made a very likeable couple. The secondary characters were also an important part of the story. The biological family Suzanne, Jay, and Doug were well written."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"It was great...of course. Roberts never lets you down. Everytime you pick up one of her books you already know the outcome; you're going to get romance, mystery, comedy and a well researched plot, of course there are never really any surprises, but that's ok by me...I know I'll always get my money's worth!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I know this isn't the newest of Nora Roberts' books, but I hadn't read it until recently. I really liked the way she treated archeology in general and these characters in particular.Nora Roberts manages to express the importance of knowing where we come from without preaching about it and solving a mystery and a murder while she does it.Of all the Nora Roberts books I've read (and I've read almost all of hers) there was only one I didn't like and \\"Birthright\\" was not it. I liked the characters and their interplay. The academics at the dig site and the people from the town had good chemistry both with each other and between the two groups.Another masterpiece!!!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I have read this book twice since it came out, and I absolutely love it! The best part is that it involves all of the characters at the heart of the book, not just those mentioned in the plot synopsis. The characters were all real as were the emotions that they expressed.Callie is a recently divorced archeologist, who comes out of subatical to work a sight in Maryland where 5000 year old human bones had been found. It is there that Susan sees Callie on television, and is sure that she is Jessie, her daughter who had been stolen out of her stroller in 1974. Doug is Susan's son, and he is tired of all the women his mother claims is Jessie. He doesn't know Callie, so he feels that he needs to warn her away from his mother. Callie hires Lana to find out what really happened in 1974. She is a widowed mother of a 4 year old, who happens to be friends with Susan's father Roger, who wants her to get involed with Doug. Jake is Callie's ex-husband, who is still in love with her and wants her back. He is an anthropologist who is assigned to the case that Callie is working on. Together with Doug and Lana, they work to uncover a decades old truth involving."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I finished \\"Birthright\\" and almost didn't finish it after the first few chapters. Callie's character bothered me with her profanity and temper. I'm thinking by almost 30 a person should have learned more control. Her birth parents as well as adopted are loving gentle people. Where did she come from??? Towards the end of the book I got to where I could tolerate her a little more. I liked Jake's character and loved the end where he tells her he never signed the divorce papers. I had guessed that by a couple other things that was said but that was a fun ending. Unlike some other reviewers I liked Doug and the grandfather and of course Lana and her son. I skimmed a lot and almost didn't read the book because I have no interest in archaeology. I liked the secondary characters and would have liked NR to have gone a little further with the ending of the 2 families together and feelings a little more resolved. I very often think that NR shorts the ending. All in all it wasn't a bad read as some reviewers indicated. The whole adoption thing was interesting because I was taken from my birth mother when I was 2 and adopted shortly after. I found my birth family after my adopted parents were deceased. I could relate to Callie's feelings as your feelings for people who raised you as opposed to the ones who gave you birth are different. It's a difficult dilemma. For some reason my birth mother had raised my siblings and these were 2 different enviornments. We had nothing in common. I think in Callie's case the backgrounds weren't that much different. I didn't care for Callie's birth mother at first because she had been so obsessed with finding Jessica/Callie she destroyed her marriage and neglected her son. Later in the book she realizes what she has done and mellows some but sitll 29 years of damage was done. Some of the book was unrealistic to me but after all it is fiction so I have to remember that. I still didn't think the murder of the 2 people in the story were necessary to the plot. They really had nothing to do with anything going on in the book and a young woman killed both of them?? It's not a book I will read again but it was an okay read."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Nora Robert's is my favorite author and her books are the best...but I am having a tough time getting thru this one. Birthright doesn't project any of the detailed gorgeous scenery Nora is so wonderful at describing. The characters are just ok. I am still reading it..and have been putting down for a month now on and off!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"The story seems to go on forever. It is a novel after all; a very long one. Each character possesses his/her own specialty but most of them are either archeologists or in the medical profession. The final showdown is worth the reading and waiting. It is interesting to witness the deduction method used in solving the ultimate mystery - who is the person behind all the killings. Romance genre deals with various types of relationship confusions and this one is no exception. Conveniently, Dr. Dunbrook arrives in a small town for a dig to land herself in turmoil of a kidnapping case - her own. That leads her to hiring a lawyer to find out the truth. The man she never gets over is there to win her heart again. Her brother who she didn't grow up with has his own love interest. A divorced couple find each other once more. Everything boils down to loyalty among friends, lovers, and family members. Not easy to achieve and understand in real life but in a fiction it is all swell and great which makes up the utmost joy in reading."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"This is one of Nora Roberts' best books ever! I have read everything she's written and this is now my all time favorite. I ADORE this book. The characters are interesting and very human, the plot is gripping and the background fascinating. Callie, an archeologist, comes to a little town in Maryland to set up a dig and ends up learning about her birth parents and reuniting with her ex-husband. What I really like about this is the two main characters already have a history before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the spur of the moment, like most romances (including Roberts). Definitely a book I highly recommend for both the romance and the thrilling plot. It will keep you glued to the pages until you figure out who the bad guys are."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I've been a huge fan of Nora Robberts for years and this book was (as always) a pleasure to read. The characters were so realistic, people you might already know. It made me laugh, it made me think, it is really a great book."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"A reader of fiction must, of necessity, give a writer a certain latitude with respect to how a plot unfolds. The problem here is that the writer went just a bit too far. For example, when the central female character discovers that she may be adopted after being kidnapped, she uses DNA to determine her birth parents, rather than relying on the footprint/and or fingerprints on her birth records. Fingerprints would be faster and more reliable than the preliminary DNA results--although the DNA results in this case were surprisingly quick, too quick, in fact.The plot is just a trifle too drawn out, apparently to fill the requisite pages. This happened and then this happened--without going forward very much.Again we have a strong female lead, rather, two strong female leads in this case, both in a field dominated by men: archaeologist and lawyer. As always, Ms. Roberts' women are young, gorgeous, a bit round in the heels, assertive, and overly competent. Sometimes a flaw might be helpful to make them more realistic. Still, the characters are not dull and that's a plus.As usual, there is an R rated sex scene about halfway through, with buttons flying, followed by some such scenes that are not described in glorious detail. With two female leads here, there are two R rated sex prelims, a bonus, if you will.The description of archaeology is accurate enough. Unfortunately archaeology, particularly of pre-historic sites, is an almost bogus science. Oh, it has the trappings, the grids, the recording of finds, etc. But too often it crosses over into fiction as the archaeologist speculates about the lives of people who owned the pottery shards and pieces of femur. Added to this is the fact that there is no historic record to dispute the speculations. Soon speculations become statements of fact, when we really do not know much at all about the shards and bone. This is particularly well shown in this book. At one point the archaeologist is shown a scrap of bone and dismisses it immediately as being from a deer, without any testing at all. Unfortunately too many archaeolgists actually do just that.Some Nora Roberts books drift into the paranormal and others are, after a fashion, whodunits. \\"Birthright\\" is in the latter category. The tracking down is perhaps too facile, but the outcome scene is pure nonsense. We have seen far too many of these, in which the criminal, once found out, holds a gun on the \\"detective\\" and explains in detail and in sequence exactly what happened, while supposedly intending to kill the detective. Nonsense. Why would the criminal not just shoot his enemy and get away quickly and safely? But no, the villain waits too long and is upended. And I didn't believe a word of it in \\"Birthright.\\"There is much to like, however, as is always the case with a Nora Roberts book. She has style. I just wish there had been a little more here."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I am a big fiction reader and a fan of Nora Roberts. I read lots of Christian fiction, really good books, and was somewhat shell-shocked to go from one great book that didn't need dirty, cheap language, to one that is filled with it!Come on Nora, drop the constant rotten language. Surely you have the imagination to let us know exactly what the character is thinking or saying without subjecting us to constant swearing."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"There's that old cliche about not being able to put a book down. This book was truly that. I read it from beginning to end in one long day, and I loved it. From just reading the description I expected a mystery, but this book was so much more. It was about finding out who you truly are, and what you have to go through to find that out. Callie was an awesome kick butt no holds barred woman who was portrayed as a woman who didn't need a man to complete her, which was definitely refreshing. Hats off to Nora for another incredible book!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Callie Dunbrook who is a grown woman and a very gifted archaeologist is a woman with a past she has no idea about. Her parents never disclosed the fact that she had been adopted as an infant at three months old. What was unknown, was that she was actually sold by an attorney who was up to no good with adoption scams.How Callie will find out is by a mysterious woman that appears at her door one day inquiring about her past. Callie is dumbfounded and seeks the truth.There is danger lurking out there, and as Callie continues her search, it becomes closer to her. This is where her ex-husband Jake will be of great help. In fact, they may end up in love all over again.A good book about roots and discovery. There is a lot of mystery in this book!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"That this idiocy masquerading as a novel could be published is beyond me. This review won't earn me many positive ratings, but in the hopes of saving just one person from suffering through this tripe I'm going to give it to you straight. Can you handle the truth?I was at the airport and had forgotten to bring a book and was forced to purchase something to read. I must have done something terribly wrong to annoy someone in a previous life for me to have chosen this insipid hokum and I must have been terribly bored to finish this garbage, but finish it I did. My time would have been spent far more productively cleaning out the johns on the airplane.Ms Roberts characters are ridiculously contrived and shallow. They appear to have been cooked up in the fetid imagination of a high-school sophomore cheerleader who didn't bother to take any English or literature courses. Ms Roberts has NO insight into the human condition. Her characters are all androgynous hermaphrodites. Her men are simply oozing with sensitivity lurking just beneath the surface. And her female characters are constantly getting into bar fights when they aren't insisting on having sex with the hapless sensitive men in the book. I guess her total lack of insight into human nature could be forgiven if she'd managed to craft a good tale, but Nooo-o-o-o-o. I wasn't so lucky. This storyline was so silly and inane that I am still kicking myself for bothering to read it.Do youself a favor. Pass on this travesty and find something (ANYTHING) else to read."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Most people already know that anything Ms. Roberts writes is an excellent write! Excellent writer, excellent story!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"A very intersting premise and not a bad story overall, but I did not like any of the characters and the dialogue was at times, just plain horrible. I admit, I didn't read the book but listened to the audiobook on CD that I got from the library, I knew nothing about the author, but the storyline seemed interesting. It really took me a long time to get through this, I wasn't impressed enough that I think I would ever read another book from the author. Not a bad book, just not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I love this book.

She seemed whiney and stupid at unnessary times and calm and leveled headed about things that didn't really matter. She was pushy (along w her lawyer) which lead me to like and hate her. I mostly liked the main men of the book her ex-husband and new found brother basically the people who weren't falling all over themselves over her."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I have always enjoyed Nora Roberts but this one was a little boring.

Hence I was on the waiting list for her latest. The editors writeup did not sound like something I'd enjoy but we often have different tastes.This time we were years apart. This was the dullest book I have ever read; and yes, I plowed all the way to the end because often times Ms Roberts saves the last part of the book for a smashing finish.Believe me, I could have lost this book at any point and never wondered again who did what. PLEASE wait for the paper back to bore yourself to death!!!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I enjoyed the book very much; it was hard to put down. But come on Ms. Roberts, why the frequent potty mouth swear words? A &quot;damn&quot; hear and there would suffice just fine."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"&quot;Birthright&quot; is classic Nora Roberts. It has just the right blend of romance, mystery, science and great characters. It isn't perfect, but it's the best Roberts I've read in a long time, and I would say that it's easily in her top 10 books.The characters in &quot;Birthright&quot; are particularly rich and real. They are smart people (the heroine and her ex are both PhDs; the secondary characters are a lawyer and rare book finder), and dedicated to their jobs and families. You get to see the everyday lives and interactions that really brings a story to life. The romances are totally believable, and by the end you honestly think that everyone should be together. I have read far too many books with romance in them that simply rely on hormones and nothing else, and I was glad that Roberts stuck to her usual &quot;develop the relationship&quot; style.I also loved the archaeology and anthropology aspect of the book. I wanted to be a digger when I was a child, and I never lost interest in the subject, so I might be biased. ;&gt;For those who are not as interested in that: While Roberts certainly does not beat you over the head with the science, it is always in the background, and she brings the human aspect to it. It's not just big words, folks. She tells you why it matters to Callie and Jake, why they feel what they are doing is important, and she does it in plain language.I found the mystery portion of the book to be very well done overall, but more rushed the closer it got to the end. I understand why Roberts did it the way she did, but it was such an unhurried story that the ending was jarring. However, since life is often jarring, especially when it comes to big revelations, I didn't feel that the mystery's answer was unrealistic.The very end was kind of corny (won't tell you what it is!), but honestly after all the angst and conflict, it was kind of like a little treat to finally have some cornball in there."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Birthright was a fantastic book - worthy of buying in hard back. Callie is someone you can relate to - she is a passionate person - about her work, her family, what's right and wrong, and definitely about her handsome exhusband Jake. The story weaves well, the characters are credible. The continual links between the work she is doing and what she uncovers there, and how it relates to her own life and what's uncovering for herself, are strong. Nora Roberts - still proving she's one of the best."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"If you are a huge Nora fan, you already own this. If you are new to Nora, you might as well jump in with this one.Callie Dunbrook reminds me of Eve Dallas after she has evolved, and I love her. I normally can not stand stories where the protaganists are divorced, and I hate archeology stories. They are usually so technical, that I am not interested. Not so with this one. Nora as always made the book fast paced and entertaining. There was not the awkardness you would expect with the divorce. She handled that beautifully and from the beginning you knew, that they were not ready before, and were know, and that it would work.Jake was wonderful, and Nora did a beautiful job balancing the \\"stolen baby\\" issue, so that you felt compassion for both sets of parents.There is also a side story with her new found brother, and her attorney. It is great too!I won't go into lots of plot detail, many other reveiwers already have as well as the book description. I just highly recommend this book.If you like this, you will love anything by Nora, and I just found another author that writes in a style like Nora. Try Mariah Stewart. She does great stories about families and emotions with the romance/suspense storylines."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Wow - just finished and what a great read.

Click Buy It Now and get started reading this one soon!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Nora Roberts at her best: Birthright had all the usual ingredients of a great read with strong women, handsome men who just don't get it the first time, a mystery to solve and then a marvelous ending.Callie Dunbrook, aka, Jessica Cullen, as the story unfolds is a successful archelogist on her way to a dig in Woodsboro, Md. At the first media presentation a woman in the area sees Callie on TV and recognizes physical characteristics that lead her to believe that Callie is her daughter Jessica.Jessica was kidnapped when she was three years old as her brother Douglas waited to see Santa. The tragedy tore apart Suzanne Cullen's life, her family and her relationship with her son Doug who had been 3 years old at the time of the kidnapping.Solving the mystery of who Callie/Jessica's parents really are, and how it all came to be makes for a story with escalating suspense.

I have used the text for my courses and have not had one student indicate that it was a nothing book or that they did not learn something of value from the book.

My intellectual knowledge has expanded tremendously on the issues of gender, racism, racial prejudice, ethnic cultures, sexism, and classism thanks to this great scholar book. On my 22nd birthday I was given this new edition and I am glad a new edition was released with more updates and information.I recommend this book to any person interested in those issues and concepts that shape our everyday life and our sociological evolution as humans. I am a university student of history and I have found this book to be a valuable tool for research papers and self-education.I strongly recommend this book.

This book is mainly a compilation of articles and clips, it uses these to try to persuade the reader that anything but the most politically left are horrible people. While it does not come right out and state this as such one of the \\"highlights\\" is when it says that if you are part of a majority then you should not be allowed to consider others prejudice against you (in the form of racism, sexism or any other \\"ism.\\") This book puts an enormous emphasis on society being the cause of all problems and completely denies personal responsibility. Some of the letters contradict the author's clear feelings on the subject but she either ignores those parts or tries to excuse them as irrelevant. I can not figure out how such a terrible book became part of a masters level social work class but I think it should not be considered for anyone because at best it provides some marginally helpful anecdotal stories.Last point: This type of writing does more damage to the groups that social workers are trying to help than most types of \\"isms\\" by perpetuating beliefs that minority groups are somehow incapable of doing anything on their own and they will never succeed as individuals without disproportionate governmental assistance.

Rothenberg offers one of the most accessible compilations of articles focusing on race, class, and gender that I have yet to encounter. Rothenberg provides a varied selection of readings that reveal the comprehensive state of discrimination and oppression within the United States. \\"Race, Class, and Gender in the United States\\" works within an academic context, but it's also a valuable addition to any professional's bookshelf.I used \\"Race, Class, and Gender in the United States\\" for a recent class on Racism and Sexism and I found myself spending a considerable amount of time exploring articles outside of those assigned. The articles integrate with one another quite well and they provide a variety of perspectives. Perhaps the most valuable part of Rothenberg's compilation is its ability to simultaneously provide the historic framework of oppression while providing a cross-section of how concepts of race, class, and gender play out in today's society.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone looking to expand their knowledge of the societal and cultural implications held within race, class, and gender in the United States. Rothenberg provides an abundance of readings within its voluminous 700+ pages.

The writing was decent, and the story wasn't BAD, but the \\"metal\\" part of the book seemed forced to me. It was the story of a young man who likes to party, who has friends who like to party, and then falls in love with a girl. The metal parts of the book couldn't almost been added after it was written. \\"I made her a mix tape, and here are the bands on it,\\" he basically says (not word-for-word). Wow, impressive. I wanted the metal to be woven into the story, but I just didn't feel it.This writer has the gift, though, and definitely has potential. I look forward to more from him in the future."},{"Title":"Heavy Metal And You","review":"The front flap of the book says \\"if Nick Hornby had a metalhead little brother, he'd write a book as clever, music-drenched, and observationally direct as this.\\" And a more true statement could not be made about this book.Enter the world of grunge, death metal and hard-core alternative music. Sam Markus comes from a good family, goes to the right school and has all the privileges of his favorite literary hero Holden Caulfield, but he also has a harsh past that turned his life upside-down. Luckily, he found an outlet for his anger through heavy metal.After Melissa, the straightedge girl of his dreams, walks into his life, Sammy knows he is in love. But Melissa, his friends and his music seem to clash, and Sammy doesn't know who he is or even who he wants to be anymore. Heavy metal helped him overcome his past, yet he isn't sure if the music is enough to help him figure out his present.With an intelligence that is astounding for such a young author (Krovatin was only 20 years-old when the book was published), this book hits home with themes of acceptance, sex, drugs and self-perception. I loved reading this book. Even with its dark and sometimes violent overtones, I found myself wanting to understand Sammy and his music as well as make some mixes of my own."},{"Title":"Heavy Metal And You","review":"This book is great. In the beginning, the way it is written is a bit confusing but you get used to it, and it doesn't take away from the story. In fact, it makes you reflect and think.

The first-date scene in the mosh pit is great reading, and a lasting visual image. But like the whaling ship in Moby Dick, I wouldn't want to live there to find out about it. The writing is not as rich in metaphor as Dave Eggers, but the plot and setting are more interesting and memorable."},{"Title":"Heavy Metal And You","review":"It's easy to tell the author is just embellishing his own thoughts and experiences, and what it really comes down to is he's just full of crap for the most part. He is name dropping bands left and right and trying to give a quick crash course in the rise of Norwegian black metal before turning around and talking about bands like Shadow's Fall. Anyone who actually pays attention to the music when they hear it knows this band is worthless metalcore crap. He also prefers Possessed over the band Death. Yikes. I eased up on the judgmental stuff when I saw how young he was, but it didn't excuse the repetitive nature of the writing itself. He spends much of the book with the same setup: the metal head character screws things up with his too-good-to-be-true girlfriend, has to apologize, and they make up until it happens again. Some of the dialogue is funny, some of it is just bad. It was a quick, easy read for a few days on a train, I'll give it that much."},{"Title":"Heavy Metal And You","review":"The book was in very good condition considering how old it is.

She has spent the past year at home and away from the disasters and death she saw in Ethiopia. However, she still has not reconciled with her teenage daughter Amy, who lived with her dad while Brett played doctor overseas. Amy hates the farm and wants to go back to the total freedom she had with her dad.While hunting on the property's woods, Brett spots the mangled remains of a murder victim. Brett calls the police. Her ex-husband heads up the investigation that soon points towards Brett, her family, and a hired hand as the prime suspects. However, the identity of the corpse leads to more mysteries that threaten to destroy the loving McBride clan.WITHOUT MERCY is an exciting contemporary suspense with a pinch of romance that centers on the unraveling of ties that bond a family together. The cleverly designed story line focuses on the fully developed charcaters as they react to the murder especially who the victim is. The audience understands what motivates the cast notably Brett and Gran.

It reminded me of my own parenting tribulations and how difficult it is to be either a parent or a teenager. Without Mercy moves very quickly and has a wonderful mix of intrigue, romance, and humor.

The beginning is excellent; the main character and her nearly-pathological needs are absolutely riveting. But as soon as the plot begins to move, the character retreats to normalcy and the magic dies. Then it's a very ordinary story of family problems and secrets, made even duller by lack of logic: WHY do they let this stranger do as he pleases? WHY does the main character, again and again, not ask the next question that anyone would ask? WHY did nobody hear a horse moving quickly through the empty forest; Why no hoofprints; why is everybody so dam*ed dumb that you'd shake them except that you don't like them enough to bother?If this is a typical Gilbert novel, I'll pass on the rest."},{"Title":"Biography - Mello, Michael A.

She only comes in at the end. So if you were expecting one where she takes center stage, think again. The story centers around Jerry Burton, a recovering accident victim who retires to the country with his sister to recover. His doctor suggests the laid back life of the country will help him relax and heal, but little did he know Jerry would wind up involved in poison pen murder.The village characters are picturesque, and Christie does a good job of keeping you guessing right up til the end. It really is a &quot;moving finger&quot; of suspicion!Overall, a favorite read and reread!"},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"We don't see much of Miss Marple in this one. She doesn't show up until 3/4 of the way through the book, and she doesn't have much to say or do in the pages of the book, although she does her thing outside of the pages, and we hear about it second-hand. We have the required setting for a Miss Marple mystery - a small village where all kinds of personalities are at play. And in this seemingly quiet village, we have some very nasty poison-pen letters being sent to almost everyone in the village. There is a suicide then, and after that a murder and this shows that something is not right in Lymstock. The book is carefully plotted and the characters are pure Agatha Christie, but I found the lack of Miss Marple rather off-putting, so I can only give this a 3."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"Why read: Reading all of Christie's mysteriesWhat impressed me: I did not see that mystery solution coming. I was so caught up in the where the story was leading me, I didn't see the other possibilities, much like the other characters. Jerry and Joanna made for great protagonists, especially with their complete lack of knowledge as to the workings of small village life.What disappointed me: The book was moving along nicely, with Jerry in the thick of the investigation, seeming as though he could easily have solved it without help, when Miss Marple shows up. Now, I enjoy Miss Marple, usually, but her appearance towards the end of the book to wrap things up felt completely unnecessary.Recommended: Yes, but not highly. A good signature Christie twist at the end, but this was not a book without flaws."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"I have the entire collection of Agatha Christie books. She is a wonderful author. Her books make you think and give you a good idea of what life was like in England during this time."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"Jerry Burton and his sister Joanna lease a house in the country to enable him to recover from serious injuries. He has been ordered to lead a quiet life with no upsets. At first life in the village seems idyllic - the locals are friendly and call on the newcomers welcoming them into their circle. Then Jerry receives an anonymous letter which suggests that his sister is not really his sister at all but enjoys a closer relationship to him. It is only when he hears that others have had anonymous letters that he starts to wonder what is going on.When the wife of a local solicitor receives a letter and is found dead things become serious and the police take a hand. This is a complex mystery and will keep most readers guessing until very close to the end of the story. I loved the characters - especially Jerry, who narrates the story, and his sister; Megan - daughter of the dead woman; the local doctor Owen Griffiths and his sharp tongued and efficient sister. The book is well written and carefully plotted. My only criticism is that Miss Marple doesn't appear until about the last third of the book when she comes to stay with the vicar and his wife.I think this must be the quintessential poison pen mystery and few authors have tackled the subject with success - Dorothy L Sayers in Gaudy Night being one of the exceptions. Patricia Wentworth's Poison Pen to my mind falls flat when compared with The Moving Finger though it is still an interesting story."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"A good mystery book from AC. This one has a bit more of human behavior, AC is a very good observer of our way of interact with each other."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"The Moving Finger was the second Miss Marple mystery I had read, and also my second Agatha Christie novel. It was a beautiful book, filled with suspense and suprises that I have to admit I never would have guessed. The twists and turns enveloped in this complex plot amazed me.......along with all the murder and red herrings that Ms. Christie spun into this web of a book. There were fake arrests, misleading comments, innocent suspects, feiry tempered police men, and relatable characters. Basically everything you can associate with a mystery novel was buried in those pages, like hidden treasure waiting to be found.But I do have to say that although I adore Agatha Christie, this book was a little dissapointing, at least compared to the other novels she has written. On the cover of this novel, it says that it is a Miss Marple mystery, so naturally, I expected Miss Marple to be in the first few pages. I opened the book, and someone was narrating it, but it sure wasn't Miss Marple. I was puzzled, because I could tell by the referrences to \\"he\\" that this narrator was a male. So I had to re-read the first couple pages and just assume that whoever this mysterious male character was, he would be introduced later. Of course, I found out it was Jerry Burton, and that he was recovering from a plane crash out in the countryside with his sister, etc, etc.. but at that moment, I was a little dissapointed with Ms. Christie for crafting the book that way. But when I went to a friend and explained, she said,\\"Oh thats interesting! Very clever.\\"Much later, after I had forgotten all about that minor moment of confusion, my older sister decided that she wanted to read the Moving Finger.

The characters and plot ring true, and, as usual, Agatha Christie shows a keen understanding of human nature.

Peace and quiet aren't necessarily on the local agenda, however. Burton soon finds himself on the receiving end of an anonymous poison pen letter. He's not the only person to get one, either. Though the accusations are wild, gossip and suspicion spread. Matters escalate when one letter prompts an apparent suicide and a murder soon follows. Despite all the nastiness, Christie manages to weave a cute little Cinderella story into the plot and love blossoms in the end.THE MOVING FINGER is a typically clever and well-plotted Agatha Christie mystery. It's populated with interesting and believable characters and the clues are there for the astute reader to find. It's reportedly one of Christie's personal favorites. I liked it, too, but there are several other Miss Marple mysteries I enjoyed more. Partly, this is because I simply found some of the other cases more intriguing, but it's also because, as others have pointed out, Jane Marple plays only a peripheral role in this one. The story is told in the first person from the perspective of Jerry Burton. Miss Marple isn't even mentioned until about two-thirds of the way through the book, and even then she's only introduced as a house guest of one of the lesser characters. Her only significant role is to explain the details at the end.THE MOVING FINGER is another quality mystery from Agatha Christie. Miss Marple fans may find this outing disappointing, however, as she plays her most minor role. I liked it, but it doesn't rank among my personal favorites."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"Published in 1942, THE MOVING FINGER is among the lesser-known Christie novels--and a great pity that is! For it is quite simply among Christie's most thematically intriguing works.Jerry Burton has survived an aircrash. When his doctor suggests that he leave the mad rush of London for a calm recuperation in the country, he--attended by his sister Joanna--rents a home at tiny Lymstock. The two are scarcely installed when they receive a truly shocking poison-pen letter, and they soon learn that they are not alone: similar letters are turning up all over the village, accusing the most unlikely people of the most unlikely sins. And with such a twisted mind at work, can sudden death be far behind?In terms of plot, THE MOVING FINGER is one of Christie's more unexpected concepts, and she carries it extremely well, building a sense of mounting paranoia in a most plausible manner and offering a truly memorable series of double-twists. The characters of the novel are also deftly rendered and, although at times stereotypical, remarkably memorable. The novel is a bit too loosely written to rank among Christie's finest, but when all is said and done, it is a truly enjoyable novel that you'll likely gulp down in a single sitting.GFT, Amazon ReviewerIn memory of Cujo, 1992-2005An Orange Cat and a Dear and Faithful Companion, Greatly Missed"},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"\\"The Moving Finger writes; and having writ,Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor WitShall lure it back to cancel half a Line,Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.\\"- Omar KhayyamThis is the quote that I believe inspired THE MOVING FINGER (1942), one of Dame Christie's most original novels. This one I would rank up with THE PALE HORSE (1961), also featuring Mr. and Mrs. Dane Calthrop, along with other characters from Poirot novels.When \\"poison-pen\\" letters accusing the recipients of secret sexual activity awaken the little backwater village of Lymstock, Jerry Burton, recovering from a plane crash, his sister, Joanna, and Miss Jane Marple (though she does not show up till much later, which is why I don't really consider this a Miss Marple novel), a friend of Mrs. Dane Calthrop, must uncover the writer's identity when one recipient commits suicide.

The author really developed the characters well, and that made you think it could have been anyone writing the letters!

But, it gets a WHOLE lot better as the story progresses, so I would recommend this book. Just keep reading! It gets really good and action packed!"},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"The use of anonymous letters is a plot device that used to be more popular in detective fiction than it is now. Other Christie mysteries used the idea of the anonymous letter (such as MURDER ON THE LINKS, one of the early Poirots.) THE MOVING FINGER is the culmination of Christie's thinking about this topic. Other Golden Age novels with this device include Carter Dickson's spooky NIGHT AT THE MOCKING WIDOW and, less successfully, Ellery Queen's THE SCARLET LETTERS. Clouzot's film LE CORBEAU, written around the same time as THE MOVIGN FINGER, is a wonderfully atmospheric thriller, and it has an American remake too. I suppose they're still making films about the anonymous letter, only now they're anonymous phone calls (like WHEN A STRANGER CALLS or even the \\"Scream\\" trilogy.)Jerry Burton's a bit of a headcsse after seeing action with the RAF and doctors have ordered him to seek surcease from war in sleepy little Lymstock, where nothing has been known to happen for years, and the War seems very far away. With him as his nurse is his sister Joanna, a sophisticated young thing out of an Evelyn Waugh novel but a woman with a heart of gold and an eye for strays. Together the Burtons meet up with their fair share of village characters, most of them very well bred. The doctor, the lawyer, the minister, the banker and their wives and families. One among them, however, is an insanely calculating killer, and many villagers are receiving obscene anonymous letters which puts the whole village on edge.Meanwhile, Jerry is seeing quite a bit of a young girl, Megan Hunter, who's quite a tomboy in manner, and seeing as though she just got out of school she's awfully young, but then again I suppose Jerry is pretty young too. Otherwise when you read about the romance that develops between Jerry and Megan there is a bit of pedophilia creeping in, or so it seems to modern eyes. Joanna finds her own romance with the town's kindly doctor, who hasn't seen a woman quite like Joanna, even up North.The mystery is a corker. I've read the book several times and I can never guess who it is! Another thing that always surprises me is the (very late) entrance of Miss Marple. Once Marple gets to Lymstock, the book becomes a more or less conventional Miss Marple novel. I almost wish that Agatha Christie had left her out of the book entirely, for the story is so strong that Marple is very nearly a distraction!"},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"What \\"improvements\\" have been made for the Black Dog & Leventhal edition?

There are further additions still in the Signet, Bantam, and Berkley editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers?

He has been sent to the village of Lymstock to get rest and quiet. Accompanied by his sister Joanna, Jerry soon finds that all is not as peaceful as he might have hoped. A series of poison pen letters detailing the explicit and often illicit facts of the residents' lives is causing quite a stir. The fear escalates when an apparent suicide is followed by a murder. With so much wickedness abounding, the vicar's wife calls in her old friend Jane Marple, whom she considers an expert on wickedness in village life.This book is notable for its excellent characterizations. From the community-minded doctor's sister, to the charming spinster who rents the Burtons her home, to the dazzling governess of the lawyer's young boys, Mrs. Christie gives us a village filled with quirky and interesting people. Most notable is Megan Hunter, perhaps her finest young girl protagonist, who is transformed from the dowdy stepdaughter to an exquisite Cinderella.The narrative style is light and entertaining, the romance sweet, and the murder quite deadly in this fun and always ingenuous offering from the mistress of mystery.Mrs. Christie herself recalls this story in her autobiography as a personal favorite that has stood the test of time. As charming as it no doubt was when first published in 1943, The Moving Finger is a most satisfying read."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"In addition to the delights one gleans from Christie's deft, skillful plotting, incisive wit, and rich characterizations, the true strength of \\"The Moving Finger\\" is Christie's examination of evil underneath the pristine surface. This \\"wickedness\\" lies not only beneath the beautiful exteriors of the sleepy village, but also beneath the shiny faces of its inhabitants.Christie is quite adept at communicating the \\"atmosphere that seemed tinged with evil.\\" When confronted with the distressing and distasteful poison pen letters appearing in the village, one of the characters exclaims, \\"Such a peaceful smiling happy countryside-and down underneath something evil....It's full of festering poison and it looks as peaceful and innocent as the Garden of Eden...\\" In addition, Christie recognizes the dark side of human nature, and that it is often extremely difficult to tell what people are really like beneath their poilte behavior. \\"I'm beginning to realize how little I really know about anyone...In everybody's life there are hidden chapters which they hope may never be known...\\"Christie makes it clear, however, that this evil is not a supernatural phenomenon divorced from human intervention in a particulary perceptive and profound passage, \\"There's too much tendency to attribute to God the evils that man does of his own free will...God doesn't really need to punish us...We're so very busy punishing ourselves...\\" And although \\"it isn't very pleasant to look upon the fellow creatures one meets as possible criminal lunatics,\\" Christie takes a realistically pessimistic view of human nature and a depicts a village filled with \\"gossiping, whispering women\\" and \\"selfish, grasping natures.\\"\\"The Moving Finger\\" is an absorbing account of a sociopath. \\"Such apparently unlikely people do the most fantastic things.\\" Christie reminds us that the most horrifying evil usually comes from the most unlikely source- seemingly upright, normal people who are hiding the most unfathonable and terrifying wickedness. \\"The Moving Finger\\" is one of her most skillfull and insightful productions."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"I read almost all of Christie's books at one point 4 or 5 years ago. One of the last I hit upon was &quot;The Moving Finger&quot;, and it turned out to be my favorite Christie mystery. I loved the main narrator - Jerry Burton; his neurosis, wit, simplistic arrogance and ultimately good heart were so novel to me, especially in a murder mystery. He was a breath of fresh air from the likes of Miss Marple and Poirot.These many years later, I picked up the title again to see what I thought. I see now that the narrator reminds me in some ways of Grimes' main characters for her murder mysteries - intelligent, reserved, seemingly aloof, somewhat cynical, and ultimately kind bachelors written by females authors. Apparently I find this character irresistable as I love all of Grimes' work.However, in going back and rereading some Grimes and some Christie, I am noticing how different their styles are. While I read Grimes' books the first time only 2 or 3 years ago, I find I can't remember the solution to her mysteries when I reread them because she buries her clues below a rich surface of character development. Christie, on the other hand, doesn't ever wander far from her murder mystery plot - no matter how much she may twist and turn it; and as soon as I started into this book I thought, &quot;Oh, ______ did it&quot;. Even so, I enjoyed reading this little gem again.That all said, in addition to having a neurotic narrator - which you may or may not enjoy - this mystery focuses on the reactions in a small country village as racy anonymous letters are received by everyone in town. Jerry Burton, the narrator, and his sister arrive from London for some needed R&amp;R right about when these letters start becoming known and so are drawn in to the town's little scandal.While Christie expounds on the psychology of those who write such notes, you have to watch all the details of the case. Like the murderer, Christie is masterful at getting you to focus on the wrong things...and then surprising you with the obvious solution. Very well done and a tribute to her uncanny gift of creating puzzles and then solving them for you."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"In a forward Agatha Christie provided for a reprint of this book, she wrote of the pleasure it was to tackle one of the classic themes, and of the great pleasure she found in writing this book with its \\"cosy village atmosphere and characters\\".The classic theme here is the phenomenon of the Poison Pen. The book is one of her shorter mysteries but one of the most cunningly devised. Adept at constructing puzzles, she opts for presenting this one as a first person narrative. The narrator is a young man recuperating from a flying accident, told by his doctor that he must \\"go and live in the country and lead the life of a vegetable for at least six months\\". With his sister he rents a cottage in a small English village \\"of no importance whatsoever\\".Accordingly, when the poison pen letters begin circulating, it is this narrator, a stranger to the village, who decribes things as he sees them, retails all the local gossip, and reports everyone's suspicions about the writer of the letters. A murder and an apparent suicide follow, and we read of the efforts of the local police to investigate.Miss Marple thus is introduced late in the book and, of course, she proves better at solving the mystery than everybody else. You will be an astute and alert reader if you discover whodunit before Miss Marple reveals all."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"A young man and his sister from London rent a house in a country town so he can recover from his injuries.

Toward the very end of the book, the vicar's wife calls in Miss Marple who is able to put the final pieces together.Agatha Christie usally \\"gets me\\" about half the time (as far as guessing, \\"who done it,\\"), and she got me on this one! A pleasant read."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"This book is really enjoyable. It has an interesting plot, a satisfying mystery, and some very likeable characters. It was originally published in the early 1940s, but since the war is not mentioned or referred to in any way, perhaps it is meant to be set in the 1930s.Jerry Burton is the narrator of The Moving Finger. He has withdrawn to Lymstock, a quiet country village, to recover from a flying accident, accompanied by his fashionable sister Joanna. Both of them are planning to take it easy, get to know their neighbours, and generally enjoy themselves. Then the arrival of an anonymous poison pen letter makes them wonder if they are as welcome in Lymstock as they had thought - until they find that there's an epidemic of nasty letters in the village. A worrying climate is developing, as people are beginning to take the contents of the letters seriously. And then Mrs Symmington, the local lawyer's wife, commits suicide after receiving such a letter. But since this an Agatha Christie book, we know that things aren't that simple.Unlike a lot of Christie's books, it's the characters that make this one. Jerry is gruff but kind-hearted, and not afraid to say what he thinks. Joanna is likewise kind-hearted, but less obvious about it; willing to niggle and manipulate to challenge people's views or get her own way. Other characters such as Owen Griffiths, the doctor; his sister, the annoyingly hearty Aimee; and Mrs Dane Calthrop, the disconcerting vicar's wife, also capture the attention and move the story along. Megan Hunter, Mrs Symmington's daughter, is another good character, a &quot;changeling&quot; who doesn't fit into village life and is taken under Jerry and Joanna's wing.So what, you may ask, is the connection of Jerry to the poison pen letters? Being an outsider, he isn't willing to sweep the matter under the rug, and works with the police to solve the crime - the solution of which is both ingenious, and something the alert reader (that is, a lot more alert than me!) has a fair chance of figuring out. Don't expect much Miss Marple in this book, though (which I was kind of glad of - the more I read of her, the less I like her) - she only turns up towards the very end to reveal all. It's kind of a pity she appears at all, since Jerry is strong enough to carry the book on his own, and MM's appearance is merely an in-joke to the established reader of Christie's books.The Moving Finger has the usual Christie strengths of an ingenious plot, a clarity of style, and justice being done. Add to that good characters and something I particularly enjoy, a window into a world that no longer exists, and you have a very good book. I think it's one of her best."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"This is a great book. The story is being told by Jerry Burton, an appealing narrarator, very human. Although the plot is great, the mystery nearly impossible to figure out, subtle clues presented throughout the book, this may make a better read the second time around, since its fun to find things that people said that meant more than one thing. The only reason it's not 5 stars is that Ms. Marple, Christie's charming lady detective, is called in as \\"an expert\\" where the local police have failed- vaguely reminiscent of Sherlock Holmes... She is hardly in the book at all, she simply explains it when the whole thing is over. Jerry Burton takes the limelight as the actual detective. Still, this is definetly one of Christie's best, and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"Agatha Christie wrote \\"The Moving Finger\\" in 1943.

Jerry and his sister Joanna settle in Lymstock, an idyllic country town that is three miles from a main road. It is a place where, as an astonished Joanna observes, \\"People really call - with cards!\\"Jerry's peaceful, vegetative life in Lymstock is, however, soon shattered. A few days after their arrival, Jerry receives a malicious anonymous letter. The letter alleges that the Burtons are not brother and sister, but an unmarried couple living in sin. Jerry and Joanna are initially quite amused by the novelty of receiving such a letter, but they soon view the letter as a sign of something much more sinister.All of Lymstock, it seems, has been receiving these letters. When a woman apparently commits suicide after receiving a letter, the search for the writer intensifies. After another character is murdered, presumably by the anonymous writer, a palpable fear settles over the community. Neighbor suspects neighbor and the whole of Lymstock wonders who amongst them could be capable of such despicable acts.The indomitable Miss Marple makes her first appearance in the last quarter of the novel. For a less skillful writer than Dame Christie, the lack of the primary character could have made this story very tedious for the reader, but Christie's characters are so well-drawn and compelling that the reader does not notice the loss. The primary sleuthing has been done by Jerry and a few of the other residents of Lymstock, but only Miss Marple is able to connect the myriad of clues and bring the killer to justice.The Moving Finger was originally published in the United States in 1942. For a novel that is over sixty years old, it has aged incredibly well. Agatha Christie's extraordinary understanding of human nature gives her characters and her stories a timeless quality.One of my favorite Christie novels, The Moving Finger is a compelling read that will keep you guessing until the end."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"The interest of this small detective story is not where we could think it should be. Miss Marple solves the problem in a very holmesian way : don't look for what is obvious but look for what is hidden by the smokescreen of the obvious. But the book reveals, describes and analyzes the reactions of a village and of the people in the village who are confronted to a series of anonymous letters. It shows how gossiping dominates and informs the minds of the people. It shows how these minds can be totally governed by old fears, perverse curiosity and jealousy in a way or another. It shows how idleness due to the lack of eventful developments in a village manages the life of people : when nothing happens in your village, the slightest little piece of news or observation of your neighbour becomes an essential topic. A criminal, here a murderer, can then use this functioning to build a smokescreen that will hide his own crime and send everyone, including the police, on a wrong track because they are going to follow the obvious and the obvious is what you can see, and when there is a smokescreen you can only see the smoke. It is well done, though regular readers of detective stories will know the solution practically from the very start. This genre is aging rather fast because it has developed so much that it has enlarged the ability of the readers to see the strings of the plot, even when these strings are covered with a smokescreen, and Agatha Christie is a real artist at leading us astray, if we just let ourselves be led, which is in a way an essential quality in a good reader.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"While a bit of a slow starter, one ultimately sees the necessity of this caveat as the story evolves. This one features great wallpaper and superior character development.Following a plane crash, a young bachelor aristocrat, along with his sister, temporarily escape to the country that he might heal blissfully while savouring the mundane activities of a small village. But, much to his doctor's consternation, this is not to be.Vulgar and accusatory anonomous letters have been circulating about the village and the protagonists, for all their nobility, are not spared. Soon following their arrival, the accusation is that the two are not brother and sister, but rather, lovers. But since this is clearly an erroneous assertion, the letters are laughed off -- until one letter apparently hits a nerve in this sleepy little hamlet and the result is a tragic suicide.The plot thickens and twists and, finally, Miss Marple is brought in by a concerned resident as a consultant in the case. But even Miss Marple has difficulty in seeing her way clear to prove that this was in fact murder, and not suicide. But the aged spinster-sleuth is forced to take a huge risk and act fast, teaming up with the local police inspector, before more murder occurs.I wouldn't reccomend this as a first Christie novel to read (go to \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" for that, her first mystery), but fans will clearly enjoy this one. If the work has a flaw, it appears that Miss Marple may have been brought in as an afterthought on Christie's part."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"I thought this book was pretty good.

I felt bad for the writer because they must have been pretty lonely to start doing this to people.

He and his modern sister Joanna took a lease on a house, Little Furze, whose owner had been forced to let out due to financial needs.At first, the village appeared perfect. It was certainly small enough that the Burtons got to know a number of notable locals who were to play prominent roles in the nasty affair to follow.There was the village pastor who appeared to be more a scholar than a shepherd, and his wife who made people she could see right into their souls.There was Owen Griffith, the local doctor, and his sister Aimee, the alpha female with boundless energy.There was Richard Symington, the lawyer, who had two sons and an enigmatic step-daughter from his wife's previous marriage.There was also Elise Holland, whose appearance sent Jerry Burton to the skies and whose voice brought him crashing down to earth.Perhaps it was traditional provincial animosity towards outsiders, Joanna received a poison pen letter soon after their arrival. But later they realised they were not the only ones. Various other ladies also received one. Strangely, though there were authentic materials available, the writer of the letters chose to fabricate the accusations.The recepients tried to ignore or deny the letters until one day, Mrs Symington, wife of the local lawyer, apparently poisoned herself with one such letter found nearby.Shortly after that, her maid was found murdered.As the progress of the police appeared slow, the pastor's wife called in Ms Jane Marple. Using the subconscious observations of an outsider, Jerry Burton, she pieced the truth and ferreted the real culprit out.The writing of this novel is excellent. Again, Agatha Christie managed to vividly desribed the personalities and interpersonal interactions of various characters to subtly build a background to a murder, without the whole picture being obvious. She also gave a lively description of a bucolic small village scene, making it interesting even to those who had no real interest in being personally involved such rustic settings.The only flaw I could detect was in the evidence, the typewriter identified used in the crime. Due to certain timings of the recepients getting the letters, the poison pen writer should not have been able to use the typewriter in the described manner to send one of the letters."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"Written during the long wartime nights in London, only stopped by the frequent bombing raids, The Moving Finger (1943) is Agatha Christie's 42nd novel. ...\\"Rather to my surprise... I find that another one [of my books] I am rather pleased with is The Moving Finger,\\" Christie wrote in her autobiography. True, you cannot miss the typical Miss Marple setting: take a small village engaged in gossip and add a nice juicy murder that could have been committed by every person living in that village. But that is where the parallel with books like The Murder at the Vicarage (1930) stops.The characters depicted in The Moving Finger are crudely sketched, becoming almost unbelievable. For example, the main character, narrator and lacking all credibility, starts to annoy you after the first ten pages with his single-minded comments and simply ruins the pace of the story. When Miss Marple appears on the last pages, she cannot rescue the story, because the solution she proposes seems to have but few connections the actual story."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"Although I enjoyed reading this, I felt that it clearly was not Agatha Christie's best.

It is a simple story told straight forwardly but has undertones of evil. The hero and his sister are front and center, but all the characters are vivid in your mind's eye. There is a love interest back story, but most of her works have a little something in the romantic vein-just a touch, but enough. The whodunnit is interesting and you will probably guess wrong because you are reading something from the Mistress of Mystery.As always, interesting villagers and many quirky characters.

The village is full of quirky characters, any one of whom might be responsible for the anonymous missives. Ultimately the mystery will be solved by one of the villagers' acquaintances, none other than Miss Jane Marple.This was my first Miss Marple mystery, and I was surprised at how small a presence Miss Marple actually was in the story. She didn't appear until more than halfway through the book, and then remained in the background, sort of like the furniture. Yes, she does ultimately solve the mystery, but she's hardly a character of much consequence. It appears that The Moving Finger is one of the earlier Miss Marple mysteries, and perhaps the character was not yet well-developed. As this was my first Miss Marple I don't really have another novel for comparison.The story is told by an injured pilot, who has moved to the countryside to recover. As he meets the various villagers, especially the women, there's an added element of romance, but as with all of Christie's work, the mystery remains the heart of the book.

She is called in as an expert on humans by the vicar's wife. She figures it out and sets up a trap to nab the murderer.It was interesting to me how the narrator Jerry Burton drops explicit hints to the reader, saying that certain things turn out to be important and how he could have solved the mystery earlier had he paid more attention. I did take notice and I still didn't figure it out; I read Miss Marple's explanation and it still didn't help me very much. But I liked this and I enjoyed the little romance. I know Christie is a mystery writer and she frequently writes the most awful things about women as if they were facts that apply to all women but she writes cute romances. She couldn't sustain an entire book with them but as a garnishing to the mystery, they work well.Overall: 4/5. Could have been higher if there had been more Miss Marple"},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"It all begins quite innocently. Our narrator, Jerry Burton, has hurt his back and moves to little Lymstock to get a quiet rest in order to heal. He brings along his sister, Joanna. She receives a letter from a malcontent who uses foul language and accuses her of the most immoral things. As it turns out, mostly everyone in this small village has received such a letter. Eventually, of course, someone has to die and does so leaving a barrage of suspects and motives. Jerry is thrown into the role of trying to piece the mystery together with the police. Naturally, as this is a Miss Marple mystery, Christie's hobbyist sleuth shows up (quite late in the story, actually) and adds her intelligence and adept solving skills to the scene. Eventually, like almost all Christie novels, the culprit is discovered and the villagers continue on in their quaint and happy livelihoods. This is a fun mystery and is pretty quick reading."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"Jerry Burton is an injured RAF fighter pilot who needs lots of rest and recuperation after a crash leaves him temporarily crippled. The doctor suggests finding a quiet country village, and he and his vivacious sister Joanna settle on renting a cottage in Lymstock. But when they arrive, they discover that the peaceful little place is being plagued by a series of poison-pen letters, spreading vicious and petty accusations among the inhabitants. When one of the letters results in a suicide, Jerry takes it upon himself to help the police catch the individual who is terrorizing the citizens.Told in first-person narrative by Jerry, some may be surprised at the lack of Miss Marple herself. Though \\"The Moving Finger\\" is classified as a Marple mystery, the elderly sleuth does not in fact show up until chapter ten, (well over halfway through the book) and even then has a very small part to play in the mystery: she drops a few hints, organises a plan to catch the culprit and then explains everything at the end. Fans looking for a specific \\"Miss Marple\\" fix may be disappointed. Also, I can't help but note that because the narration is told in hindsight, Jerry keeps adding little ominous notes to the end of his chapters as to forthcoming events that get a little overly dramatic after a while.However, if you know what to expect, (or rather, who *not* to expect) then this is one of Christie's finest mysteries, as well as one of her personal favourites. There is a wide range of fascinating characters, all of whom come under suspicion at one point or another. Usually Christie relies on a range of stereotypical characters to round out her cast, but here everyone is unique, precisely because the plot calls for a character-study in which various people can be held up for comparison against the profile that the police create for the anonymous letter-writer.Like Marple herself, Christie was a keen observer of human nature, and here she's at her peak at creating a pretty little picture of village life that is festering under the surface with gossip and spite. As clues concerning the poison-pen writer grows, so too does suspicion among the inhabitants - and you'll be as paranoid as the next person when trying to figure out who could be behind it all!Along with the mystery is a romance that blossoms between Jerry and a young woman called Megan Hunter, one of Christie's more vivid characters. Eccentric and anti-social, Megan somehow gets under Jerry's skin, and though the romance is an unorthodox one, it manages to be somewhat charming in its oddness. Yet for most of the book, Jerry refers to her as \\"the child\\" (even after he discovers he has romantic feelings for her), and though we are never specifically told his age, it's clear that he's significantly older than the twenty-year old Megan. Furthermore, he is the one behind her \\"makeover\\" from an ugly ducking to beautiful swan, which gives off the vague impression that he's grooming her. Some might find all this a tad disturbing, and yet the breeziness of Christie's narration and the sincerity of Jerry's narration means that it never becomes truly creepy...perhaps just a bit disconcerting. I only mention it because this plot is surprisingly central to the story (when romances in Christie are usually kept as sub-plots).In any case, the mystery will keep you page-turning all the way to a very satisfying conclusion. By the way, in case you were wondering, the title is derived from the poem by Omar Khayyam:The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor WitShall lure it back to cancel half a Line,Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"\\"The Moving Finger\\" by Agatha Christie begins somewhat enigmatically, with an unknown narrator telling the story in first person, which is unusual for Christie's mysteries. The narrator turns out to be a pilot, injured in a plane crash, who has been adviced by his doctor to seek out some quite countryside where he can peacefully continue to heal. The narrator and his sister, Jerry and Joanna Burton, take a house in the seemingly quiet and quaint town of Lymstock, but soon learn that the town isn't quite what it seems.Shortly upon arriving in the small town, Jerry and his sister receive a vile letter, accusing them of not really being brother and sister. They take little notice of it until they learn that other townspeople have received similar letters, which don't contain much truth, but lots of suspicion. When one of the letters causes someone to commit suicide, further light is shed upon these nasty accusations; and when a young maid is found murdered, Jerry begins to think that the first death might not have been suicide. While the police are searching for the most-likely female perpetrator, the pastor's wife calls in Miss Marple to solve the mystery, as all of the townspeople are ready to think of the worst of whoever might be singled out next.\\"The Moving Finger\\" is a classic Christie mystery, even if the first-person storytelling is a departure from the norm. It has a fast-paced intriguing plot with a subtle twist at the end of the story. Jerry never quite touches upon the real perpetrator of these crimes, but is shown the light by Miss Marple, as is any character in Christie's works, and as is usually the reader."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"A Miss Marple novel published in 1942, this mystery is one of Agatha Christie's own favorites. Set in what by all appearances seems to be the quiet village of Little Furze, the place where the injured pilot Jerry Burton goes with his sister Joanna to recuperate, it doesn't take long to learn that the place is in a bit of a turmoil. Someone is sending nasty letters to various residents; even Jerry and Joanna receive one accusing them of an incestuous affair. Before long a suicide and a murder occur because of the letters. Investigation shows that the letters are composed of words and passages cut from old books. Miss Marple is eventually let in on what's been going on, and just before another murder is about to take place, she solves the mystery. The story is tight and interesting. There are also a couple of love stories going on as subplots, which resolve themselves nicely by novel's end. It's a most satisfying mystery from the master."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"The narrator of the 1942 story is Jerry Burton, an RAF pilot who was sent to recuperate from a crash in a quiet environment. Jerry and his sister Johanna moved to an out of the way little village but soon found that life there would be anything but peaceful. The first unsettling event was the arrival of a poison pen letter, an occurance that made them part of the village. Most of the rest of the town had gotten one already. Just as they were getting acquainted with their neighbors there was a suicide, or was it murder?As time passed there were more letters, more deaths and romances. A less skillful writer would have made a confused mess of all of the various threads but Christie keeps the focus on the mystery while maintaining the romance as an interesting subplot.The story has worn well in the intervening fifty years. The only dated aspect is that women's lives were more restricted then. So why is this story an 'almost' 5? The problem is that Miss Marple arrives on the scene about 3/4 of the way through the book and then does very little. For Miss Marple fans this is not nearly enough of her. In my opinion Christie should have either brought her in sooner or left her out altogether.Despite this THE MOVING FINGER is an excellent story and one of Christie's most memorable stories."},{"Title":"The Moving Finger","review":"Some of the Audio BBC are quite good. However Moving Finger was just ok. It lacked the mood of the unabridged original. I was never quite sure of the extent of damage done to Jerry's legs.It failed to capture the atmoshpere of the original. Also the ending differed from the original to a certain extent. Some of these dramas are fairly well done. Moving Finger just was not in that category. Go for the unabridged audio or the novel."},{"Title":"Children of the Earth and Sky","review":"A very beautiful intelligent read. My children loved it as much as I did. I encouraged my son's teacher to influence her students to read this and similar stories. Not only is it educational for Native American children but also for others. It is important that every American child learn about Native Americans. Unless they live near a rez most people do not even realize Native Americans still live. In schools American children learn about the pilgrims and that small chapter in history about the bloody Indian wars. There is so much more; culture, tradition, history, and even morals. If you teach the children now, with stories such as this one, perhaps they will learn acceptance of other cultures instead of ignorance.Children of the Earth and Sky is a collection of five stories about Indian children. (Hopi, Comanche, Mohawk, Navajo, and Mandan) Each teach a lesson full of tradition and culture. The book is also filled with beautiful pictures that flicker images from a world of the past. I recommend this book for all ages and nationalities."},{"Title":"San Francisco Opera: The First Seventy-Five Years","review":"This oversized coffee table book was prepared and published as part of the 75th anniversary celebration of the San Francisco Opera in the fall of 1997. It contains page after page of beautiful photographs with descriptions of performances by the likes of Lawrence Tibbett, Lauritz Melchior, Kirsten Flagstad, Beniamino Gigli, Leonard Warren, Leonie Rysanek, John Vickers, Ezio Pinza, Birgit Nilsson, and many many others. The San Francisco Opera is indisputably one of the important opera companies of North America. Operas by 20th century composers such as Britten, Hanze, Orff, Poulenc, Ravel, Shostakovich, Tippett and Walton as well as operas by earlier composers such as Cherubini and Rossini were given their United States premieres on the stage of the War Memorial Opera House. For all of this book's strengths, it has some decided faults. It does contain a listing of all performance from 1923 through the end of the 1996-97 season with dates and casts. While it is interesting to browse through the listings, its usefulness as a research tool is seriously undermined by the lack of an index. If you want to find out how many times Lily Pons sang the title role in Lucia di Lammermoor, or if she ever sang that role in San Francisco, you have to read through the listings for every year. With an index you could simply look up the information by the name of the singer or opera. Likewise, there is no single list of all of the operas performed by the SF Opera. Also, the organization of the book lends itself to browsing, not to finding specific facts. The text of the book does not form a chronological history of the company. Rather, the chapters are devoted to specific topics. Four chapters are devoted to the general directors that have led the company. Interspersed between those four chapters are chapters on leading men, leading women, physical productions, and the orchestra/chorus/ballet. So, if you wanted to read about the 1967-68 season, you might find mention of that season in several different chapters."},{"Title":"San Francisco Opera: The First Seventy-Five Years","review":"This text is a wonderful history of opera in San Francisco with marvelous photos and well written summaries. The book is a welcome addition to any library--informative, attractive, and complete. The Amazon price was also wonderful and the book is in excellent condition."},{"Title":"San Francisco Opera: The First Seventy-Five Years","review":"This was an incredibly well put together book on the history of the San Francisco opera.

The premise of a transexual hit (wo)man coming back home to off a club owner amongst all the club kids and nutters sounds lively and promising. The devil is in the writing though, and although quick-reading, the prose doesn't quite deliver."},{"Title":"Acid Casuals (A Mask Noir Title)","review":"Acid Casuals is an exciting non-stop novel. Blincoe displays his talent for never letting the reader lose interest. The negative reviews that I have read do nothing but encourage me to read more of Blincoe's work. He knows the underground world of Britain, and he masterfully creates a novel to keep your head spinning. Transexuals, drugs, and sex are just some of the things that make this novel amazing. The way Blincoe melts them together is genius. If you want to pass the time, read a book. If you want to experience a world of entertainment, read Acid Casuals."},{"Title":"Acid Casuals (A Mask Noir Title)","review":"If any of you have watched the &quot;New Order Story&quot; about the fortunes and disorder witnessed by the famous Manchester band then you should read Acid Casuals. Not only does the author hail from Factory Records but this book covers the antics of a nightclub owner (aka Anthony Wilson, the New Order manager). Of course the names have been changed to protect the author but Wilson must be reeling after this gem of a book. Fantastic reading without this twist but if you're a fan of Manchester sub culture or New Order then this is a must. Oh how I laughed as here in the UK this book has recieved much acclaim as a result of Blincoe's slick, ultra-hip dialogue. Yet so few people know what this book is really all about! Tony Wilson finally gets what he deserved all along. Brilliant!"},{"Title":"Acid Casuals (A Mask Noir Title)","review":"Do not give this author any more acid. Patently, he is well past his limit."},{"Title":"Acid Casuals (A Mask Noir Title)","review":"With every literary effort, Blincoe is digging himself a new hole. Not only does he not understand the subject he pitifully tries to write about, but he does it in such a yawn inducing way as to warrant an health warning; Do Not Read Blincoe Near Heavy Machinery.

If your taking the Series 6, I would like to recommend this book, and wish you good luck!"},{"Title":"Bloody London","review":"Dear Amazon, I was disappointed to see that you had posted the netative Kirkus review, but not the very positive Starred Publishers Weekly which goes like this: &quot;Red Mercury Blues and Hot Poppies, Nadelson's first two books about Russian-born New York cop Artie Cohen were colorful but basically conventional mysteries. In her third book (Bloody London) the author makes a major leap forward in scope and depth. The novel-a harrowing take on the sickness that seeped out of Russian following the collapse of communism and infected New York and London--offers a frightrening, apocalyptic vision of two cities drowning in success. Characters we've met before have grown and changed: Artie, still carrying several loads of immigrant baggage from his journey to Moscow to Israel to New York, is no longer a cop, but a PI, doing special jobs for a much subdued Sonny Lippert, his mentor, who's a federal prosecutor. Artie's lover, Lily Hanes, now the mother of an adopted chinese baby girl, is worried that Artie's current case--looking into a Russian connection to the murder of a wealthy and powerful Englishman who ruled his exclusive Sutton Place co-op with a ruthless hand-might stir up some old secrets of her own, especially about her ex-husband, who has found a way to profit from the homeless. And Tolya Sverdloff, Cohen's charming and connniving friend from the streets of Moscow and Brighton Beach, is now a high-flying player in some brutal financial games, worried enough to have a secret steel-walled safe room carved into his apartment. The scenes set in new York City are taut and sharply etched, but the novel really takes off--into Nathaniel West country--when Artie follows Lily to a a London ready to burst from catastrophic rains and the accumulated poisons of decades of official greed and neglect. This is a powerful portrait of cities and people, wobbling on the edge. (Publishers Weekly, November 22, l999) STARRED REVIEW. I would be delighted if you would post this and perhaps take out the Kirkus."},{"Title":"Bloody London","review":"Reggie Nadelson's latest brings back her Russian/American hero Artie Cohen as a private eye. Artie is worldly-wise, soulful, and not above making up the rules as he goes along. Nadelson's New York and London are pitch-perfect, her plot appropriately labyrinthine, and her best heroines are at once beautiful, wised-up, willful, and--intriguingly--over 40. If you like intelligently written mysteries that keep one eye on the headlines--Michael Connelly comes to mind--you're going to love this."},{"Title":"Bloody London","review":"Former Russian citizen, Artie Cohen left NYPD to become a private investigator. Much of his work comes from Sonny Lippert, who asks Artie to investigate a Manhattan murder of a British expatriate Tommy Pascoe. The assailant tried to remove the victim's head before leaving the deceased to swim in an exclusive Sutton Place pool.Artie begins to investigate the murder and soon finds a Russian connection that sends the sleuth into Brooklyn. Other killings follow and lead Artie to London where the city seems on the verge of annihilation or exhilaration depending on where you sit in the food chain.BLOODY LONDON, the third Artie Cohen mystery is a puissant tale that focuses on the decade-old aftermath of the collapse of Communism on New York and London. Artie remains a charming but wild mix while his girlfriend Lily seems stronger than previously depicted. The who-done-it is entertaining as Artie falls in love with the decadent, exciting, and pendulum-like swinging London. Though Reggie Nadelson makes Artie seem too lyrical at times, this doesn't prevent fans or readers new to this exciting series (see RED HOT BLUES and HOT POPPIES) from enjoying the maturing of the characters as the tale twists into new areas."},{"Title":"Bloody London","review":"The first half of the book, set in New York, wasn't particularly convincing. The second half, set in London, was ridiculuous. It sounds like it was written by someone who spent a weekend in London after reading an article in an inflight magazine on the Thames Barrier. The attempt to evoke a sense of impending doom by describing Londoners packing a supermarket, with kids tearing open packets of M&Ms; is about as convincing as \\"the young cop struggl[ing] to inflate a dinghy by blowing on its tube like it was a balloon. His face swelled up with effort\\". Puhlease! A shortwave radio for weather reports? In London?If Reggie Nadelson wants to write a weather catastrophe novel, maybe she should stick to North Carolina or Florida.Of course everyone gets to live happily ever after at the end, even though none of the real baddies have been brought to book, and they're supposed to be the sort of ruthless characters who will have you killed for looking at them crooked."},{"Title":"Bloody London","review":"It's rare that I give up on a book as fast as I did this one, but life's too short to plough through writing this dismal. On page one I doubt if there was even a single sentence with more than four words in it, and the writing conveyed just that - words, no significance, just letters strung together to make dull words. My review of this single page has taken more time than I had ever hoped to spend again on this book after I left it lying on a table in a university lounge. Call it altruism.

After the grandson bungles a tech acquisition, the investor shorts and the price falls by two thirds. The investor closes and begins to ponder whether it is possible to transform a boring company into a stockmarket star. The book is more or less a manual of how to dress up mutton as lamb, and as a professional investor, I particularly appreciate the detail on how to manipulate the stock price so as to produce the chart signals that get technical analysts excited.The fact that this book is out of print merely proves that the collective intelligence of the market is as low as ever."},{"Title":"Street Fighting at Wall and Broad: An Insider's Tale of Stock Manipulation","review":"Investing is war.

A truly must read."},{"Title":"Congressional and state reapportionment and redistricting: A legal analysis (CRS report for Congress)","review":"Christian classic, \\"Medjugorje, The Message,\\" is Wayne Weible's first book on Medjugorje, a mountain village in central Bosnia where the Virgin Mary has been appearing to a small group of then children, now adults, since June, 1981. The lives of millions of people have been transformed since.Weible, a newspaper columnist and Lutheran, became interested in the apparitions of Medjugorje in October 1985, because he felt it would make a good story for the weekly papers in his community of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. He was a skeptic and, as a Protestant, had nominal disdain for such \\"Catholic things.\\" As he was watching a videotape about the apparitions, he was stunned by a message to his heart, \\"Write about the events of Medjugorje; this will become your life's mission if you choose to accept it. You will no longer be in your present work.\\" He felt the Virgin Mary was speaking directly to him.Today, Weibel is the most popular chronicler of the phenomenon and has been leading pilgrimages there for more than a decade. This first book provides a backdrop to the apparitions - the events leading up to the apparitions, information on each of the visionaries, the challenges to the apparitions, the messages given to us from the Virgin Mary, and Weibel's own spiritual journey that followed.The message of Medjugorje centers on the Virgin Mary's encouragement for all to convert to the ways of Jesus. The way to conversion is through prayer, fasting, and penance.\\"Medjugorje\\" is an excellent introduction to the phenomenon of Medjugorje for Catholics and non-Catholics. This book inspired me to join a group from San Francisco that spent ten days around Easter Sunday, 1990, in Medjugorje (+ 2 days in spectacular Dubrovnik). It was a formative trip in my life and an experience I recall almost daily."},{"Title":"Congressional and state reapportionment and redistricting: A legal analysis (CRS report for Congress)","review":"I was given a copy of this book as a gift by a friend who has made seven pilgrimages to Medjugorje, and whose own life has been transformed by the experience.I was initially rather skeptical, but after reading this extraordinary account, I have now bought copies for other people as well.Almost exactly 25 years ago, six children reported that the Virgin Mary had appeared to them on a hillside in Bosnia-Herzegovina. She has allegedly been returning every day since then, making comments about the world, and advising us on actions that we need to take.The story is inspirational, and was recently given more credence by a scientific report indicating that there really is something going on here which appears inexplicable according to the currently accepted scientific model.The Vatican has not yet elevated Medjugorje to the level of a \\"miracle,\\" but the fact is that the events in this village have transformed the lives of people all over the world.I highly recommend this book to all spiritual seekers."},{"Title":"Congressional and state reapportionment and redistricting: A legal analysis (CRS report for Congress)","review":"Not being a terribly religious person when I read this book, I was almost embarassed to buy it but I'm glad I did. It truly got me to thinking about what is possible in this world and if I believe in Mary, why not be open to the possibility that she is still here with us, warning us to be faithful as she did at Fatima? A very objective book, about the author's travels to Medjugorje, Yugoslavia prior to the Bosnian war. It'll definitely make you think."},{"Title":"Congressional and state reapportionment and redistricting: A legal analysis (CRS report for Congress)","review":"Hello all and Christ is Risen!I wanted to write this review and say that this book is profoundly beautiful. Read it and get to know God's heart through Mary His Mother, the Blessed Virgin. I kid you not, this book WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE, because God speaks through Wayne's words directly to your heart. From my perspective, a Jewish convert to Catholicism, this book helped me and made me believe fully and trust in Jesus Christ GOD! Please don't judge the idea of a 2,000 year old Lady, the mother of a historical figure, Jesus Christ, (who you will come to know as God), frighten you or dissuade you from reading this beautiful book. Read it, read it, read it.Christ is Risen!"},{"Title":"Congressional and state reapportionment and redistricting: A legal analysis (CRS report for Congress)","review":"This book was very enlightning to me. I am a Methodist and never really thought much about the Blessed Mary except at Christmas time. The messages and miracles writen herein really makes you think about the spiritual realm of Jesus' mother. The call to pray the Rosary is still undecided in my mind, but I can sense the benefit of focusing on the events of Jesus' miracles and love as a needed help in my prayer life. I certainly offer my thanks and praise to all who have answered this calling. Your obedience has made a great difference thru-out many parts of the world.God is smiling on you."},{"Title":"Congressional and state reapportionment and redistricting: A legal analysis (CRS report for Congress)","review":"The book and its sequels, Medjugorje: The Mission (1994) and Final Harvest (2002) both also by Wayne Weible are truely inspirational! One can see God's hand working and guiding not only Mr. Weible but his family, friends, and many others. Through his writing, he has deeply affected thousands of others' lives by bringing the message of Mary's and Christ's love for us all. She calls us to conversion through prayer, fasting, and penance to draw us closer to God.While it is true that the Catholic Church has not formally approved of the Medjugorje apparitions, the Catholic Church has NOT dissapproved of them either. The Catholic Church will likely not make a determination until after the apparitions are complete, just as it has done in the past with Fatima and Lourdes.Medjugorje bears its own good fruit because of the Blessed Virgin Mary's efforts on behalf of her Son and on behalf of all of us. It bears its own good fruit because people have listened to Mary's message, not all and not always, but many have listened and acted accordingly. The messages which she gives to us through the vissionaries are consistent with the Gospel and the Catholic Faith. Nothing is new, but it is brought far closer to us in time and concreteness because of her appearances for almost 25 years. She does this in love for us ALL as her children!Wayne Weible captures this essence through his own story of involvement. And he writes this story in an easy and clear format that is humble yet inspiring, educational, and compelling. He tells of his own conversion and so much more! I had trouble putting any of these books down. My own faith has grown tremendously thanks to his work."},{"Title":"Congressional and state reapportionment and redistricting: A legal analysis (CRS report for Congress)","review":"I just started learning about the phenomenon occurring in Medjugorje and read this book to get an overview.

I have since gone to the Medjugorje Peace Conference and am planning a visit to Bosnia... all thanks to Wayne's book."},{"Title":"Congressional and state reapportionment and redistricting: A legal analysis (CRS report for Congress)","review":"This has to be one of the most exciting and exhilerating books I've ever read. I can honestly say that I only have read one other book that made me feel like this one did. The miracles of Medjugorvje will have you looking deep inside your yourself for the truth. I was a Catholic who has been brought up in the church yet that was about it. Later on I looked more into spirituality but recently have become invigorated and sort of been reborn into my faith. This book only proved my thoughts and gave me an easy to read and inspirational text to look to. The fact that it came from a former Protestant was ever more intriguing.Whether or not your into religion or believe in miracles, this book is not a let down. It was well worth the money I paid for it. I read the book in one day and I'm looking forward to reading the next book he had written. Whether you're a sceptic or not, you will not regret buying this book. The message is sincere and from the heart. By all means go ahead and buy and watch how it will touch you. Good luck."},{"Title":"Congressional and state reapportionment and redistricting: A legal analysis (CRS report for Congress)","review":"Once you start reading this book, you wont be able to put it down. I started reading this book with a lot of skepticism, but am now a true believer! I can't begin to explain how much this book has changed my life! I went from a luke warm catholic at best, to one who loves JESUS &amp; MARY and loves attending and participating in mass. Buy this book and it will change yourlife forever! Thank you and God bless you Wayne. P.S. If you've already read this book, read 'Medjugorje The Mission' next. It's a continuation of 'Medjugorje The Message.'"},{"Title":"Congressional and state reapportionment and redistricting: A legal analysis (CRS report for Congress)","review":"This book is the story of Wayne Weible's journey to Medjugorje. This book changed my life. It tells of the Blessed Mother's appearances to six croation kids in Medjugorje. It tells of his personal conversion and calling to spread the messages Our Lady is giving us there. These messages are truly from God, and if one is looking for a book to make his/her spiritual life better, this is the book for him/her. I also reccommend reading Medjugorje Day By Day, a daily medatation book. These apparitions have not yet been approved not because of their authenticity, but because the apparitions are still going on, and the Catholic church can only approve appartitions until after they have ceased. This book is amazing."},{"Title":"Congressional and state reapportionment and redistricting: A legal analysis (CRS report for Congress)","review":"This book is inspiring, provocative and, YES, life-changing, if you let it. Wayne Weible takes you along his spiritual journey, which resulted in his life-long devotion to Medjugorje. His language is simple, easy to relate to, and compelling. Wayne is just like you and me! I have never met him, but reading his words I feel as if I have known him for years; I feel like I walked his walk with him. This book will fascinate you, keep you in suspense, bring you to tears, give you hope.... I hope to visit Medjugorje one day, but I know that if that is not possible, then I have the teachings from Medjugorje right there on my bookshelf, in Weible's book. As Weible states in the book-- you do not have to visit Medjugorje to have a miracle happen in your life, you just have to BELIEVE and turn your life over to the Lord. Please read this book, you will NOT regret it, I promise!!!"},{"Title":"Congressional and state reapportionment and redistricting: A legal analysis (CRS report for Congress)","review":"This particular purchase was for a friend who just became Catholic.

It just wasn't exactly what I expected. I wanted to know every detail about the miracle that is happening in my time, but as it applies to all of us, not just to one person. This book is one person's personal story. It is well written, and an easy read."},{"Title":"Congressional and state reapportionment and redistricting: A legal analysis (CRS report for Congress)","review":"It is natural for people of faith to seek assurances. What has been, and is now, happening at Medugorje addresses the cosmic questions: Is there a God? and, If so, how are we then to live?Mr. Weible, a Lutheran who now prays the Rosary, recounts how the events at Medugorge came about, how he learned of them, and how that knowledge changed his life. He is a gifted writer and the book is very well written, not at all plodding or stodgy. I recommend it to all persons of faith as well as to those who have lost faith or never encountered it."},{"Title":"Congressional and state reapportionment and redistricting: A legal analysis (CRS report for Congress)","review":"This book was given to me by a friend and I found it very enlightening.

Medjugorje did not touch me until reading this book! I was looking for something inspirational before having to start my second round of chemotherapy and this book seemed to just pop up out of no where. My second round of chemo happen to be the 24th anniversay of the apparitions, 06/24/05. I don't think any of this was a coincidence. This book definitely changed my life for the better! I have passed it on to family and friends and they feel the same way! Praise God!"},{"Title":"Congressional and state reapportionment and redistricting: A legal analysis (CRS report for Congress)","review":"We are living in the last days of this world as we know it according to the messages given by Our Lady from Medjugorje. Mary is inviting all Her children where ever they may be and regardless of colour or creed. The urgency and universality of this message is fully encapsulated in Wayne's excellent book.Wayne Weible a protestant of the Baptist denomination was no exception. One day out of the blue he heard Marys's voice calling to him and like any sane person dismissed it but Mary is persistent and will not give up because She loves us all very much. Wayne finally succumbs to her charms and though not a Catholic has become one of the most widely read authors on Medjugorje. He has met with the six visionaries and their spiritual directors. Detailed accounts of his interviews and various meetings with the major players of the Medjugorje apparitions are given in the book.You will find it very difficult to put the book down once you have read the first page and I would suggest therefore that you reduce your work schedule that week as nothing will seem to matter any more until you have finished it! Certainly that's what happened to me."},{"Title":"Congressional and state reapportionment and redistricting: A legal analysis (CRS report for Congress)","review":"I was a nominal Catholic at best in 1994 when I happened to read this book one weekend when the family went out of town to visit relatives. I was not much of a reader at the time, but I oculd not put it down. I can say that it completely changed my life then and up to the present. It had a major impact on other family members and many others I know. Medjugorje itself was personally promoted by Pope John Paul II to many he came in contact with, including Mother Teresa, many Cardinals, Bishops, and Priests. Because of its world-wide significance, in an unprecedented manner the Vatican has taken authority over it and is expected to make some type of pronouncement over it in 2013 or soon thereafter. In my opinion, there is no better place in the world to make a pilgrimage or to send a family member or friend who is in need of a spiritual conversion. Mary's role is simply to bring others to her Son and to teach us that God truly exists. It seems it is virtually impossible to come away from Medjugorje (or simply from reading the book) without experiencing a major change in your life."},{"Title":"Congressional and state reapportionment and redistricting: A legal analysis (CRS report for Congress)","review":"No matter what faith you follow, it's foolish for you not to believe especially after reading this book. I need to pass on this message as well. I will try to buy this book for my friends and family as gifts for bdays or for Christmas. Our Blessed Virgin Mary continues to send her messages through the visionaries every month. You can receive the Medjugorje message each month through email by submitting your email address at:[..]. When you sign up you can view the latest message. It truly hurts when Mary passes on messages that she is sad or that Jesus is sad. Please help Jesus to smile by not just reading the messages, but by living the messages.

Please note the Roman Catholic Church has in NO WAY authorized these alleged \\"apparitions\\" in Medjugorje as approved for personal belief. In fact, the Bishop of the diocese in which Medjugorje resides has written at least two opinions that the Blessed Mother is NOT appearing there.If you can get your hands on The Medjugorje Deception by Michael Jones I believe you will get a more balanced view of Medjugorje.

Weible's story reminds us that miracles abound still today. Every page fills me with awe and a greater desire to serve our Lord. I feel blessed to have been introduced to the book and the opportunity to meet one of the seers here in the United States at the end of this year. Here is a site with his speaking schedule at the bottom: http://www.medjugorje.org/The Medjugorje seers' portrait of Purgatory and Hell matches the one presented by Maria Simma, an Austrian nun who receives visitations from Purgatory souls. I highly recommend Sister Emmanuel's (of Medjugorje) interview, called The Amazing Secret of the Souls of Purgatory. Like the stories of the visitations of the Virgin Mother, it is filled with answers one would never have dreamed they would receive in this life. I have grown to trust in them whole-heartedly."},{"Title":"Congressional and state reapportionment and redistricting: A legal analysis (CRS report for Congress)","review":"We originally read a copy that belonged to a relative, then we had to have a copy ourselves.

This author earns his livelihood peddling this nonsense all over the world. Besides, this book is terribly out of date because the author speculated that the world would end in 1997 and we're all still here in 2000. That should give you an indication of the truth of these so-called &quot;apparitions&quot;. The unfortunate truth about Medjugorje is that it is a scam invented by the Franciscan priests to help them in their fight with their local bishop. One of them had gotten a nun pregnant and the bishop had revoked his faculties (right to act as a priest). The &quot;visionaries&quot; all ran to the bishop insisting that the Virgin Mary was on the side of this priest. The Virgin Mary would not take the side of a disobedient priest over that of the rightful bishop. BTW, this priest now lives with the nun he impregnated and they have a souvenier stand in Medjugorje. This &quot;apparition&quot; has been condemned by the local bishop of Mostar. He became convinced that the &quot;visionaries&quot; were lying because after promising to tell the truth with their hand on a Crucifix proceeded to lie about where they were when the first &quot;apparition&quot; happened. The &quot;visionaries&quot; have become wealthy. They have mansions in Medjugorje and Mercedes. One has married a former Miss Massachusetts. Many of the other characters involved in this scam have been discredited. One of the most infamous was the child molesting priest, Ken Roberts, who preached the Medjugorje &quot;gospel&quot; throughout the world and on EWTN. Money sent from the US by pious Catholics to Medjugorje during the war was used to ethnically cleanse Bosnians and Serbs from the area. The Franciscans have been involved in Croatian nationalism from the beginning of the war even going so far as to insert pro-Croat messages into the supposed &quot;messages&quot; of Our Lady. This is not a dramatic departure for them because during the Second World War, the Franciscans aided the Croatian fascists in their genocide of the Serbians. Approximately 200,000 Serbs were massacred by the Croats during the war for refusing to convert to Roman Catholicism. Serbs (men, women, children and Orthodox priests) were forced at gunpoint to jump from the supposed mountain of the &quot;apparitions&quot;. In short, do not buy this book! Stay away from this nonsense. Read about approved apparitions like Fatima or Lourdes. (BTW, Sister Lucia who still receives messages from Our Lady has never mentioned Medjugorje. If it were an authentic apparition, surely Sister Lucia would support it.) If you want more information, read the story on the Crisis web-site about this.

I know of no more concise and accessible explanation for the Bible's origins and how it came to us in its present form.

When I was 12 or 13, I had the chance to go to France and see some amazing paintings and sculptures in person, but public school did not equip me with a basic understanding of art history and technique to make sense of what I saw. I recently decided to find out more. I wish I had found this book years ago. Gombrich is quite a writer; the text was engaging and readable. I feel that I have a general understanding of art developments. Now, when I see a painting I will be able to understand and appreciate it more. I am also excited to pursue Gombrich's recommendations for further reading in the periods that interest me the most. This book is worth every penny in the richness it will add to your life."},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"I have always wanted to take a course in Art History.

Thanks for the suggestion!"},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"E.H. Gombrich's The Story of Art is one of the best introductory books on the history of art available today. The combination of Gombrich's insight into various art movements (particularly his discussion of Impressionism and Cubism) and the inclusion of many quality reproductions make this book exceptional. If after reading this book you find yourself hungering for a more in depth examination of art history, i also recommend Marilyn Stokstad's Art History; it includes many of the same issues raised and explored in Gombrich's book, but takes them a bit further. If you are interested in learning about art and its history, (and if you want to have an enjoyable time doing it) then consider reading Gombrich's The Story of Art; you will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"After both my daughters had read Gombrich's A Little History of the World, I bought The Story of Art for my 14 year old daughter, who is now half way through it only two weeks later. The Little History is written for the younger reader but it provides an informative and entertaining overview for adult readers as well. The art book is actually a college-level text, but because Gombrich is a natural educator who relates directly to his reader, the overview is both fascinating and easy to follow."},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"I cannot recall ever reading a college textbook written with such grace and quiet authority. Everything from the cave paintings to the latest post modern is mentioned. Every art work described is illustrated as well. Gombrich tends to return to the same themes throughout history so you can see how different artists portrayed a king, a child, etc. Great care is taken to show why a later phase succeeded an earlier one. Connections of art to national styles and world history are explained well.Of course, the majority of famous works must be left out, but you can find internet sites to supplement your favorites. If you like history, are inclined to visual display, and appreciate well-crafted prose, this book will deliver on all counts."},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"This ranks among the very best of _any_ &quot;history&quot; narrative (in all categories, not just art) that I have ever read. It's absolutely amazing how the author incorporates such a wonderfully cogent yet friendly and comprehensible narrative style into the book. The text is never boring (unlike many &quot;art history&quot; publications) and all works discussed are accompanied by a nice reproduction, including some spectacular fold-outs.This book (first published in 1950, and now in its 16th edition), was/is intended as an art history primer but is suitable for anyone who wishes to pleasantly and painlessly brush up on their knowledge of &quot;fine art&quot;.As a complement to this great book, I recommend Janson's &quot;History of Art for Young People&quot;, Sixth Edition. The latter is for all ages, not just &quot;young people&quot;. It too merits highest marks!"},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"When it comes to art, I am an idiot. But this book is the perfect amount of basics, insights, and neat pictures that it is highly informative, yet also highly entertaining. This combination is rare, especially in any book that is the size of a textbook. I cannot stress enough how much this book will help you understand the concepts and theories behind such words as &quot;Renaissance&quot;, &quot;Impressionism&quot; and other words you have heard but might not have really understood.Buy this book, it is worth every penny and more."},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"Just a dozen or so pages into this book, I knew that it was one I wish I would have had access to when I was first seriously exposed to art. While in many respects, it is a conservative textbook (being first published in 1950), it is fundamentally meant for someone who has little to no previous formal contact with art history. Of course, if you have some, this can make you seriously engage some of your previously held assumptions about what you like and why you like it, but I got the distinct impression while reading that it was meant to initiate a teenager - a teenager who very much reminded of me of myself - into a whole new world.The inclusions and exclusions of certain artists are, of course, always arbitrary. However, Gombrich's choices do not deviate too much from a standard art history text. What particularly drew me to the book was what I perceived to be its inordinate focus on medieval and especially Renaissance art. Of the twenty-eight chapters included in the book, about five mostly focus on Western medieval images (6 and 8-11). Another six chapters (13-18) focus on the art of the Western Renaissance. Most surveys of art history to which I had been previously exposed paid scant attention to medieval art and they sometimes did not give the Renaissance the space that I felt it deserved. There is no doubt the medieval and Renaissance art Gombrich's pet periods here (and, admittedly, they're mine, too.)What makes it so special is that, instead of spending the first chapter in an abstract exercise of thinking about what \\"Art\\" is, he forces you over and over again to take the art on its own terms. While discussing the various visual perspectives painted by the artist of \\"The Garden of Nebamun,\\" he says: \\"To us reliefs and wall-paintings provide an extraordinarily vivid picture of life as it was lived in Egypt thousands of years ago. And yet, looking at them for the first time, one may find them rather bewildering. The reason is that the Egyptian painters had a very different way from ours of representing real life. Perhaps this is connected with the different purpose their paintings had to serve. What mattered most was not prettiness but completeness. It was the artists' task to preserve everything as clearly and permanently as possible. So they did not set out to sketch nature as it appeared to them from any fortuitous angle\\" (p. 60). It is the occasional insight like this that makes the book most worthwhile for a neophyte. After all, how many of us have measured something we saw by the standards of our particular narrow time and place? He really drives home the point that thinking about art seriously means thinking about other perspectives (both literally and figuratively), other preoccupations, and other aesthetic modus operandi. This is a lesson that should be lost on none of us, about art, or about anything else."},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"Much has been written on Gombrich's The Story of Art, but rarely if ever attention was paid to the two following points. The first is the title of the book - not 'History of...' but 'The STORY of...\\". With this unconventional title Gombrich alludes to art as a narrative of visual culture and not a periodical endeavour of artists. The second point is the opening sentence of the book (from my memeory) There is no such thing as Art, and he continues that there are people who painted walls etc. and they should be considered artists. By denying Art as a Platonic idea in favour of a Popperian definition of the Arts, Gombrich maintains that art is a constitutive practice and not a regulative practice directed by some external force which is not inherent in Art itself. These to my mind are the two important (and may I say immortal) contributions of Gombrich to the understanding of the history of art.Ben Baruch Blich (a former post-doctorate in the Warburg Institute supervised by Gombrich in 1989)History and TheoryBezalel Acaddemy of Arts and DesignJerusalembaruchbl@013.net.il"},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"Anyone interested in art will find this book amazing. It begings with the early traces of art in human history and ends around the 80's. The author makes a great job in transmitting his passion for the works he explains and you start to look at them with different eyes, understanding what the artist wanted to do with each stroke.I've been to a lot of museums around the world and paintings were something that didn't attract me much.

It is a perfect gift, particularly for someone planning to visit Europe's great museums and churches over the coming year."},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"Gombrich is undoubtedly a great read but one that should only be done in conjunction with (many) other resources. I'd recommend using Gombrich only with a teacher or if you already know art pretty well and have your own opinion which to weigh gombrich's view against. The art history class i'm taking right now borrows extensively from him, however always within the context of many other views (my teacher's view the most vocal of course) Still a great resource for anyone serious about learning more about art. Wonderfully written and engrossing."},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"I normally find portraits and religious paintings with all those angels boring and battle fields or works in broad format seem too \\"crowded\\" to me, so basically I did not think much of the art performed before the Flemish painters of the XVI century, which started painting rural life and landscapes. I am glad I bought Mr. Gombrich's \\"Story of Art\\", since it introduced me to a subject that I thought was only interesting to art lovers and true \\"conoisseurs\\"; it helped me appreciate paintings I do not like and see art in a different way. This book is probably aimed at people like me, if you already know more about art, a deeper treatise on technique, composition or else will maybe suit you better.I am of those who believe that one of the characteristics of great expertise is the ability to explain complicated things in a simple way, which shows that the author not only understands but fully masters the topic. Well, this is the case, the \\"Story\\" of art is not a dry \\"history of art\\", it truly narrates a story; it puts the artists and their works in a well explained historical and artistical context and allows you to appreciate equally works of art from different time periods. As the author puts it: \\"the purpose and technical resources may change, but art itself does not progress in the same sense as science\\", a work of art is complete as such in each time period. I also appreciated that the author included some architecture, not only paintings and sculptures, to frame the master pieces in their full context.My first encounter with Mr. Gombrich was his bookThe Image and the Eye: Further Studies in the Psychology of Pictorial Representationwhich captivated me, since it combined science with art in a masterful way. Mr. Gombrich was probably one of the first art experts to be interested in the research done in the emerging neurosciences, specially regarding vision. His attention was drawn to how we receive external stimuli (light), how our brain perceives and forms a three-dimensional image, how it makes sense of a figure of which it only sees a countour like in a caricature, etc., but best of all, his insights were explained using pictures of great works of art. After reading this book, which I also highly recommend, I started searching for other books written by him and was gladly surprised to find out that he had written a \\"Story of Art\\" as well, which by the way seems to be better known and easier to understand than the Image and the eye.16 editions supervised by the author talk of the care with which a book was written, revised and edited. My Spanish version of this 16th edition, full format is also excellent (translation inlcuded), congratulations to Phaidon Press for a beautifully presented book."},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"Gombrich, the leading art historian and critic of the latter half of the 20th century, sets forth in his opening pages what he going to do in this book and then actually does it. More than that, he surpasses all expectations. I have never read a book so quickly and so enjoyably. I read it to prepare for a lengthy vacation in Paris and Italy (six weeks). I took the vacation, took some copies of certain pages in his book and enjoyed the ubiquitous art in Rome, Florence, Venice, Paris and other smaller towns. Although obviously a highly intelligent and knowledgable person, Gombrich in The Story of Art wears his learning lightly. He makes it possible for people of varying interests, abilities, knowledge and intelligences to enjoy and understand art. What sets him apart from so many writers is a totally sincere interest in educating people about art and the appropriate way to respond to it. I realize the utopian nature of this suggestion, but every college should require at least one quarter or semester on art and use The Story of Art as the main textbook. Even mediocre teaching cannot undermine the knowledge and enthusiasm a studentwill gain from this magnificent book."},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"I have specified this book as the main text in GPH-205, Historical Foundations of Visual Technologies, which I have taught for eight terms running at DePaul University. The book is superb as an introduction to traditional western art (and a few side trips into Chinese, middle eastern, and ancient art). I pair this up with Colors by Delamare and Guineau to flesh out the technical side of artistic endeavors along time periods that parallel those covered in Gombrich. Students really appreciate the fact that the 400 artworks Gombrich describes are located on pages facing the discussion, a practice that has been maintained through most of the editions of this text. The text is very readable, the discussions lucid and of appropriate length for the purpose of an introduction, and the book reflects the polish possible with a book that started out with a good premise and was refined and expanded over a period of fifty years!"},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"An excellent book in an easy to read formatt.

This was much better than all those books that mention this and that artist but never show their actual works.

That's when I realized this was sth I was actually going to enjoy. No BS in the name of art. What a relief! How many times do you have to opportunity to be with an EURDIT who also has FRESH insights, OPEN attitudes, and a HUMBLE treatment of art?Finally, the WHOLE book was a HUGE surprise and delight. Art became a voyage and I was the lucky adventurer. I don't know if I \\"learned\\" art. I don't care because I learnt sth much more important: I developed a passion for art that I didn't know it was there.P.S. For those of you who actually HAVE to \\"learn\\" art.
