Every paragraph in the book is a poem.It is a tale of two young boys, one bright, and one dark, who discover a great evil inthe autumn carnival. Somehow they must stop the evil from spreading without allowing it toengulf them as well. It is a carnival that makes broken promises and takes away your whole world,and Bradbury makes it come to life. The carnival is alive with everything from Witches of Wax, toShrunken Lightning Rod Salesmen.Once I picked it up, I could not put it down. It is experiencing fear at it's strongest, while sittingin the comfort of your own home. I would recommend this book to anyone, from children to seniors.Read it before it reads you.I don't know why I said that.David Warkentin, 14"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Great, pivotal book by Ray Bradbury. My sister needed it for a class and this is a great edition! I recommend it!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Well, you've got to grant that Ray Bradbury is not a boring novelist. The entire story of Something Wicked This Way Comes runs almost entirely on enthusiasm. Part morality tale and part freak show, Something Wicked finds something of a happy medium as an exuberant young adult novel, a wild and unstoppable train of delight in every moment of living. The two protagonists Jim and Will live unimpeded lives without any great danger until the day the Dark Train arrives in the middle of the night, at the witching hour. Unfortunately, Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show offers more than mere curiosities and entertainments: it offers your heart's desire... for a price. Are you looking for true love? Your lost youth? Cooger & Dark will give it to you, just take a short ride on this carousel over here.It's easy for a reader to lose the overall geography of the novel in favor of its individual parts. Bradbury's prose oozes with flamboyance and a baroque explosion of literary decoration. Consider this description of a library from the second chapter:\\"Out in the world, not much happened. But here in the special night, a land bricked with paper and leather, anything might happen, always did. Listen! and you heard ten thousand people screaming so high only dogs feathered their ears. A million folk ran toting cannons, sharpening guillotines; Chinese, four abreast, marched on forever. Invisible, silent, yes, but Jim and Will had the gift of ears and noses as well as the gift of tongues. This was a factory of spices from far countries. Here alien deserts slumbered. Up front was the desk where the nice old lady, Miss Watriss, purple-stamped your books, but down off away were Tibet and Antarctica, the Congo. There went Miss Wills, the other librarian, through Outer Mongolia, calmly toting fragments of Peiping and Yokohama and the Celebes. Way down the third book corridor, an oldish man whispered his broom along in the dark, mounding the fallen spices...\\"Arguably, the overall body of the novel takes second place to its members. Bradbury's prose is such a delight to read that you might find yourself surprised to see a story wrapping itself up in the final chapters.But what is this novel? A horror story? An allegory of sin and temptation? An exercise in literary gluttony? I would suggest that it's a little bit of each. The moral, insofar as there is a coherent one at all, concerns the power of a sanguine attitude over the dark despair that comes in the middle of the night when you're tossing awake in bed. The Dark People could be interpreted as embodiments of ennui or despondency, as noonday devils who twist one's head around backwards to glare forever at what he has left behind. They feed on the unhappiness of ordinary people, and have so fed for centuries if not millennia. The fact that laughter has such great power over Mr. Dark and his carnival freaks would support this approach to the story.Most of all, I think that Something Wicked is worth reading for its grab-life-by-the-tail-and-hang-on attitude. It lacks a certain type of literary quality, but makes up for it with spiritedness, like a child who creates a whole imaginative universe using only Legos and crayons. One might need to be in the right mood for this novel, but it's not an unpleasant mood. Not unpleasant at all."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"The Disney version of this book that was done in the 1980s really doesn't do this book justice. The prose is extremely vivid and rich, almost poetic. This is an excellent tale for readers young and old."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I'd like to start this review by getting the negatives out of the way first. My main problem with the book was how wordy it was at certain points, which I felt somewhat disrupted the flow of the novel. I would assume I'm in the minority about disliking this style, but I read purely for fun, not for themes and life lessons(though if a novel has them, as this certainly does, it's not a bad thing). Some of Mr. Halloway's long-winded perspective in the novel, his philosphy, slowed the book down. It's not that Bradbury was over descriptive in general (I read Stephen King, so I'm no stranger to descriptions), but it was the fact that he describes one thing with about a dozen different adjectives, which almost tempted me to skim through, even though it was such a short novel. Perhaps it's just that I wanted to get back to the exciting parts. I'd really love to say \\"screw it\\" and give this book 5 stars, but I pride myself on giving my honest opinions. Just these minor issues kept it from being 5 stars.As for the other 90% of the story, no doubt about it, it's very good. Not many books could be enjoyed equally by a teenager and a middle-aged reader, but I feel like this could. There's enough carnival-type fun and fantastic images for the young adult (as well as an older) reader to enjoy, while maintaining enough serious writing for an adult. It's quite a nice balance and Bradbury deserves alot of credit here.I'd also like to say that I was pleased with how much horror/supernatural there is. I knew before going into this that it was considered a dark fantasy, but I didn't expect much genuine horror, but there was more than enough to be found. As for the fantasy parts, well, they were pretty great as well. Add in some supernatural and the coming-off-age feel to it, and you have a recipe for success.Overall, alot of good imagination, mixed with some real life issues and struggles, Something Wicked This Way Comes is a unique book. A whole lot of story goes on in less than 300 pages, and this is one of them books that makes you realize how gratifying reading a good book can be."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"How can you go wrong with a Ray Bradbury story....I sent this to my 17 year old grandson as an introduction to other fiction."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"2nd Witch:By the pricking of my thumbs,Something wicked this way comes. [Knocking]Open locks,Whoever knocks![Enter Macbeth]Macbeth:How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!What is't you do?The above quote from Shakespeare's Macbeth is whence this book takes its title, but it's the character Macbeth's quote immediately following the titular quote that seems to me more &agrave; propos to an attempt at reviewing the book; for Bradbury, despite the book's ending, is a full adept at exploring the secret, black and midnight thoughts of us all. The book's fault - in my eyes - is that it presents, in the end, a Manichean, Star Wars view of the world which just doesn't wash with me. Thankfully, throughout most of the book, Bradbury is more concerned with the dark carnival that comes into town upon a midnight wind one October and the dreamlike horrors it works upon the townspeople. This is where the magic in the prose lies. It rather reminds me of Blake's remark about Milton, that he was a true poet and on the devil's side without knowing it.Be all this as it may, it's very difficult to tell the prospective reader what this book is about, because of its wild poetic exploration of the dark corners of the human soul. But I think it's best seen as a sort of warning: Beware of your dreams and imaginings - regardless of your age or situation - for therein unfathomable darkness lies beneath the gilt surface. This is best set forth by the doomed schoolmarm, Miss Foley, bewitched by the memories of her lost youth:\\"Best skate the thin ice, lightly. Paused, the weight of your attention might crack the shell. Plunged through the crust, you might drown in depths so cold, so remote, that all the Past lay carved in tombstone marbles there. Ice water would syringe your veins. Transfixed at the mirror sill, you would stand forever, unable to lift your gaze from the proofs of Time.\\"And the doomed lightning-rod salesman, bewitched by the ideal of the perfect woman:\\"Once, as a boy, sneaking the cool grottos (sic) behind a motion picture theater screen, on his way to a free seat, he had glanced up and there towering and flooding the haunted dark seen a woman's face as he had never seen it since, of such size and beauty built of milk-bone and moon flesh as to freeze him there alone behind the stage, shadowed by the motion of her lips, the bird-wing flicker of her eyes, the snow-pale-death-shimmering illumination from her cheeks.\\"In an odd way, Bradbury seems to be telling us to beware his own writing. But the obverse side of this coin, embodied in the person another reviewer has dubbed - quite rightly, I think - the \\"hero\\" of the novel, Mr. Halloway, expounding upon the notion of the \\"soul's energy\\" that these outlandish carnies seem to crave, maintains:\\"How do I know this? I observe. The carnival is like people, only more so. A man, a woman, rather than walk away from, or kill, each other, ride each other a lifetime, pulling hair, extracting fingernails, the pain of each to the other like a narcotic that makes existence worth the day.\\"In other words, there's scarce relief to be found in any domestic bliss. The way out, the \\"good\\" way, seems to be laughter at the absurdity of it all. But, for this reader anyway, this - quite literally, towards the end - forced laughter is the scariest, most inhuman phenomenon of the lot!In the end, I'd rather have a wicked but all too human Macbeth than laughter at the meaninglessness of memory, imagination and human suffering.Perhaps, so would Bradbury's ghost."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Awesome novel; Bradbury is exceptional and the novel is extraordinary.

Do yourself a favor and get this book NOW!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"When I put down this book yesterday, two-thirds of the way through, I was pretty sure it was the best book I had ever read on the subject of death. If not death, then the peculiar phantasm of death paraded by the ghoulish, the morbid, the interminably gasping, and the paranoid. There could be no more perfect metaphor for the fascination and terror death holds for us, than the carnival. Swooping in, strange, exhilarating, mysterious, dangerous, and familiar; overwhelming and sometimes nauseating.Bradbury's style for this novel makes heavy use of metaphor and simile, sentence fragments, and slang, which are often incongruous and insensible; at first this is annoying, largely because it seems like an affectation, but there are moments in his stream of images and phrases where all the disparate elements flow together and what's left, whether it makes sense or not, is really beautiful.The same can be said for the spates of philosophizing, shuffled in and out of the story as we explore the allure of the carnival, and the weaknesses of it's victims. After having researched urban legends, ghost stories, and various real acts of evil for the last few months, I tend to agree with his assertions (filtered through the character of Charles Halloway) about fear and death in particular. And having been a William (unnervingly good), and a Jim (fascinated with, inured by the macabre), and a Charles (trying to rationalize a world where both exist), I also tend to sympathise with Bradbury's views on humanity. Yes he does go on, (or as Jim Nightshade says \\"You talk a lot.\\") but he has something to say, even if it is wedged into a stream-of-consciousness style that is not wholly decipherable, or one-hundred percent the truth. What doesn't work, for me, and wholly forgivable for a book from the '60s, is the dated male perspective which shadows Charles' discussions of love and compassion, which makes it seem like women exist only to be a man's emotional consciousness; forgivable, but still somewhat disruptive to an otherwise interesting discursion.Now, the last third of the book. Perfectly suspenseful, somewhat satisfying, until the very end, which seemed mealy and saccharine compared to the subtly textured, fair-food substantialness of the rest of the book. Like having Spielberg direct the last ten minutes of a David Lynch film.In summary, a good book, but not for horror fans, certainly not for people who insist on direct communication, who are flummoxed by effuse evocation. Definitely for someone who can appreciate the simplicity of small town life, and the difference between the percieved and real dangers of the unknown."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I first read this when I was 13.

Even their covers have been burned into my mind's eye.And that's saying a lot. Because I'm 41 years old. And some of these books were devoured some 30+ years ago.And in all that time I have never found a book to equal Something Wicked This Way Comes.I read this book yearly, sometimes twice a year.

I have got some MAJOR gripes with this book. First off, being that there is absolutely nothing believable about Jim or Will. Not a single instance of these characters seeming real. Secondly, the way that Bradbury structures sentences in this book has to be some of the worst grammar I have ever seen in a publication, major or independent. The thing that really gets me about it is that this is pretty much an internationally love piece of fiction and I just can't see the justification of it. Even the actual story itself, which is wonderful in idea, is completely underwhelming because of the way Bradbury writes this novel.

All of a sudden, Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade find themselves caught between a fight of good vs. evil.I thought 'Something Wicked this Way Comes' was an excellent science fiction/ fantasy book and this book is definitely a book for people who enjoy scary stories.Charecters that the book mostly revolves around are Will Halloway, Jim Nightshade, Charles Halloway, Mr. Dark, Mr. Cooger, and other freaks of the carnival. The book Mostly takes place in the month of October at a carnival and soon mysterious things start to happen to the boys when they arrive at the carnival. The force of evil is so great that they can't control the situation by themselves. They must get help from Will's father to help defeat the evil.To me this was a great book and they best part of the book was when Charles Halloway carves a smile onto a fake, dissolvable bullet and kills the Dust Witch with the smile and goodness. The reason that the Dust Witch died is because of the happiness that was on the bullet. This was the most exciting part of the book to me because when Bradbury describes the scene, the image is so vivid in your mind. Also, he has the power to stop time and seem as if the world stopped for a second when Halloway shot the bullet.If you are interested by this book, there are many other books that have been written by this author. These book consist of 'The Halloween Tree' and 'The Illustrated Man'. I really enjoyed this book because it is very exciting and i really recommend this book to everyone.

So now some twenty plus years later, in a nostalgic mood, I ordered a bunch of Bradbury books. Something Wicked This Way Comes was the first book I chose to read and now I kind of wish I hadn't.In this book, Bradbury writes shorter sentences than Hemingway. And far too many of them contain exclamations such as: \\"Jim!\\"; \\"Oh gosh!\\"; \\"Dad!\\"; \\"It's hopeless!\\"; \\"Boys!\\"; \\"Like Heck!\\"; \\"Cheezeit!\\"; \\"Jim!\\"; \\"Jehosophat!\\"; \\"You're evil!\\"; \\"Jim!\\"; \\"Bangity-bang!\\"; and the best of all, \\"But for cri-yi, Jim, face it, you don't really want to be twenty!\\"How about this for a sequence:\\"No its all right!\\"\\"Jim!\\"\\"Will, yes, its ok!\\"\\"Stand back!\\"\\"This man is in a trance! As part of our new act I have hypnotized him! He could suffer injury if you shocked him from the spell!\\"The internes shut their mouths. The police stopped moving.\\"One hundred thousand volts! Yet he will come forth alive, whole in sound mind and body!\\"Now that's some writing. Ed Wood himself couldn't have done that scene better.All of this could be forgiven if there was an underlying story or even some characters worth knowing. But alas...The protagonist, Will, is a wussy. His father, Charles Halloway is dour old woman. Will's best friend, Jim, has some guts, but to Will and his father he is far too brash. The villains, such as they are, are not frightening or particularly villainous. There is a dwarf, a witch, an illustrated man--not to mention Mr. Electro. Oh my!And what dastardly deeds come to light? Why there is a carousel that can turn a young boy into an old man and vice versa! Gasp! There is a maze of mirrors that shows people their worst fears! Shriek! There is a freak show with the implication that carnival director Mr. Dark sculpted these freaks (pinhead, sheep boy, fire eater) from ordinary folks just like Will and Jim!As Jim would say, \\"I think I'm going to bawl now!\\"You aren't missing much if you take a pass on this book."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I can't believe the constant showboating of the writing in this book. The metaphors per paragraph (MPP) is just ridiculous and totally distracting from the story. Simile and metaphor are meant to communicate meaning. In this book, however, many of them, while sounding interesting or \\"peotic,\\" simly don't do their real job, which is to help tell the story. Or maybe that's the problem - the story isn't very interesting so the author hopes to distract the reader from that fact with the spastic writing style. Bradbury here writes like a college kid whose only real chance of getting laid is by impressing some girl in his creative writing class. Really sad; I thought Bradbury was better that this. He apparently needed - and went without - a reasonable editor who certainly would have taken him out in the parking lot and slapped him around until he remembered what writing was supposed to sound like. Real writers use literary devices sparingly, if at all. And when they do, they make sure they are dead-on and impactful.

It is a fiction book. In this book, the lesson is to help others in any way you can. It is like what John F. Kennedy said, \\"Ask not what the country can do for you, but what you can do for the country.\\" In this case, Will helped his friend without asking and that shows how much Will and his friend Jim care about each other. This book has a lot to do with friendship.The text is about a carnival coming to their town late in the year and Will's father has a bad feeling about it but the boys are enthusiastic about it and go many different times. Mr. Dark, the illustrator, has like an evil mind while Charles Halloway, Will's father, doesn't. Mr. Halloway outsmarts Mr. Dark, rescues his son, and kills the witch. Later, Jim falls into a stupor where he almost dies. Mr. Dark comes back as a kid when Mr. Halloway had recognized him and kills him with showing affection. While the carnival falls apart, Will keeps trying to revive Jim. Will and his father save him by singing, dancing, and laughing, anything that deals with happiness. Happiness brings Jim back alive and away from the edge of being dead.At the beginning of the book, it was very interesting learning about the two boys of how they were and described themselves. For me, later, it got less interesting, but then Mr. Dark came in with the carnival and everything all of a sudden was very cool to keep reading.Therefore, this book has to do a lot with happiness and heroic stuff.

The Novel is good to read though, because when you get closer to the end the story has a lot of suspense, and makes the story more exciting and interesting to read. The story has details that explain how the characters and setting look like. You can picture the theme of the story easily. Something Wicked this Way Comes is about two close friends that find out a secret magic that the carnival has. The two boys then are hiding in dark places and do not trust no one.

There was action, suspense and evil things happen.Jim Nightshade (13 years, 11 months, and 23 day) and his friend Will Halloway(13 years, 11 months, and 24 day) can't wait for their birthdays on Halloween. About a week before Halloween a carnival comes to town which is unusual because it so late in the year. At 3:00 the carnival comes. Curiosity overcoming them, Will and Jim run down to see it. That's when they knew this wasn't a regular carnival. In the morning they decide to go again but no it looks like a regular carnival. One ride stands out to Jim, the merry-go-round, which says, closed. The carnival closes and Jim and Will stay to look at the merry-go-round and they find out why it's closed. If ridden forward the merry-go-round makes you older, ridden backwards it makes you younger. They check newspaper articles and Mr. Cooger and Mr. Dark have been bringing the carnival every forty years. The same men that own the carnival now. Only the merry-go-round can answer that question. Going to Will's dad for help it becomes a competition against the carnival freaks that live off pain. When Jim, who wants to ride the merry-go-round, is nowhere to be found that's where Will looks first. Jim is they're riding the merry-go-round getting older. When he gets off, he's about 19 years old and close to dead. Will's dad suggests that if happiness killed the freaks then it should bring Jim back. Yes I did like this book because I have read other R L Stine books, but they where Goosebumps books and have really liked them because I really like mystery books.The book is about Emily and her family. Her mom tells her that she is going to be getting two new stepsisters. One is called Jessie and the other is called Nancy. Once they are at her house strange things start happening. Somebody killed Tiger, Emily's dog, while she was at a dance. Somebody killed Jollie and somebody put peroxide in Emily's favorite shampoo. When the family goes camping and Emily, Jessie and Nancy go looking for firewood, Nancy gets separated and Emily tries to get away from Jessie and she ends up in the old grave yard. When Nancy puts the shovel in the rabbit's grave the shovel lands on Emily's arm and her arm is broken. Why has someone been trying to hurt Emily?I recommend this book to anyone.But will it work?If you like dark fantasy you'll like this book, or science fiction. Advanced readers will like this book too. There is action and suspense so if you like that you will also like this book."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"There is a dark veil hanging over this book and it absolutely scary. Scarier than some horror movies.Ray Bradbury is of course one of the greatest sf/fantasy writers of the 20th century and if you have never read any of his books, read this one or Fahrenheit 451.It has many dark and mysterious themes, a traveling show with many strange characters. It is about how people can play with time and how that may affect the souls of people. It could be, and I mean this positive, a Star Trek or X-Files episode.

Although I really loved the book so far I think What I liked most about it, or atleast cought my eye at first was the saying on the cover:By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes. When I read that phrase I knew I had to read this book. If you like to believe in the idea be careful what you wish for and think sometimes things are the way they seem then again this is the perfect story for you. This was an intense story that really you could say addicts you to reading. I could not put it down.I hope the rest of the book is as good as the first 22 chapters.

It is a fictionstory about two boys and their adventures at a carnival. If you like adventure and things that are out of this world, then you will like this book. Jim and Will (the two main characters) are very different. Will is very cautious and always thinks things through before doing them. Jim on the other hand just likes to go for things no matter what the consequences may be. The two boys go to a carnival and witness wicked stuff happening there. The book is pretty, long because of so many things that are happening at the carnival. It is fifty-four chapters long. If you are looking for something to read during your long, boring summer then read Something Wicked This Way Comes. The adventure never ends in this surprising, fiction story."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Two 13-year old boys are the centre of this book, but this is not really a children's book. In fact, I suspect that the modern 13-year-old would find the philosophising tedious and the action trite. However, to the older reader (say, high school and up), there is much to recommend the book. The plot: a carnival arrives in town, unusually late in the season, and a few townspeople disappear. The two boys investigate and learn that the people who were thought to have disappeared still exist, but in altered form: one has become a wizened dwarf while another has become a little girl. They discover a carousel that can turn the clock - make you older or younger. The carnival operators become alarmed by the boys and try to buy them off (by making them \\"grownups\\") or kidnap them.Of course, the plot isn't as important as the atmosphere, which is truly creepy. Carnivals and freak side-shows are creepy at the best of times, but Bradbury manages to instill dread and darkness into every scene. The boys eventually enlist one of their fathers, who works at the local library, and who supplies the philosophy in the book. Naturally it focusses on death and aging, which the carnival's carousel can reverse.The supernatural elements are a nice touch, and unique (I don't think they've been copied). Especially well-designed is the blind \\"witch\\" that can smell souls - she is essentially the bloodhound that tracks the boys for the carnival's master.The only drawbacks are that the philosophy is a little simplistic (mostly because the father is simplistic) and the notion of a carnival is outdated. It sounds quaint to modern ears that 13-year-old boys would be this excited about a carnival and its acts. However, I enjoyed the book, and recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"The beauty of reading this classic and many other earlier great sci-fi/horror novels is the ability of author to clearly convey a compelling and fascinating story by using brevity. Unlike today's mega author's who feel the need to prove their prowess by writing 1,000 page tomes, or stories with trilogies ( with amusingly more than three books), the early pioneers could tell a story using a third of the words but with three times the impact. If you've ever read a Stephen King book (and I enjoy King) then read this book, You'll be amazed at how much Stephen King owes to Bradbury. Take a step back and enjoy the writing, not just the story. You almost feel like you are reading a long poem. There are many excellent horror and sci-fi writers today, but it's refreshing to go back and read this Bradbury classic and remind oneself why he is considered to be one of the masters. Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I thought this book was a little off target, and kind of boring in some places. If you havn't read anything by Bradbury, you might want to try the Martian Chronicles or Farenheit 451 first."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Something Wicked This Way Comes - Ray BradburyI am grateful to Stephen King for having brought this novel to notice in his horror fiction chronicle-critique \`Danse Macabre' (which I will recommend to anybody who is even remotely interested in horror/fantasy media).The main protagonists of this supernatural adventure are the sunny Will Halloway and his companion and counterpart, the wild Jim Nightshade. The plot centers on how their lives are turned upside-down with the arrival of that very unusual sideshow carnival, Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show (God, this has such a Heavy Metal feel to it).If it were to be judged by its start-up this would undoubtedly be one of the best books ever. Bradbury in his element comes up with the literary equivalent of a Rick Wakeman solo. The words fly fast and furious, magically arranging themselves into such dizzyingly ornate and mellifluous phrases, sentences, paragraphs that almost threaten to drown the reader in their exuberance and beauty. This major portion of this book contains some of Bradbury's finest literary moments and as anyone who has read his work will till you, that is an achievement of no mean order. Characters like the Dust Witch and Mr. Dark aka The Illustrated Man are described in such vivid and astonishing detail as to strongly etch themselves onto readers' minds. You do not merely read, you see, hear, smell, taste, feel whatever the pen of Bradbury commands you to. This book bristles with parts that I will be happily re-reading for many months on.Wherein lies the catch? The plot after one of the best build-ups ever constructed grows somewhat loose with several potentially interesting supporting characters (Mr. Electrico, the Dwarf) given marginal footage. Although lavish description is used to paint what Stephen King describes as the \`Apollonian-Dionysian' divide between Will and Jim, once the action heats up, this is pretty much left by the wayside, the boys rendered almost interchangeable in their personalities. The story, after a point moves IMO almost into the realms of the straight-ahead thriller format, although Bradbury's writing alleviates a lot of the conventionality and it is perhaps only the cynical bastard in me that finds it difficult to swallow the \`Love Conquers All' driven denouement."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"In this book, Bradbury's writing is so infused with his style that if you don't like his style, the book is unreadable; whereas if you do like his style, then you are almost certain to love the book. I don't like his style, but many people do. Here's a sample which illustrates the style to which I refer. It is the fourth paragraph in chapter 3:\\"What's the answer, he wondered, walking through the library, putting out the lights, putting out the lights, putting out the lights, is it all in the whorls on our thumbs and fingers? Why are some people all grasshopper fiddlings, scrapings, all antennae shivering, one big ganglion eternally knotting, slip-knotting, square-knotting themselves? They stoke a furnace all their lives, sweat their lips, shine their eyes and start it all in the crib. Caesar's lean and hungry friends. They eat in the dark, who only stand and breathe.\\"If you like that style of writing, or at least don't consider it pretentious, self-indulgent gibberish, then you will probably be able to find a decent read in this book. I was able to make only about one-sixth of the way through before my annoyance with the style overcame my desire to read a good story."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I've always considered this book to be the dark companion to Bradbury's _Dandelion Wine_. Will Halloway is Douglas Spaulding is...young Ray Bradbury. However, where _Dandelion Wine_ dwells primarily on the innocent and uncorrupted side of small-town America in its golden age, this volume dwells with its shadow side. You see, Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show doesn't bring darkness to town, so much as it cultivates what's already there. Like all portrayers of vice, if there weren't already a potentially willing market, they would have no success.Yet, every generation the black train steams into town- always on the cusp of the seasons- always in a long October, half way between midsummer and Christmas. Every generation they tempt and entrap. Every generation must either resist or succumb to their dark tricks. These October people are still out there, still making their infernal rounds....This book bears rereading. First of all, like much of Bradbury's earlier work it is as much poem as prose. I know that I myself didn't really appreciate poetry, the right brain side of seeing things, until I found his work. Also, as one grows older, one identifies less with Will, and Will's potential shadow, Jim, and more with the other characters. For me, Will's father, an old man who has wandered the world and has suffered a thousand petty defeats- and a much lesser number of minor victories- becomes more and more familiar.This book will give you nightmares. It will do so not because of graphic violence, but because of the way it subtly undermines the spirit and spreads doubts through the chinks of the soul. Still, without Dark to contend with, how would Light define, and strengthen, itself?"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Great.Something Wicked This Way Comes is a little gothic masterpiece by Ray Bradbury. The story concerns Will Holloway, his best friend Jim Nightshade, and his father Charles Holloway. One October a carnival comes to town. The carnival is run by a group of freaks who are intent on evil. The entire town, and particularly the two boys, and put in terrible danger. That all leads to a tremendous climax as Will, Jim, and Charles have to try to learn the true nature of good and evil to save themselves and the town.I can't believe that some people have written that this book is dated. I don't think that anyone will be saying that after the events of September 11. As long as fathers and sons still love one another and as long as there is evil to strive againgst, this novel will still be extremely valid. Something Wicked This Way Comes is fairly symbolic, and comments greatly on the nature of good and of evil. The story is fascinating and enlightening. Absolutely any reader can read this wonderful novel, be moved by it, and come away with a better understanding of human nature. I don't think that Ray Bradbury gets the credit he deserves, but any read of one of his novels will prove to the reader that he is a GREAT novelist."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I had to read Ray Bradbury's novel, Something Wicked This Way Comes as an assignment for my english class. I thought it would be just another tedious book to read. So, I started reading it, and discovered that, in all honesty, that it was just what I thought it would be....tedious. Of course, that is what I thought the first couple of pages were. I was about to quit reading the book after page 8 when I discovered that my English grade would plummet if I didn't complete the assignment. So, I plodded on, line after line. It wasn't that the book was impossible to read, it's just that Mr. Bradbury is so descriptive, a person can sometimes get lost in what he's saying unless they pay a lot of attention to the message that he sends across. It wasn't a book that I finished in a couple of hours. It took me a while to read it(and I'm a pretty quick reader)because some passages were so descriptive and flowery that I had to read them twice to fully grasp the meaning. However, upon reading the book in its entirety, I'm very glad that I didn't give up with it. The ending made all the hours of reading worthwhile. I loved the theme of goodness versus evil. I liked it because the ending made the whole book sort of come together and intertwine.

I have read the reviews of \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" both positive and negative. I agree with both sides to an extent. \\"Something Wicked this Way Comes\\" IS a dated novel. And while dialogue at times seems straight from \\"Leave It To Beaver\\" (Gee whiz!) and the ending can be deemed corny, I feel that this book and Ray Bradbury have stood and will continue to stand the test of time.Bradbury's style of writing may not be appreciated by everyone, but to say that his work is a waste of time seems way to extreme to me. I love Bradbury's works FOR the metaphors, FOR his long descriptions. Bradbury does not allow his readers to be innocent bystanders, instead he places them right there standing next to Jim Nightshade and Will Halloway, witnessing firsthand the evil that is Dark and Cooger's traveling carnival. It is a perfect combination of sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. For this, Ray Bradbury is definitely one of a kind.As for the ending, I was happy to read a novel with such a simple message at the end. There was no big complex (often ridiculously impossible) solution to ridding the town of evil, rather a pure, simple fix. For me, \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" is a welcomed stray from modern horror fiction."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"That Bradbury is the living legend of fiction so profound that it can move you for life is a well known fact.

If you read this you may find yourself re-reading sentences to figure out what the hell was being said. Although not from the book, there are many, too many, sentences like this:&quot;Will ran, didn't run. Jumped, didn't jump.

In this poetic-prose masterpiece, two boys, Jim Nightshade (the dark one--hence the name) and William Halloway (the light one--i.e. Hallow=Holy or Halo) encounter an evil carnival inhabiting their small mid-western town (Waukegan, Illinois). Mr. Dark and his prized possessions--the freaks--succeed in luring and deceiving the townfolk into succumbing to their desires and fantasies, thus fueling and giving life to the evil carnival. Beware of the Autumn People! They feed on the lonely, desperate, and weak-hearted. Along with William's father, the two boys try and defeat the approaching evil and in the process they learn more about themselves and their growing and misunderstanding relationships with each other. This novel not only has a great plot and very interesting and in-depth characters, but it is SOOOOOOOOOOOO well written. Also, from the reading, we learn about Bradbury's philosophy on life--ACCEPTANCE! This book should be considered a classic and every middle school and/or high school should make it a mandatory read. Although it has received great reviews, this novel is still very underrated. In my opinion, Something Wicked This Way Comes is far better than Bradbury's more popular-- Fahrenheit 451. Hollywood--NOT DISNEY--should make a major motion movie about this masterpiece. This book--along with The Martian Chronicles, Dandelion Wine, and Death Is A Lonely Business--are definite must reads. One day, I predict Something Wicked This Way Comes will become an American classic. BEWARE OF THE AUTUMN PEOPLE! Who knows, we could be next."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I love this novel -- its whole is truly greater than its parts -- but some of it's seriously flawed. (I even heard Bradbury himself complain about it.) You get the feeling that Bradbury's a true believer of artistic inspiration, of a kind of unrestrained, no-metaphors-barred kind of poetics; but that he's not too keen on rewriting. He re-wrote this novel, in a sense, when he wrote the screenplay for the movie. It is the movie version, not the novel, in which Bradbury entirely overhauls the story and really polishes things up, i.e. fully fleshes out the characters, gives the plot a kind of emotional complexity and horror that never really exists in the novel, and really focuses in on the book's major theme -- the loss of youth and the acceptance of old age and death. Next to the novel, the movie shines and cuts like a razor. (Bradbury, incidentally, also wrote the screenplay for Moby Dick.) I love Bradbury, he's one of America's greatest national resources, and his works have even influenced such writers as Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez. But like I said, it's Bradbury's movie, which he wrote himself, that's the real masterpiece. If anyone doesn't agree with me or doesn't understand, then I would urge him to watch his cinematic adaptation.

An evil carnival comes to town and preys on the emotional and spiritual weaknesses of the residents.

It was like I couldn't put it down. The only way a book can do that to me is if it addresses a burning question that I have. A story can take hold of your curiosity and not let go. Something Wicked This Way Comes does exactly that. Moreover, it is also a great story.This book addresses the question of evil. I realize that's saying a lot because the question of evil is really many questions: what is it? where does it come from? what is it for? And for me, most importantly, how do you deal with it? I won't give away the books answer to this question, which I will say was very surprising. Just as surprisingly, it will make sense once you think about it.Even if, in the end, the bad guy gets away, you deal with him the same way when he comes around again because he won't really have any new tricks. He only has old tricks and old ways that he can't give up."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Something Wicked This Way Comes was a very interesting read for me.

On the negative side, if you aren't used to reading this style of storytelling, it could very well hinder the story and cause disinterest. At first, I was put off by the poetic style.

Part Two","review":"In the tradition of his two earlier volumes of Scots-Irish links for the period 1575 to 1725, Mr. Dobson picks up the trails of Scots living in Ulster and Irish living in Scotland during the following hundred years. Unlike the previous century-and-a-half, the destination of most Scots emigrants during the 18th century was across the Atlantic and not to Ulster. The same period also witnessed the beginnings of a large-scale exodus from Ireland to the Americas. Nevertheless, there was some movement of peoples between Ireland and Scotland from 1725 to 1825, and most of it was on the part of students heading for universities in Glasgow or Edinburgh. The simple fact was that Presbyterians and other religious dissenters in Ireland continued to send their sons to matriculate at Scottish universities because English and Irish universities restricted their enrollment to members of the Church of England. Interestingly, Scotland generally produced too many graduates for its domestic requirements, which resulted in many of them seeking careers in the Americas as physicians, schoolmasters, ministers, and other professionals.While most of the students are described merely by name, university, and date of attendance, in a number of cases Mr. Dobson is able to provide information on the individual's spouse, children, parents, local origins, landholding, and, of course, the source of the information. As was the case with the earlier volumes, there is no certainty that each of the roughly 1,200 persons identified in Later Scots&#8209;Irish Links or their descendants ultimately emigrated to America; however, undoubtedly many did or possessed kinsmen who did."},{"Title":"East Coast Ghosts","review":"This is an old-fashioned set of ghost stories written by a host of authors, the most famous ones being Henry James &amp; O.

The Blanchards sound like very nice, fun, hard-working people who embrace change and roll with the punches. They see opportunities and they seize those opportunities. I admire that and would probably like them in person.The book, however, annoyed me. Aside from its Trump-like self-congratulatory tone and phoney sounding dialogue, there was a bigger issue that I could not get past.The book talks about how the Blanchards live out their dreams after coming back from the brink of financial ruin, following the long-term hospitalization of their very prematurely born son. They do this by \\"following their hearts.\\" I don't dispute the importance of that, but maybe the fact that the hospital decided to pick up the tab for the Blanchards had just a LITTLE something to do with it.I was so happy for the Blanchards when I read about the hospital's kindness to them. I could not wait to read about how the Blanchards would be inspired by that act and someday do something kind for someone else... how they would incorporate that kindness into their lives and business ventures. What goes around, comes around, right? Maybe they'd donate a percentage of book profits toward medical research? Or do restaurant promotions to support families with sick children? I was disappointed that there is never any mention of them doing anything to help anyone but themselves.Then, there's the \\"financial struggles.\\" At times, they are legitimate. But then, when they miss Vermont and want to get back somehow, it sounds as though the Blanchards scrimp and save to buy a piece of property in hopes of \\"someday\\" building a small house they could retreat to for 2-3 months a year. A few pages later, they're building the house and struggling to make it happen on a tight budget. I'm not sure their definition of \\"budget\\" is the same as most people's, considering it's a majestically situated 6400 square foot home and art studio.For all I know, the Blanchards may be two of the most generous, philanthropic people around but that never comes across in the book. Perhaps it was the book's \\"preachy\\" tone that made the absence of any mention of selflessness so conspicuous. My impression of this book is that it is nothing more than a marketing tool to promote their other books, restaurant, and possibly upcoming resort. They seem to view themselves as free-spirits, but what comes across in the book is that they are really good salespeople."},{"Title":"Live What You Love: Notes from an Unusual Life","review":"Three and a half stars really, curse you amazon for your integer rating system.Look, this book is a good read. Is it revolutionary in new ideas? No. Is it blithe and trite? No. This book is simply a pointed collection of simply-written life-stories from the authors. The stories all contain some angle on how they chose the feel-good, fun-loving alternative as opposed to the mundane, bill-paying one and what a fabulous idea that was for them. They keep some perspective though and freely admit to problems they faced as a result, agony in certain decisions, and errors in judgment.Will you change your life because of this book? I struggle with that thought. The book is so simple, so easy-to-read, it screams out \\"beach reading!\\" at every page that it is hard for me to fathom altering my decision-making style. And yet, I find myself thinking of the characters (well, real people) and while their carefree spirit may not end up guiding me it certainly infects me and nudges me.Live What You Love is a great book to give at graduations (and other such ceremonies) because its not your usual \\"Great Man\\" biography or cookie-cutter \\"Life Rules\\" books. It is simply the story of how one couple stuck together and made some brave moves. Plus it's short. And as a grad, I prefer my life-lesson books to be brief."},{"Title":"Live What You Love: Notes from an Unusual Life","review":"I picked up this book with no real expectations, but with a need within myself for some change and inspiration. This book delivered just what I needed. It inspired me to follow my dreams, heart, feeling or w/e else you would like to call it. I have been following a typical lifestyle of working for living and not enjoying life, not doing what I love. Even though I do admit that I am not all that sure what it is that I truly love and want to do, this book inspired me to try, experience and not be afraid to fail. The true story behind the book only makes it that much better. Quick read, in one day. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Live What You Love: Notes from an Unusual Life","review":"\\"Life is to be lived and to be loved\\", writes Blanchard, which befittingly defines the doctrine of Bob and Melinda's lives, as well as the invaluable message conveyed in \\"Live What You Love\\". In an uniquely inspirational companion book to their first triumph, \\"A Trip to The Beach\\", Bob and Melinda Blanchard reflect on their extraordinary and anomalous lives full of successes and failures.The book shares some of their salutary words of wisdom learned from a remarkable life to help you begin to live a life you love. Organized into a series of random intriguing personal short stories, you are provided with tonic quotes and an end to each chapter with a checklist for you to begin striving towards your own aspirations. This book is to be held and carried indefinitely, not rushed through like a novel. It's designed to be read over and over again, consoling a reader like a Tony Robbins or Joel Osteen book.We've all heard the admonition of, \\"follow your dreams\\", but what does it really mean? Where do we begin? I have a steady job and am receiving AARP applications in the mail, is it too late? For anyone who might still hold an unconventional long cherished dream that doesn\`t snugly fit into the sequence of an \\"average American lifestyle\\", Bob and Melinda do more than tell us how, they show us. To read \\"A Trip to The Beach\\" and \\"Live What You Love\\" consecutively will have you reflecting on where you are currently and wondering why you haven't begun to fertilize a lifelong dream kept in your backseat.As Blanchard sums it up, \\"Our Life is a series of positive acts with purpose.\\" Having lived a life less ordinary; opening eight businesses, residing in two countries, building everything from restaurants to sailboats, to going from six digit debtors to wealthy entrepreneurs has bestowed the Blanchards with a crate full of knowledge on how to live a life for what you are truly passionate for. Despite any atypicalities or the absence of predetermined roadmaps for success, the Blanchards overcame much apprehension in shadowy times to become impelling life motivators."},{"Title":"Live What You Love: Notes from an Unusual Life","review":"This is a couple who follow their inner wisdom and the results are very inspiring!

I did not read this book, I only skimmed parts of it while in a bookstore. Also, I am naturally cynical, though I want to believe in people (an idealist at heart hidden beneath a cynic's clothing). Normally, I would never consider writing a review for something I never read-- a big pet peeve of mine. However, skimming this book and reading the reviews of the other book by the Blanchard's, \\"A Trip to the Beach : Living on Island Time in the Caribbean\\", compelled me to balance out the five star reviews. What I did read of this book seemed very shallow, self-congratulatory, and generally obnoxious and annoying. My feelings were lent further validity when I saw the negative reviews of \\"A Trip to the Beach : Living on Island Time in the Caribbean\\" (overall, it does have a four and a half-star rating, though the several negative reviews had a lot of merit). Those reviews pointed out that the Blanchard's were rich before they moved to the Caribbean and they had owned eight businesses previously (one of which was a restaurant in Anguilla before they opened \\"Blanchard's\\"). Yet the Blanchards portray themselves as free spirits who on a whim and against logic took a risk to follow their dreams. They write a misleading book (\\"A Trip...\\") and then follow it up this disingenous crap. In addition, the Blanchards have a condescending tone towards the natives on the island, and seem to be more concerned about themselves and their business than other people. So basically, they fall into the all-too-prevalent stereotype of rich, old, white people who don't realize how lucky they are (financially, anyway) and who do not appreciate or respect others. Publishing several books about their \\"heroic\\" and \\"inspiring\\" tales is even more callous and fake. They should run for political office in Anguilla.If none of this matters to you and all you want is regurgitated, BS fluff to inspire you to do something that the the authors didn't do, buy and read this book. Otherwise, abstain."},{"Title":"Live What You Love: Notes from an Unusual Life","review":"I finished this book in two hours. Very encouraging and uplifting. If you need a little emotional boost or support when you are in the early stages of starting a new business, read this!But hold on -- not only does it offer emotional support, I find that it also offers the budding entrepreneur quite a few good advice and examples if you read carefully. On the whole, I find this book more useful than Martha Stewart's recent book on starting a business. Martha's advice is too impractical sometimes for cash-strapped entrepreneurs ('get the best lawyers !!' or something to that effect)."},{"Title":"Live What You Love: Notes from an Unusual Life","review":"This book was amazing.

It starts with revolution in 1789 and ends with the disastrous events of August 1914....a revolution since it made the United States a global power and shaped the Twentieth Century. In the middle there is peace...well, relative peace.The Nineteenth Century is split into six sections - domestic politics, culture, society, economics, international politics and imperialism - and attempts to be an overview that will appeal to everyone. I found the sections on imperialism, politics &amp; economics the most interesting ... although the most readable sections of the book are the intro and finale written by the editor.The book contains a really great chronology of the main events during the period. The biblio leaves the reader with plenty of follow up leads. And the publishers also provide pretty detailed maps of Europe and the world at various points along the way.Faults-wise, there are a few. One, it's not really a blow-by-blow account of the main events. It's more of a big picture or thematic overview and the reader may be susceptible to attention fatigue unless gripped by a need to know. Two, you don't really go away with a real sense of what happened to the world, because of what occurred in 19th century Europe. The linkeages are left for you to fill. Fair enough, but one chapter wouldn't have hurt."},{"Title":"The Nineteenth Century: Europe 1789-1914 (Short Oxford History of Europe)","review":"An excellent thematic approach to the social, economic, and political processes of the nineteenth century.

Blanning's contribution is a good introduction to the 19th Century that should be complimented with a more comprehensive composition."},{"Title":"The Nineteenth Century: Europe 1789-1914 (Short Oxford History of Europe)","review":"This book has quite a bit of information--making a very dense read. This is fine, but the authors write with several assumptions. 1. There is the assumption that everyone will know what they are referring to when discussing particular topics. As a graduate student focusing on early modern Europe, I navigated the text somewhat with ease. However, this text is being used for undergraduate courses, and many students are considerably lost when reading this text. If you are an expert in, let us say, European economics from the 19th century until mid 20th century the book may be suitable. At times, the authors appear quite confusing and the use of specific stats is often overused and overbearing for the reader.2. As I alluded to earlier, this book is used for an undergraduate course. It should only be used for graduate courses where many of the students are either familiar with the topic or you are guaranteed to have several supplemental readings to assist you with this text.If you are just a person who loves or likes history and wants to read on this particular period--I would only suggest this book if:1. You have an decent background in this periods history.2. You at least have another text(s) covering similar topics to aid you in your reading.If you know nothing of the period or topics covered....I would not suggest this text."},{"Title":"Disney's: Winnie the Pooh's - Christmas Stories: Big Book (Learn and Grow)","review":"Once again the character of Pooh comes to life bringing about a message of friendship.

(Emergent Reader, Level 1)","review":"The book may be intended to supplement a lesson on reading maps, but it has other uses also. It is written in a simple repeated pattern, which makes it easy for the ESL student to follow. Until the last sentence, each sentence follows the pattern \\"Can you find [name or common noun] [apostrophe-S] house?\\" This renders the book valuable for a lesson on the interrogative form or a lesson on the possessive S.

Bad French grammar, of course, although an English speaker doesn't immediately know why :). What are all the different rules for questions, for negation? What, exactly, is the difference between &quot;pendant&quot; and &quot;depuis&quot;? All that and much more is here, well organized, in more detail than you could ever want. If you have a question about French grammar, this book answers it in exhaustive detail. That is the only flaw - it is so complete that the intermediate student feels a little overwhelmed at times.If you are one of those people who is uncomfortable just &quot;winging it&quot;, and needs a *correct* explanation, in English, of how French really is and how things really work, then look no further.Of course, a book like this is only a part of the puzzle, but an important part."},{"Title":"L.S.R.

The introductory chapter on the arts & crafts movement and what exactly is considered a bungalow are quite good. It was the misleading title and the narrow focus of the rest of the book I was disappointed with. A more accurate title for this book would be \\"The Bungalow: Central California's Arts & Crafts Home\\"I just bought a 1915 craftsman-style home in superb condition, in an area filled with bungalows and arts & crafts homes.

Not only is the author, Wilhelm Halbfass, a profound scholar of both Western and Indian philosophy, he possess an acute philolosophical mind himself. The book begins with a fascinating exploration of the history of Western Metaphysics, and culminates with the recent controversy over the very meaningfulness of the question of being. While noting that many analytic philosophers think that the classical Western tradition of metaphysics extending back to Plato and Aristotle is based on linguistic confusions, Halbfass makes clear that not all analytic philosophers feel this way, and seems to think that Heidegger's repeated assertion that the moderns neglect Being for the sake of beings, has a point. The introductory chapter concludes by insisting that Western Philosophy has not, by any means, come to a conclusion about the nature, or even the possibility, of Metaphysics, and, therefore, that it would be unseemly for Western Philosophers to approach the Indian Philosophical Tradition from as stance of certainty or superiority.The next chapter introduces the question of being in Indian Philosophy by tracing the origins of the Indian thought to certain questions and speculations raised in the Vedas. Halbfass makes a strong case for the thesis that the Vedas, in general, raise the question of being with respect to the origina of the universe. Though Halbfass does detect in certain of the early Vedic speculations the roots of the classical Advaitin monistic position, he insists, based on impressive textual evidence, that the Vedic Indians were not so much interested in the original, uniform, state of the world, as in the space the Gods opened up in that state, a space which allows for the existence of contingent beings.Halbfass next goes on to argue that that the earliest Indian Schools of Philosophy can be distinguished by whether or not they are primarily concerned with origins, and with the evolution of the world of experience from an original and unmanifest nature, or are primarily concerned with \\"what there is\\", with the classification of all beings and all possible beings. It is this question of \\"what there is\\" which dominated the labors of the earliest Indian Realism, the Vaisesika School. Halbfass devotes several chapters to the explication of the subtle and ingenious categorial scheme of the Vaisesika. In the course of his discussion he makes the intellectual penetration and sophistication of the great Vaisesika and Nyaya philosophers crystal clear to the attentive reader. But he also forcefully states the objections of the anti-realistic Buddhists and Advaitins to the realism of the Vaisesika (noting, along the way, how the Jains tried to mediate between extreme realism and anti-realism), and in concluding the book he notes that the Advaita Vedanta of Sankara posits an ultimate One that is not unlike that which is spoken of in the Vedas as the origin or source of all things. The question of \\"What There is\\" thus gets covered over at the end of the dialectic, and there is a return to the question of being.What I really appreciate about this book, aside from its stylistic clarity and the staggering scholarship it evinces, is the fairness with which Halbfass states the arguments of both the realists and the idealists. It is clear that he himself is torn with respect to which side has won this debate. Persons who like polemics, and want an author to come down on one side or the other of a philosophical argument, will find this book frustrating. But all those who know how difficult it is to find the right answers to the most profound questions, will leave this book enormously stimulated, and will have renewed awe and respect for the philosophical prowess of the ancient Indian masters. I cannot recomment this book highly enough to anyone interested in Indian philosophy or the philosophical debate which has raged, in both the east and the west, between the realists and the idealists."},{"Title":"Southern Fried Football: The History, Passion, And Glory","review":"\`Southern Fried Football' is the definitive reference tool for fans of SEC and ACC football.

Mr.Knussman is in the process of making this book in to a movie. he has hit some snags and may be on hold for a while longer. has a few different screen plays written for this movie and it should make a good flick. he was hoping to get charleze theoron and dennis quaid to star in it. he also has written a second book that i highly reccomend called the peabody connection and i like it a bit better than the ice conspiracy."},{"Title":"Ice Ages (Planet Earth)","review":"I recommend this book highly. It is well-written and easily understood by the newcomer, yet sophisticated enough for someone with an earth science background. The photography is excellent, with some pictures being remarkable for their spectacular beauty. Both the photos and the superb diagrams follow the text closely.I was especially impressed with Chapter 2, on the disappearance of the large wild animals, and with Chapter 3, on the development of solutions to the &quot;cosmic problem&quot;, of Ice Age causation. Both show the development of science via the scientific method in an exemplary fashion.The best chapter to me was Chapter 4, however, which discusses challenges to the proposed astronomical causation theory. while the currently fashionable &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot;, isn't discussed in detail, only its recent novelty prevented this. It is noteworthy that this book has been quoted frequently in scientific abstracts.The book won't make you a glaciologist or a paleontologist, but it will surely whet your interest and increase your knowledge in these fields. Any natural science library is well served by this book's inclusion."},{"Title":"Ice Ages (Planet Earth)","review":"This is a great book for overall view of the history behind &quot;global warming&quot;.

Mrs. Cimino, because of unusual stress, has become confused. A hearing is held, a guardian appointed, her assets placed under control of a bank, and she is sent to a nursing home. Thanks to her granddaughter, she is moved to a home that helps her recover. The bank has sold her home and possessions with no interference from her two sons, so she moves to an apartment hotel. But she must, with difficulty, sue for a larger allowance from her own money and to regain some control over her own assets. Once placed under guardianship, few recover control of their own lives. Even Mrs. Cimino, who is quite well off financially, does not get all she asks. And she is warned by her attorney that the bank might ship her to another nursing home to avoid losing control of her money. An absorbing story with characters who seem real. After reading it, one doesn't have to wonder what happens to less wealthy people in the same situation."},{"Title":"A piano for Mrs. Cimino","review":"This is a moving, powerful novel about an idealist's search for meaning in a callous, corrupt society.

Reading this book not only made me a better eater-it made me a better food shopper and enhanced my abilities in the kitchen.

It explains the scientific basis behind the nutritional issues without being overly technical, and the engaging writing is free of extraneous motivational psychobabble and New Agey preaching.

By breaking down this theoretical artistic venue into three easy steps: Color Wash, Base Layer, and Ghost Layer, those of us wishing to venture into textile art using our quilting skills will appreciate her methodical and consistent approach. Katie's diagrams and photographs are extensive and thorough. Most appreciated are her example photographs done on a black background, making them much easier to see. This book is packed full of examples, starting with beautiful photographs, followed by their corresponding abstract, artistic quilting interpretations. Katie has not missed a step or technique, and though her book may appear a bit complex at the onset, careful review reveals her clear and concise instructions and explanations. Katie makes a most difficult artistic venture simple and understandable to even the beginning art quilter. All of Katie's techniques can be transferred to embellished clothing, as well, so her instructional information is timeless and span the entire creative sewing spectrum.

The author unfortunately couldn't resist including the Offenhauser which really belongs in a book about racing engines.I would love to see another similar book about another group of engines. My candidates would include more oddball entries that are less high performance oriented.

This is a VERY thorny area, though with teachers (as distinct from 'free spirits', who don't have quite the same responsibility - if you want to play with the fire, it's your problem if you get burnt lol!) I tend to err on the side of:\\"The deeper the enlightenment --> the deeper the knowing that ultimately everyone/everything is 'just fine' + a deep respect for all beings through knowing their essential inalienable dignity and purity ---> it's definitely not necessary to harm people based on the CHANCE this might get them enlightened quicker.\\"Observe the Dalai Lama and Dilgo Khyentse for example.

A tale that might have been told in 100 pages -- if at all -- is dragged out far too long. The timelines are confusing, and verifiably inconsistent; the characters are unappealing to the last and completely predictable; and the story itself goes nowhere. You're told all you need to know on page 1 and the rest is overblown description and repetition. Obviously, I regret taking the time to read this book and can only recommend that other readers try something -- anything -- else."},{"Title":"Lost Man's River (Panther S.)","review":"There is - as the other reviewers have pointed out in their varying ways - altogether too much inertia in this book for the impatient reader, too many interweaving genealogies and generations, too much \\"cracker\\" dialogue in this account of historian Lucius Watson's (son of the Watson killed in the first novel of the trilogy), who much resembles Matthiessen himself, even in physical description, attempt to discover the \\"truth\\" about his father, if that is indeed what one could call it. Lucius doesn't quite know what he's been doing all these decades of his life at the end of the book - aside from having thrown it away.All this having been conceded, Lost Man's River is like nothing so much as a long drawn out prose-poem of encircling narratives whose keynote is the deep lingering bass of elegy: elegy for a lost landscape, for a lost way of life, for a lost man and his lost sons, and, in the end, as with all great elegies, for lost humanity.One feels at times that the prose itself is sticky marshland one is wandering through to no end. But, to this reader's mind, all is redeemed by the lyrical sighs that punctuate the work, from the \\"cruel spring dusk\\" to the \\"somnolent August pastures\\" the narrative is wound in a dreamy language of desuetude.This lovely prose is what makes this second book of The Watson trilogy worthwhile to me. It has much of Thomas Gray and the book of Ecclesiastes in it. Here is a sampling:\\"And yet Lucius had always known - or known, at least, since October of 1910 - that in the end there was no sanctuary except free self-relinquishment into the eternal light of transience and change, leaving no more trace than the blown dust of an old mushroom or the glimmer of a swift minnow in a sunlit sea or the passage of a lone dark bird hurrying across a twilight winter sky.\\"If this passage doesn't strike a chord in you somewhere, then - as any number of the canny old-timers in this book might say: \\"You'd best turn right around and leave off ponderin' readin' this thing right now afore you get yourself stuck somewheres you don't much like.\\"But, on the other hand, if such passages do strike you, then you'll be amply rewarded as you turn the final page with a panorama in the mind's eye of a time and setting lost in shadows and voices on the wind."},{"Title":"Lost Man's River (Panther S.)","review":"For me, this is the deepest and most moving novel in the Mr. Watson trilogy. While it must be read with the other two books, in this novel the losses we have experienced as a people and as a country in the twentieth century hit home hard. Lucius, the main character, reveals in his wanderings that we all have lost our own history, our families, our environment, and much of our humanity. That twentieth century America was built on the bones of native Americans and by the continuing enslavement of African Americans is the dark under-theme of this novel. Black people were rounded up and \\"sold\\" as chain gangs to construct the citrus groves and railroads that transformed Florida from wilderness to \\"civilization.\\" And the true hero of the book is Henry Short, the purest person in the entire tale, condemned to a tragic death by his race."},{"Title":"Lost Man's River (Panther S.)","review":"Matthiessen's Killing Mr. Watson trilogy, of which Lost Man's River is the middle part, is to me an excellent example of how fiction describes reality better, more intensely, and in a way that is hard to explain, more truthfully, than, let's say, a factual report by a newspaper (or the police, for that matter)."},{"Title":"Lost Man's River (Panther S.)","review":"Perhaps I loved Killing Mr. Watson TOO much. I was thrilled to see a sequel, but found the characters in this novel pale in comparison to the outlaw watson. These folks which we met superficiously in the 1st novel, well, maybe I got to know them too well in this one! Or maybe Mr. Matthiessen has a different point to make about these outlaws and outcasts. Hmmm, can't say it'll stop me from anxiously awaiting the third book in this trilogy!"},{"Title":"Lost Man's River (Panther S.)","review":"I've read only the first 135 pages of this novel, but feel compelled to publish my critique less I die of boredom (or old age) before I finish it. Perhaps my exhaustion comes from the fact that I've had to reread every other sentence to have any idea what's going on. Despite a beautiful cover, this book is a web of tedious geniology almost completely void of anything close to a plot. If I live long enough to finish it, I'm afraid the experience to date will still be enough to leave me dissapointed."},{"Title":"Lost Man's River (Panther S.)","review":"Living in southwest Florida in the area of much of the locale of this story I was constantly reminded of the tangle of the mangrove forests which are typical of the coastal waters of this part of the world and the Ten Thousand Islands in particular. Virtually impenetrable. So was the confusing mass of cracker family detail piled on the reader. One has to force one's way through it and the result is a pretty thin story at the end. However the author's tidbits of history about the area and the spoilation of the Everglades is of interest for those having some knowledge of and curiosity about the subjects. I also felt that this New York born writer carries a lot of his Yankee baggage with him which causes him to unload the usual northern liberal unsympathetic, vulgar, racist stereotyping of southern life of the past on the readers. Way overdone."},{"Title":"Lost Man's River (Panther S.)","review":"Second part of trilogy starting with 'Killing Mr Watson' I can't wait for the third. A man searches for the 'true' story of his father and finds the universal truth. That what we think and say depends on who we are talking to and why. These books tell us much more about humanity then the bible for example, even touches on. What seems a simple story that Mr. Watson was gunned down by a erstwhile posse because they suspected he was a killer, becomes a beautiful literary exercise in the terrible legacy of the human animal. Mr. Mattheissen has awesome experience in all the ways of the world and shows it off here with ruthless honesty. Imbedded in this tale is the utter desecration of the enviroment as well."},{"Title":"Lost Man's River (Panther S.)","review":"Matthieson has one of the most unique and evocative writing styles, and for a person who grew up in NYC, his ability to write in the voices of denizens of the everglades is amazing. It gets a little slow at certain points, as some of the same ground is gone over many times - but once you finish, you realize that this repetitiveness is exactly what the main character's obsession with his father's death would lead too: he just can't let go; he needs to keep at it, no matter the cost. And what a cost. Overall, I loved it. I can't wait for the last installment of the triology."},{"Title":"Lost Man's River (Panther S.)","review":"The Washington Post, and others, have proclaimed that Part II of the Watson trilogy isn't up to its brethren - but I found it fascinating, nonetheless. Of special interest were the character vignettes, what I would call the stories within the story - masterfully done, sometimes funny, sometimes revolting. Peter M. has learned a lot about the human condition, and he doesn't hold back. In addition, while reading this book one can almost smell the mangrove swamps of Florida, and at times feel their destruction in the name of &quot;progress&quot;."},{"Title":"Lost Man's River (Panther S.)","review":"although i admire the author's use of language, and do admit he's a very good writer, i had a rather hard time with this book. i usually read about a book a week (generally not fluff), and it took me almost a month to get through 2/3 of it. i had a lot of trouble keeping track of all the characters -- i actually made a series of &quot;family trees,&quot; trying to figure out how everyone in the book was connected. that helped, but didn't make the book any more fun to read. (the author should have included some sort of chart or legend in the book -- i kept looking for one every time he introduced a new character). maybe the ending makes the whole book worthwhile -- i don't know. i gave up before i finished. maybe if i had read the first book of the trilogy, i would have gotten more out of it. as it is, i've moved on to books that are a pleasure to read, rather than a chore."},{"Title":"Lost Man's River (Panther S.)","review":"This is the second book of a trilogy that begins with \\"Killing Mr. Watson,\\" and ends with \\"Bone by Bone.\\" If you read Killing Mr. Watson, and were fascinated by it, as many readers and critics have been, you'll be tempted to read the rest of the trilogy. Dead Man's River begins many years after E.J. Watson's death. Watson's son, Lucius, is struggling to reconstruct his father's life and death. You might have noticed in Killing Mr. Watson that the story, told by those who knew Watson, contains gaps, ambiguities, contradictions and mysteries. There's plenty of room for sequels.Lucius finds some answers, and also uncovers new mysteries and contradictions. Along the way, you'll learn more about the many fascinating characters you first encountered as narrators in \\"Killing Mr. Watson.\\" The final book in the trilogy, \\"Bone by Bone,\\" tells the tale again, from the point of view of Mr. Watson.The Mr. Watson trilogy is reminiscent of the well-known film, Rashomon, by Akira Kurosawa. It re-tells the same tale several times, from different perspectives. This is a gutsy kind of trilogy to write. A lesser author would burden the reader with repetition and excessive detail. Mathiessen, one of few authors ever to win one National Book Awards for fiction, and another for nonfiction, is up to the task, if anyone is.Dead Man's River suffers from the usual problems found in the second book in a trilogy. It doesn't begin the story, nor end it, and it's nearly incomprehensible if you haven't read the first book. Consider, who would enjoy \\"The Two Towers,\\" the second book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, if he or she had not first read \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" and did not intend to read \\"Return of the King\\"?If, after reading Killing Mr. Watson, you're eager to know about Mr. Watson and the other pioneer families of that time and place, read the rest of the trilogy, in sequence. I think you'll be glad you did. I certainly am glad that I did. Matthiessen is a master of so many things -- pioneer history of Florida, diverse cultures, nature writing, environmentalism, character development, historical accuracy and detail, dead-on vernacular dialog, inventive style, and, in this trilogy, compelling mystery.Also, in this trilogy, Mathiessen explores the nature of truth itself, as the same story is retold several times by people who all think they know the truth, though their understanding is filtered by their own perspectives, limited knowledge and vested interests.On the other hand, if Killing Mr. Watson filled your cup, you might want to stop there. It works very well as a stand-alone novel."},{"Title":"Lost Man's River (Panther S.)","review":"I am an avid fan of Peter Matthiessen, and eagerly anticipated &quot;Lost Man's River&quot;. After reading 150 to 200 pages, I began to wonder what he was getting at with the monumental absorbtion in the trivia of names, relationships, and memories. As I progressed further, waiting fruitlessly for either some fuller character development or an essential story line to take shape, my disappoinment began to mount. By the time I finished, I am saddened to report that I felt cheated. The encyplopedic attention to detail required to give full attention to the book, does not fulfill it's end, nor is the final surprise a justifiable finale to the mind boggling littany of detail to which we are exposed. Hopefully, the final volume of the trilogy will restore the interest so greatly initiated by &quot;Killing Mr. Watson&quot;."},{"Title":"Lost Man's River (Panther S.)","review":"I sat down to read this book with a sense of eager anticipation, having greatly enjoyed Peter Matthiessen's first book in the Watson trilogy, \\"Killing Mr Watson\\". I put it down, nearly a month later, with a sense of profound disappointment. \\"Lost Man's River\\" is not a book in the same class as its predecessor.\\"Killing Mr Watson\\" told the story of Edgar Watson's life in Southern Florida and his eventual death at the hands of a posse of his neighbours. \\"Lost Man's River\\" tells the story of Watson's son Lucius, a historian with both an academic and an emotional interest in finding out the truth about his father's life. (Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that, while Lucius's academic interest lies in finding out the truth about his father's life, his emotional interest lies in confirming his own preconceived ideas about his father's life). By the time of the events narrated in the book (around 1960) Lucius is an elderly man. The book follows his journeys around Florida and his meetings with the surviving few people who remember Edgar Watson, including his reunion with his long-lost brother Rob.The sentimental journeyings of a septuagenarian historian do not make for an enthralling plot; indeed, the book has a loose, episodic structure and very little in the way of coherent plot at all. In \\"Killing Mister Watson\\" the characters were vividly drawn, especially the dominating figure of Watson himself. In \\"Lost Man's River\\" there is much less in the way of characterisation. Although Watson is an ever-present thought in Lucius's mind, he obviously cannot be introduced as a character in his own right as he has been dead for fifty years. Lucius is merely a bore, and the other characters are stiff and lifeless. The old people's reminiscences of the past are tedious and confusing, and tend to get bogged down in an excess of genealogical detail. In an attempt to add to the interest of the plot, Matthiessen provides a brief love-interest for Lucius in the form of a much younger woman, but this episode struck me as very unconvincing.Not everything about the book is bad. There are some vivid descriptions of the natural beauty of the Everglades. There is also some sharp commentary about the way in which that natural beauty has been despoiled by the modern world, and about Southern racism. Unlike most of what has preceded it, the ending is genuinely gripping, as old feuds end in violence and Lucius makes an unwelcome discovery which forces him to reassess his view of the past. Unfortunately, to get to the ending one has to wade through some very tedious passages; like some of the characters, I often felt that I was bogged down in an impenetrable swamp."},{"Title":"Lost Man's River (Panther S.)","review":"I loved &quot;Killing Mr. Watson,&quot; the first book, and thought the genealogy in it was great, though I finally did find myself making a (complex) chart of who was related to who. But even with this knowledge already in hand, &quot;Lost Man's River&quot; seemed to bog down. The modern parts, especially, were very forced. Sally, among others, was just not a believable character, and the sex scene made her even less believable. Moreover, when is all this set? The author hints that it was 50 years after Mr. Watson's death, which would necessarily make it 1960, and so makes Lucius age 70 and Rob--admitttedly--an octogenarian. But the tone and language, plus the attitudes towards drugs, race, sex, etc. are much closer to 1975 (at least) than 1960. Several characters are depicted as veterans of a war in Asia that &quot;no one ever gave a damn about.&quot; Sounds more like Vietnam to me than Guadalcanal or Okinawa. Ironically (and it's a big irony) the most interesting thing about the book is the critical name change for the family that was the &quot;Richard Hamilton&quot; clan in the first book. In this book, the author calls them the Hardens, but it's clearly the same family--even their initials are the same. The names of all the other families are the same in both books. Why the change for this one? It can only be because this is the family that all the others believe to have some African-American ancestry. This was a big issue in the South in 1910, and it is obviously nearly as big an issue now. All the other surnames are of actual pioneer families of the Everglades: Daniels, Jenkins, Brown, Storter, Smallwood, etc. The clear inference is that today's Hamilton descendants objected to the author using their real names and thus labelling them as &quot;passing for white&quot; (whatever that means). It would be interesting to have Mr. Matthiessen confirm this, because it brings one of the book's significant themes into real-time focus."},{"Title":"Lost Man's River (Panther S.)","review":"If you have ever driven yourself to near distraction trying to trace a family genealogy, with duplicate names, multiple marriages, and family migrations, you might have prepared adequately for Lost Man's River, which is, essentially, a detailed family genealogy. And though you may be fascinated by some of the characters, be prepared to do a great deal of page-flipping to try to keep all the characters all straight.There is not much direct action. Except for the ending, the most exciting events take place in the past and surround the death of E. J. Watson when the now fifty-year-old narrator, his son Lucius, was a child. The action that takes place in the present occurs primarily through interviews forty years after E.J. Watson's death as Lucius tries to separate truth from myth.The book is not fatally dull because of the historical, sociological, cultural, and geographical insights the author also provides. Illustrating the conflicting cultures and motivations of very poor whites, blacks, Indians,and &quot;mixed breeds&quot; as they hunt, fish, drink, and interact, often disastrously, in the Florida Everglades, Lost Man's River also traces the life, death, and possible salvation of a wild and much threatened natural environment.With its large cast of characters, complex familial relationships, and carefully researched depictions of the forty year time span of the &quot;action,&quot; this is a book of enormous reach. It is not surprising that it took the author twenty years to bring it to fruition."},{"Title":"Lost Man's River (Panther S.)","review":"I read \\"Lost Man's River\\" nearly 10 years ago, and finished the trilogy immediately following the release of #3. I've been a repeat reader of \\"Snow Leopard\\" and \\"Nine Headed Dragon River\\" and when I saw an unknown (to me) Matthiessen title I bought it on reflex, dug in, slogged, and followed in short-order to consume \\"Killing Mr. Watson\\" and wait impatiently for \\"Bone by Bone.\\" When talking with anyone in whom I detect the slightest to be a reader I'm off and gone on the magnificience of Matthiessen's capacity to immerse the reader in the heat of the swamp and stubborn mind of man. It is an ultimate fly-on-the-wall experience. You buzz around, land for a moment, flash a restless, comforting blink through hundreds of lenses, and flashing with fear, hunger and frantic sleepy nervous energy, flick to another elbow, eyebrow, lampshade, another hall of mirrors inside someone's mind. And onto the next. Endless strings of POV. Not an easy read. It's at least as confusing as any of the most critical reviewers has let on. If your expectation is smooth narrative with crisp transitions and a baggage-free punchline at the end of a perfectly dissembled string of interleaving \\"Arthur Hailey-esqe\\" sub-plots, well, no, this isn't it. Peter hasn't named it \\"Lost Man's River\\" for nothing. It's the heat. Sweltering, oppressive, unrelenting, weaving inside and out of the mind's eye of dozens of characters, dozens and dozens by the time you get through all three books, each of whom is utterly certain that they've got the story right. This is a long yarn where everybody is telling the truth. Probably in much the same way, as say, Tom DeLay is certain that he is always telling the truth. Matthiessen's accomplishment as a craftsman is the voice, the vernacular. You learn to read with a drawl quick enough, which gets to be like a buzzing in your head. Books 1 & 3 are by the far easier reads. The experience of #2 being very similar to Thomas Pynchon's \\"V\\" where the candy for the mind is in the tone, weight and timbre of language, the music of the prose, where the narrative line is possibly only be found by surrendering your search. Matthiessen's achievement is brilliant, extraordinary, precious and impossibly rare."},{"Title":"Lost Man's River (Panther S.)","review":"In agreement with many of the other reviewers of this novel I agree the amount of characters and their lineages can be trying. However, when I manged to get even a slight idea of who was who things became much easier. I thought the novel filled in the gaps and questions left my &quot;Killing Mr. Watson&quot; with great clarity. Because of this I believe that the novel could not be fully appreciated without having previously read the first book of the trilogy. &quot;Lost Man's River&quot; made me formulate my own conclusions as to what actually happened and not until the very end did I find out what I had right and what I had wrong"},{"Title":"Lost Man's River (Panther S.)","review":"... I might be able to paddle in and out of the Everglades National Park, what's left of the ten thousand islands and the swamp described so vividly in Peter Matthiessen's \\"Shadow Country\\" trilogy, of which 'Lost Man's River' is the second book. With a lot of imagination, I might be able to visualize the plantations - driftwood shacks, mostly - of the pioneer generation of despoilers. I might catch an image of the enormous flocks of egrets and other 'plume birds' which that generation exterminated. I might be able to photograph the rotting and rusting remnants of their strivings and failings. It wouldn't be easy not to get lost, not to rot in there. But it would probably be easier than not getting lost in the meandering sloughs of this novel, which is roughly divided between rotting and rutting. Wallowing. Staggering. Stagnating. Wasting a life in the effort to redeem the waste.\\"Lost Man's River\\" is powerfully written and powerfully unappealing. The narrative is as turgid as the muddy channels of the swamp. The central character, Lucius Watson, is obsessed - consumed - by his father's identity and fate. The father, E.J. Watson, was slain by a mob of his neighbors at the beginning and again at the end of Matthiessen's \\"Killing Mister Watson.\\" Lucius thinks he wants to know what really happened, what sort of man his father really was, with perhaps the hope that the information will tell him what sort of man he is himself. Like a Faulkner novel, the trilogy tells the same story (or rather, what should be the same story but isn't) in the words of dozens of witnesses, not one of them a 'reliable' narrator. The unreliability of history, even at or especially at the smallest scale of a single man's life and death, has to be taken as one of Matthiessen's central themes. Environmental catastrophe in the making is surely another, and the horror of racism is a third.As one negative reviewer correctly said about this book, there isn't a 'decent' human being in its pages. They are all hate-driven, drunken, violent, and lawless, with the implication that they are the prototypes of American sociopathy. This volume, of course, is all about Lucius, and we readers plod through it hoping against hope that Lucius will turn out okay, that Lucius's education and thoughtfulness will eventually make a man of him. A different, better kind of man, that is, from his father and from all of the other men around him. I suppose that's what Lucius hopes, also, as a justification for his otherwise wasted life.E.J. Watson was a 'real-life' personage, by the way, and Peter Matthiessen must have poured months of research into preparing this trilogy. But one must not fail to note that most of the scenes of the book are fiction. Products of Matthiessen's historical imagination! The third volume, as I understand, retells the 'myth' of Watson's violence and violent death from Watson's own viewpoint. Wow. So after more than a thousand pages, the story is still unresolved. A cliffhanger. Now I HAVE to read \\"Bone by Bone\\" to get my mental kayak pointed toward home."},{"Title":"Lost Man's River (Panther S.)","review":"After waiting eagerly for the second saga of life in the Everglades, I was disappointed with an inaccurate time line, malicious use of real people 's names with bad events at the wrong time and place in The Everglades history.... a portrayal of good and simple people as rednecks, crooks and drug runners. The story line is stretch to its limit with the main figure in the story having sex with a college student when he had to be in his 60-70s... This is not equal to the first book - don't waste your time"},{"Title":"Lost Man's River (Panther S.)","review":"Peter Mattiessen has written a snoozer of a book as a follow up to &quot;Killing Mr. Watson.&quot; I purchased this book with enthusiasm and began reading it with keen anticipation and soon found myself bogged down in tedium as muggy and uncomfortable as any mosquito-infected hammock in the wilds of South Florida.The author drags the reader, along with vaguely embodied Lucius, son of Mr. Watson, from one to another of complicated and excruciatingly boring genealogy lessons, painfully and pointlessly enumerating the complex web of family members, living and dead, of Mr. Watson, as well as the family members of Mr. Watson's alleged victims, members of families he married into, and the families of women upon whom he sired bastard children.It reminds me of being in the company of a bunch of old men and women from my own rural background, who are sitting around tracing through and arguing over family history. &quot;No, no, that wasn't a Jones he married, it was a Smith, that little Smith girl, Jessie, you know...&quot; Ho-hum. It is bad enough to encounter this sort of boorishness from time to time in real life -- but to seek it out in fiction is a form of masochism which I hope most readers will not find appealling. Sorry, Peter, but you lost this reader this time. I'll never make it to the third novel in the string, &quot;Bone by Bone.&quot; It was bad enough going through the life of the ultimately uninteresting Mr. Watson, body by body. &quot;Killing Mr. Watson,&quot; was a good read.

I don't know that I've ever read a better treatment of the subject. Hartman makes an excellent case for free verse as a rigorous form, and his discussion of prosody should be required reading for all teachers of 20th century poetry and any poet who wants to work in this form."},{"Title":"Free verse: An essay on prosody","review":"This actually is NOT the reprint edition (the previous reviewer's remarks to the contrary). ISBN 0-691-10185-X (this edition) is the original Princeton University Press edition (paperback) that contains the &quot;Appendix: Full Text of Three Quoted Poems&quot; (Moore, Larkin, Berryman). The Northwestern reprint that the previous reviewer is referring to is a different edition (ISBN 0-8101-1316-3). This Princeton edition is out of print and hard to obtain, but well worth it."},{"Title":"Free verse: An essay on prosody","review":"I just wrote a fairly detailed review of this at my blog, Poemshape, so I won't repeat it here.In a nutshell, Hartman fails to create the prosody as he defines it at the outset of the book. He speaks with authority and conviction, but when his \\"prosody\\" is actually put to the test, as with T.S. Eliot's \\"Burnt Norton\\", it turns out that Hartman is wrong. That's only OK if one isn't trying to argue that certain interpretations \\"must be shared\\", as in a shared prosody.More disappointing to me is Hartman's endlessly fussy redefinition of rhythm in meter and rhythm as opposed to meter. This fails completely and when obvious instances of metrical poems (like nursery rhymes or limericks) flatly contradict his thesis he all but writes that \\"they don't count\\". He writes that they're not meters \\"in the poetic sense\\". This is complete rubbish, but Hartman has so painted himself into a corner with his idiosyncratic definition of rhythm that he has no choice but to pretend that limericks aren't really metrical.Lastly, the academese of his writing only worsens as his book progresses - probably because his arguments are steadily growing weaker. By the time one gets to the end of the book the reader will be confronted with luminous paragraphs like this:\\"A striving toward concreteness in language -- the subordination of other linguistic processes to that of naming -- is one corollary of the doctrine of the objective correlative. On the other hand, the poem's method partly conflicts with the purpose of that doctrine, which is finally to facilitate communication between poet and reader by giving them a common ground. If sense in language inheres in the connections among units of sound, meaning inheres in the connections among units of perception, not simply in the units themselves. The poem's linguistic fragmentation, besides emphasizing sound, tends also to atomize experience into isolated glimpses, and thus to fragment the meaning that the reader is asked to share.\\"One can only marvel at the irony of beginning such a passage with the words \\"concreteness in language\\".But I don't mean to discourage \\"students of poetry\\" from reading this book. Hartman provides much grist for the mill. He's thrown his glove down and though he trips over it, face first, it's still a challenge worth taking up. The ins and outs of lineation and phrasing, while not amounting to a prosody, may well encourage writers of free verse to reconsider how they write their poems."},{"Title":"Why Do I Do What I Do?: How to Understand Yourself And Others","review":"I had the pleasure to participate in five different workshops that Virginia presented at my place of employment.

Even so, it manages to put across more hard info about the transformation of Charlie from Love Guru to General Charlie of the Acid Apocolypse than any book, article or expose since Ed Sanders' THE FAMILY. If you have a heart at all, the scenes recounting the murders of first Gary Hinman, the forgotten Manson Victim and then Sharon Tate and friends and then the poor La Biancas will leave you broken and weeping.

Up until now, only the lucky few attendees of Film festivals have been able to catch a glimpse of Jim Vanbebber's radical reworking of the Manson Family story since the Film has yet to have been distributed to Theaters. Now, while Vanbebber finishes his final cut, you can read the screenplay itself, browse the photos and add his take on the crime spree to your collection of classics like HELTER SKELTER. Of course, I can hardly wait for the film, but in the meantime... I'll take this. The retelling itself focuses on a theory of the crimes that has not been in the forefront. Vanbebber's take on the big question of WHY the murders took place is disturbing since it demystifies the crimes and shows them for the dirty, filthy, stupid and brutal murders they actually were rather than some statement on a fictional Race War. Ultimately, I feel his telling of the stories is more disturbing as a result of his refusal to be swayed by media myths."},{"Title":"Charlie's Family: An Illustrated Screenplay to the Film by Jim VanBebber (Creation Cinema Collection)","review":"I've been hearing about CHARLIE'S FAMILY for over five years and ever since I've been dying to see Underground Wunderkind, Jim Van Bebber's retelling of the Manson story. Sadly, it seems that the film is either not yet finished or has not yet acquired a Distributor. In a year when Blair Witch made so much money on such a false pretense, I gotta ask myself why this film hasn't seen the light of day? Still, Creation has now published the screenplay to this long-awaited project along with lots of groovy production stills which has calmed me down some. However, after reading the story which is a poignant but slightly sardonic look at Tabloid Culture, I only want to see the film more and more. Even so, I think anyone interested in Van Bebber's work (My Sweet Satan) can appreciate his narrative style and enjoy reading this screenplay. One advantage to reading it as a screenplay instead of some novelization is that you can see in your mind's eye, what shape the film will take place. It's like a secret glimpse into the creative process that few people outside of a studio ever get access to. The story itself is very up to date even if it is about Manson. The wrap-around story brings the moral questions of the Manson mystique into focus while the flashback scenes transport us back into the harrowing summer of 1969 when the Hippie movement jumped the tracks and a small band of Free-lovers and their ex-con Guru, Charlie, decide it's End Of The World Time and take their paranoia to the streets. The back then and then and the Here and Now of this telling blend very well and make us all wonder if it's very wise to objectify the monsters of our past. Personally, I'd like to see the author move on to a serious, sociological exploration of Manson-Worship but I doubt even he could stand to wallow in the Manson story much longer. Still, if you can overcome your reluctance to read a screenplay, you won't be sorry because in here are all the big answers to the questions raised by the Manson Murders, not the least of which is WHY ON EARTH they happened in the first place. Oh.. and the answer has very little to do with Helter Skelter."},{"Title":"Charlie's Family: An Illustrated Screenplay to the Film by Jim VanBebber (Creation Cinema Collection)","review":"Simply put, one of the most disturbing, beautiful and cautionary tales I have encountered.

It'll take some effort to fix this. It hasn't happened yet.\\"Now Wait for Last Year\\" is yet another example. As with most of Dick's later novels, it's difficult to state simply what it's \\"about\\".

And about a man debating his responsibility to a wife suffering from progressive brain damage from abusing that very drug. And about another man (one of Dick's beloved simpletons) whose hobby is making little carts for rejected missile guidance systems out of no more than a sense of fairness.The other reviewers are far from wrong in their view that very little happens. This is Dick writing SF in mainstream mode, where what occurs is less important than how people handle it, from Earth's military dictator (who is a lot better than he has to be--more of a MacArthur than a Mussolini) to the guy with the carts. There's no grand climax or slick SF \\"solution\\", just a minor epiphany as things finally fall into place for one character. The last scene, which in other hands would have been simply absurd (it does, after all, portray a character named \\"Sweetscent\\" having an emotional conversation with an automated cab) comprise some of the most hopeful pages in any recent novel in SF or out.NWFLY is the book that most clearly reveals Dick's fundamental decency, his sweetness of spirit. John Gardner, the litcrit who was not a poststructuralist and suffered for it, once wrote that the novelist must never forget that some of his readers will be sick, some dying, and some in trouble. Dick never forgot. \\"Now Wait for Last Year\\" is a book for people in trouble. Which means, of course, just about everybody."},{"Title":"Now Wait for Last Year","review":"While Dick is no stranger to deconstructing conventional notions of time he does it threefold (at least) in this novel. It is one of his more action-packed endeavors (like his short story &quot;The Variable Man&quot;) while dealing with temporal perception in an extremely thoughtful and playful way.He also manages to place the earth in an incredible bind that begs the reader's compassion and stimulates the intellect: Which alien race can we trust when two appear, bringing their ancient fight to our planet? The humanoid aliens are manipulative and very powerful but their opponents are human-sized ants that speak in clicks, making it a comment on racism as well. Our only hope lies with an ailing UN super-general who isn't showing his cards, and his mild-mannered doctor who's ex-employer shows up again and again to re-hire and re-fire him.An extremely entertaining and rewarding read that is an essential part of anyone's P K Dick library.

Dick. The themes treated in NOW WAIT FOR LAST YEAR are not a surprise for those of us who have read the precedent books of the american writer. But, in this book, Philip K. Dick succeeds perfectly in the alchemy of the plot.An alien invasion that is never happening, a commander in chief of the Earth population who could be a simulacra, a dangerous drug that is altering time and reality, an average character who has to act as an hero in order to save the humanity : all these themes have already been treated by Philip K. Dick. But not with so much empathy - a fundamental word in PKD vocabulary - in the description of the feelings of his characters.In my opinion, the relation between Eric and Katharine Sweetscent, the doctor and his drug-addicted wife, marks a turning point in the evolution of Dick's literary skills. Hate, Love, Regrets and Empathy hadn't been until then so masterfully painted under Dick's pen.NOW WAIT FOR LAST YEAR is one of PKD's books that could let you enter the unique imaginary world of this american writer. Don't hesitate to open the door.A book for your library."},{"Title":"Now Wait for Last Year","review":"This is a very engaging novel typically for Philip Dick being centred on a character not quite at the hub of the action - an observer, one who can reflect and speculate. And isn't that all of us as our everyday lives infringe on the events of the world - infringe rather than impact?As in many Philip Dick novels there are logical challenges which may compromise the story for people who are unable/unwilling to accept a basic premise of the novel. In this case it is the power of a drug to actually move people temporarily in time - forwards or backwards - or across parallel worlds. Not make it appear that they move, but actually move them. The descriptions of characters in the influence of the drug are so fascinating - for me anyway - that the logical discontinuities disappeared into the far recesses of my mind. And now I realise that there are many logical problems for me in the REAL world that I have trundled away in the back of my mind so that I can get on with life.Philip Dick's graphic and extending speculations on the natureof reality certainly push hard into my reality and how I understand it. And here's a quote: '..... you've only got one tiny life and that lies ahead of you, not sideways or back.'"},{"Title":"Now Wait for Last Year","review":"Although Now Wait for Last Year is usually grouped with the novels of Dick's late 1960s period, it was completed by late 1963. It as the first of several novels in which drugs are a major element, the others being The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, Lies Inc., and A Scanner Darkly. In Now Wait for Last Year the drug in question, JJ-180, supposedly hallucinogenic, does more than alter consciousness: it takes the user backwards or forwards in time. It alters not just subjective reality, but also objective reality, and allows concourse between the parallel universes of different time tracks. Of the novel's main characters, Gino Molinari, the world leader, attempts to use the drug to break out of the fatality of history and linear time and borrow from other possible universes for the benefit of his own. His physician, Eric Sweetscent, for his part, tries to create a desirable future by communicating with future versions of himself. His love/hate relationship with his wife becomes a major element of his desire to escape the present. In a well-known scene, he gets psychological counseling from a talking taxicab. This is a brilliant and fascinating novel that tends to get overlooked among Dick's better known works."},{"Title":"Now Wait for Last Year","review":"Seeing the rave reviews concerning Philip K. Dick's multidinous collection of books, I was immediately intrigued by an author who dared to challenge the mind. In reading most books, one is interested but not ferverent, engaged but never truly touched. Now Wait for Last Year will breach the walls of that special compartment of your mind that strives to remain isolated. The challenge of comprehending Dick's reckless plot is substantial indeed but the rewards are great. Energizing the reader's curiosity, Dick makes impossible promises but always fufills. In the end, the reader is not distressed or confused, he/she is unburdened. The ending is particularly ingenious. In a unique twist, Dick leaves the reader with a feeling of crushing inevitability that differs from other books in that it also hides a certain optimism, an enlivening hope for the future. The main character is oppressed by the yoke of an alien invasion and an unhappy marriage, but there is redemption for him, an end in sight, but distant enough to drive and enthuse us to our destiny. Dick is truly among the greatest authors of all time, and if anyone out there was still pondering as to the literary merit of science fiction, here it is. With Dick's gem as sf's spokesman, one can't help but be utterly convinced."},{"Title":"Now Wait for Last Year","review":"Earth is allied with the planet Lilistar against the alien Reegs. Gino Molinari, the leader of Earth's forces, has just hired Eric Sweetscent as his personal physician. For his new job, Eric has to leave his wife Kathy, who has just become addicted to a new hallucinogenic drug. Eric is glad to leave, though, because he and Kathy aren't getting along.When Eric arrives at Gino Molinari's side, he finds that the man has some strange health issues. At first Eric thinks Mr. Molinari is a paranoid hypochondriac until he discovers that he has survived numerous bouts of cancer. Soon there are other strange discoveries about Molinari's health that baffle Dr. Sweetscent. When he finds out that the drug that Kathy's hooked on came from off-world and causes its users to travel through time, he wonders if her drug addiction and Gino Molinari's bizarre symptoms could be related. He also starts to wonder if Earth is on the wrong side of the war.You never know what you're going to get with a story by Philip K. Dick. Well, that's not exactly true. You can almost certainly expect aliens, spaceships, robots, drug use, paranoia, bad marriages, time warps, alternate universes, and badly inaccurate psychology. What I mean is that PKD's stories vary greatly in quality -- some of them are incredibly clever and innovative, while others are almost painful to read. This may be because, according to biographers, Dick's novels reflect his own unhappy life and his struggles with drugs, divorce, and mental illness.Now Wait for Last Year (1966) is definitely one of the better ones. Eric Sweetscent is a complex character with complex problems for which there are no obvious solutions. A wrong move could endanger all of humanity! There's mystery, whimsy, and humor here, too -- the scenes with the talking taxis are funny (humorous situations with automatons are a familiar PKD element).What stands out most, though, is that Now Wait for Last Year is an unusually emotional novel for Philip K. Dick. Eric deals with a whole spectrum of feelings toward his wife: grief, love, hate, treachery, anger, disgust, and pity. I actually dissolved into tears during the final scene of Now Wait for Last Year when the talking taxi gives Eric some beautiful advice.I listened to Brilliance Audio's version of Now Wait for Last Year. Luke Daniels performed it perfectly, as usual. I love old science fiction and I love audiobooks, so I absolutely adore Brilliance Audio for putting so much old science fiction on audio this year!"},{"Title":"Now Wait for Last Year","review":"A virtual compendium of many of Philip K. Dick's pet themes, tropes and obsessions, \\"Now Wait For Last Year,\\" the author's 17th published sci-fi novel, originally appeared as a Doubleday hardcover in 1966. (As revealed in Lawrence Sutin's biography on Dick, the novel was actually written as early as 1963 and rewritten two years later.) Phil was on some kind of a roll at this point in his career, having recently come out with the masterpieces \\"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\\" and \\"Dr. Bloodmoney,\\" and \\"Now Wait For Last Year\\" is still another great one for this important writer. In it, the Earth of the year 2055 is in big trouble, fighting a protracted, losing war with the 6-foot-tall, antlike reegs of Proxima Centauri while being harassed and bullied by its allies from Lilistar. Against this typically bleak Dickian backdrop, we meet Dr. Eric Sweetscent, an \\"artiforg\\" (artificial organ) transplant surgeon who leaves his cushy post at Tijuana Fur and Dye. Co. to minister to no less a personage than Gino Molinari, the hypochondriacal, psychosomatically ill U.N. Secretary General who is head of the Earth forces in Cheyenne, WY. Sweetscent's life is severely recomplicated when his estranged wife, Kathy, gets herself hooked on a new military weapon, a drug called JJ-180, which has the power to cause instant addiction and to induce time-travel effects in the user. And as if Eric's life weren't troubled enough, Kathy has just decided to get her husband hooked on the drug as well....I mentioned up top that \\"NWFLY\\" is a virtual compendium of Dick's themes and ideas, and as such, it would make a perfect introduction for any readers new to PKD. The subject of artiforgs had already been broached in Phil's \\"The Penultimate Truth,\\" which novel also featured Cheyenne as the U.N. capital. (For that matter, the subjects of 1920s cowboy star Tom Mix AND St. George, Utah, both strangely figure in the two novels.) As in so many of Dick's other books, the topic of divorce is spotlighted prominently here (the author was himself married five times, before his death at age 52), as is the issue of a world leader who is not what he seems (dealt with in depth in \\"The Simulacrum\\" and \\"The Penultimate Truth\\"), although here, that leader is not a mechanical construct, but something much more ingenious. As in \\"The Crack in Space,\\" the theme of alternate Earths with alternate futures is given an airing, as are Phil's ambivalent attitudes toward drugs (JJ-180 is seen as an abomination in this book, and Eric in one section ponders that anyone who addicts another \\"ought to be hanged or shot\\"); these attitudes would turn decidedly antidrug a decade later, in the author's \\"A Scanner Darkly.\\" The issue of suicide is again touched on (I've lost count of how many Dickian characters have had suicidal thoughts; Phil made a few attempts himself during his troubled life), but here, the author treats us to a wonderfully life-affirming resolution that caps his book off very sweetly. The novel, I should add, just brims with invention and ideas on virtually every page, be it the women's fashions (ebony teeth, toenails painted to depict the Norman Conquest, public toplessness with nipples gilded with a Martian life form!), Tijuana Fur and Dye owner Virgil Ackerman's Wash-35 outpost on Mars (an exact replica of a few square blocks of Washington, D.C., in 1935), the ingenious political intrigue or the truly disorienting, drug-induced time traveling. This is a novel that grows wilder and wilder as it proceeds; hold on tight and prepare to be stunned! Here we have Phil Dick operating at the near peak of his powers, and modern sci-fi really doesn't get too much better, loopier or heartfelt than that.\\"NWFLY,\\" still, is not a perfect book, and nitpicker that I am, I was able to discern some small problems. In the Martian Wash-35, for example, is a replica of the Uptown Theatre...which didn't open until 1936. And that McComb Street in \\"D.C.\\"? That should be \\"Macomb.\\" And when Kathy spots a 1932 Model A Ford during her JJ-180 trip...well, the Model A was discontinued in 1931; the Model B started in '32. And while I'm picking nits, just how DOES one cut a drug CAPSULE in thirds? OK, enough of that. Truth is, I really did love this wild collection of Philip K. Dick's pet preoccupations. \\"A daft and delightful yarn,\\" British critic David Pringle calls it in his \\"Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction,\\" and ain't it ever the truth! How I wish that some major studio would spend $200 million to lovingly bring THIS ONE to the big screen!"},{"Title":"Now Wait for Last Year","review":"How is it after 28 years and 30 books, I finally discover PKD's best novel? I have read the one's people say are his best, and I have loved every one I have read, from SOLAR LOTTERY to MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE and VALIS. But today I finished my 30th book I have read by him, and I am stunned how amazingly perfect it is compared to his other works. Have no doubt, I love PKD. I adore his crazy plots, awesome extrapolations, and wacky world view. I like his writing because he uses sci-fi for what it should be, for what makes it the best genre of fiction--he uses it to explore the human condition that cannot be done in any other way. This novel stands out because of the flaws in his other works. Again, keep in mind I love PKD partly because of the flaws. They add charm to his work. The silly names. The characters who talk like no one would ever talk in real life. The science that could never work. The unnecessary amount of side plots, digressions, and secondary characters. The crazy ideas he sticks in just because it came to him that day at the typewriter, not because it even works in the current novel he was writing. The unfinished endings that wrap up to quickly or wrap up too easily. His other novels are just raw and rough and uneven. What makes this novel stand out is that it is tight. Every character matters. Every plot line eventually has real meaning to the story he is telling, even down to the silly inventions in chapter one that just seem like a goof and the robot taxi drivers that just seem cliche. Every thematic meaning he draws from his characters, from marriage, to being a man, to being a leader, to understanding what it means to be human and what it means to be inhuman. It all just works. I have read almost all his sci-fi novels (over 20) and have only a few more to read (around 5), but as of this moment, I feel I have read the best thing with which PKD blessed his readers."},{"Title":"Now Wait for Last Year","review":"PKD's &quot;Now Wait for Last Year&quot; features the author's unparalleled inventiveness at less than its peak form. The novel's action unfolds on a mid 21st century Earth in which Terrans have allied with alien ancestors from the Alpha Centaurus world Lilistar to levy war against insectoid extraterrestrials called reegs. The war is waged partially through use of the drug JJ-180, which allows its ingestors to travel through time at the cost of unbreakable addiction and irreversible brain damage. While fighting in this conflict, the novel's protagonist, Dr. Eric Sweetscent, engages in a personal struggle against his self-destructive tendencies.Like a precocious toddler who completely devours one toy and impatiently grabs another, PKD introduces and discards ideas on nearly every page of the opening chapters of this book. A race of alien mimics supporting a synthetic fur industry, an apparently telepathic politician who communes through physical contact, &quot;babylands,&quot; exact replicas of a person's birthplace, a fad among the moneyed class, all ideas that might independently feature in their own novels but are abandoned after minimal treatment in &quot;Now Wait for Last Year.&quot; The plot deteriorates halfway through the book, and the latter chapters consist largely of Dr. Sweetscent traveling forward in time to query future selves about the outcome of his external and internal struggles.Although not as focused as his better novels, PKD's &quot;Now Wait for Last Year&quot; presents a vivid and detailed future that should interest most SF fans. As with all of his work, this book contains PKD's remarkable insight into human character and hopeful view of mankind's future, a view rendered quite powerful by his intimate familiarity with all of man's flaws and wrinkles, and his optimism despite these defects."},{"Title":"Now Wait for Last Year","review":"Of all the excellent works by PKD, this one is by far my favorite. In most of his novels, PKD takes time to describe how average people deal with non-average situations. However, in many of these novels, the primary focus is on the circumstances and their deeper meanings (particularly in his later works). In Now Wait for Last Year, the focus is more on the characters themselves- their needs, wants, dreams; their strengths and their weaknesses. The circumstances are merely a backdrop to sharpen this focus. PKD was never known for his character development, but in this novel it is important. The best part is that the novel reads well, with plenty of suspense and adventure."},{"Title":"Now Wait for Last Year","review":"I've read 15 of PKD's books and this is by far my favorite (followed closely by \\"Time Out of Joint,\\" \\"Ubik,\\" and \\"A Maze of Death.\\")As with most of PKD's books, \\"Now Wait For Last Year\\" is an entertaining ride - drugs that cause people to travel back and forth through time, a man who's built a detailed recreation of his hometown on an entirely different planet, a world ravaged by war and, of course, lots and lots of marital strife. And there's a unity to this novel that's lacking in a lot of the author's other works: his stories can jump from A to B to Z to F and you get the impression he didn't even make an outline half the time - \\"We Can Build You\\" is a good example of this - but this one seems to have been fully thought-out before PKD put pen to paper (or finger to typewriter key).There's also a touch of the sublime here. There's a chapter centered around leftover energy from a processing plant being funnelled into tiny mechanical carts. At first you think it's just a one-off idea PKD threw in there for entertainment's sake, but by the end of the novel, the idea of these carts turn out to be a really thoughtful meditation on what it means to be a human being. It might sound like I'm giving the text too much credit, but I'm not. It's emotionally affecting stuff, the kind of which I haven't seen in anything else PKD has done.Do yourself a favor and pick this one up."},{"Title":"Now Wait for Last Year","review":"Written in '63 (when Dick was arguably at the peak of his powers) and published in '66, Now Wait For Last Year has everything one could ever want in a PKD novel. All of the major \\"Dickian\\" themes are here, including the nature of reality, parallel universes, and what it means to be human. Because of this, it would be a good starting point for someone new to the world of Philip K. Dick, and for those who are already fans.The plot is so convoluted, in a good way, that it's next to impossible for me to try and attempt a plot summary, but the basic gist is this: There's an interstellar war going on between Earth, along with their allies, the humanoid \\"Starmen,\\" and the bug-like Reegs. The elected leader of Earth, Gino Molinari seems to have a psychosomatic illness that leaves him at various times on the verge of death. Dr. Eric Sweetscent, a surgeon and main protagonist of the story, is signed on to be Molinari's new 24/7 doctor. Meanwhile, Sweetscent's wife is addicted to a new drug called JJ-180, a massively addictive hallucinogen that appears to send the user back and forth through time uncontrollably.Got that? I didn't think so. But how these things are all tied together is an accomplishment only Dick would even attempt, let alone perfect as he does here. This is a perfect example of Dick's genius, and an under-appreciated classic that deserves more attention than it gets. This is definitely one of his most \\"far-out\\" novels, and it's sure to leave you slack-jawed and in awe for days after you've finished."},{"Title":"Now Wait for Last Year","review":"This one seldom gets a mention among Philip K. Dick's greats, like \\"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,\\" \\"Ubik,\\" \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" and \\"The Man in the High Castle\\". With all due respect to those classics, it's a sin and a shame. This novel should be welcomed into that august company, and without delay.On the other hand, perhaps \\"Now Wait for Last Year\\" flew under the radar because the story is really so ordinary. You can wrap up the basic plot in a very few words; a doctor, in a bad marriage made worse by addiction, grows into a genuinely good man by means of the hardship thrown in his way by a high-pressure government job during wartime. Sort of a combination of \\"The Days of Wine and Roses\\" and \\"Dr. Zhivago\\". With poisonous addictive drugs and time travel thrown in.I can't think of any other author who postulated time travel by chemical means - that is, the idea that certain drugs might affect actual reality, not just your sense of reality. Take JJ-180 in the world of \\"Last Year\\" and you find yourself in the actual past or future. Of course, then you come down, come back, and die in great pain a few months later if you don't take it again. If you do take it again, you die of irreversible neurological damage in a year or so.Now, here's what makes this one of PKD's great novels; like the ones mentioned above and a few others, this time the author found a way to unite his multiple plot strands into a cohesive story. In this book, humanity develops JJ-180 as a weapon against the insectoid reegs. Our ostensible allies, the humanoids of the Lilistar Empire, make use of the drug against certain humans to keep Earth in the war on their side. One of their victims is Karen Sweetscent, who hooks her husband Eric to force his help in getting her off the stuff. (Or maybe just out of spite - PKD was a trifle peeved at women during these years.)The Sweetscents are one of PKD's typical couples of this period in his work - they can't stand each other but can't let go, either - and the whole thing is complicated by the fact that Eric Sweetscent has recently become personal physician to the ruler of Earth, Gino Molinari. In short, here is a war between various galactic species and a war between a man and a woman; each conflict comments on the other, and JJ-180 emerges as a weapon in both.Eric, the linchpin of all this hoo-ha, must decide where his loyalties lie. The question is all the more pressing because the fate of the Earth may depend upon his answer, by means of his relationship with Molinari, also known as \\"The Mole\\". And he doesn't have much time for necessary reflection, because the Mole is not normal either mentally or physically. He's desperately ill with any number of complaints, many of which ought to be fatal, but he keeps on surviving. This is obviously a man of enormous power even when sick.And the most astonishing thing about him isn't even his ability to overcome cancer, renal failure, heart attack and God knows what. It's the way in which he uses his illness to avoid the destruction of Earth. The sicker he gets, the less he can administer his government, and the less he can subordinate humanity to the destructive Lilistar Empire. Like many of his people, he comes to realize that allying himself with the so-called 'Starmen was a serious error, and so his disease allows him to accept responsibility and pay for his mistakes both at the same time. This is not your typical Christ figure - he's a fat, middle aged, peevish, desperately sick, brilliant political strategist. The Moral Majority will burn this thing in a heartbeat if they ever bother to read it. Which they won't.Anyway, whatever else may be true, this is a war story like none you've ever seen before, complete with chemical and biological weapons like none you've ever seen before, both of which operate best when turned upon ourselves, not the enemy. And we haven't even gone into the time travel aspects yet. Why, you may ask, would anyone come up with a weapon that literally sends the enemy back in time temporarily?Oh, no you don't. You're going to have to read the book to learn that little detail. Suffice to say that the time-travel character of JJ-180 lies at the heart of the Mole's power, as well as his illness, and therefore at the heart of Eric Sweetscent's journey into his own character. And there you have the brilliance of PKD and of \\"Now Wait for Last Year\\" - everything connects and becomes richer by its contact with everything else. Sometimes this produces paranoia, in life and in PKD's work. At other times, again in both places, it produces some kind of spiritual breakthrough.So I invite you to follow Eric Sweetscent as his life spirals out of control, first in his marriage, then in his employment, then in his ability to stay in one place at one time. The last chapter is particularly worthwhile, an early example of PKD's trademark emotional conclusions in which his protagonist wanders through the lonely city wondering whether it's even worth going on, and finds inspiration in watching a simple (and in this case artificial) form of life just doing the best it can. When someone blesses Sweetscent as a good man at the end, you know it's true.Besides, what could be bad about a novel that starts off in a building shaped like an apteryx? No one but PKD would think of that.Benshlomo says, The road to enlightenment has never been easy."},{"Title":"Now Wait for Last Year","review":"This book belongs very much in the mainstream of Dick's work. It has his typical emphasis on drugs, power structures, artificial people, alternate realities, and time discontinuities. What distinguishes it from many of his other works is the portrayed relationship between Dr. Sweetscent and his wife Kathy, one of conflicted love/hate and dominance games, a portrayal that is much more realistic than many such within the SF field, and which provides an underlying tension to the book well beyond its ostensible main plot of trying to save the Earth from the war between the \`Starlings and the reeqs.The drug in question is JJ-80, which not only is highly addictive after just one use, but makes the user actually travel in time. Regardless of the scientific implausibility of this, Dick handles the problem of time travel well, postulating that most such travelers end up causing parallel time tracks/universes, and neatly tying this concept in with using people from one universe as replacements for some in the viewpoint universe. Then Dick adds \`robants', artificial people, to the mix, which leads to his typical confusion of just who is who (or what), along with questions about the ultimate nature of reality.Dick's prose is quite utilitarian here, but it does get the job done. There are some odd lapses in both portrayals of some characters (mainly the Mole, ruler of the Earth) and in the underlying motives for some of the \`Starlings actions. And it suffers from a typical failing of SF books of this period, that of the single average man as world saver, which makes the already difficult suspension of disbelief even harder. Still, it's more coherent than many of his books, though it's certainly not up to the level of excellence of his Man In The High Castle.A must for Dick fans, worth reading by the casual SF fan.-- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Now Wait for Last Year","review":"\\"Now Wait for Last Year\\" (1966) is a novel that reveals a future where Earth has been caught in the war between Starmen and the reegs, and it is loaded with a large cast of characters. Primary, it is a story of an organ-transplant doctor, Eric Sweetscent, who have been caught in the politics and eventually became the supreme elected leader's doctor. And, add to this story, there is a drug called JJ-180, which render the user to become so addicted and the side-effect of this drug will force the person to move through time (to the past or future, or even \\"sideways\\"). The plot of this novel is so twisted and flips like a hot coin to the point that the reader is unaware of what the story's going.While one is reading this book, many of Philip Dick's popular themes are evident (drugs, political suspicions, alternate realities, etc.). This novel also can compel us to be doubtful of the truths in myself and of what we see. We can never be sure of anything. It's very interesting to read about a drug's side-effect involves altering of one's time perceptions, even sends one through time.Personally, I found this novel to be one of the classics and rather unsettling read. It's a good novel of its time."},{"Title":"Now Wait for Last Year","review":"It's difficult to leave one's personal problems out of one's professional life and vice versa. In this book we see how one regular guy, Dr. Eric Sweetscent, deals with mounting pressure in both aspects of his life. More importantly, we see how Eric handles the enormous responsibility of being given a chance to influence the lives of billions of people. How many people can deal with knowing what's really going on in the world?Eric is stuck in a loveless marriage with Kathy which has devolved into a struggle of who can hurt whom the most. They seem to be the epitome of the saying \\"there's a thin line between love and hate\\". It's the year 2055 and Eric works as a surgeon who transplants artificial organs into people, specifically working for Virgil Ackerman, the head of the company Tijuana Fur & Dye. Kathy works for the same company as a procurer of artifacts from the 1930s. Kathy also experiments with drugs and gets hooked on a new drug called JJ-180 which seemingly transports the user to another time.Can someone change the future? Science fiction writers over the years have developed various ideas surrounding time travel and Dick's approach is rather interesting. Some people on the drug travel back in time while others travel forward. All this places a crucial part to the story and is involved in its many twists.In the bigger picture, Earth is ruled under one government by U.N. Secretary Gino Molinari. Through Virgil, Eric meets Gino and becomes employed by him. Gino is an interesting character full of contradictions. He's in rather poor health, but remains somehow impressive to the people. The people need a strong leader because they've been drawn into a war between two interplanetary powers - Lilistar and the reegs. Signing a pact with Lilistar, the humans are forced to fight in the war and things aren't going well. Working with Gino, Eric learns more about the war and what's really going on than most people would.Eric is a rather insecure person who can be indecisive at times. It's easy to empathize with him because he has so many flaws, he isn't one of those perfect heroes. When circumstances provide him with the ability to strongly influence both his wife's life and the outcome of the war, it's interesting to see how he handles it."},{"Title":"Now Wait for Last Year","review":"Dr. Eric Sweetscent's love/hate relationship with his wife is the focus of this bizarre tale of drugs, time travel, interplanetary war, and alternate realities. After a single exposure, Sweetscent's wife Katharine has become helplessly addicted to a little-known drug called JJ-180, which has time-warping properties. She purposely addicts the good doctor (her husband) in order to obtain his help. Eric's fight for survival leads him through a pharmaceutical company to the world government itself, where UN Secretary General Gino Molinari is using the reality-warping powers of JJ-180 to ward off an alien invasion. Can Eric conquer his addiction, save his wife, and fend off the alien overlords? Longtime readers of Dick's work can probably guess the answer.Even with all the dangers and plot twists in this story, it's still basically an allegory about power. JJ-180 gives its users power over others, and the power to control events far beyond themselves. Katharine uses the drug's power to control her husband, even at the risk of killing him. Facing death, Eric uses his power to control others, but stops short of controlling his own wife. The moral is aptly summed up by the cabdriver at the book's conclusion: for Eric to take some critical step \\"would be to say, I can't endure reality as such. I have to have uniquely special easier conditions\\". A former drug addict himself, Dick is telling us that reality has to be enough for all of us, even when the going gets rough. We shouldn't need to have anything \\"uniquely special\\" just to make life worth living. A must for fans of PDK; for others who aren't put off by science fiction and Dick's quirky storytelling style, a sad and moving tale of love and reality."},{"Title":"Now Wait for Last Year","review":"'Now Wait for Last Year' is a formulaic Philip K. Dick novel involving time-travel, space travel, altered realities and unusual shenanigans all wrapped into a story which takes a slap at today's society. As with most Dick novels, this novel doesn't quite hang together. But it sure is a fun ride.As for the story itself, it takes place on Earth in the mid-21st century. Humans have joined forces with a alien species to fight another alien species. A deadly drug was developed as a means of chemical warfare. This drug is instantly addictive and ultimately fatal. It transports its victims into a time-altered reality, a journey into either the past or the future. But is this journey only in the mind?? Hmmm, ... read the book to find out. But be forewarned the story gets quite complex. Just think of the movie 'Back to the Future'; it's 100 times more complex.Bottom line: classic Philip K. Dick. However folks new to Philip K. Dick might want to start on one of his more straightforward (and more popular) works such as 'Ubik' or 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'."},{"Title":"Now Wait for Last Year","review":"To me, this almost reads like a 252-page suicide note ... certainly it deals with feelings of self-loathing and his decision to commit his third wife for psychiatric treatment and drug therapy. It's not happy, but as usual it's incredibly vivid and incredibly imaginative. If you choose to go with the central conceit (a drug which transports users through time and into alternate realities), it's an extremely wild ride. Best of all, it's got Dick's usual insights into and ruminations on human nature."},{"Title":"Now Wait for Last Year","review":"As the name suggests, this deals with time travel, sort of. PDK leaves it up in the air as to whether time travel is truly possible by suggesting that perhaps other time streams would be other parallel universes. Toss into this a bit of Xenophobia, marital strife and the drive of personal responsibility and you have a lot going on in 230 pages.I am reading all the PDK novels, one a month. I am 10 months in to this three year trek. It seems, after 10 books, that PKD has an adjustment period. In the first few books I read he annoyed me. Now I'm into a groove.One note, it's interesting to see the concepts in this book played out in the longer and different works by other writers like Orson Scott Card. There's more than a smidgeon of this in the Ender series."},{"Title":"Great contemporaries","review":"Although Winston Churchill is remember best as a statesman (and in my mind the greatest man of the 20th Century), he made his living through his pen. Churchill though of aristocratic background, was not extremely wealthy. While he could have survived on the family fortune, his expensive tastes and zest for living would have bankrupted him. So he turned to writing to earn his living.Great Contemporaries is a series of essays written between 1929 and 1937 on the \\"great\\" leaders of the day. Churchill knew many of these leaders personally, and is able to supplement what might otherwise be a dry recitation of the facts of a career with personal stories and vignettes.Perhaps the most famous of the essays is on \\"Hitler and his Choice, 1935.\\" This essay is often cited by neo-Nazis and far leftists as proof that Churchill actually admired Hitler. But finally getting the chance to read the essay shows that any such analysis takes Churchill's words extremely out of context. Hitler was to be Churchill's great antagonist in the coming decade. In 1935, Churchill recognized that Hitler was facing a choice - would Hitler take a moderate road and perhaps be remembered as the leader who restored German honor, or who Hitler take the road of war. Churchill ends the essay with a warning, that German rearmament was continuing, and, of course, tragically, Churchill's misgivings were played out.One problem, with this book is that many of the \\"great\\" men described are almost forgotten today, at least outside their home countries. Men like the Earl of Rosebery (Prime Minister in the 1890s) or King Alfosno XIII of Spain probably make no impression on the American reader while George Curzon is remembered, if at all, as the man who roughly proposed the border between Poland and the Soviet Union (the \\"Curzon Line\\").The book includes essays on well-remembered men such as George Bernard Shaw, Clemenceau and Churchill's prot&eacute;g&eacute; T.E. Lawrence (better known as \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\"). These essays, full of personal remembrances by Churchill, are well worth the time."},{"Title":"Great contemporaries","review":"There is very little about Sir Churchill that can be considered routine, average, or some standard he can be compared to. Everything he did was generally on a scale that helped to create the Legend he has become, and that he will remain. Even when he erred, it generally was not minor, however rare, but on balance we do not, nor will we have his kind again. He loved his Country, and he loved the US, for he was 50% American, so that even in Washington D.C. today, a statue of him striding forward has one foot on British, and one on American soil.His life was long, stretching past the 90-year mark, allowing him ample time to write and give speeches, which are routinely quoted to this day. He was a master at both disciplines, with his writing awarded the Nobel Prize For Literature in 1953.\\"Great Contemporaries\\" is a book that is more about the men and women he knew than about the Author. He is evident throughout the read, as the impressions of these people of History are his. The 21 profiles he shares with the reader are incredible in their range, and that they were his \\"contemporaries\\" is one testament to the History he created and was a part of.Contemporary people of fame are often identifiable by a first or last name alone. However as we live in an age where you can chat in real time across the planet, fame does not require the same level of notoriety. The fame is of a different character and caliber.The Kaiser, Shaw, Chamberlein, Hindenburg, Foch, Trotsky, these are only a fraction of the essays this man of history will share. Too, there is Lawrence of Arabia who requires a bit more than a last name, but it is not do to his renown, rather the generic nature of the end of his sobriquet.These reminiscences are different than those of today's leaders, there was very little distance between these people, they often met alone, and they did not bring an array of lackeys, translators, and gadflies.A tremendous sweep of one man's impressions of people whose actions resonate to this day, and in all likelihood will not cease."},{"Title":"Great contemporaries","review":"Consider this passage, about the political climate in Britain before World War One:\\"At the time, conflict unceasing grew year by year to a more dangerous intensity at home, while abroad there gathered sullenlythe hurricane that was to wreck our generation. Our days were spent in the furious party battles..., while always upon the horizon deadly shapes grew or faded, and even while the sun shone there was a curious whisper in the air.\\"Who could the author of such Churchillian lines be but Winston Churchill himself? The stately but rarely stentorian pacing and tone, imitations of which are rarely successful, still impresses upon the reader the power and beauty of the English language.These biographical essays, written while Churchill was in political exile in the Thirties, were collected in book at the end of that decade. His majestically simple (or simply majestic) writing brings long-gone controversies and personalities back to life, if unavoidably suffused with the aura of the author's own personality.Some notables that would seem to have been natural subjects for this book are missing: Gandhi, Lloyd George, Edward VII. But an American reader only passingly acquainted with the luminaries of early 20th century Britain would be interested in Churchill's memories of the First Earl of Birkenhead, Herbert Henry Asquith, and George Nathanael Curzon. The pieces are light on biographical detail and heavy on evaluation, but Churchill's estimation of most of these people is generous. He dismisses George Bernard Shaw as a jester, gallantly defends the ex-Kaiser from the worst of the late war-time propaganda, and warns of the rising influence of Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler. The reader is also reminded from time to time that Churchill was indeed a politician, as in the essay on Lord Fisher, in which he deflects blame for some WWI naval setbacks onto that gentleman.Excepting Walpole, probably no statesman's collected bread and butter writing has ever been so memorable, or made for such good reading."},{"Title":"Great contemporaries","review":"Churchill's \\"Great Contemporaries\\" was originally published by Thornton Butterworth in 1937 with twenty-one essays on \\"Great Men of our age,\\" all of which had earlier appeared in newspapers or magazines. The book appeared in a revised edition in 1938 from the same publisher with four additional essays, including an essay on \\"Roosevelt from Afar\\"--the book's only essay about an American. In 1942, with Britain allied in war with Soviet Russia and the United States, \\"Great Contemporaries\\" was reprinted without the Roosevelt essay and without the essays on Boris Savinkov and Leon Trotsky; in this wartime edition the essay on George Bernard Shaw was abridged by omitting the account of the trip Shaw took to the Soviet Union with Lady Astor. Unfortunately the Simon Publications edition reproduces this truncated 1942 edition, which lacks these three essays and part of the fourth. Readers who wish to read the entire book must therefore find an edition based on the 1938 edition with all twenty-five essays. A complete edition of the book with a new introduction, explanatory notes, and additional essays by Churchill, edited by the author of this review with Paul H. Courtenay and Erica L. Chenoweth (ISBN 1935191993), was published by ISI Books in June 2012 as a companion volume to the new edition of Churchill's \\"Thoughts and Adventures\\" published by ISI Books in 2009."},{"Title":"Great contemporaries","review":"Having read many of Churchill's books, it never ceases to amaze me how he captured the english language. Reading these essays, written in 1932 is a treat for any history buff or student of literature and or the english language. This book describes the accomplishments of various personalities that he was exposed to during his life. For the most part, he is positive, but you will enjoy his short essay describing Hitler, again, remember this was written in 1932."},{"Title":"Great contemporaries","review":"Published in 1937, this book includes 22 biographical sketches of notable persons, mainly British and mainly involved in politics and government. Almost all of them belong to Churchill's preceding generation or to his own, and with one or two exceptions, he knew all of them personally. These are intimate impressions of the author revealing the secret and dangerous mechanisms of the European scene during the First World War and its aftermath. Parliamentary life, the great political debates, and the intricate geostrategic dilemmas of the worldwide chess, are all reflected from the privilieged position of a crucial observer and player.Figures like the Count of Rosebery, Joseph Chamberlain, John Morley, Asquith, Birkenhead, Balfour, Curzon, Snowden, or Parnell, suffuse life into the Great Britain of the first third of the XXth Century, with the constant musical chairs between Conservative and Liberals, as well as the definitive demise of the latter and the rise of Labour. Inevitably, several military people are central characters, war having been the predominant phenomenon of that age: Sir John French and his stoicism in the face of the initial debacle of the IWW; Hindenburg, his rise and fall; Lawrence of Arabia, perhaps the most eccentric in a gallery of eccentrics; Foch and his final triumph; Haig and the comeback in IWW. Also memorable are the favorable portrait he paints of King George V, as well as sketches of other European leaders such as Alfonso XIII, well-meaning but frivolous and detached; the fierce and coherent Clemenceau; and, as a real rarity, Hitler, to whom Churchill concedes, reluctantly, the benefit of doubt, although he sounds convinced that it will all end in disaster. G.B. Shaw is the only figure from the artistic world, sympathetically included.In this relatively early book, Churchil's literary qualities already shine: his acute but balanced judgment, and the remarkable depth of perception which characterized him. He struggles to show both virtues and vices of his subjects, including the least presentable, like Hitler and the Kaiser. It is a valuable document of history."},{"Title":"The World of Jazz: In Printed Ephemera and Collectibles","review":"The history of jazz and its sociocultural battles within U.S. culture are portrayed in this spectacular collection of documents, photos, newspaper clippings, concert announcements, album covers, advertisements, jazz magazines, and other &quot;ephemera&quot; of the last 100 years or so. The book's extraordinary photos and well-researched narrative give a fond but unsentimental portrait of jazz history; of brilliant music played against a backdrop of hardship and white expropriation.The book is a delight: A museum of rare and evocative materials from turn of the century Storyville, New Orleans (the oldest picture is of jazz legend Buddy Bolden's Band circa 1894) up to around 1990 (with posters of recent movies like &quot;Bird&quot; and &quot;Round Midnight&quot;); however, the bulk of the collection is from the early New Orleans days through bebop. We see the very young Louis Armstrong in the &quot;Colored Waif's Home&quot; brass band, and later with his &quot;Hot Five&quot; group in 1925, and then a racist ad for Armstrong's OKEH recording of &quot;St. James Infirmary.&quot; Numerous pictures of jazz in Europe, featuring two Django Reinhardt album covers, a &quot;Jazz Illustrated&quot; article about a 1949 Paris concert with Sidney Bechet, Charlie Parker, Tad Dameron, and &quot;Hot Lips&quot; page (all of whom were subject at the time to a British protectionist ban on foreign musicians), and numerous memorabilia of British jazz bands. (There's a disproportionate amount of material on English jazz; the book was originally published in London).Bunk Johnson is featured on the cover of &quot;The Jazz Record,&quot; hailed as a &quot;the last important link between the present [the 1940's] and the fabulous Buddy Bolden . . .&quot; Superb pictures (but too few) from the bebop and post-bebop periods, including the young Dizzy Gillespie, a close-up of Monk, and album covers for Bird. There's also a ticket from the &quot;Jazz at the Philharmonic&quot; series and an English &quot;programme&quot; for an Ellington concert, but only a two page section on &quot;Women in Jazz,&quot; featuring photos and albums of vocalists Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington, Bessie Smith and Ella Fitzgerald.The book has its problems. As mentioned previously, there is far too much emphasis on British jazz, the books devotes almost an equal number of pages to &quot;Jazz Consolidates in Britain&quot; as it does to the Swing Era. The boppers, the Cotton Club, Miles, etc. are also not well-represented; this is not a history of jazz. But, overall, this is an eye-catching assortment of &quot;printed ephemera and collectibles.&quot; With a special section on &quot;jazz in print&quot; (a guide to jazz magazines), jazz-related literature, ephemera collections (e.g., the Louisiana State Museum), a bibliography, and index. Though neither thorough nor balanced, this is an exciting book, and is a valuable resource for students of jazz and culture. Highly recommended, and definitely worth looking for!!"},{"Title":"The World of Jazz: In Printed Ephemera and Collectibles","review":"This book has a unique perspective on jazz for an American.Instead of Josephine Baker and the French exile, we have Chet Bakerin a nearly unknown jazz movie.

But the one you must get---if you can---is the 'St. Martin's Press' edition of 1990 which goes by the ISBN number 0672515237. It is a gorgeous little facsimile edition of one of the best of the first editions. Nothing can compare to the charm of this beautiful hardcover with it's colored endpapers and high-quality paper. It's not just the original illustrations that are so wonderful, but even the original typeface, dustcovers, and embossed boards. The whole nine yards. It's better than having a real first edition (which would cost a fortune), because you can give this one to a child to enjoy, or even toss it into your beach bag. A matching edition of the sequel, Through the Looking Glass, was also available under ISBN 0312803745, but I think there are none left of it now."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"If you were the kind of child who always asked the \\"why?\\" question, and who liked to challenge what everyone else regarded as normal, you'll love this book. In \\"Wonderland\\", Lewis Carroll questions everything about life that is normal, and gives us a picture of a world where everything that we accept as normal is turned upside down. With Alice, you'll fall into a rabbit hole and enter an imaginary and wacky world where nothing is at it seems. Here's a small taste:\\"By-the-bye, what became of the baby?\\" said the Cat. \\"I'd nearly forgotten to ask.\\"\\"It turned into a pig,' Alice answered very quietly, just as if the Cat had come back in a natural way.\\"I thought it would,\\" said the Cat, and vanished again.And another quote:\\"...they drew all manner of things - everything that begins with an M -\\"\\"Why with an M?\\" said Alice.\\"Why not?\\" said the March Hare.If you find this kind of maddening surreal world even remotely attractive, then you're sure to love Alice's \\"Wonderland\\". You'll be amazed by the cat-less grin of the Cheshire-Cat, amused by the absurd logic of the mad Hatter, and in hysterics over the antics of the murderous Queen of Hearts with her constant refrain of \\"Off with his head.\\" \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is full to the brim with wild humour, farcical fantasy, witty wisecracks, and slapstick comedy. What I especially enjoyed were the abundance of delightful puns, paradoxes, and parodies. Much of the deeper significance will escape young children, but they will enjoy it as a fantastic story, and rediscover it with even greater pleasure as adults. A \\"classic\\" is a book that appeals to people of all times and ages, and that's certainly the case with \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\"Is \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" all nonsense? I don't think so. Behind the outer layer of nonsense Carroll conveys a great deal of sense. He allows you to return to reality with a renewed appreciation for everything that is normal and accepted. Yet this fantasy world is at the same time so nonsensical and enjoyable, that you'll want to return there many a time.

Of course she was chasing the white rabbit in the waistcoat. The world she fell into was a wonderland of non-sense. I found no mention of the twin boys that have graced many of the other tales and movies about wonderland which I was sort of disappointed about. I did find one part that has largely been omitted from recent works. It was when Alice made her way to the Duchesses house. A frog in a uniform, which was an oddity to Alice in its self, guarded the home but she ventured further and found upon entry into the Duchesses house it was filled to the brim with pepper. The cook of the house was randomly throwing pots and pans at everything and everyone. Curiously the Duchess sat in the middle of the violent cook and the cloud of pepper nursing a baby that she thrust to Alice to care for. Funny part was when Alice gazed at the baby at first she could not decided if it was a human baby or a pig. She abruptly decided it was a pig and let it run off into the woods while she continued on her adventure.

At the bottom, she finds herself in a room with a tiny door and a bottle labeled \\"drink me.\\" She grows and shrinks depending on what she eats and drinks, and as a small version of herself, finds herself swimming in a pool of tears. Swimming to shore, Alice and some other creatures decide that \\"'the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race'\\" (26). Alice continues to chase the White Rabbit and the White Rabbit sends her into his house for his fan and gloves. Once in the house, Alice gets into more trouble with an unlabeled bottle, quickly growing too big to move. The White Rabbit and Bill the Lizard try to get her out, and Alice only escapes by eating some small cakes. She runs into the woods and meets a hookah-smoking Caterpillar, who gives her some advice on ways to grow bigger and smaller. Next, she stops at the house of the Duchess with a pig for a baby; the pig escapes, and Alice asks the Cheshire Cat for help. Directed on to the March Hare's house, Alice takes part in the Mad Tea Party, perhaps the most famous scene in the book. Alice moves on to the Queen's croquet ground, where she encounters the Queen of Hearts and tries to play croquet with a flamingo and a hedgehog. Next, Alice encounters a Mock Turtle and a Gryphon, who tell her the story of the lobster quadrille. The book closes with a trial on the case of the stolen tarts, as the Queen accuses the Knave of Hearts.

But what makes a book a good book? It's the describtion of all the surroundings, like how the weather was, what temper the figures have, all the nonrelevant things you want to know. You can't find them in this book.

It's a very fun book to read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Unfortunately, this free Kindle edition of \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" does not reproduce the original's stylistic usage of typography. A particularly glaring example is the Mouse's tale. In the original, this poem is rendered in a series of indented lines of dwindling point size, curling to and fro across the page in the shape of a mouse tail. In this free Kindle edition, the Mouse's tale is flattened into a single paragraph, not even indented like a poem. Furthermore, this edition leaves out the prefaratory poem entirely.Unpleasantly, this edition also uses ASCII typography throughout: \\"straight quotes\\" instead of curly quotes, em dashes rendered as a pair of hyphens (--), and so forth.Read this book in a better edition, like the far superiorThe Complete Alice in Wonderland (Kindle Master Editions), which unlike this edition, is complete, includes both Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, illustrations (by Tenniel, Holliday, and Carroll), and annotations. (The Kindle Master Edition also does not reproduce the typographical tricks to render the Mouse's tale as a tail, though it does at least format it decently like a poem.)For a less portable version with full typographic fidelity, plus outstanding annotations explaining details of Victorian manners and culture parodied within the Alice books, I heartily recommendThe Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"While this is generally considered a &quot;children's book&quot;, Alice In Wonderland can only be fully appreciated by adults or teenagers. It contains so many private jokes, grammar puns, and other such stuff that a child would not understand it, really. I first read it when I was in first grade, a rather hard book really for first graders, and loved it incredibly. But rereading every year of my life since then (I am now fifteen) one finally can truly relish the great puns and imaginative ideas that Carroll (or Dodgson, his real name) placed within this extremely random book. Yes, there really isn't much of a single plot. It jumps from place to place. Just like a real dream. I don't understand why some people think that this is &quot;scary&quot; for little children though. C'mon, the Wizard of Oz and Mother Goose Nursery Rhymes (when the bough breaks, the cradle will fall- if little children aren't afraid of THAT, I don't what would scare them) is more frightening than this beautifully-crafted story. Note that the Queen of Hearts, though she has an insatiable urge to decapitate every person she sees, never really kills anyone- the Griffin says so. It's not frightening, rather, it's full of what little children like- randomness, smiling cats, violent-tempered queens, talking rabbits, and imaginary animals. If one is discovering this book for the first time, let it enchant you. If you are re-discovering this book, find in it the things you couldn't find before. If you are simply re-reading it for the fiftieth time (like me), then enjoy every single moment of it. It really is one of the best books I have read, right up there with- dare I say it- Colour Purple and Les Miserables. Yes, even Les Miserables."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is an unabridged audiobook production of Lewis Carroll's classic children's storybook of a young girl lost in a magical land of fantasy. Read aloud by Grammy and Audie Award-winning performer Jim Dale, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a delightful performance that adroitly captures this whimsical spirit of the story. Highly recommended as a giftbook to listeners of all ages, as well as for public library audiobook collections. 3 CDs, 2 hours 57 minutes."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The book is delightful, but I'm not talking about the story of Lewis Carrol itself. I'm talking, literally about the book -- its size, texture of pages, color of endpapers, texture of dustcover, that it has a built-in silky bookmark and so on. (This is one book in which it is the right thing to do to judge a book by its cover.) I'm also referring to the extra material, though. First are the illustrations which are really cool. Then there is plenty of commentary on the illustrations. There is also commentary on the Author, Illustrator, Foreward writer and even commentary on the typography of the book. Finally, the Foreward is amazing. I don't know if I agree with all that the Foreward writer says, but that Foreward sure helps to build your vocabulary. I've had six philosophy courses and I still had to look up dozens of words in the Foreward. Really advanced, arcane or even never-heard-of words -- why?, beats me. You would need a Ph.D. in literature to know all the words without a dictionary. So whether you're an adult wanting to increase your vocabulary or you want to buy a nice little book that is a delight itself in its physical being as a book, this is the Alice to buy."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Young Alice has never been a patient child. Therefore, as she is sitting along the riverbank, listening to her sister drone on and on as she reads passages from a slightly boring book, Alice begins to find her mind wandering. After all, this particular book has no pictures to capture the eye. Alice begins thinking about doing something else, making a daisy chain, or climbing a tree, but she's too lazy to leave her comfortable spot. So, as she gazes about her, she finds herself drifting off to sleep, and soon she has spotted a White Rabbit dressed in fancy garb. She begins chasing the elusive rabbit, but quickly finds herself falling down a very deep rabbit hole that she had not seen previously. Alice is frightened as she tumbles down and down, but soon finds herself in a new world. A world not filled with dirt and daisies, but, rather filled with long hallways, and houses that are smaller than Alice herself. Soon, Alice begins encountering characters of all shapes and sizes. To the confusing Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum, to the riddle-loving, smiling kitty known as the Cheshire Cat; all the way to the delightfully zany Mad Hatter who loves throwing tea-parties, and the vicious Queen of Hearts. But, as Alice continues wandering through this wondrous world of magic, where animals talk and dance, and even dress in fancy clothes, she begins to wonder how on earth she will ever find a way out of this backwards environment, and back to her sister, sitting upon the riverbank. For even though lazing about on the riverbank can be incredibly boring, sometimes it is preferred when your life is in danger by an evil ruler.I do not have to tell you how much I adore the tale of ALICE IN WONDERLAND. Since I was a young child I have been enamored by Alice's adventures to Wonderland, where she met an array of lovable characters who made you question the sanity of this backwards place, and the people who reside there. From the film to the pop-up books, and everything in between - Alice has been something I have cherished. Therefore, when I stumbled upon Alison Jay's newest edition of ALICE IN WONDERLAND, I could not pass up the opportunity to call it my own. The perfect thing about this edition is that the font is quite large, which makes it easier for younger readers to enjoy the tales of Alice on their own. The second thing I adore about this edition, of course, are the illustrations. Alison Jay is a magnificent artist who has laced almost every page with full-color illustrations of Alice and the various people and things she encounters during her trip to Wonderland. From the intelligent Caterpillar, to the delicious pink-frosting covered cupcakes she shares with the Mad Hatter at his tea party; and the delightful, yet strange game of flamingo and hedgehog croquet played with the Queen of Hearts, to Alice's trial with the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle. Each and every illustration is enjoyable to look at, and truly brings Lewis Carroll's words to life. A colorful new ALICE IN WONDERLAND edition, that puts a new spin on the timeless tale.Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is my preferred copy of AAIW, and I have several. The quality of the illustrations is superior, because they were made from recently excavated printing blocks. The result is they reveal greater detail than I had seen before, leaving me more impressed than ever with John Tenniel's talent--as if Lewis Carroll's wasn't enough. A beautiful, beautiful book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The BLTC Kindle edition is an EXCELLENT choice - 5 stars. 5 stars is also for the original book. The free Kindle edition is a VERY POOR choice. I sampled many Alice in Wonderland and all the Through the Looking Glass books I could find available (at Amazon and Gutenberg org - though today I discover some I missed). I believe I found that the best available editions, if you want both, are:The BLTC at 1.79Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (BLTC Press Edition)- this edition is very well formatted with all the Tenniel illustrations that I recall and is the one I purchased myself.The Bompacrazy at .99Alice in Wonderland (Illustrated)orAlice's Adventures in Wonderland (Illustrated)(these two appear to be exactly the same from the samples as both have the 'blotted out' picture of the Drink Me tag): this is almost as good a choice, though not quite as well formatted. The sample has a Rackham illustration (and there may be more) as well as the many Tenniel, though, which is a plus.The free Gutenberg org versions - lacked the improved linking and formatting, but there are various illustrated editions; may be worth it to you if .99 is too much or you are looking for something other than Tenniel.I did see a kindle version of an 'Original First Edition' Alice which appears to be illustrated by Arthur Rackham - in case you are looking for that one instead of the better known John Tenniel version.Alice In Wonderland - Original First Edition Version Published For Kindle - Lewis CarrollThat edition has no Tenniel illustrations in the sample; also the text seems to be abridged (or just maybe an earlier version?) and the formatting is poor. Note that the picture of Alice looking at the Cheshire Cat in a tree that appears on this linked product page is not the cover that appears on the downloaded sample; the cover that does appear is of Alice walking with the Duchess and looks like this kindle book:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass- now for more typical Amazon mis-linked craziness, this latter edition has Tenniel illustrations, but beware that they are very small thumbnails and enlarge to very poor quality. I do not recommend either of these editions. The Rackham is available at Gutenberg for free.Today I discovered the Master EditionThe Complete Alice in Wonderland (Kindle Master Editions)which I missed before (likely because I was concentrating on Through the Looking Glass, which has far fewer editions, and then pursuing the 'matching' Alice in Wonderlands). Today the price is .89 and I am going to buy it. It is at least as well formatted as the BLTC (based on the sample) and has even more Alice writings (beyond Wonderland and Looking Glass) as well as essays and historical info and other 'add-ons'. He has all the illustrations from Tenniel and additional ones from Holliday and Carroll (I think he should add Rackham's, too).As many others have said, the basic Kindle edition is a very poor choice, and most others also lack the illustrations. Thank goodness for samples.Re Through the Looking Glass, it was the chess board appearing in the BLTC sample (and not in the BompaCrazy sample) that finalized my choice in their favor (before finding the Master). Here are the BLTC and BompaCrazy links:Through the Looking Glass- BLTCThrough the Looking Glass (Illustrated)- BompaCrazyI hope this review helps you find your best choice far more quickly than I did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"While the tale is the same as all other volumes of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the illustrations by Yayoi Kusama make it unusual and more beautiful than can be imagined.

The Kindle edition however is a different matter. There are NO ILLUSTRATIONS as in the hardcopy versions of this book.

Or do we?This is definitely not Disney's Alice in Wonderland or Tim Burton's wickedly awesome version of the tale. This is it... the real deal.I've been meaning to read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland for a few years now (you'd think I would've read it as a child, but nope, back then I was into Stephen King haha) and I chose this edition in particular because I fell in love with Camille Rose Garcia's illustrations. With it's fun-shaped narratives and two-page, colorful layouts scattered throughout. Originally I thought it was a shorter version of the novel, but to my joy and delight, it was the full story, so this is definitely one that I'm showcasing in my bookshelf at the moment.As for the story, well, it's complete nonsense of course, but that's the great thing about it. There are talking cats who disappear all but their grin. There are sneezing babies that turn into pigs. There are mock turtles, dodobirds, gryphons and hookah-smoking caterpillars. There is painting the roses red, a queen who won't think twice before yelling \\"off with his/her head\\", there are dormouse's with sleeping disorders who hang with nutty hatters and crazy hares. Oh, and did I mention Alice's problem with height... yea, the poor girl.Jibberish I tell you. But that's the fun of it. I would call it an organized mess. There really is no rhyme or reason to it, and that's exactly what makes it such a delight to read. Very imaginative, colorful and amusing - and I personally could not help feeling \\"curiouser and curiouser\\". I read it rather quickly too, as it's not very long.All in all, this was a very peculiar read, one that I can say is fun, whimsical and a classic that should be read at least once in your life.And one last thing, does anyone actually know:Why IS a raven like a writing desk?!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Lewis Carroll's story of the young girl Alice who chases a rabbit down a hole and discovers a completely new, beautiful, surreal, yet, dangerous world is a tale beloved by both children and adults. There are countless editions of the story available. This one is published by Templar Books and is illustrated by Rodney Matthews. The book comes in a wonderful hardcover slipcase. The illustrations that accompany the story are quite lavish and capture both the absurdity and fright that is an intricate part of Wonderland. The book includes at least one or two full-color, full-page illustrations for ever chapter as well as smaller, black-and-white illustrations of a quarter-page or less about every other page. Very young children (probably 4 and under) might not enjoy this particular edition of the story because there aren't enough \\"pictures\\". However, it is an ideal book for slightly older children as well as an edition to read to younger children. This isn't the best illustrated version of the Carroll's story, but it's not too shabby either."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"With the introduction of Tim Burton's new movie, there is brand new interest in Lewis Carroll's 140 year old dream trip down a rabbit hole. My first choice for an edition of the book (in print) is, most definitely, this volume. It is remarkably illustrated by Camille Rose Garcia. Her wonderful painted illustrations imagine a troubled, hurting universe of the noteworthy characters - the Red Queen, the Dodo Bird, the caterpillar with the hookah.... Her surreal approach to art is unforgettable...rather like the explosion of emotions in first glimpsing Picasso's \\"Les Demoiselles D'Avignon\\", the floating portraits of Chagall, or the folded clocks of Dali. Put in another way, the art in this volume of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" stays in your mind for a very long time. And because of that, the writing of Lewis Carroll does too.My second choice is the edition illustrated by the unbelievably talented black and white photographer - Abelardo Morell.Many will recommend the \\"Annotated Alice\\" [or even the \\"Annotated Hunting of the Snark\\"] but I think that's not the first way to experience Lewis Carroll. Second time around...yes...but \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" should be heard or read without footnotes, so that each person can interpret it individually and creatively.As for an audiobook, there is a very fine reading by Jim Dale, famous for his versions of 'Harry Potter.' Personally, I prefer the splendidly wicked audio version by Joan Greenwood ...but, alas, this is only available in cassette tape.Those who have never read the unabridged \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" will find it mind-bending...like first hearing Einstein's theory of relativity. No cheating allowed. The masterpiece has never been successfully translated into film. So, if you fail to experience it in the original, \\"off with your head.\\""},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I waited too many years to read this book.

It's one of the most famous line from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and I think it pretty accurately sums up the entirety of the book. I traveled through wonderland and came out feeling a tad conflicted over this book. On the one hand, I fully acknowledge that Lewis Carroll developed a truly awesome story. I can't even imagine how shocking this book was when it was first published in 1865!! On the other hand, I spent much of the book feeling like I was missing out on some kind of drug-fueled inside joke.There were times when I literally had to read the same sentence 5 times because I just had no clue what he was talking about (and re-reading usually resulted in me being even more confused than after the first read through). To be fair, I know that after writing this book, Lewis Caroll spent countless hours with an artist trying to perfectly capture the essence of Wonderland. Unfortunately, the Kindle version didn't include these pictures, which I think would have clarified some of what Carroll was trying to convey through his mad mad words."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Ordered for my kindle and it is an awesome book to have. Cannot find these classics in the stores and this way my kids will be able to enjoy as well."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"having read this book i first dissagree with some, this book is wonderfull and no better han the movie. it is a classic where een if there are no pictures because of the words you would be able to imagine. espessically adults. i am only a teen and i would think you would know what a book review is."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I saw the recently released movie Alice in Wonderland and that prompted me to read this book. The movie has great visuals and thus complements this text-only Kindle version."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"You cannot go by stars alone really on things like books. Especially books like Alice in Wonderland. There are people out there,(ahem see the three star reviewer) that have no imagination. This story is just a silly bit of imagined nonsense covering up deeper meanings. Anyone apposed to nonsense, or those who cannot read \\"between the lines\\" need not apply. :D cheers"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Long time ago, I should have read this story as a child, but I don't remember how come I didn't, but I don't remember either how I came to know Alice so intimately, as if this was a legend that had leaked out to me and never to be forgotten. No doubt, this is one hell of a legend.The title itself belies it to be just a fantastical childhood tale but it is actually a book that will get adults curiouser and curiouser until all the puns that are intended to taunt the deluded adult world will boil down to giving you a crazy smile. I swear by a mouse's tail- this Alice book is charming, and so full of funny, far-out characters. I cant resist being crazy with the mad tea-party, and the wacky game-story of cards and chess, of the chesire cat, and of course, Alice who is smart, proud and always snappy. Although my favorite of all is the wise caterpillar who smokes a hookah and sits on a mushroom.Alice in Wonderland is actually a story of growing up, or more like a child's discovery of wisdom, or maybe an exploration of wisdom in a child's perspective. The setting of cards and chess is an allegory of the world of chance and determinism, and the pervasive foreshadowing of death seems silly but anyway childish. Sometimes I don't understand why the book is one of the most quoted. Perhaps because aside from being popular, I am sure this tale really brings out the child in anyone.Lewis Carroll might have only told this story to put a loquacious girl in silence but fortunately, he has not made a very simple fantasy. He has invented an Alice in a lot of us."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I love this book so much,I couldn't wait to get Through The Looking Glass.I like this book,because of the adventures such as:Going down the rabbit-hole,using the key,being ordered by animals,meeting the Cheshire Cat,and meeting the Queen of Hearts.Buy it,now!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Lewis Carroll tells us a fantatic tale of a little girl who is caught in a satircal world, filled with paridy and weirdness. The book is a children's book with a sense of politcal humour for an adult. That is what makes Alice so wonderful to read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice's Adventure's in Wonderland is book that is like no other that i have read. At first it may seem simple and non moralistic but after you read it over more than once you can see what Carrol was trying to say and how it reflects his life. I think I enjoyed it because it is something that would never happen. Well the odds of me falling down a well chasing a talking rabbit with a pocketwatch is slim to none. Because it's unsual, quirky and comical it's fun to read and hard to put down. I'd recommend it to people of all ages."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"My 16 year old son asked me to get this book for him from the local library; (I think he saw the cartoon). For whatever reason, I was happy to see him reading! He enjoyed it so much that I decided to read it again. It was still as magical as the first time I read it 25 years ago. If it's been awhile since you followed the White Rabbit and enjoyed a Mad Tea Party, do yourself a favor and read 'Alice' again"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"After Lisbeth Zwerger's work on &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, I had pretty high hopes for her artistic interpretation of &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot; Her &quot;Wizard&quot; was a bold, refreshing take on some very familiar characters, and stands in particular contrast to the MGM movie. But, sadly, the illustrations for &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; don't offer the same interesting take on classic characters. Her version of &quot;Alice&quot; gives us the most depressed looking Alice I've ever seen. She appears to be almost drugged, and not at all the curious and engaging little girl we know. While Lisbeth Zwerger is known for sparse illustrations, here they seem almost barren at times. Her version of the Caterpillar for instance takes an almost sacrilegious liberty of giving us a modern seeming caterpillar smoking a cigarette instead of the traditional, more exotic hookah. Her artistic vision here offers us a scene more mudane than surreal. Perhaps, the artist is illustrating too many books, since this effort doesn't seem to me to be a fully realised one. I recently purchased &quot;Aice in Wonderland&quot; illustrated by Angel Dominguez (Artisan, 1996) and that's far and away a much better version. I would say buy this book only if you're looking for another &quot;Alice&quot; book for your collection. I just don't feel it's a standout addition."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I bought this book for my daughter. This quality of this book tells you that it is meant to be a keepsake. It is very well printed on high-quality paper, beautifully bound, and comes with a hard slipcover. The illustrations are amazing, but I found their style to be a bit dark for my 7-year old. The book is very text heavy, making it cumbersome to read aloud to a child, and a lot of the prose itself is on an adult level. Although my daughter is an excellent reader for her age, she has lost interest in trying to get through this book. I have read it myself, and while it captures the story of Alice in Wonderland nicely, it is, indeed a commitment to get through."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I loved this book. I have never read it before ...* This book is so amazing that Mrs. Kirkwood Told me to read it to the class.* I was SHOCKED when she said that but I read it and they LOVED the book.SO buy it now and have a ball."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I in my life don't remember reading or seeing an Alice In Wonderland movie; not a cartoon or actual person one. If anything I remember seeing pieces of a cartoon if you're lucky and so when I downloaded this book, I didn't expect to like it. As to be honest, I have an odd taste in books, I thought Alice was not my thing. But I was sucked in from the first sentence. I give this book four stars right now as I am still reading it and also because it's a bit confusing at times and repeats itself a tiny bit here and there, nothing major."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"There is something in these books, maybe too fictional. It was not for my daughter. She like books such asMatildaorRoald Dahl/Charlie Boxed Set (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator)orThe Invention of Hugo CabretorThe Complete Little House Nine-Book Set. This book was not cut for her."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Okay, I admit to reading this after playing Alice: Madness Returns. I was in the mood for some classic literature too!Having never read this, I didn't know what to expect. Rather than having a cohesive story with a beginning, middle and end, like the nature of the writing, things are a little bit...bizarre. We have a collection of scenes which Alive stumbles her way through with (let's face it) atrocious intro and conclusion tacked on. These are so brief (a few paragraphs) that do nothing. In fact, I know this is an older story, but the ending is awful. Maybe it hadn't been done to death in Carroll's day?Despite my contemporary complaints, I actually feel the story would be better off without the intro and conclusion, and be left as a collection of very strange conversations.Okay, there are dialogue heavy with some great images and everything is twisted and fired back and forth, but even this gets a bit...repetitive. It's easy to see why the tea party scene is so famous however, as the writing and humour here is superb. Though I have problems with this, I can recommend the book for this scene alone!In summary, it was good to read something a bit different and the language is approachable and it's all very, very silly. Good to dip into. Just ignore the after-thought ending."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Having read it when I was four it is getting more boring as I get older!

No, I'm not talking about that 'new movie that just came out last year', I'm talking about the original book, which follows a completely different storyline. This book keeps you (and the main character, of course) in curiosity from Alice's fall 'down the rabbit hole', her meeting with the Duchess and Cheshire Cat, to the twisted crouquet game with the queen. Through this story, Alice struggled to keep her mind straight in the many places where reality curved.

I love the fact that it was free and I was able to read one of the classics on my list instantly on my Kindle Fire."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is an unbelievably wonderful play on words. It is so much fun to read.Mr. Carroll was well acquainted with three young sisters. The middle one (who was his favorite) was named Alice. Once, on a summer picnic, he told the girls a story he had made up about Alice. They loved it so much that he made a book out of it and got it published. The illustrator he worked with was very accommodative, and he made the pictures exactly to Mr. Carroll's liking. The real Alice had short, dark hair, unlike the original illustrations. (Robert Ingpen takes some liberties on his version, but I am IN LOVE with his dreamy illustrations). As is stated in the first chapter, \\"What is the use of a book...without pictures or conversations?\\"I love the attention to detail in this book, such as a little cup of orange juice on a bookshelf.Alice herself is a wonderful character; she is confident, but humble enough to admit that she makes mistakes. At one point she [SPOILER WARNING!] relates to another character how she enjoys playing croquet with herself, and when she cheats, she will scold herself most harshly so as to bring tears to her eyes! She is also amazingly smart, especially for being only about seven. (She states her age in \\"Through the Looking Glass\\".)I would recomend this book for ages twelve and up. It just won't be enjoyable for younger ages. I tried reading it to my 9-year-old sister (who has been complimented by many people on her amazing vocabulary) and she didn't get the humor. It was written in the 19th century and the language was just over her head.Now, I have seen many cats without smiles, but I have never seen a smile without a cat.

My daughter loves the gold gilded edged pages. She loves the bookmark ribbon and the illustrations. It feels like a very special keepsake book to her. the pages are thinner so get this for a child who can be gentle with it and not rip the pages too easily.

Most of you should have read Alice's Adventures, and if you did not, you are better off. If you watched both, then you would best understand the major differences between the novel and the animations. Though I am sure there are a lot more to point out, in this review, I will focus on theses three points: the change with characters, the difference in setting, and the alternation of plots.First of all, here are the major character changes! Many agreed on the Queen of Hearts being the one of the most different, and also, the Cheshire cat. The classic portrayal of characters indicated the Cheshire Cat as the property of the Duchess. In the film, there is no Duchess at all!! The Cat stands alone, and instead of staying calm and cool as the novel, it is rather playful and gets Alice into big trouble with the Queen. Not only Duchess was not even mentioned, the gryphon never showed up, and the mock turtle was totally out of the picture. The Queen is selfish and ignorant, and though she rules the kingdom, she shrinks from responsibility. That may not get you much information on why there are so many difference with the Queen, and that will go on to our second point: the settings.Settings were also dramatically changed, kind of combined with the other book, making it a total hybrid. The queen's selfishness was not mentioned directly on the original, only the screaming passion for winning. The Queen of Hearts on the film's personality was combined with the Red Queen (especially the \\"open your mouth wider\\" parts inherited from her personal lines), making clear that she wanted everyone to obey her and to make her as happy as if she could ever be. The other clear facts supporting the idea of the combination between the two books are Tweedledee and Tweedledum appearing after the caucus race, followed by the garden of singing flowers. I was clearly expecting more than this, so it will actually look like as if it WAS a two book in one film, not an in-between sidekick.When it comes to settings, it always has to do with plots. Though not mentioned above, the start and the ending have a lot to this section. First of all, it was just a pleasant afternoon, resting by her sister when Alice started to dream and saw the white rabbit hurrying by, not during the history lesson. Then, there is the white rabbit that appears more frequently than it used to in the original, even during the mad tea-party. However, the most important thing in the whole plot, is that Alice thought of this amazing world before even she started to dream, and found out it was a dream at the end of the story, BEFORE she woke up. In the story, there was no such thinking of this events and it was a surprise for her to know she grew back to her own size, and have been sleeping.Overall, there are a lot of differences mentioned in this comparison review, and despite of director effort to create a lovely animation, I think it was kind of messed out. There are some reasons I wrote down already, but it is mostly for the others which have not been. However, I DO appreciate the animator's hard efforts to even think of turning this perfect piece of writing to a film, so I guess the \\"missed-outs\\" are expectable.This was my comparison review, and I hope you enjoyed it. If you have any spare seconds, please put a thumbs-up on my review & share your thoughts with me. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The theme of this book is basically a mystical wonderland where the unexpected happens. She starts off by falling into a hole, and then her journey in Wonderland begins. Carroll's descriptive language is incredible and he's always engaging your imagination. The only thing that could be better about this book, is if things to make a little bit more sense. But I guess there wouldn't be any fun in that."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I got this free for my iPod kindle app. I'd never read the story as a child, and had only seen a minute or 2 of the cartoon movie.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \`Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\\"This is what Alice, a curious young girl, experienced one sunny afternoon. Very bored, she decided to follow a rabbit down its hole. Expecting to see the rabbit's nest, Alice was stunned when she opened her eyes and saw a teeny tiny door surrounded by teeny tiny furniture. This is just the beginning of Alice's journey to Wonderland. She encounters a mischievous disappearing cat, a larger-than-life caterpillar, and an insane Mad Hatter. Alice's adventure becomes complicated when she crosses paths with Wonderland's evil queen. The queen, jealous of Alice's looks, gentle personality, and innocence, orders that she be captured and held prisoner. Alice, united with her unusual friends, must help restore order to chaotic Wonderland by dethroning the wicked queen and returning to her own world. Does Alice find her way back home? Or is she fated to navigate through the foreign world for eternity? There is only one way to find out!Lewis Carroll, Alice's creator, brings a world of madness mixed with logic to life. This particular edition has gorgeous watercolor illustrations by Helen Oxenbury that will help you visually explore Wonderland along with Alice. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a classic that is sure to earn a place as a favorite tale as well as a place on your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"What mainly sets Helen Oxenbury's version of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventure in Wonderland apart is her appeal to the new generation. Gone everything complicated, in comes simplicity and cuteness! The characters have a modern look to them that surely will appeal to chidlren.

This edition will definitely delight young readers for generations to come!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"If you've never read Alice in Wonderland then you are missing out.

If you've seen the film, the book seems comparatively brief and Alice seems to be exploring Wonderland with no specific purpose.

When I first read it I was a bit disappointed. But the Alice story persists. It's imagery pops up time and time again in other media, films, TV, video games, art. The Alice story is a lterary classic. Legendary even. Even people who haven't read a book in their life know at least something about it. They know many of the characters. Criticism of it is shocking, possible heretical.Meh. To me Alice In Wonderland is simply a nonsense story aimed at children. Nothing less, nothing more. Now, today the word \\"nonsense\\" has a perjotative ring to it, but back in the 19th century \\"nonsense\\" was pretty much a viable genre. But it's a short story, with little plot, no particular likeable characters, and filled with some of the most annoying literary creations ever. As some have said the events in the book are mostly non sequiturs, just seemingly random encounters that Alice has. It's written in rather sedate prose too, with little description of what Wonderland is actually like. In fact more information on the nature of Wonderland can be gleaned from the atmospheric illustrations by John Tenniel.I think Alice in Wonderland has survived through the years precisely because of it's vagueness and ambiguousness. People will read into what they want. It has provoked philosophical, moral, social and mathematical speculation. But I don't think there are any real hidden meanings or metaphors behind it all. It's an almost blank canvas for people to project their theories and speculations on what Wonderland is supposed to be. Something like a Jackson Pollock painting for the Victorian Age. Okay, maybe not *that* bad."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"THE weirdest book I have ever read in my entire life! It is wack!

I can't believe I waited so long to read it! I should have read this book as a little girl, when the magic would have been so much more real. I love the almost stream-of-consciousness feel to the words, and of course the extremely imaginative scenes.

It was extremely weird, but weird in a good way. The storyline was indeed \\"curious\\" and if you can get past the weirdness then you can enjoy it. At times I could get past the strange aspects of these stories, but other times I thought it was a bit too ridiculous and confusing to say the least. A few times, I had to read a sentence more than once to fully grasp its meaning. There is not really any plot to this book, but I can see how it may be a fun book to read to kids.Definitely not my favorite books, but I did enjoy Alice's Adventures in Wonderland more than Through the Looking Glass. I'm not going to say don't read this because I know a great deal of people enjoy this classic...it's just that I didn't find it all that great.

It's a quick read and you can make your own judgment about it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The story read like all the sentaces has been thrown it a blender and then reassembled into a book. The only reason I could follow any of it was because I have seen the various movie versions many many times. I not sure why I assumed that because it was a classic children's tale it would be good. The entire thing made no sense and on more than one occasion I believed that maybe because it was the Public Domain kindle edition perhaps I was missing a page or chapter. I know it was missing illustrations but it also felt like it was missing whole paragraphs. If this edition is complete than this truley is a horrible book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is coming from someone who absolutely LOVES the Disney classic film; and maybe (as I'm sure some of you will point out to me) that is the problem, but I think there is a bigger factor to my lukewarm sentiments towards this Lewis Carroll classic.I read this on Kindle.Now I love my Kindle (app), and I love the bountiful \`free' books to choose from, but if I can muster any amount of warning it would be to steer clear of this particular book. The reason being is that \`Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' is a visionary piece of literature that very much requires visuals to make it work. Reading the prose in mere \`black and white' so-to-speak, without any illustrations, makes such a low impact. In fact, the story takes on a tiresome tone without the aid of John Tenniel's illustrations. The fact that the Kindle version of this story omits them is a tragedy because it takes so much away from the experience. Sadly, my first experience with this story was on the picture-less Kindle version and my expectations were not met and I was left with this sour taste in the back of my throat. Thankfully, my mother has an illustrated version of this she let me take a gander at. When you tie both Carroll's wildly imaginative themes and Tenniel's beautifully constructed pictures you have a far more captivating and memorable experience.So, I feel partially unqualified to review this book since I didn't actually read it the WAY it was meant to be read.I will say that I felt the book definitely got off to a rocky start, for the repetitive nature of Alice's constant growing and shrinking became somewhat tiring to read. I also think that Disney's decision to fuse both \`Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' and \`Through the Looking Glass' together in their classic 1951 film was a stroke of genius, for they both truly complement one another and elevate the other. That, and it also made for a more involving and better paced film, for the events in \`Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' become a tad redundant, especially the dialog driven parts. I mean, I'm never one to say \\"the movie was better than the book\\" because, well, how often is that true, but some stories are better told on the screen and this is one of them. Reading this banter is far different than hearing it, and it doesn't quite read as effortlessly as I'd wanted it to.So, in the end I recommend the story (it's one that everyone should read) but don't do as I did and simply read the \`free' Kindle version. You really need to get an illustrated copy, for it makes all the difference."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"And I have to say there is no contest.The kindle version delivers all the words, but it's just not the same things without the illustrations.The illustrated version is an absolute masterpiece for all ages, absolutely entertaining....Despite the terrible terrible movie......"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"At 50, with the kids all growing up and moving out, I'm finding more time to read, and most of it is on my Kindle I recieved for my birthday. Free classics from Amazon seemed like a good place to start. There are many books that I know the story line to from other sources (movies mostly), but never had a chance to read the original source material. Alice is one of those books. It was a quick read, and thoroughly enjoyable. In fact, I wonder what I would have thought of this book if I HAD read it as a child? I probably would have hated it, as the language and sentence construction is purposefully confusing. But now, at 50, although it makes no sense, it makes a lot of sense because I can see Alice's world from a parent's perspective. I hope you enjoy rereading the classics like I am."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is a free book on Kindle and a must read for every child and grown up if you have not read it.

I've never turned away from nonsense, especially when it's \\"nonsense for the sake of nonsense\\". I do not \\"buy-in to\\" claims that this book is purely a drug-induced creative work. The language and the prose is so absurd and confusing at times that you feel as lost as Alice, which I like.I think it's important to read the works that were later \\"Disney-fied\\" so that you can see both why Disney made the decisions they did for their youthful audience, and, how the author originally intended the story to be."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I loved it. Be sure to read \\"Through the Looking-Glass\\" when you finish this one. I got so much out of this book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I want to start by saying it's free, and it's hard to beat free, unless what you are getting for free is really good. This is one of those items that is just that. This story has been passed on through generations, and I would imagine is still on of the most popular stories to date. I had only seen the movies of this tale, and thought there is no way this book could be better than all of these movies made over that last 100 years. This book exceeds every movie ever made form this book and will probably be better than every movie to come. The way Carroll portrays the characters in story you feel as if you are in the Wonderland as a bystander as it's all happening. It's a very vivid story that I will read to my kids one day.With this being the free kindle edition, it didn't come with the illustrations as other editions and that was fine with me. Where as I'm sure it would be nice to see the pictures as they were 150 years ago, it's still nice to use your imagination of the way Carroll put them in words."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I have taken to read some classics lately and I found Alice in Wonderland as a free ebook. I read the book in a day and loved it. Though I did love the Disney movie as a child, after reading Alice in Wonderland, I find that the book surpasses the movie. I will probably reread this book again in the near future to read anything that I may have missed, because the story had me begging for more and I might have missed a few things. I loved the humor in the book and the sadness of the book. The pictures give the book more life and I recommend this to everybody."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is the first time I read the book in its original version and I found Alice incredibly annoying and is just a pretentious self-centered little girl. Maybe that's what little girls do but surely it annoys me so much that I had the thought to abandon the book when I am 1/5 into it. It is always difficult to read a book when one dislikes the main character. I did finish it and it is a lovely ending. The other characters so fun and interesting - very imaginative and I can see why it is a classic. Guess it is just not my type of classic even though I love children books."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Ralph Steadman's illustrations seem to be taken directly from Lewis Carroll's ingenious mind.

Some books drag from the very beginning, but this children's story didn't. There were surprises from the start. This book is an all original example of using your imagination. Lewis Carrol was gifted enough to let his imagination go wild, and to write it down on paper. This book inspires me to write any sort of crazy thing that is worth writing. This book is about Alices adventures from the time she saw the peculiar White Rabbit with a waistcoat and watch. She meets thrilling but very arguementive creatures and charectors such as the caterpiller who smokes, the Duchess and her baby which turns into a pig, a Mock Turtle, a gryphon, and the most famous the Chesire cat and the Queen of Hearts. This book is a bit different than the Disney movie. There are other charecters in the book that are not mentioned in the animated movie. and I think the book is more bizarre."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Lewis Carroll did an excellent job when he wrote this book.

Where Cheshire Cats are always grinning, and Hatter's have tea parties all the time.This is a wonderful, exciting, and magical adventure for all young readers, and don't think because you've seen the movie you know the whole story.

My friend loved the book.

The book starts off with Alice in the park with her sister. She has nothing to do as her sister is reading so when Alice sees a talking white rabbit scampering by, she doesn't hesitate to follow it. Following the rabbit leads her to a world she could have never dreamed of. This book can take you to magical places you would have never dreamed of. Through the use of Carroll's thorough descriptions and dramatic elements this book is sure to take you on one wild ride. I thought that the book was very well written and very interesting. I could really imagine what the characters look like and feel how Alice would have felt. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a good adventure and lots of twists along the way. This book is for children and adults alike. As long as you have an imagination and a great sense of adventure you are sure to love this great tale of a girl and how she found herself in an imaginary world."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I collect Alice memorabilia and have massive sites on &lt;yahoo&gt; and &lt;photobox&gt;.And maybe I'm the only one who saw the uncanny resemblance between Alice In Wonderland and my favourite singer Virginia Astley. Even her middle name is ALICE.Her instrumental album &quot;FROM GARDENS WHERE WE FEEL SECURE&quot; is the perfect soundtrack to Alice and all the titles she used were appropriate:Summer Of Their Dreams,Out On The Lawn I lie in Bed,Its Too Hot To Sleep,Hiding In The Ha Ha,A Summer Long Since Past...the music is accompanied by Nature sounds and splashing oars. Her later songs had titles like Nothing Is What It Seems and Over The Edge Of The World,these especially fit into her version of Wonderland. Virginia Astley even LOOKS like the Rackham illustration of Alice and not only that but she lived with her family in the 70s at Moulsford,Oxfordshire,with the Thames outside the back door and only a few miles South of Alice Country.Virginia is,in fact,Alice in the Deanery garden,her latest song &quot;I Will Miss This Holy Garden&quot;"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Most children these days are exposed to the magical adventures of Alice in Wonderland through cartoon movies, such as Disney's version, but very few are exposed to the exact literature, the book that made the cartoons, movies, and every other piece of merchandise on the market today happen. &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is a complete children's classic. Unlike many children books of then and now, it makes you think, something we all, especially children, should do often if not done at least once a day. Not only is this book, which follows Alice through a magical world where the verdict comes after the sentence, tea parties are insane, and Mock Turtles sob continueously, a good fantasy story to keep young (and old) minds occupied, its also a good riddle and puzzle book. With constant interruption and riddles being said throughout the book by the 'mad' charactors, its a good book to read if you want something difficult to figure out or to wonder about. The author Lewis Carroll I've learned enjoyed complicated puzzles and intentionally included many in this piece of literature. &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is definately a classic that must be read if not already read.

Although a rather accurate depiction of Wonderland, it cannot compare to the book (plus it muddled things together, mixing Alice in Wonderland with things originally in Through the Looking Glass). I never really took much attention to this very strange movie, but one day decided to read the book.Enter Wonderland.Absolutely no plot, no direction, no point. Lot's of silly nonsense but in spite of, or maybe because of this, it is very enjoyable. You literally never know what's going to happen next. After reading this book, I realized just how much my own dreams... Unforgettable characters, who can ever forget the cheshire cat or the caterpillar, jokes, interesting supplementary drawings, and puns keep you on your toes.This is really not for kiddies. Sure they can read it and maybe even enjoy it, but cannot fully appreciate it. A masterpiece, a classic, but more importantly, an enjoyable experience.Don't forget to read Through the Looking Glass! Tweedle Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum, the Walrus and the Carpenter, and &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; don't pop up in Alice in Wonderland but Through the Looking Glass. Although &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; didn't appear in the movie, it's still a classic. Finally, an explanation of this ever-puzzling poem! And of course, &quot;I am the Walrus&quot; is one of my favorite all-time songs...One of those books that you can read over and over again and find something new each time. Definitely an essential. The most fun I have ever had with a book. If you've ever been cursed enough to watch the movie but never read the book, PLEASE READ THIS BOOK!

Lewis on cheap drugs. The events are complete non sequiturs and the changes in plot are worse.It appears to be a spoiled child wandering in a world she does not understand, nor is willing to learn about - unlike Lucy in The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe who seeks to understand the local customs and circumstances.The book is very easy to read but it leaves distaste in my literary mouth.

It is down-to-earth enough for younger kids to enjoy, but is also full of logical jokes and play-on-words that adults can crack a smile from. After lazing off during her lessons, Alice is distracted by the peculiar sight of a white rabbit with a waist coat. She follows him down his rabbit hole, and finds herself in Wonderland, a place full of strange characters and substantial anomalies. During her adventures in Wonderland, Alice encounters all sorts of talking animals and seemingly illogical scenarios. The rationalization in Wonderland is slightly skewed, and Alice often finds herself adhering to their strange rules after hearing their unexpected but relevant justification. For example, after getting wet swimming in a pool of her own tears, Alice suggests that she and the group she's with dry off. Her acquaintance, the mouse, proceeds to recite the 'driest' thing he knows.Among other things, Alice meets a hookah-smoking caterpillar, a duchess and her cook (who is perpetually peppering soup,) a mock turtle, a deck of cards, a Cheshire cat, and 'her majesty,' the Queen of Hearts, who is always threatening to behead her subjects but never following through. My favorite aspect of the book was Carroll's witty insights to the way we perceive reality. The story made me question the world we live in, and why things that are considered 'custom' are so widely accepted, How did we even come to decide what qualifies as normal or abnormal anyway?Alice's Adventure in Wonderland was such a breath of fresh air as a book from a child's perspective, and I give it five stars because it was not only thought provoking, but funny and entertaining as well."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is one of the most beloved children's classics. It has been adapted into numerous cartoons, films and plays over the years, and it has become an important backdrop of the World culture. It is a brilliant and zany fairy tale that remains fresh and engaging well over a century after it had been written. This is in large part thanks to the unforgettable and unique characters that are as famous (if not more) as Alice herself: the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the \\"Mad\\" Hatter, the Queen of Hearts and many more. They are among the most idiosyncratic characters in all of literature. However, the aspects of the book that I found the most fascinating were the clever use of language, the numerous puns, and the plays on the difference between the literal and actual meanings of different expressions and saying.

The book made me reflect again on so many aspects of the world that I take for granted, and it made me feel like a child exploring and learning about various objects, ideas and relations for the first time.

It inspired me and I used to play out the story with my dolls and dad's playing cards - such fun to be had and all because of Alice in Wonderland! Alice's character is an inspiration to young and old alike - a young girl who says what she thinks and challenges authority, precocious, open-minded, and possessed of an admirable courage in the face of strange and frightening events. It is a story that appealed to me as a child and at a deeper level as an adult appreciative of the wordplay and rich symbolism contained within.As an adult who has read the illustrated versions, the Kindle title is a bonus that I can store and read at my convenience. But I would definitely prefer the illustrated version when reading to my 5-year-old child. Also recommended isThe Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Jim Dale is a spectacular \\"interpretor\\" of this classic story. Wonderful and satisfying rendering for children and adults."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Almost everyone knows the classic tale of Alice in Wonderland. They've either read the book or seen the movies but none of the former publications quite bring Lewis Carroll's story to life like Camille Rose Garcia. The artwork in this story is fantastic! Every page pops and pertains to the scene being described in a nearly perfect fashion. After finishing this version I could not help wondering if I hadn't drifted off and visited wonderland myself.Now, obviously the art is one reason to purchase this book but let's not forget the story itself. Carroll pushes the boundaries of reality, leaving the reader as well as the characters themselves to wonder if what they have experienced is real.This is not your classic fairytale. There is a damsel in distress but she has to save herself. There are kings and queens but no princes to save the day. There is magic without spells and witches. There is life in everything from the animals to cards. There is chaos with a certain amount of order and a dose of fear.The story itself is imaginative and one of the reasons I enjoy books so much. Carroll reveals to us the magic of imagination. Garcia takes this imagination and brings it to life, making it perfect for people of all ages. You've seen Alice, but never quite like this. You won't regret this purchase!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I have never found a book that makes me laugh at the stupidity of a character but makes me overjoys me in its descriptive world.

Since I have seen the movie I knew most of the things that were about to happen, but it still kept me wondering."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This version does not include any drawings, but I am not entirely positive the original Alice had illustrations. I know 'Through the Looking Glass' did though. (Please comment if you know so I can edit review).The four star rating is for the actual story itself. It is timeless in a way, but it is short and somewhat bittersweet. I do believe that it is the better story than 'Through the Looking Glass'. In this fantastic story we follow Alice through some interesting adventures in Wonderland. We are introduced to an amazing cast of characters including the Knave of Hearts, the Queen of Hearts, the Duchess, the white rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the march hare, and several other wacky animals and other beings.I guess the bittersweet impression is because I enjoyed the characters, but they are typically brief. The Mad Hatter is a little more prominent in the story, as is the Duchess, the Knave, and the Queen; but I would have enjoyed more time with the Cheshire Cat and a few others. Also, Alice is quite petulant, and it does get a little old that she continually goes into her little asides and interrupts the stories. Still, some of her comments are quite funny.It's very good, a true and timeless classic. This is a great example of literary nonsense. It's not quite as silly as something like Candide, but more imaginative and fantastic in every way. The Kindle version is very good, and free. Win Win."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"It was a spectacular book I love it so much more than I love the movie so thank you for writing this book"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"It is wonderful to discover another classic of children's literature illustrated by Robert Ingpen. It is a beautiful book. Even if you already own another copy or other copies of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, you should add this book to your collection."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Audiobook fans might recognize Jim Dale as the narrator of Harry Potter series. He has won two Grammy Awards and seven Audie Awards, and lives up to his reputation in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Dale brings to life this timeless story, giving the iconic book all the justice it deserves. Non only is his English accent comforting and accessible to American ears, he speaks with an ageless authority that instills both comfort and wonder. I can't imagine a better performance! There is something straightforward and comforting about the simple surrealism of Alice.Listeners of any age will revel in Lewis Caroll's book that defined the genre of children's science fiction. Forget the Disney knock offs - Caroll's original words are as entertaining as they were when first written, and his magical realism still delights beyond the wildest dreams of the most talented modern day writers."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is one of the best Alice books I've seen in recent years. As soon as it arrived I heard people talking about the illustrations. My friends know I love Alice, and they have come to love her too. I gave this new copy as a gift. The art is fab, and the Alice image is more like the \\"real\\" Alice than the Tenniel Alice, which is very refreshing, I always think of her as real, don't you? If you haven't read Alice for a very long time, read this, dream about the little girl, pretend you are along the trip with her. Forget you're an adult for 2 hours."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was originally written in 1865 and has since been translated into 125 languages. There have now been over a hundred editions of the book, as well as countless adaptations in other media, including theater and film. If you haven't already done so, isn't it time to introduce this masterpiece to your children?This edition is particularly enjoyable because it is presented like a large picture book, making it a great choice for a large range of ages. Sized at 9\\" x 12\\", beautiful illustrations by Oleg Lipchenko sprawl across every page, bringing the story to life. Broken up into twelve chapters, this is the perfect bedtime book. There is ample adventure and colorful characters afoot to keep children breathless and anxious for the next night's chapter.I think I was first introduced to Alice by the 1951 Disney cartoon. Like most book to movie adaptations, reading the story is so much better. Reading the book allows you to process Carroll's original text and allow your imagination to develop the characters, which makes the story uniquely yours. Here, Lipchenko's illustrations will act as a starting block, but they don't fully create the memory for you, like a movie will do.There is a reason Lewis Caroll's writing is considered a classic - it really does transcend the years. I'm so pleased that Tundra Books is offering this updated edition, so that I may introduce a whole new generation to Alice's adventures via a gorgeous book. I must point out that Oleg Lipchenko's illustrations plus Lewis Carroll's original text serves to make this a spectacular gift choice. Grab a copy and invite your own children to join the tea party and take their chances with the Mad Hatter, the March Hare and the demanding Queen of Hearts!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"AAW rating: 5Lewis Carroll rating: 5It appears that most of these reviews are reviewing the original book and raving about the illustrations and how wonderful the story is. However, this version does not have illustrations and its formatting is not good for the Kindle. On the plus side, this version has the text correct. I gave it a 1 to counter what I feel are misplaced 5s. (I don't uprank this for being free, because most of the versions of AAW are $2 or less and that is essentially the same price.)Get a version that has illustrations and with the text properly sized for the Kindle."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I already owned this book, along with Through the Looking Glass, but I just had to get this wonderful edition after seeing the YouTube trailer for the book: (...). Go ahead and watch it. I'll wait :-)Awesome, right!? I'm a complete sucker for nice clothbound books, and I love contemporary art, so getting this really was a no-brainer.The illustrations are amazing and they compliment the story perfectly, transporting adults into an imaginary world that's rarely available to those over two feet tall. For a story that's been visually adapted time and again by Western illustrators and filmmakers, it's refreshing to have a completely re-imagined view of Alice's adventures by this wonderful Japanese artist. In fact, the one problem I had while reading the book was trying to forget the movie adaptations I'd seen (particularly the Disney one) and instead allow myself to imagine it with fresh eyes. It took a little while, but I love the new vision that Kusama took me on through that timeless rabbit hole.In regards to the story itself, I was so impressed with how cleaver and imaginative Carroll is. None of the movies really do the story justice. I'm pretty sure that Carroll must have at least been an amateur linguist because of all the ways he plays with the language. Actually, thanks to my former life as a linguistics major, I got so much more out of reading this than I probably would have otherwise. While this is undoubtedly a children's book, this is a story for all ages.Whether you're a kid or an adult, this is a fantastic edition of a classic story. Rarely does a book make me laugh out loud, but Alice's adventure in Wonderland did just that - page after page. I can't wait to share this with my (as of now, nonexistent) kids someday!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I loved it, and I can't wait to read the sequel,Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Reasons to not get this version:This edition contains no pictures (even where the text says \\"IF you don't know what a gryphon is, look at the picture.\\" [sic])The poems appear as prose paragraphs, even the glorious Mouse's Tail poem.Suddenly near the end of the book, you get 2 editorial comments: \\"[later editions continued as follows: ...\\" that would have been better treated as footnotes. But why only 2 such notes in the entire book?"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"It was the cover picture of Alice and the Rabbit that caught my attention. Out of the many editions of Alice in Wonderland, I would recommend Alice's Adventures in Wonderland illustrated by Helen Oxenbury. Helen Oxenbury is a talented illustrator who won England's Kate Greenaway Medal for illustrators. She draws Alice like a modern girl very different from Disney's Alice with neat hair, an apron, and the poofy dress. Some of the pictures are coloured and some are not. This is the unabridged story with a bigger font than the others which is good for reading because alot of other novels have very small writing which is hard to read.This book would be awesome for Christmas, Hannukah and Easter presents or just a present for your family and maybe for yourself because it is paperback. However, it has thicker paper than the fragile pages in other paperback novels.You might get anothe edition of Alice in Wonderland because you think you're not going to read it again after you finish, but if you get this version, then you will want to read it again and again after you finish.Written by Jenny"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I am rereading this classic on my Kindle and was happily surprised to find that it included beautiful illustrations.

I enjoyed this story as a child, but thought it might seem like \\"a girl's book\\" to my eight year old son.

The word structure and usage even reads, and in some cases looks, like a dream. You may not always understand why something happens the way it does to poor Alice, but like the unlikely heroine herself, you simply accept it and move on to the next adventure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"was the first time i actually read it, had to look up some words and phases since it is an older book set in a different time period. lol"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I have read this book many years ago, I decided it would be nice to read again and it did not disappoint.

I had an assignment in school to read the book of \\" Alice in Wonderland\\". At first I didn't wanted to read it cause i had seen the movie. Later on that day i read the first sentence of the book. It was different from the movie. For example, in chapter one it says Alice was in her sister's bookstore and in the movie it showed she was outside studying. The other example, in the book it seemed she was taking forever falling in the hole and the movie she fall and then landed. So I kept on reading it and in my mind, it wasn't picturing how it is in the movie. I got into more and more each day.There were some big words I won't say or understand.

Yes, this book can be read by all ages and you pull something different out of the tale every time you read it. I read part of it when I was younger but it confused me too much so when I saw it on Amazon, I decided to give it a second chance. Lewis Carroll does a great job of displaying curiosity and the unknown adventures in a child's dream world.

I've been a fan of this story for 25+ years and have at least 15 different copies of this book. We all know the story and there's nothing new as far as that goes. What's so new and updated and original in this book are the illustrations! The pictures are so vibrant and beautiful.

It was then that I opened my copy of \\"Alice's Adventures...\\" and dove once again down the rabbit hole. I even played Alice in a play when I was a young teen and it stands out as one of my most cherished memories.Alice is everything that I think a young girl wants to be - adventurous, clever, compassionate and even a bit funny. She is wonderful.Many editions of the book have been published over the years, and the Kindle one lacks the illustrations of some other versions. That was not a detriment to me, as I loved to imagine Alice and her adventures when I was a child. I know there are some gorgeous illustrations out there and perhaps the Kindle version can include them, but the lack of illustrations should not stop anyone from reading this book - for teh first time, or the thousandth."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Truly a classic. This story had popped up in my childhood first as a Disney movie and later as an elementary school play. However, up until now I've never actually sat down and read the book. I wasn't disappointed.If you are looking for an illustrated version, keep looking. This version is only text. It allows for the readers imagination to \\"see\\" the story. Some of the imagery is convoluted and makes this a challenge, but in a good way.Nothing is better than enjoying a good book on a dreary afternoon. The remembrance of childhood was just an added bonus."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Absolutely love this book.

Not only is this book great but it was free! I would have given this five stars just the thing that puts me down on this is that you have to pay for narration on the whole book.

So, simply, buyer beware of that fact that I over looked."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The story is interesting, but I think from a childs point of view this Kindle edition would be most facinating if it contained the orginal illustrations.

She can now visualize what she reads. from the wonderful pictures. Every night - we read - 2 - 3 pages and I explain many of the words and phrases she's hearing for the first time. Even if it is late and way past her bedtime - skipping bed-time reading results in tears and tantrums. That is how much she loves the material.

The actors are top-notch as are the music and sound effects.The previous reviewer criticized this adaptation for not following Lewis Carroll's original; it's been so many years since I read the original (probably over 30 years) that if there were any changes in the sequence of events I didn't catch it. I will suggest, however, that Lewis Carroll's original be read before listening to this. There are so many whimsical and strange things taking place one after the other, and Wonderland is such a place of pandemonium (captured perfectly in this recording) that someone listening who isn't familiar with the original would probably be quite confused as to what is going on.I highly recommend this for children, families, or anyone who simply enjoys excellent audio dramatization."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"it wasn't quite what i had expected based on the fact that i had seen tim burtons new movie. i did enjoy it though but i was expecting more excitement. i would recommend it to young readers who enjoy adventure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I thought this book was good. I grew up with the movie and have only recently read the book.

It was nice to read the book again after many years. The kindle edition does not, however, do any justice to the book. Being a children's story, the lack of pictures and opening poem really take away the effects. Because of the lack of physical description, all I could picture while reading it was the movie starring Carol Channing and Sammy Davis Jr. This is one of two books where I can honestly say that the movie was better."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The product arrived very quickly!

One that both adultsand children will equally like. It's filled with humor, poetry (if I'mnot mistaking this book with Through the Looking-Glass), and logical statements made by the characters that will really make you think. Some of the things they say - like the White Rabbit and the Mad Hatter - will make you laugh.Carroll was truly a master in combining logic with humor. From any angle that you look at this book, you will find it enjoyable. No book, I think, has ever been so shrewd and witty. No E. B. White or Dr. Seuss book can be compared to the two stories of Alice and all her eccentric yet lovable friends."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"i really felt let down by this book.

She was thrilled!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is a pretty awesome book, and that's coming from someone who can't stand reading a book. The imaginative phrases and descriptions are enough to keep you going strong until the very end. The numerous descriptions of the different areas of wonderland is pretty cool. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"From the very beginning, the book showed its weirdness. Alice is bored on the riverbank in the company of her sister, and sees a talking White Rabbit walking by. However, she's not amazed by this, but rather by it pulling a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket. Driven by boredom, she follows the rabbit down a rabbit hole, where she falls and falls near endlessly whilst having conversations with herself. Apparently one can pick up cups and pots and place them on shelves while falling at a terminal velocity.The entire motivation for Alice's adventures is the beautiful garden past the small locked door she wishes to enter. Throughout her seemingly random changing of sizes to try and enter the garden, she meets mice, turtles, a caterpillar, a Cheshire Cat, and many other weird creatures. All of them seem to have a quite annoying wit about them that bases itself upon word puns and spellings. Accordingly, Alice's painfully simple logic and way about doing things exposes these puns just about every page. Tale to tail, Tea to the letter \\"T,\\" and other similar things. To brighten things, the Cheshire Cat's demeanor is a little different, but not by much. He, like many other characters, is quite literal and has a cloudy and recondite service to the overall story.And to top it all off, when Alice finally does enter the lush garden, she meets the Queen of Hearts who has a record of both ordered executions and empty words. When she isn't screaming \\"Off with his/her head!\\", she's playing a rather silly, disorganized game of croquet. I would attempt to identify an allegorical message about foreign countries' governing systems in this scenario, but the ridiculous nature of that chapter was just too much.There really was no clear climax, and the resolution didn't suffice--for me at least. What was the main conflict? Not being able to enter the garden? The unfair trial about stolen tarts? If the latter is indeed, then it was never resolved. Personally I believe it was identified at the very start--her boredom.Overall, the adventures weren't that adventurous, and the wit not that witty. Perhaps if you enjoy ambiguity, you will appreciate this book. It's very hard to understand cultural references from a book written over a hundred years ago. Don't read this too critically; take it with a grain of salt--or you'll dislike it like me."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I really wanted to like this edition of Alice In Wonderland, as I happen to admire Lisbeth Zwerger's art. Unfortunately, there were inconsistencies between the illustrations and the text which marred my appreciation.An example:In the scene where Alice encounters the rather severe and pedantic caterpillar, Zwerger takes a top-down perspective, forcing us to see the creature from above, as we would in everyday life. Zwerger ignores the fact that Alice is the same size as the caterpillar (6 inches) and viewing him from a lower position (he sits on a mushroom, thereby gaining height over Alice). The text even specifies that Alice has to stand on tiptoe to see what is on top of the mushroom. I have always thought it obvious that readers (especially young children) are meant to identify with Alice and see things from her perspective. Instead, we tower over the caterpillar, taking away the unusual perspective that Dodgson would have wished us to have. Tenniel's illustration is faithful to the the text and the child's perpsective; Zwerger's, unfortunately, is not.What is more, with Zwerger's perspective, it is difficult to imagine the caterpillar as a stern, brusque, off-putting character-- much like some adults who have little tolerance for children(\\"Who are _you_?\\"; \\"What do you mean by that?\\"; \\"Explain yourself.\\") The text mentions, among other things, that Alice is rather shy of him. From Alice's (and thus the reader's) perpective, the caterpillar is an intimidating figure. Not so in Zwerger's interpretation, where the caterpillar is not only a diminutive thing, but also a self-conscious-looking thing, puffing nervously on a cigarette.Which brings me to the most glaring and incomprehensible departure from the text: the cigarette. The story clearly indicates that the caterpillar is smoking a \\"hookah\\". Zwerger perversely ignores the details of the story and substitutes hookah for ...a ciggy! Is this artistic license, or sloppiness? Either way, a child reading \\"hookah\\" for the first time will be betrayed by Zwerger's illustration; older readers who like to think the artist should be faithful to the text will find the changes disconcerting and annoying.Together, these inconsistencies dampen the pleasure I might have gained from Zwerger's lovely pictures and Carroll's story.And this was just one picture, from the Alice book only, mind you. I haven't yet looked at those of Oz, but I am too disappointed with the first to try.For the meanwhile, the books remain in their slipcase, in a remote part of the bookshelf, while I enjoy the original and delightful illustrations by Tenniel."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I really liked Alice's adventures in Wonderland because it is so original!

I enjoyed the wikipedia entry about the book more than the book itself. It noted that the book is classified as \\"nonsense literature,\\" and I cannot agree more. The book is utter nonsense.

So ou may be looking for the Ingpen edition but unable to find an Ingpen review.I fell in love with the Ingpen edition when I saw it in the store. Every page turn features an outstanding color illustration by one of the of the world's leading illustrators.In Alice she says:'what good are stories without pictures?' We can read a story without a picture, yet when we have a picture it really helps us in imagining the story, and Ingpen has a great imagination when it comes to the picture story.This is the kind of book you will leave on the coffee table just so you can show it off to your friends. Whether you are a parent or just reading it your own pleasure, I found reading it this way much better. I do own a pictureless version which I never got around to reading.Sterling publishers have published other stories with Ingpen such as the Wizard of Oz. So if you wish to enjoy a classic story and to fire your visual imagination at the same time this is a great way to do it. I passed my version along to a niece and have the occasional pang of regret for having given it away.I highly recommend it, think you will love it and hope this was helpful."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The book dimensions are appriximately 4x6 inches.

But one too many references to \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" made me finally decide I need to know, first hand, what all the fuss was about.Reading a text that has long become embedded into our culture, turns things upside down. I had so long heard of the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the Rabbit Hole, that I feel like I know these reference when in fact, I don't. Now I do and that is what I got most of the book. Alice's plucky, no nonsense tone is a bracing counterpoint to the ridiculousness going on around her. The Queen cracked me up and I now see where Baron Sasha Cohen's Dictator comes from. As a work of literature, perhaps its charms would have been more intoxicating at age 7 but alas, I cannot turn back time.So I'm glad I read the thing but there was no transport, no insight and my general dislike for children's books and fantasy remains as fortress-like as before I began down the rabbit hole."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"awesome part one is amazing but, i have the original unbigided version in hard cover from Barns & Noble which was CHEAP!!! looking forard for the complete tales of Edgar Alan Poe i shall say nevermorep.s. i'm nine"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Have never read this classic before.

Wish I had that kind of talent!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll and Illustrated by Camille Rose Garcia is a classic tale that should really be on everyone's bookshelf. This is a timeless story that can be appreciated by all generations, and this is a beautiful gift edition that people of all ages will enjoy.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is one of my favorite stories from childhood. As an adult, I hadn't read the story again, until this book touched my hands. It is even better reading it as an adult because I found so much more in the story than when I was a kid. I appreciate literature more now and Lewis Carroll is one of the best. If I had kids, I'd read this to them before bed or naptime.The illustrator for this special edition of the book does a truly amazing job with the artwork for the story. Camille Rose Garcia is exceptionally talented, and I really hope that she illustrates more books like this in the future. Her artwork is edgy and gothic, which gives this children's tale a more grownup or current vibe than when it was written.I absolutely loved this edition of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and highly recommend this as a book for everyone to get. It would also make an excellent gift for someone, especially if they love this story and the characters in it.* Thank you to the publisher of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Harper Design, for providing me with a copy of this book for review.

Well, it occurred to me as I was looking through the available books on my Kindle, that many of the free ones (yes I'm quite open to free as an option) that there were many books that I assumed I knew because I had seen movies, seen summarized in some other form or simply because they were cultural icons and \\"everybody\\" knows these books.Many I have indeed read and did read as I was younger. However, now with a Kindle and a commute, it seemed a perfect opportunity to address some of those elements lacking in my basic reading. It was in this spirit that I down loaded Alice's adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll and read through it is a remarkably short period of time. Many of these free books on the Kindle, are in the public domain and have been available in text or PDF files for quite some time. A simple conversion in format is all that is required to make it available. The question I asked as I read the book, is does the experience of reading it in this format take away anything from the experience. Children's Literature in particular is often about more than just the words on a page. Of course there are often illustrations, the physical book itself takes on dimensions that are bigger than usual. This adds to the experience of a child reading the book by themselves but in particular it adds to the experience of a child being read to who can then sit in a lap or look as the book as presented and share in the experience by learning to read or reinforcing reading skills.So, for a aging kid who needs something to read to round out his cultural iconic missing links this worked just fine. However, for those seeking to have an experience with their kids in reading a classic piece of literature, I'd not recommend it in that venue.As to the story itself, there's little I can say. In some ways, it's like reading a familiar story but in others it's amazing how much can be lost or glossed over in the pop-cultural offerings that sprang from it. Reading this piece of classic literature gives you some insight not only into the time it came from, but also into the heart of childhood that is timeless and can be recaptured at least in part, if we'll pause and exercise our imagination.4 stars. Absolutely 5 stars as far as the story goes. Because this specifically addresses the Kindle edition, a drop of a star so that any considering reading this to their children from a kindle, consider what might be lost by not obtaining a more traditional copy complete with illustrations and the opportunity to share at a level one notch above what the Kindle offers in this context.Perhaps something like thisAlice's Adventures in Wonderland. Take some time and look for what will work best for you and your intended audience.bart breen"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"\\"What is the use of a book without pictures or conversations?\\" Someone might have thought to ask that of the compilers of this Kindle edition, which lacks any of the famed Tenniel illustrations, even though they're all in the public domain and have been made available in many on-line versions. Worse, the compilers also omit Carroll's opening poem, \\"All in the golden afternoon,\\" even though it's an integral part of the book. One gets the feeling that the goal was to not make the free version truly complete, so that one would have to wind up purchasing one of the non-free editions for one's Kindle -- which is probably a better solution from the outset."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I forgot how wonderful a tale this is. It is written so well that the images almost jump off the page. Even as an adult I couldn't help but to fall under Carroll's spell."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Do you remember the first time you saw a painting by Marc Chagall? His fantastic creatures wearing hats and trousers, people kissing while floating in mid air, layers of events happening at once, and conversations between animals and flowers? If Chagall was alive and asked to illustrate Alice's Adventures, it may have looked very similar to this.Only this is better.Simple and yet very rich illustrations bounce you from page to page. They are vibrant but not overwhelming, you are curious about where the images will take you next, it makes you hungry for more. And you get more! There is a printed illustration on almost every other page of the book! There seem to be as many small images, lending themselves as nuances to Carroll's text, as there are full-page illustrations. In a word, it's fantastic.I disagree with the editorial review of the School Library Journal. While I see this book as sophisticated, I also see very young children relating to the artwork. The dream is at times spooky and frustrating like the real world can be, just as at other moments it can be a playful party. Although Alice in Wonderland may not have been originally intended for child as young as three or four years old to read, they will be enticed into trying. A child as young as four will relate to this Alice, she is a small girl with flowing hair and dresses in an easy style. Deloss McGraw has illustrated a modern and truly dreamlike interpretation of Carroll's classic. Finally we have a total departure from the formal British and more grown up Alice that John Tenniel portrayed all those years ago and has been an influence upon artists attempting it since.Albeit a short, but important side note: the size 14 - 16 font is very readable for both old and young eyes, and comes in very handy for those readers-out-loud at late bedtimes in a dimly lit room.Of all the illustrated versions there are of this classic story, this will be the version your child would first pick up from the shelf."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The story of Alice in Wonderland is repeated in a very readable text and is as delightful as ever. This is not, however, a childrens' book. Barry Moser's illustrations tell the story of Alice in a different, dark and somewhat menacing way. Is the rabbit hole just the means to reach an amusing world of people and animals with strange names and stranger habits, or is it the path to a nether region where the normal rules of social conduct and the shape and size of &quot;people&quot; don't apply? If his illustrations mean anything, Moser thinks perhaps it is the latter. For example, the Queen of Hearts appears not as the crazy, but ultimately harmless, creature of a Disney movie. Moser shows her as a dark and foreboding character and by his illustartion suggests that &quot;off with her head&quot; is a real threat. The text of the book is standard Alice, but the real reason to buy it is to get Moser's illustrations. This is definitely not a book for 10 year olds. But those of us who grew up on Alice as half comedy, half light hearted spoof will enjoy this twist on a traditional tale. Moser's other illustrations of classical works such as Moby Dick and The Devine Comedy are also well worth acquiring."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I have this book. It is beautifully illustrated. I do not understand the comment of a previous reviewer who complained about the number of illustrations. Nearly every page is beautifully illustrated. Every chapter is introduced with a two-page illustration. There are numerous two-page and full single-page illustrations throughout the book. I'm an adult who fell in love with this story when I saw Disney's Alice in Wonderland. This is a worthy addition to my collection of things Carroll. I recommend \\"The Wasp in a Wig\\" if you can find it. The end of this Alice... has a nice and concise description of Carroll's writing of the book, photographs of the cover and first page of Carroll's handwritten first version, and a wonderful tribute to John Tenniel, the illustrator of the first published edition who provided the classic drawings nearly all of us recognize. Buy this book for your kids but teach them to handle it carefully; buy this book for yourself even if you only have cats to read it to."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Now I understand the timeless appeal of Lewis Carroll's classic&quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. Of course the story is magic to readers of all ages but for me what is especially magical are the illustrations. Deloss McGraw has turned &quot;Alice&quot; and the world of illustration on its head. Now I understand why this book has just received the New York Society of Illustrators 2001 Gold Medal for Original Art."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The treasure of this edition lies principally in its beautiful layout and thoroughly original illustrations. Strict traditionalists may find Garcia's gothlike depictions of their favourite Wonderland characters a bit off-putting, while fans of Alice looking for something distinctly different won't be disappointed. The text is Carroll's original classic, nicely set, with a whimsical unjustified right edge and pleasing gradient toned pages. This volume does not include Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass, which is a pity -- it would have been interesting to see Garcia's depiction of the Jabberwocky. Garcia's art notwithstanding, I would more highly recommend:The Annotated Alice: The Definitive EditionI also highly recommend:Alice in Verse: The Lost Rhymes of Wonderland"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The book received only included \\"Alice in Wonderland\\". \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" is not included in the book, even though the picture depicts that both are included. I found the book that included both stories elsewhere and purchased it. I donated the book I received from Amazon to my daughter's school library instead of dealing with the hassle of returning it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This review is strictly for the Kindle version of this classic story by Lewis Carroll.I confess almost all books I buy for the Kindle are works for which I already have a paper copy, sometimes two, if it is a translation. I buy the Kindle editions in order to easily search for particular quotes and passages. These passages I commonly paste into writings I do on the Bible, and Lewis Carroll's works are some of my favorites, behind Shakespeare and Plato.I mention all this because unlike many other books, this edition is actually better for reading than it is for the purpose I just mentioned, because it does not have the pagination which would enable one to refer back to the original copy. In most Kindle books, you can locate the printed page number by doing a query on a word on that page. That's a bit hokey, but that's what you have to do. That trick does not work on this edition. Rules for scholarly source citations have not yet caught up with editions which are formatted especially for the Kindle.But for reading, the Kindle converters got two things very right. First, the edition has all of Sir John Tenniel's drawings. They didn't even spoil them by having them colorized, even thoughh the thumbnail picture in the Amazon header is colored. Second, formatting for poetry loses absolutely nothing as the size of the page or font is changed. This is especially important for that unique example of \\"concrete poetry\\", \\"A Mouse's Tale\\" which appears in chapter III."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I thought for sure the BBC would get Alice in Wonderland right and to some degree they have. The actors all do their parts very well and overall this CD is enjoyable. It will be maddening though to Alice fans who expect the script to follow the book. I don't understand why it was thought necessary to change the plot line almost at whim and then insert \\"The Walrus and the Carpenter\\" (from Through the Looking Glass). What's wrong with the way Carroll wrote the book? His logic is far superior to this adaption. I felt frustrated throughout when incidents or characters were skipped, but then turned up later in the story. Surely the BBC could have done better with one of Great Britain's classics!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"While this version does have illustrations, they are not the original illustrations by John Tenniel, which was what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is of course a classic story that has seen many, many printings. That said, I am very impressed with this edition. The binding is excellent, the paper quality is great (even the dust jacket), the print quality is great, the cloth page-marker is a nice touch, and the size of the book is perfect: classy and noticeable without being too large. I highly recommend this edition."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"What a classic! Everyone knows the story of Alice in Wonderland, made even more popular by Disney years ago. All I knew of Alice was the Disney cartoon and the artwork of Tenniel and Rackham. What I didn't know was the brilliant writing style of Lewis Carroll, the author who created Alice and her Wonderland.Carroll is one of the most clever writers I have read. I kept thinking to myself as I read this book, \\"how the hell did he come up with this?\\" The dialogue is pure genius. I loved every minute of the Mad Hatter and his tea party.The story is very short and without much of a plot, but that is what can be expected of a dream. It's sort of just a walk down the rabbit hole and through wonderland. But in that walk, we meet fascinating creatures; creatures and objects present in the real world, but with a fantastical twist.What I loved more than anything was the book itself. I got a beautiful edition of this book through Dreamhaven, published by Firefly. It was a $30 on sale for $7.95. It's hardcover, clothbound, with thick, high quality paper and illustrations that I've never seen before for Alice.The illustrations are done by Ralph Steadman. His work looked familiar and I found out that he is the artist from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I didn't know what to think of the images at first, but I liked them by the end. They are definitely geared towards a more adult audience, but then again, I forget what it's like to be a kid. He adds a certain edge to the characters. The characters become menacing and bizarre. He gives a great introduction in the book and explains why he drew each one of the images the way he did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I've been looking for these editions since a certain bookstore stopped carrying them a couple tears ago. They are small, about 4x6. So they are perfect for carrying around in your purse or bag for a bit of reading wherever you may go. My book doesn't have the picture on the cover but its almost identical other than that. (I believe the ones with cover pictures came as part of sets.) My copy does have some illustrations inside in black and white.If you want a really cute, small hardcover Alice in Wonderland, perfect for reading anytime, pick this up.***As per the reviewer above... the writing is small. Has to be for the book size! So if you need regular print, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"An occasional review will focus on this point. Alice in Wonderland is no more children's book than, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".The reason this five star book gets less stars occasionally is not because of its contents or purpose; it is because of either being mistaken for a kids book, in which case one wonders why it is forced on kids, or it is so dated that even the reader thinks it is gobbledygook.You will find the book full of references to items of the time and play on words of the time.If you fall into either of these categories then you need to first purchase \\"The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition\\"; this will clear this understandable confusion. Be aware that every sentience is a play on words for a jab at the culture of that time.I will not go through the story, as that is why you are buying this book. However I will say that it is a classic and should be part of everyone's cultural education.When you make it through this book and enjoy it the next challenge should be \\"Alice's Abenteuer Im Wunderland\\" German Translation.If you are also interested in sci-fi then try to get a copy of \\"Mimsy Were the Borogoves\\" by Henry Kuttner.Best of Henry Kuttner \\"Mimsy Were the Borogoves\\""},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is a horrible digitalization of a book.

Alice's Adventures In Wonderland is a literary treasure for readers of all ages. The quality book binding incorporates a built-in bookmark on a ribbon that says \\"Read Me\\", in a delightful complement to this widely beloved story. Due to the coffee-table size of this edition, it may be a little physically large and heavy for younger readers to handle, and therefore is better suited for parents to read aloud to their children.

Some books drag from the very beginning, but this children's story didn't. There were surprises from the start. This book is an all original example of using your imagination. Lewis Carrol was gifted enough to let his imagination go wild, and to write it down on paper. This book inspires me to write any sort of crazy thing that is worth writing. This book is about Alices adventures from the time she saw the peculiar White Rabbit with a waistcoat and watch. She meets thrilling but very arguementive creatures and charectors such as the caterpiller who smokes, the Duchess and her baby which turns into a pig, a Mock Turtle, a gryphon, and the most famous the Chesire cat and the Queen of Hearts. This book is a bit different than the Disney movie.

With writing like Caroll's I am not disappointed."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I read \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" (hereafter \\"Alice\\") in college during the 1980s. Reading an annotated edition was probably indispensable because without it, I probably would have concluded, like many others, that \\"Alice\\" was an unrestrained, loony, dream-like fantasy - a literal pipe dream. But being in a collegiate, analytical situation, I was expected to plumb \\"Alice\\"'s metaphysical situation for some profound truths. As even the foreward to my \\"Alice\\" version warned, it would be relatively easy to construct a psychological, social, or historical dissertation from the characters and situations 7-year old Alice encounters. In other words, one could read practically any literary theme into the work. Fun as this scavenger hunt might be, I think there's really only one significant theme \\"Alice\\" reinforces - stay young and childlike and innocent as long as you can, because adulthood is harsh and inconsistent and insane.Consider the evidence. Almost every character Alice meets in Wonderland is a pedantic, supercilious, self-important adult that treats her with impatient disdain. Almost every character gives Alice contradictory, unfathomable advice and rules, symbolically underscored by the changes in bodily size and proportions Alice undergoes. We have the declaration from the Cheshire Cat (a relatively innocuous but still didactic adult figure) that everyone in Wonderland is mad to some degree. The authoritative nature of Wonderland's adults culminates in the ultimate authority figure - the utterly but irrationally and impotently tyrannical Queen of Hearts - who screams for beheadings but never accomplishes any. The most humorous denunciation of adult rules and customs arises during the \\"climactic\\" silly trial about some stolen tarts, where legal protocol undergoes zany pretzel contortions. Throughout, the \\"immature\\" Alice sees through the pontifications and does not take Wonderland's sneering condescension lightly, especially during the trial ending when the cards exasperatedly indundate her and cause her to wake from her dream, glad to lying in the grass next to a peaceful summer stream.To be more precise, Carroll championed a prolonged childhood for little girls, since he considered young boys unmannered churls and had a barely respectful fondness for Alice Liddell, to whom he dedicated \\"Alice\\". According to the annotation's foreward, as a minister who toiled in religious privacy, he would often look from his rectory and envy Alice's and her siblings' frolicks outside. With that knowledge, \\"Alice\\" as a Peter Pan-like paean to eternal youth becomes more understandable. What also makes \\"Alice\\" memorable is the bold assertion that a child can weather the eccentricities of an \\"adult\\" world better than most adults can."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"this book was very entertaing and is a reallygood classic. its price is awesome so i dont think you can go wrong with this."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"A long fall down a deep rabbit hole lined with book selves and small bottles should cause angst in anyone.

It turns out there's no such monster in the book (or in the sequel, \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" - as far as wiki tells me).What's marvelous though is everything else that *is* in the book. What other book has created so many characters that live on in our world? The Mad Hatter, the Queen of Hearts, the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the Duchess, the Mock Turtle, Alice herself (and this isn't counting all the myriad characters from \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" like Tweedle Dee, Tweedle Dum, Humpty Dumpty, the Walrus and the Carpenter... I must read this second book now). \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" comes close, but as a child of British colonial rule, it's Alice's story, not Dorothy's that I remember best.\\"Why is a raven like a writing desk?\\"Why indeed. I loved all the mad things that happen so casually: the caterpillar smoking, Alice growing and shrinking, the never ending tea party, the \\"Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.\\" And I especially loved how there's no moral, no lessons learned, no neat resolution.

In that respect, if you are using this Kindle ebook as a means to read the story to your children, I would recommend either a pdf version with pictures or purchasing an illustrated version (they aren't expensive at all at this point). Otherwise, if you are reading this simply to sate your own curiosity as to the actual story or to reread the tale now that you are an adult, then this version is fine and you should be able to get along without the pictures.Don't get me wrong, the pictures are a definite added bonus and classic, but I find it hard to argue against downloading this classic anyway, as, well, its free.

I think it's because I'm not a big fan of Disney's animated Alice, and that kind of put me off from reading the actual story. I also have to admit the unsavory rumors about Lewis Carroll also steered me away from reading this one.I put that aside and decided to finally read this classic. I found Alice's Adventures in Wonderland a delight. As soon as Alice falls down the rabbit hole, I found myself swept into Carroll's lyrical and strange storytelling and didn't stop reading until the end.Alice herself is the one who captivates the reader.\\"For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.\\"After falling down the rabbit hole, Alice encounters some strange characters, the Chesire Cat, the Queen of Hearts and the Mad Hatter among them. The encounters Alice has with these characters are funny and strange and I enjoyed the silliness of the story. Interestingly enough, this genre is referred to as literary nonsense.Lewis Carroll was a mathematician and that is evident as you read this story.\\"Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is - oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! \\"My favorite chapter was 5, Advice from a Caterpillar.I found it amusing that Alice comes upon a caterpillar sitting on a mushroom, smoking a hookah no less.\\"The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.'Who are you?' said the Caterpillar.\\"I enjoyed this fairy tale and will be reading Through the Looking Glass next."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I bought the book strictly for the artwork of Camille Rose Garcia.

I had only seen the Disney version as a child and as an adult desired to read the original, then decided to purchas this version because of the illustrations. I was not disappointed. Having been down a rabbit hole or two myself, I greatly enjoyed this nonsensical, imaginative tale. Although pinned as a children's book, the story is equally as enjoyable for the young at heart. Camille Rose Garcia's vibrant, haunting style perfectly compliments the dark whimsical story by Carroll.

His other works include Alice Through the Looking Glass, Phantasmagoria, Sylvie and Bruno, and Rhyme? And Reason? All of which are very creative and imaginative, but his best would have to be Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The book is enjoyed by most, but fantasy lovers and mature young adults seem to really love it. Once you read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, you get hooked and you have to read more. Carroll paints a vivid picture of Wonderland and all of it's crazy inhabitants you find around every corner. Each chapter has a different plot and character even though the complete novel has a pretty well known main idea. Carroll keeps it interesting all through the book. You can really tell that he's trying to get the point across of the world not being perfect and it would be better if people just went with the flow. I would definitely recommend this to my friends.

I'm just so excited that Kindle is getting such specific support so early on."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I love classic literature to begin with, and so I was sure I would enjoy this book. Well, I enjoyed it to an extent, mainly when Alice was speaking with herself or exploring. But when characters began speaking or interacting with Alice, I was left scratching my head (probably much like Alice.) I'm sorry to the fans of Lewis Carrol, but I did not like Alice Adventure's in Wonderland. Why? Because while there was a protagonist, there really wasn't an antagonist. There was no hardly any plot, no theme, no conflict, and no resolution. There really was no point in Alice's dream. It did not make her a better person. And the characters in the book while amusing, literally had no point. Sorry, but no matter how many cents I have, it will never make enough sense for me. Won't read again."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I never had any idea where this book was going. I know that in some cases, that may be a good thing, but I'm not so sure it was good in this case. I don't believe that there was much plot at all, nor was there much of a climax. Throughout this whole book, I couldn't help but think to myself that there was something extremely wrong, so to speak, with Lewis Carroll."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"When I first downloaded this book I was a bit disappointed. I had previously purchased BLTC Press's version of \\"Through the Looking Glass\\". The illustrations in Wonderland were considerably lower in quality (it was published at an earlier date).

A few weeks later I was notified that the images had been upgraded (how's that for responsiveness to a customer?). I've swapped out the original for the updated version. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I was great to relive a childhood book that just shows how a childs imagination should be. A classic that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a wonderful piece of literature. The characters described by Lewis Carroll make the reader feel part of another world. Alice is a young naive girl who encounters some unfortunate events during her time in Wonderland. I do not agree with responders who say they did not like the book because, I honestly loved this book. All of the characters have their own unique personalities. Even if some of those personalities are strange, they are different none-the-less. This version of the book was more than helpful to me while I was reading it for a school project. The fantastic illustrations kept my imagination alive as I read along.One of my personal favorite characters is the Mock Turtle. When Alice first encounters him, he is singing about Mock Turtle Soup, which is strange because he is singing about a soup made out of his own flesh! The Mock Turtle is one of the characters that the readers will wonder how Carroll could have ever imagined. I enjoy this character because of his strange personality and even stranger way of thinking. Another character that I believe is extremely funny is the Duchess. She is mad; her baby is truly a pig; her servants are insane and her Cheshire Cat has a mocking smile! These are only two of the characters that make this story exciting and compel readers to finish the novel.I was in the musical production of Alice in Wonderland, and I loved the story so much I couldn't keep myself from reading the book! The book had many similarities and differences from the musical, but the general storyline was the same. The main difference from the book to the musical was the elimination of the minor characters. The musical did not include the lizards or the dozen animals that were washed away in Alice's pool of tears. (Just the three birds and the French Mouse!)I would definitely recommend this book to all readers! Young children will not understand all of the adult themes, but the unusual characters and great illustrations will certainly capture their interests. Furthermore, hearing one classic can get them to become more interested in other classics in the future."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Review of \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" by Lewis Carroll is a classic fantasy that is wonderful for Middle School students who love to read.This fascinating book is about an adventurous and curious girl named Alice who follows a \\"White Rabbit\\" and mistakenly falls into a long, long hole. When she lands she is in an amazing new land called Wonderland. Wonderland is a world of crazy ideas and unfamiliar rhymes. Alice meets many new characters such as, The Mad Hatter, The Dormouse, The March Hare, The Queen of Hearts, a Duchess, a Gryphon, a footman that is actually a fish, and The Cheshire Cat, as she tries new adventures to get herself back home. She doesn't just meet these characters she also battles with them in a court case which is bizarrely unfair , she plays crochet, and even continually shrinks and grows herself. She gets herself tied up in odd situations but her curiosity carries her onward. In the end Alice discovers something truly amazing!\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is a great book for children who love to be urged onward by amazing and fascinating descriptive word choices and crazy creatures. This book is not very difficult but is not easy either. It may seem like a childish book but it really keeps your mind going and thinking about what will happen next.

Out of the many editions I would recommend the Alice's Adventures in Wonderland illustrated by Helen Oxenbury. Helen Oxenbury is a talented illustrator who won England's Kate Greenaway medal for illustrators. She draws Alice like a modern girl very different from Disney's Alice whith her neat hair, apron, and the poofy dress. Some of the pictures are coloured and some are not. This is the unabridged story with a bigger font than the others. It is better for readers because novels usually have small fonts which are very hard to read.This book would be awsome for Christmas, Hannukah and Easter presents or just a present for your family and maybe for yourself because it it paper back. However, it has thicker paper than the fragile pages in other paperback novels. I would not recommend this for traveling because it weighs more then the other paper back novels.You might get another version of Alice in Wonderland because you think that you are not going to read it again after you finish, but if you get this book, you will want to read it again and again after you finish."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Charles Lutwidge Dodgson was born in 1832 and lectured Mathematics at Christ CHurch, Oxford, for 26 years. He was best known, however, as a author - writing under his pseudonym, Lewis Carroll. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" - commonly referred to as \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" - was first published in 1865. Alice, of course, was based on a real person - Alice Liddell, whose father was the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University and the Dean of Christ Church College.Sitting by a riverbank on a warm day with her sister - who has her nose buried in a book - Alice is bored beyond belief. So, when a fully-clothed, watch-carrying White Rabbit comes charging past, commenting how it's going to be late, she's obviously a little curious. Only a moment after the Rabbit had disappeared down a rabbit-hole, Alice herself jumped right in to find out what was happening. After a long trip down, she touches down in Wonderland...though, unfortunately, it doesn't take long for the Rabbit to get away. Still, she finds the key to a door leading off the hallway she's standing in...if only she were small enough to fit through it.I vaguely remember having read it as a kid, and I liked the Chesire Cat much more now than I did then. (I've always been a dog lover, but I may have felt honour-bound to dislike all *cats* as a kid. Still, Alice could have been a more discreet in bragging about her cat Dinah to a mouse and various birds...) My favourite characters, however, were the Mock Turtle and the Gryphon. A short and easily read book overall, and one that really doesn't take too long in getting through. (However, having read up a bit more about the book, there seems to have been a lot of parodies, in-jokes and hidden references written into the book - most of which were lost on me. It didn't stop me enjoying the book though)."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I love it! It is just like the movie that just came out, except a lot more describtive.

Children are children and they only have grown-up age in front of them as a limited world and a perspective, the latter of which they may change when they are grown up by remembering what childhood was for them and the tales they entertained when they were children in order to tell them to a new generation of children. Lewis Carroll leads Alice into a world where everyday objects and animals, but also strange objects and animals, mix. Everything is right and wrong at the same time. Too small or too big. Everything speaks and tells stories or sings songs that remind Alice of songs she knows but that come out strange and distorted. This whole world of wonderland is a suddenly animated pack of cards in a doll's house and doll's garden. But at the same time Lewis Carroll invests the fears and the fantasms of the child into this world. We then can have and see a father figure and a mother figure that loom high in this world and represent a completely aborted sense of justice. Alice, the child, becomes the one who puts things together and back to straightness by just dreaming this disrupted world awake. She only nostalgically remembers the fascination that was hers and the strangeness that was that world's. Waking up brings her back to normality and clears this wonderland of the menaces it contained. Lewis Carroll is a genius when he thus depicts a world of fear and frustration and shows how this world can become marvellous in real life because it is the antipodes of everyday regular society.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I ordered this book twice and both times received the wrong book.

For example the Caterpillar smoking a hookah. I didn't know what hookah was until last year. I was really confused in some parts of the novel. This book I thought was great for someone that hasn't even heard of Alice in Wonderland. It is a very thin book but it was like reading a children's book.

Once the rabbit went down a well-like hole, she soon followed, falling down and down for what seemed like forever. At her landing, she appeared in a whole new world, with talking caterpillars, floating/disappearing cats, and food that makes you grow and shrink. Another major aspect of the rising action is when Alice ate a special cake that made her grow extremely large in the rabbit's house. It made her realize how weird this Wonderland was.I enjoyed the beginning of this book because it was very interesting how random organisms were talking, for example, a smoking caterpillar. Another interesting factor was the bottle that read \\"Drink Me\\" and the cake that read \\"Eat Me\\"; the liquid made her shrink while the cake made her grow. Once it got towards the middle of the novel, I got progressively confused. I think this book is a little too random: especially when it goes from the Mad-Hatters tea party to the Queen's croquet match. The transitions from each scene made it confusing to read because it went too fast. Another reason this book is confusing is because it was written in 1865 and some of the language is outdated. The style of Lewis Carroll's writing is creative, but extremely odd.

Will Alice be able to make it out of Wonderland before her head is chopped off? Read this book to find out. This book is fiction.I recommend this book for ages 10-12, this book is for anyone with an imagination."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Although the story and characters are powerful enough to be remembered after a 20 years hiatus, reading it again as an adult didn't bring anything more interesting than old pictural memories (and I wonder how much praise has to be given to Disney for that). A classic - still modern today - but one better suited for children (as an adult, it made me curious to read an annotated version though, or an essay about different ways to interpret the text's metaphors ; if someone got a suggestion, let me know about it...)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is a beautiful book and in great shape! My daughter loves this story."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"It all started when Alice was spending a lazy afternoon on a river bank. Suddenly, she looked up to find a White Rabbit in a waistcoat go hopping by. Curious, she got up to follow him into his hole. Suddenly, she found herself falling down, down, down. And when she landed, she was in Wonderland, a strange place full of even stranger creatures. Yes, the animals all talk. But Alice seems to find herself growing or shrinking whenever she eats something. There's a locked door she can't seem to get through. A Caterpillar demands she recite. She visits the strangest tea party she's ever attended. And she plays croquet with the Queen of Hearts where the penalty for winning is a rather harsh \\"Off with her head!\\" Will Alice ever find her way home?I haven't read this book since I was a child. I remember enjoying it then. And I did enjoy it as an adult as well. The story is just crazy enough to capture the imagination of anyone who reads it. There were a couple times when I felt the book got a tad too repetitive, but for the most part the craziness was always fresh and fun.Plus this was a great excuse for some none sense poetry. While this book doesn't have some of Lewis Carroll's more famous I did enjoy what was here, especially \\"How does the little crocodile improve his shining tale.\\"As an adult, I must admit I found it a bit weirder than I remembered. However, keeping in mind the revelation of the final chapter certainly does help keep it in perspective. Ultimately, this is a classic that kids will still enjoy."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"\\"... and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\\" Good advice for reading this book, from the Red King himself.To say that \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is a classic would be to state the obvious. Published originally in 1865, it was taken from stories which the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll) told to three girls, the daughters of Henry George Liddell, including Alice Liddell who is the basis for the heroine of the stories. The stories inside are wonderful and superb nonsense which appeal to readers of all ages, as long as you don't try to read too much into it. The stories are filled with all sorts of absurdities based on language, logic, math, and parody. If you obtain a copy which has notes that discuss what is being parodied, it will add to the fun, certainly, but it isn't necessary because even without the parody it is still great fun. Also, you can certainly find references online to help find the sources which are being parodied.Other than to say that the book is about Alice's adventures it would be difficult to say that there are any great lessons here, other than perhaps to not take things too seriously. At the same time there are certainly some running themes throughout the stories. Size is a key element at some times Alice is very tiny, and at other times incredibly large, and food and drink are the main triggers for these changes. Sense and nonsense is another running theme as there are those who try to make sense out of the nonsense, and others who just enjoy the ride.The book opens with Alice following the white rabbit down the hole, and plummeting deep into the Earth. She meets many characters in her adventures, like the White Rabbit, a mouse, a lizard named Bill, a Caterpiller smoking a hookah, the Duchess, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare the Cheshire Cat, the Mock Turtle, the Red Queen, and many others. The adventures include her descent into Wonderland, her loss of identity with her changes in size, her babysitting a baby which turns into a pig, the endless tea-party, a very unusual croquet game, listening to the Mock Turtle's story, and of course the trial at the end.The stories clearly have long lasting influence as well. In books, movies, music, and art, there are countless examples of works based on the Alice Adventures as well as references to them. One thing those works have done is led to some confusion with regards to the Alice stories. Characters like Tweedledum, Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, and the Red Queen are not in this book, but rather in the sequel \\"Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There\\"."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"i love ralph steadman. his pictorial spin with the classic tale adds a new dimension to the story. this is not your disney princess story book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Tomorrow you will enter a planet where animals talk; you may even feel a bit smaller than usual after drinking a modest drink. There is going to be a door that you may be anxious to go in but not so anxious to drink what's on the table. If you are eager to go inside that door, read Alices Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll.Alices Adventures in Wonderland, where do I originate? Let's start at the beginning, Alice walking around in the forest then she sees a cat in a tree and the next thing you know she is in a room with a miniature little door in it and a drink on the table. One sip will do it you are as small as a mouse. Now figuring out that she can now fit into that tinny tiny little door. What will Alice do in that peculiar world with talking animals and cardish people who talk? If you think this book is right for you than run down to the nearest book store and pick up Alices Adventures in Wonderland, but watch out for the queen, she may behead you!I actually have two ideal parts of this book. My first favorite part of the book is when Alice sips the potion which makes her very small. I like it because in the beginning she really wants to get in a very small door and she realizes that she can now fit in that little door. My second favorite part is when she is at the tea party with the Mad Hatter. I like this part because she is so bewildered with what is happening because it is always tea time.The part of the book that makes me chuckle is when Alice is observing the queen play croquet. I think it is amusing because she is playing with these card/people things and if they do anything wrong the queen would behead them. She thinks they are always doing something wrong so, she always is sending people out to behead them.I would recommend this to people who are gloomy or have a bizarre life because; it would probably comfort someone sad up. It would also relate to someone who has a bizarre life because this is a strange book. I think this is for people 10-14 years of age. I give this book 5 stars, so read Alices Adventures in Wonderland."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"As everyone knows the story, the five stars I rated it are for Ralph Steadman's drawings. I've always loved the original illustrations, so it was with some trepidation that I got this book. But I love Mr. Steadman's other work, so I held out hope that this was just as good. And they are - they go great with the story - and manage to be both whimsical and creepy at the same time. I love it. the only thing that I don't like about the book is that it isn't longer - unlike a lot of versions of Alice in Wonderland this one does NOT also include Through the Looking Glass.

Funny reason, yes, but it's true. I have never read this book before now, having only watched the cartoon movie. It's an interesting story, since it is supposed to be dream like, and so fun to read, out loud or silently. I think this is a great book for young people and young-at-heart people. If you've never read it, it's a must-read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is for most children pure pleasure. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's codes in the text, or debate this or that, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing \\"The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new.\\"There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters, my preferred is the Cat! - fantastical and totally normal creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences.For more than 130 years, children love the delightfully non-moralistic, non-sense, nopn-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education.Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are almost as important as the well-loved story.And for 0,00 Pounds, Dollars, Euros to pay - what can You lose?It is a whole win-win situation!Grab, people, grab!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Point: Dreams can be life-like and life can be dream-like.Path: Originally told as a children's story while rowing on the Isis river, this story was eventually written down and published. Carroll follows an inquisitive Alice down rabbit burrows, through animal homes, flamingo croquet games, under disappearing cats, and back home again.Sources: Many have suggested ideas for possible illusions and references in this work. The most likely is that Carroll was imagining what a dream would be like in real life.Agreement: I enjoyed the musings following the book more than the book itself. While reading it everything seemed so disjointed and combobulated - which is exactly the point. After completing the book I found myself pondering reality through through the eyes of a dream.Personal App: In a dream, extraordinary happenings make sense. Perhaps reality would be a little more exciting if I were to slow down and really think about what I take for granted. There is magic all around.Favorite Quote: \\"Alice looked at the jury-box and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.\\" Moving its tail in a melancholy way! That is funny.Note: It is worth it to pick up an edition with the original sketches."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I just couldn't get enough of this book. I loved this book so well I can't give it enough stars. This story and its characters was so pure and simple I could imagine myself with Alice. It was humorous...sometimes I was laughing so hard I was crying. I enjoyed this book more than words can express. This book, everything about it, was beautiful, simply beautiful. The setting was so vivid and expressionfilled. The funniest parts were when Alice met the Queen of Hearts. The were playing crochet with living animals. Then there was the time Alice was talking with the Gryphon and the Turtle. The Turtle was obviously extremely erroneous concerning education. He was describing his school to Alice, and he said \\"history\\" was \\"mystery\\" and a lot of other twisted up tales. Then there was the Rabbit, March Hare, Hatter, and the Dormouse, who alone made up a curious group. The Dormouse apparently had problems with a sleeping disorder, as he could fall asleep standing up. Then there was the Duchess, who had a baby who resembled a pig, and the silly cook who threw everything within reach at the Duchess. Another odd character (all of Lewis Carroll's characters are odd) was the Chesire Cat, who could disappear just like that. There were many others, including a courtroom full of poor fools who toppled over when Alice made a sudden move, which I did not mention. The extra bossy Queen seemed to have a problem beheading anyone for the slightest offense, while the weak King pardoned them all behind her back. As it turned out, this whole story was all a strange dream which Alice had while she was resting outside with her big sister. Anyway, this was a wonderful book, and you should read it for yourself...one of the best books I've ever read, and yes, up till now. This book had a really great impression on me, and I found myself saddened to see myself coming to the end of it. I highly recommend this book to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Jim Dale could read a cookbook and it would be awesome. This audio rendition of Alice in Wonderland is well, wonderful :-)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Lewis Carroll's nearly 150 year old story has never gone out of print. It has been translated into over 120 languages, and there are over 100 different editions. This classic fairy-tale is deeply imbedded in both children and adults of the Western world.The young blonde protagonist was inspired by 10-year-old Alice Pleasance Liddell, who so loved Carroll's candid story about her that she persuaded him to write it down. He provided her with a copy that he illustrated himself called Alice's Adventures Underground. Soon after, he expanded the story adding the scenes with the Cheshire cat and the Mad Hatter. And with help from an incredible illustrator, John Tenniel, he published the first edition called Alice's Adventures in Wonderland in 1865.The book is very short. I read it on my iPhone Kindle app all in one sitting (I was on the bus for TWO hours because of Red Sox traffic). It jumps right into the story: On the first page, Alice is already falling down the giant hole where the Rabbit disappeared. Alice is a strange child and you get the impression that she often plays by herself and mostly lives in her head (perhaps she's an INFP?). She has very entertaining conversations with herself that the narrator handles beautifully:She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.The story is very similar to the Disney version that I grew up with. There were only a few minor things that Disney omitted and with good reason. For example, I could do without the completely absurd scene where a Gryphon and a Mock-Turtle tell Alice about the Lobster Quadrille.On a road trip to Colorado from Arkansas a few years ago, a friend of mine read about half of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland out loud to the rest of us in the car. The illustrations were awesome and......................the words..................................made patterns...................................................on the screen....................................................................like this.That's the way I suggest you read/hear this story.

Specifically, I was looking for a book that would draw her into reading it with exceptional artwork and craftmanship. This is exactly what I got in this edition. One possible drawback is its size. It's a bit large for little hands and portability, but that is a small trade-off for this work of art. Also, the pages are thick so watch out for paper cuts!!! This edition is nice enough to display as an unusual conversation piece on a coffee table, or pass down to the next generation.The booklist reveiwer mentioned that the print was at times distracting, but I think he misses the point. It's meant to enhance the story. For instance, as one character falls the print spirals and gets smaller.

I sampled many Alice in Wonderland and all the Through the Looking Glass books I could find available (at Amazon and Gutenberg org - though today I discover some I missed). I believe I found that the best available editions, if you want both, are:The BLTC at 1.79Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (BLTC Press Edition)- this edition is very well formatted with all the Tenniel illustrations that I recall and is the one I purchased myself.The Bompacrazy at .99Alice in Wonderland (Illustrated)orAlice's Adventures in Wonderland (Illustrated)(these two appear to be exactly the same from the samples as both have the 'blotted out' picture of the Drink Me tag): this is almost as good a choice, though not quite as well formatted. The sample has a Rackham illustration (and there may be more) as well as the many Tenniel, though, which is a plus.The free Gutenberg org versions - lacked the improved linking and formatting, but there are various illustrated editions; may be worth it to you if .99 is too much or you are looking for something other than Tenniel.I did see a kindle version of an 'Original First Edition' Alice which appears to be illustrated by Arthur Rackham - in case you are looking for that one instead of the better known John Tenniel version.Alice In Wonderland - Original First Edition Version Published For Kindle - Lewis CarrollThat edition has no Tenniel illustrations in the sample; also the text seems to be abridged (or just maybe an earlier version?) and the formatting is poor. Note that the picture of Alice looking at the Cheshire Cat in a tree that appears on this linked product page is not the cover that appears on the downloaded sample; the cover that does appear is of Alice walking with the Duchess and looks like this kindle book:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass- now for more typical Amazon mis-linked craziness, this latter edition has Tenniel illustrations, but beware that they are very small thumbnails and enlarge to very poor quality. I do not recommend either of these editions. The Rackham is available at Gutenberg for free.Today I discovered the Master EditionThe Complete Alice in Wonderland (Kindle Master Editions)which I missed before (likely because I was concentrating on Through the Looking Glass, which has far fewer editions, and then pursuing the 'matching' Alice in Wonderlands). Today the price is .89 and I am going to buy it. It is at least as well formatted as the BLTC (based on the sample) and has even more Alice writings (beyond Wonderland and Looking Glass) as well as essays and historical info and other 'add-ons'. He has all the illustrations from Tenniel and additional ones from Holliday and Carroll (I think he should add Rackham's, too).As many others have said, the basic Kindle edition is a very poor choice, and most others also lack the illustrations. Thank goodness for samples.Re Through the Looking Glass, it was the chess board appearing in the BLTC sample (and not in the BompaCrazy sample) that finalized my choice in their favor (before finding the Master). Here are the BLTC and BompaCrazy links:Through the Looking Glass- BLTCThrough the Looking Glass (Illustrated)- BompaCrazyI hope this review helps you find your best choice far more quickly than I did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Unlike other versions for the Kindle, this one has the illustrations and properly formatted poems and songs.

It has been adapted into numerous cartoons, films and plays over the years, and it has become an important backdrop of the World culture. It is a brilliant and zany fairy tale that remains fresh and engaging well over a century after it had been written. This is in large part thanks to the unforgettable and unique characters that are as famous (if not more) as Alice herself: the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the \\"Mad\\" Hatter, the Queen of Hearts and many more. They are among the most idiosyncratic characters in all of literature. However, the aspects of the book that I found the most fascinating were the clever use of language, the numerous puns, and the plays on the difference between the literal and actual meanings of different expressions and saying. It was very amusing to read these, and realize how clever and verbal this book actually is. The book made me reflect again on so many aspects of the world that I take for granted, and it made me feel like a child exploring and learning about various objects, ideas and relations for the first time.

There are many full page illustrations that are simply amazing to look at. With a detailed style that occasionally reminds me of Graeme Base, he populates &quot;Wonderland&quot; with all sorts of exotic birds and animals, some of which aren't usually included in illustrated versions of Alice, such as anteaters, platypuses, hippos, etc. But they lend an air of strangeness to this imaginary world that nonetheless seems to be appropriate. The artist has included a number of unique touches to the world of Alice, and they all fit in wonderfully with the spirit of the book. I would definitely say this book is worth buying for your &quot;Alice&quot; collection."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This classic tale is the best of them all!

First, it was much shorter than I expected. It wasn't nearly as dark as I expected. And I had no idea how it would end. Much has been written about it and it has been over-analyzed beyond belief. I didn't read any of the commentary on it and don't intend to unless one of you sends me a convincing argument as to why I should.My expectations must have come mostly from the 1951 Disney movie. And I expected a darker movie. Maybe I should see the movie again, as and adult and see if I still think it is so dark.I would encourage you to read it, if you have any interest at all.BTW, the version I read looked different from this one, but I couldn't find it on Goodreads or Amazon.

This is a must read book for teenagers and adults expecialy, maybe a little difficult for children. It allows your mind to go on an adventure. I truely admire Lewis Carroll as he points out all the characters leaving the mind full of imagination. The peculiar white rabbit Alice follows in the tunnel leads her to meet all kinds of different characters.Alice gets bigger and smaller through out the whole book as she drinks and eats all kinds of things. The characters make you smile such as the Duchess, Caterpilar who smokes but is wise, Chesire the Cat , lobsters who love to dance, the Mad Hatter, The King and the Queen of Hearts. The end of the story just made me want to read it over again. Let your imagination go a little wild as you read this amazing, brilliant book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"When the new Disney \\"Alice\\" movie came out, I was chagrinned to realize my twelve-year-old daughter had not read the original book. As she had a birthday coming up, I immediately set out to find the perfect hardcover edition. I already owned a copy with black and white illustrations so I really wanted something with color. Many of the books were charming but also seemed geared toward a younger audience. Then, I discovered this edition illustrated by Camille Rose Garcia. I was struck by the unique drawings of what I immediately dubbed \\"Goth Alice.\\" I knew that my artsy \\"tween\\" would love this copy!(which she did!)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Camille Rose Garcia's work, in this new edition of Lewis Carrol's Alices Adventures in Wonderland, is amazing. Her characters and color pallet add even more enchantment to one of my all time favorite stories."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is a magnificent edition of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The binding is very good quality, the pages have the gold edging, and the book itself also has the front and back cover illustrations. For me the last is important, as we bought this book for our 9 year old son, and we always remove the book sleeve covers from his books before he reads them. (Children are not always kind to book sleeves.)The pages are of high quality paper and the illustrations and print are crisp. Also, the book stays flat when opened at all times, very important for children.Best edition I have seen of this classic, and very good for children to read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"One of my two-year-old daughter's favorite movies is a made-for-television version of Alice in Wonderland, so after watching the movie several hundred times I thought maybe it was time to read the book. Though I show a book cover, I actually read this book using DailyLit, a website that sends excerpts of classic literature to my email once a day, which I wrote about in another blog post.I found the book to be an enjoyable romp through a world of nonsense and fantasy, though at times a bit dour as many of the characters did not seem all that happy. I understand that Alice is a child in the story, but I still find it difficult to understand how children can be as lacking in intelligence as she is throughout her adventures - I don't recall being quite so foolish as Alice is at this age. My favorite part of the book was actually after Alice exits Wonderland and sits with her sister, telling her all about her travels. I was able to appreciate the story more once I found an entry in Wikipedia on the novel that explained much of what I did not understand, such as the various poetry recitations and songs, the real people that the characters were parodied after, the mathematical concepts explored, and the elusive answer to the Hatter's riddle, \\"Why is a raven like a writing desk?\\" Answer: \\"Because it can produce a few notes, though... they are very flat; and it is never put with the wrong end in front!\\"Perhaps I have been disillusioned to the magic of this novel thanks to a combination of Disney's animated film and my daughter's obsession with her movie, but I would rate this book as a decently entertaining read, not one of my favorites. Though ,I am greatly looking forward to the upcoming movie Alice in Wonderland that stars Johnny Depp!!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"A high quality book with beautiful cover. I would have preferred more illustrations because I am reading it to my Alice obsessed 4 year old. She starts to lose interest with the text being quite adult. The quality of the illustrations are high and most suitable for older children at the stage where they can read it alone."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I have always loved this book and Jim Dale is a wonderful narrorator. Excellent purchase!!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"As a child, Disney's Alice in Wonderland was my favorite movie. I loved the colors and the nonsensical fun. Carroll's novel does not lack in amusement; however, the book is far more than the silly story I know from my childhood. At a deeper level, the book is full of fascinating symbolism that mirrors political strife and unraveling social norms of Carroll's time. I truly believe that Alice's Adventures in Wonderland has something to offer readers of all ages, from a child's bedtime story all the way through adulthood. It's a relatively easy read, very funny, and includes no questionable content. I'd recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Lewis Carroll's classic story. Nothing more, nothing less.

Oh dear! I shall be too late, the Rabbit say to itself..and when he actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and hurried on and popped down a large hole, curious Alice, went after it never considering how she was to get out again.Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? She tried to curtsey as she spoke...Ma'am is this new Zealand or Australia?... \\"Curiouser and curiouser\\" cried Alice... Now I'm opening like a largest telescope...Good-bye, feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet.... When suddenly thump, thump, the rabbit was still in sight as it turned the corner saying..Oh dear! Oh dear! How late it's getting... ( from the book)And it goes on and on...and on. Of course the plot and the narrative are totally nonsensical but if you let your imagination roam and let yourself fall into its spell you will be transported along with Alice to a magical world with its memorable characters such as Mad Hatter having tea parties, and the terrifying Queen of Hearts threatening to behead everyone. You will meet Cheshire the cat, the turtle, the Duchess, Bill the Lizard, the Mouse, the Dodo, the Lory and Caterpillar and many more weird characters all the while growing and shrinking from drinking lotions and potions saying \\"Drink me\\". Ultimately you will move around very fast and achieve nothing...till you wake up and realize this was all but a dream...This adventure has inspired numerous comic books, films, TV movies through countless adaptations and hundreds of editions of the book throughout the years. This story was one of the freebees on my e-reader so I decided to give it a go. Early in I missed the visual aspect I have always associated with Alice, but as my imagination kicked in and the characters came alive, it became easier to understand the humour and wits that played within the words and admit it was a refreshing experience. However my fondest memories take me back to the animated version created by the late Walter Disney and his Studios. Who ever said a picture is worth a thousand words really knew how to leave a lasting impression in a little girl's mind"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"My Aunt gave me a BedBook Classics Alice n Wonderland Bedbook for my Birthday and I feel in love with the format.

Kippy Lampkins"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice is of course a well known classic, having spawned many spin-off movies & sci-fi stories & it's well referenced by many intelligent people who love this kind of silliness. It's been one of my favorite books since I first read it in high school because I had finished The Hobbit & a friend told me I had to read Alice. Like Tolkien, Lewis Carroll creates a very complete world that quickly draws you in & that you can return to at any time & feel like you've always been there. For me, I can't really remember what it was like to have not read Alice. It's very much like what a critic/scholar of Shakespeare once said of the bard \\" Shakespeare is in the air....\\" Alice is as well.....& in your head..........& under the ground..........."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I purchased two copies of this delightful book. Two, because I wanted to keep one for myself (even though I have small children, it is actually MINE! I share it with them if their extra good...!) and give one to a colleague as a thank you gift (another adult!). Nancy is a renown doll artist, with a high level of both imagination and skill. The book's illustrations are photographs of Nancy's amazing hand-crafted dolls and sets. This process creates a unique half-fantasy, half-reality image you feel as though you could step into. So, my recommendation is~ when purchasing this book as a gift, get one for yourself to get lost in as well."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"It amuses me that this is listed as being for \\"ages 9-12.\\" Really? I read this (and the sequel) as an adult and loved it. It thoroughly deserves its status as a classic and can be enjoyed by adults and children alike."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I had always thought that I knew Alice's story. I had watched the 50's Disney animated movie and suffered the ensuing nightmares during my childhood and those memories stuck with me. When I actually read the book I found not so many discrepancies, as is usually the case when going from adaptions to sources, but a whole additional layer of complexity and humor. Indeed, while the movie makes a great (if terrifying) children's movie, the book makes for great entertainment for all ages.If you haven't ever read the book, and especially if all you know about the story is its many adaptions, you are selling yourself short. This is a charming, odd, and softly humorous story that is both short and captivating."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Here is another excellent full-cast dramatization from the BBC; with an emphasis on the wacky, surreal aspects of Lewis Carroll's fantasy classic \\"Alice In Wonderland.\\" The sound effects are used to great advantage here; especially whenever Alice (excellently portrayed by Sarah-Jane Holm) eats or drinks anything and changes size; from small to tall and back again. This adaptation even has bottles, cupboards, and food talking back to Alice!This BBC dramatization is likely to leave the listener feeling slightly disoriented; which is precisely how Alice felt in Wonderland. The cast, led by Sarah-Jane Holm, is superb; especially The Caterpiller, The Queen Of Hearts, and The Mad Hatter. As portrayed here, the celebrated Mad Tea Party with Alice, the Mad Hatter, March Hare, and Dormouse almost goes over the edge into total insanity."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"my daughter thought the book is good but not to good.

It also includes an interesting introduction about the author.These things aren't included in the free versions, and I think they are worth having for $2,99."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I really felt that this book jumped around too much. I could hardly keep track of where Alice was from the top of one page to the bottom, or how she moved from one location to the next. It was just hard to keep up. The entire book was just nonsense, yes I realize that's the point, but I really felt like there was nothing or little to be gleaned from it. I liked Through the Looking Glass a lot more. It too is about Alice's adventures in Wonderland and is also an imaginative little book, however Through the Looking Glass had more structure and was more interesting. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was a lot closer to the Disney cartoon version than I would have thought. So I guess maybe if you liked the Disney movie this book is for you? Too much nonsense for me. It jumped around so much I just kept zoning out then I would have to reread to try and figure out what had just happened. It was definetly a struggle for me to finish. It was plotless so I never really got into the book or emotionally attached to any of the characters. In general I would say if you want to experience Lewis Carroll read Through the Looking Glass instead and just watch the Disney version and that will show you this book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"A Classic is a classic a classic. The detailed notes are a delight and enhances readability. However the title did not mention if its an abridged version or a complete version."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I've just started to read the book \`Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' written by Lewis Carrol. I decided to read the fairy tale on the kindle as it was offered on Amazon for free. I watched the movie when I was a child and wanted to read the story behind the film. Since it is aimed at children the story is easy to read. But still recommended for adults! Once you start reading you quickly get enchanted by the exciting journey through a fantasy world full of curious creatures and places. Adults might love the dark and frightening side of the story. Indeed, Alice is totally alone and needs to survive. I really like the fantasy creatures in the book. Especially the Cheshire Cat which represents the crazy world in a very good way. One easily understands the strange feelings Alice must get while speaking to the cat.Unfortunately, the book on the kindle does not come with illustrations. I think they would help to inspire your imagination. But this doesn't take anything away from the story.If you compare the movie and the book, I think both are great. Since I have not finished the book yet I cannot make a final comment on this. But I expect the book to be at least as great as the film, most likely better.At this stage I can say - So delightfully inspiring that I was quickly taken back to childhood...So far I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"There are books that we read because we need to in order to be well rounded and culturally informed people and then there are books we read because they are good, solid, entertaining books. Alice in Wonderland has the distinction of being both an important classic and a beautiful, creative, and whimsical story.Everyone knows the story of Alice and how she fell down a rabbit hole ending up in Wonderland. If it was enough to just know the story there would be no point in taking this book off the shelf. But it's not just about the plot but about the way that Carroll writes. He does such a wonderful job of capturing our inner child, of looking at the world and reminding us how we ourselves use to see it and what we might have though if we found ourselves in Alice's place.Shorter than you might imagine and perfect for any age, this is a story you will read over and over again.Alice came to a fork in the road. \\"Which road do I take?\\" she asked.\\"Where do you want to go?\\" responded the Cheshire cat.\\"I don't know,\\" Alice answered.\\"Then,\\" said the cat, \\"it doesn't matter.\\"-Lewis Carroll"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I was first introduced to this book as a child and was immediately fascinated with its vivid characters and whimsical nature.

Amazing to see work created 20-30 years ago that has so obviously influenced a generation of contemporary artists. This book is highly recommended to anyone interested in contemporary art. If you don't know the work of Joe Brainard, this retrospective will impress, and if you are already an admirer of this extraordinary talent, this is a must have for your art library."},{"Title":"Joe Brainard: A Retrospective","review":"My route to Joe was different from Houseseller's. I came to him through his mimeo'd writings in the 60s - his intimacy, his lack of pretention (coupled with a certain wry scepticism) were utterly disarming - but the graphics were always present too. This retrospective incorporates some text but would complement Joe's Collected nicely. So glad the world's caught up! Having Georges Perec as your disciple must have helped; not only was he first to copy the now somewhat overworked I Remember format, but Joe's play with 'secret' Nancy and pansy codes may have given him ideas"},{"Title":"BIG BIRD'S SESAME STREET DICTIONARY Volume 5","review":"We have the entire collection of Big Bird's Dictionaries.I like the way that they show the letter, make a word of it and also use the word in a story. I believe these books are great, very educational and have colorful pictures. I recommend this product."},{"Title":"Starburst","review":"I've read a lot of short stories...from Vonnegut to Kafka, H.G. Wells to Neil Gaiman. But none of those remotely compare to what you'll find in Bester's short stories. His stories are all fast-paced, and he gets his meaning across. He doesn't have to put in a lot of nonsense just to take up space. If his story is three pages long, so be it! He doesn't add another 15 pages just for the sake of having a long story. If he gets his message across, he ends his story. I think a lot of authors nowadays should take note! But just in terms of science-fiction, it's easy to see why Bester has had so much influence on the sci-fi community. His ideas are so awesome. He was like so many other science-fiction authors: ahead of his time! What I like most about his short stories is how we get a glimpse of characters that appear in Bester's larger works. For instance, some of the characters from &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot; appear in some of these short stories. I just think it adds to the fun.I can't even say a coherent statement about this book, and I apologize. I'm just still in shock. I think that if you like science-fiction, Alfred Bester in particular, or just like to read, you NEED to read at least one of Bester's short stories. After that, you'll be hooked."},{"Title":"Starburst","review":"I picked this book up along with Bester's _The Stars My Destination._I only bought the _Starburst_ anthology because I wanted to read more from Bester. I was not prepared to be blown away by his entertaining and breezy writing style. Yet Bester's topics are for adults, not grownup children.Thematically, each story is so different from the next. Bester, although didactic in a philosophical sense, writes some very serious themes such as which choices go into making one a mature, existential human being.I was simply enchanted by his ability to take a simple story, one after another, and weave such complex themes of the human condition into them!This man understood mankind, he understood self-delusion, and he understood the vice of wishful thinking. That is \\"Hobson's Choice.\\" Such a profound thinker as Bester should not be underestimated. The insight just sneaks up on you! All in a tale of a simple statistician and time travel...True, \\"Travel Diary\\" is clever but ultimately inane and condescending, but it is still a valid critique of a cultural type that may have been rampant in the early 50's, the \\"Ugly American.\\" Perhaps a few readers read themselves into this mindset and feel uncomfortable. Who knows?\\"Fondly Fahrenheit,\\" an android story, told in a brief twenty pages is as good in its exploration of insanity and the criminal \\"split personality\\" as the Hitchcock/Bloch film \\"Psycho.\\"\\"Starcomber\\" involves the existential yet \\"simple\\" element of choice. Prepare to have yourself examined.At some level, I suspect that reading--and thinking about--this anthology is as good as 6 months of psychoanalysis.Definitely science fiction for grownups."},{"Title":"Starburst","review":"I got this book second-hand based on the review below. I had not read any of Alfread Bester's work previously. The first five short stories in Starburst are pretty good, but the rest, which take up the second half of the book, are filler. I would suggest going with a different collection of short stories as Starburst is a pretty mediocre collection and didn't give me the impression that Bester was a particularly good short story writer."},{"Title":"Score! My Twenty-Five Years with The Broad Street Bullies","review":"This book is probably the best history of the Flyers that you could find out there.

My Twenty-Five Years with The Broad Street Bullies","review":"No one can tell a story the way Gene Hart did. He made you feel as though you were a part of every experience he retells in this book. Gene's love &amp; passion for the game of hockey and the Philadelphia Flyers is clearly evident in this book. Gene not only chronicles the Flyers history from their entrance into the NHL, he also gives you a deep insight into the pride and character of a close knit group of players. We are all truly enriched by Gene's efforts."},{"Title":"Score! My Twenty-Five Years with The Broad Street Bullies","review":"I first started listening to Gene Hart calling Flyers games in 1968. He was a wonderful announcer when the Flyers were mediocre and was absolutely superb when they were on top. I've heard a lot of sports broadcasting in a lot of cities around the country in the last 35 years and no one else in any sport approaches Gene's work. I was disappointed when he stopped announcing and deeply saddened with his passing last year. His book is every bit as fine as his radio and television work. Of the several Flyers books in print, his supasses the others in intimacy, first hand recollections and general nostalgic value. I sure miss Gene Hart, but this book and some tapes of television broadcasts he did are my most treasured sports memorabilia. He is a Hall of Famer and his writing belongs there too."},{"Title":"Score! My Twenty-Five Years with The Broad Street Bullies","review":"Unlike most books, these &quot;memories&quot; are not all about the stars that most of us know so well. Individual short stories about role players, short-timers and other lesser knowns makes this book truly enjoyable. It is evident that it is written by true Cardinal fans, because they take great joy in every small achievement made by both the team and the men who played for them. If you're the type of person who can't devote long periods of time to spending with a book, you'll love this one because of it's short-story format."},{"Title":"Score! My Twenty-Five Years with The Broad Street Bullies","review":"Having grown up a Flyers fan and hearing Gene Hart for many years, I loved this book. It's a great combination of how Gene became associated with the Flyers, as well as a timeline of the Flyers' history from the beginning up to the early 90's."},{"Title":"Score!

You can perceive it in every frame of the movie, is not casual that a location as Vienna has been choosen to develop the story.Time, life, freedom, love, poetry, signs are important issues."},{"Title":"Before Sunrise","review":"Two people came together with nothing at all to offer each other except the probable opportunity to cause themselves pain and they didn't fear to love. (To love without the promise that there would be a tomorrow for them.) This is a good script and an incredible movie...Nice soundtrack unfortunately it is unavailable. Linklater is groovy!!"},{"Title":"Before Sunrise","review":"Before Sunrise is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I can't imagine a better book to accompany it. What makes this book so great is that it does not contain the actual script, because I think the shots and technical description would just ruin the magic of the dialogue, which is the best thing about the movie. The pictures are brilliant (for they're not only copies of the film's shots), and the poem at the end of the book is simply a touch of genius. I lost the book, though. So I was wondering if anyone could help me find a copy. All expenses will be paid. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Before Sunrise","review":"It is a great movie that we just can't miss it in our life. When a man meets a woman in the way like the movie goes, something is expected to happen. It is amazing that everything is so natual, so romantic.The story makes me desiring a romantic love everytime I am in a journey...It is pity that I miss the opening of the movie. I've tried to get the VCD of the picture but I can't make it in Hongkong. I can't find the book neither..."},{"Title":"Before Sunrise","review":"I've been looking for this for ages! No bookshop in Londonseems to have it. Well, I haven't read the book, but Iassume it's the screenplay of the fantastic movie &quot;BeforeSunrise&quot;, which is the best thing I have seen in a longtime. Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke act wonderfully, thescript sparkles and the location beautiful. Yes, I quiteliked it!"},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"This is about the best book I have ever read about classical antiquity. Davidson focusses on consumption habits, and the morality of eating, drinking, and sex. It is both very revealing about the lives of the Greeks, and an absolutely key step in understanding the origins of modern styles of consumer culture. This is by far the most theoretically sophisticated thing written about consumption in prehistory - Davidson brings some of the best of modern consumption theory to bear, but never in a pedantic way. The text remains lively, fun, and enlightening."},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"While I would grant that this is a scholarly work by a serious historian I found it an engaging read and quite fascinating. It is one of the few books I have read that really helps one get into the mindset (mentalite) of another civilization, far distant in time and space. I don't think one needs an encyclopaedic knowledge of ancient Greece to appreciate this book but some exposure to other studies of mentalites might be helpful."},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"A marvelously written, intricate weave from an incredible array of sources that illuminates the significance of Greek appetites (especially for fish -- yes, fish -- and for sex, in multiple forms and layers) and attitudes toward them, and thus, on the way, as it were, what was regarded as virtuous, that the author convincingly shows were central to social, philosophical and poltical life in classical Athens. An extraordinary book offering amazing insights. One awaits the next set of revelations, if there are more to be delivered to us, by Mr. Davidson, with something resembling opsophagia. A tour de force!"},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"A book that can take preconceived notions of history, stand them on their heads, and at the same time open up new areas for further research by professional historians while entertaining lay readers is a necessary book. &quot;Courtesans and Fishcakes&quot; is a witty, rational, eminently readable social history of ancient Athens. You won't ever be sorry you read it."},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"James Davidson's Courtesans and Fishcakes is a marvelously complex book that is at times fun, at times dull, but always filled with new insights strung through as pearls in the verbiage. The book is not as accessible as it is claimed by some to be. I have a bit of background in classical studies and I needed every scrape of it to plow through this book. The historical framework necessary to understand what the Athenians were passionate about was never given and would have been a help for the non-classical studies buff. In the end, this book is definately worth the ride and the reader will appreciate the struggle. A very intelligent book that requires much from the reader but will also deliver even more back."},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"Although I think that the general reader may find some difficulty with the use of transcribed Greek words, the writing is both intelligent,articulate and amusing.Davidson has delved into some of the lesser known aspects of Classical Athens, although perhaps has ignored the (already well documented) enthusiasms for theatre, war &amp; politics that also engrossed the Greeks This gives the impression that all the Greeks were interested in was fish, wine and sex. Obviously, he has wanted to create an interesting and sale-able book, but no reader should forget that, as in the modern world, such pursuits formed only a part of most people's lives or indeed of the lives of a small section of society. And, as today, they are by far the most interesting things to read and write about, but they are only a part of the whole.His arguments provide a neat counterbalance to the rather one-sided products of recent years. I could detect quite a few axes being ground, quietly, in the background against many of his scholarly contemporaries. Such disputes are always gratifying to the non-combatants.I would recommend the book to any reader interested in a wider appreciation of Ancient Greek society or just for an amusing read."},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"This is a most welcome addition to my Ancient History bookshelf, and while a knowledge of Athenian history lets you get the most out of this book, those without any background in the subject may find that Davidson will prompt them to dig further into the lives and times of a most intriguing people. I found myself thinking &quot;Aha!&quot; more than once as some facets of Athenian culture were put more firmly into place for me, and the rich fullness of Athenian life put on display.Granted this is not the most entertaining 'read', but neither is it a dry scholarly tome. Some tables (regarding currency and what it would buy, for example) would have been nice to make some comparisons easier, but that is a minor matter. Any student of Greek drama or history should find this book invaluable in gaining a deeper understanding of their coursework, not to mention the fun to be had in throwing references from this admirable book in to jazz up your next paper."},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"With a elegant style, this book modified my view about some aspects of private life and habits of the ancient Athenians. Davidson goes direct to the point without much philosophical considerations. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"Any book on a scholarly subject that can manage to be completely readable and even amusing has my complete support, especially if it also manages to be fairly well-researched. Davidson's book can't be faulted just because he (and I'm sure it was him, and not his publishers) skews things here and there to snare the interests of the non-specialist reader. Let's face it: without working that extra little bit with that aim in mind, books on classical history are doomed to a much smaller audience than they deserve."},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"&quot;Courtesans and Fishcakes&quot; is without a doubt thecleverest and most entertaining bit of writing on classical Athens Ihave ever come across. Davidson combs the classical authors (many of whom had seemed drained of life by other scholars) and finds remarkable and startling things about the ancients' love of wine, sex, and, not least, fish. Recommended! END"},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"The best part of the book is how it brings the ancient world to life. What did these folks do day-to-day? That said unless you're doing an academic thesis on this topic you might lose interest halfway through."},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"This isn't a bad book. The writing is pretty good and it is loaded with trivial facts about Athenians. It is interesting in that one gets to flirt with entering quite an alien culture and gets to try and equate it with how we live today.The author never really brought this alive for me but it was good enough that I finished it."},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"A pleasant relaxing and amusing read about the ancients and their habits.Did you know they were obsessed with fish and that girls on top was the most expensive."},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"I'll read just about anything on the ancient Greeks, and the title and subtitle of this book intrigued me. It turned out to be surprisingly dry and tame. The Greeks celebrated the senses with gusto and brio and a lot of other words that end in -o, but this book offers a strangely anemic version of Greek exuberance. It's definitely not an in-depth examination of Greek gluttony, bibulousness, and polymorphous sexuality. What I remember most about it is how astonished the author was at how much the Greeks loved seafood. As for Greek pederasty, even an old prudish monograph like John Addington Symonds's A Problem in Greek Ethics does a better job of explaining it. I expected to laugh and learn a lot more than I did from Courtesans and Fishcakes. (I suspect the book is a warmed-over doctoral dissertation. If so, that would explain its curious &quot;neither fish nor fowl&quot; quality.) Though it's by no means an awful book (and displays considerable learning and insight), it's too often tedious. Something like Dowds's The Greeks and the Irrational is ten times better."},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"James Davidson's COURTESANS AND FISHCAKES relates eating, drinking and lovemaking in the Athens of Pericles (or thereabouts). I'm the rare Frenchman who doesn't care all that much for food and drink, which leaves what we call un cinq &agrave; sept. Davidson plays down the role of boys, certain that the Greeks were far more port&eacute;s sur le sexe faible. Even so, he does describe the act of love between men as - for the receiver - a kind of itching of incredible pleasure which just goes on and on until the strength of the giver abandons him. Although I personally fear even a thermometer, one has to wonder, when one hears the animal cries on the Web - begging for the giver to go faster and deeper - if one hasn't wasted a part of one's life. All this to say that Davidson is no proud, he clearly and engrossingly describes what may well have gone on, and that if you are ALSO interested in eating and drinking, this book is for you. My own books can be found on Amazon, in English and French, under Michael Hone."},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"A stylish and well written look at the more seamy side of Ancient Greece.It was interesting to learn that they didn't just give the world great philosophy, maths and science but also the type of behaviour and gossiping that you get on reality shows.I was surprised to read that eating too much fish was so frowned upon and it was considered a terrible vice.There are numerous fascinating and often very amusing anecdotes throughout but he also provides plenty of scholarly analysis.After reading this book I am never going to look at radishes in the same way again."},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"James Davidson's Courtesans and Fishcakes provides an \\"extracurricular\\" view of ancient Greek ways, manners, and mores. It is a work both enlightening and maddeningly unfocused having sources including the writings from 'theatre' and 'traditional' authors known for their more cerebral works. The author is faced with the incredibly difficult dilemma of determining the genuineness of scenes that represent sincerity or comic parody. Davidson draws from the arts and artifacts of these worlds, and commentaries penned centuries after the collapse of Greek culture and economy as additional sources for his interpretations.The author explores the roles of food, drink, and sex to provide social and political insights in ancient Greece. Most would not consider looking for big picture lessons by studying public and private means that commoners, courtesans, and commanders satisfied their primitive instincts. But their are insights that Davidson provides by just such an approach. I now have numerous reasons to question many of my beliefs of Greek as only pugnacious and terribly staid scholarly chaps. Davidson's book opens a door into a fascinating approach to history. I will await his next volume."},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"Courtesans and Fishcakes, make no mistake about this, is a textbook. It is a very witty and readable textbook and at times it demands all your background in the classics to immerse yourself in James Davidson's absolutely alien landscape. He is utterly original in his ability to help us put aside 21st century experiences and root around in the eating, mating, prostitution, friendship, tyranny, and socio-philosophical underpinnings of ancient Greece. This is the one book that gives no quarter to the reader. You are made to understand that current morality does not apply to the subject matter of ancient Greece. This book will help you in all your other forays into the ancient classics. It will broaden your understanding of Greek plays, the Peloponnesian wars, Greek democracy (so very different from ours) and Greek appetites, sexual and otherwise, of the ancients. Even if you are just a reader of historical fiction, your enjoyment level will be doubled by your encounter with this remarkable piece of scholarship. Three thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"Be advised: this book is slow reading. Unlike Athenians at fish fests you will not gorge on the paragraphs as they come hot off the pages. I am a book a day man but this fellow took me more than two weeks. I will admit to other reading during that time , but this book was not for work, which is often the case with chapter a day reads. I know my Lit Crit theory. I have a little Latin and less Greek, and I needed them for this book, and yet every so often a wonderful prospect of words and word connectedness blossomed from this suggestive title, sort of like those rather suggestive amarillis stems and blossoms. I would add, that familiarity with contemporary literary critical theory would also help in appreciating what Davidson has achieved which is a learned and creative picture of that shaping and yet alien culture which was Athens.Any teacher who has had to explain how tragedy fits into the Athenian vision with its strict moral code but lacking the ideas of sinful guilt will appreciate the careful path the author treads as he looks at a very different vision of addiction and desire from that we find in modern culture. Keep a good dictionary nearby while reading. Keep a bookmark too. You will want to, pause, set this side frome time to time, and think"},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"Although the topics of this book are appealing, I found it hard to read. It assumes a level of knowledge about Greek society, culture, and language that I simply don't have. There is no clear narrative line to it. However, it did succeed in making me realize how different the physical and conceptual world of the Greeks was from our own world and from our ideas of the what the past was like, and for that it was interesting and worthwhile."},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","review":"The book is well put together, but too dry for an average non-fiction reader. This is not a light read. Unless you've read more Greek lit. than just Homer and know a fair amount about the individual city states it will be an uphill read (as it was for me).

And I always enjoy collections of then-present-day observations written in the semi-distant past. Well, 1919 doesn't really seem that ancient to me -- but it's ninety years ago now, nearly a century, so I suppose that says something about me. The Great War had just ended and Bell the antiquarian was continuing his lifelong habit of poking about in his city, climbing down ladders into medieval basements, opening cupboards in ancient churches, and discovering things of which, he laments, the people about him walking to work are completely oblivious. And many of the small, unknown pieces of London's history which he describes here would not survive the Blitz twenty years later or the savaging that redevelopment would continue to do to the city's historical fabric.His first chapter is also one of the best, about Henry Grey, the Duke of Suffolk, and father of the ill-used Lady Jane Grey, who was executed by having his head struck off at Tower Hill in 1554 -- largely because of his own foolishness and weakness of character. But his head apparently survived, having been rescued by his widow who didn't want to see it spiked on London Bridge, and was found nearly three centuries later, tucked away in a nearby church. It was still there in 1919 and Bell held the glass box in which it was preserved. In fact, the book includes a photograph of it. (Is it still there? I haven't been able to find out.) Bell was also a fan of London's Roman remains -- the surviving sections of the city wall, now built into warehouse walls and hidden in basements (and, more recently, in a parking garage), and the two baths discovered by 19th-century workmen preparing to erect new office buildings. Then there's the City merchant's mansion rebuilt just after the Great Fire of 1666 -- goods stored in the cellar, offices on the ground floor, spacious living quarters above that -- which still stands at No. 34 Great Tower Street. And his exploration of Wapping High Street and the Old Stairs down to the Thames at the end of it, which served both the Navy and the merchant sea trade, and which, in its heyday, was one of the most roisterous and dangerous neighborhoods in Greater London. By the time Bell compiled this volume, it was a dead and dull area of warehouses with few residents. Nowadays, Wapping is being cautiously gentrified, but the sailors never returned. Other chapters will take you to the pavement of Smithfield where religious martyrs, both Catholic and Protestant, were burned at the stake, and will show you the funereal waxworks of the great still preserved at Westminster Abbey, and will investigate the ghosts of the Tower. And Bell will turn the pages of Domesday Book for you, and will examine the hitherto secret parchments recording the details of the trial of Anne Boleyn -- which, in 1919, any student could handle just by filling out the request slip at the Public Record Office.Bell is completely fascinated by all this, and it comes through in his knowledgeable but never stuffy prose. You have the sense of your tour guide tugging you along to the next amazing sight, listening to his descriptions and commentary about things and places you never knew were there, just around the corner.The sequel volume continues in very much the same vein, with the author remembering his youthful introduction to the sights of the Guildhall -- including a naval dispatch written in 1340 by Edward III to his son, the ten-year-old Duke of Cornwall, and still (in 1920) to be found in their archives; the Duke later became the Black Prince, victory of Crecy and Poitiers. Then there's the City's own execution ground (not the same as Tower Hill), where executions were carried out by the Sheriff, and which stands in a very pleasant garden. And there's the 17th-century printing house in Cheapside, possibly the earliest remaining building from the rebuilding that followed the Great Fire. (The tablet on the wall tells the passerby that the building actually predates and survived the Fire, but Bell doesn't believe it, and he tells you why.) And, naturally, there are more Roman sites to be explored, too. If you're interested in the history of London, or if you simply enjoy a fascinating bit of sightseeing, I cannot recommend these two books highly enough. And, in a sign of our own times, of which I think Bell would have approved, both can now be found at Google Books."},{"Title":"The Truth Behind Racism","review":"So honestly written this book cannot offend anyone.

I enjoyed the humor, mistaken identities, and sense of foolishness for love. Shakespeare's comedy although written several years ago still proves relevant to today. His use of love and the crazy things people will to find it, and once found keep it, will always prove a timeless message.Shakespeare mainly communicates how foolish and deliberate people act when they find themselves in love. The title also elaborates on the fact that people spend entirely too much time worrying about nothing. The characters become enthralled in the present and ignore the future and reality of their circumstances. Many of the characters also develop a sense of selfishness when asked to choose themselves or any one else. Later in the story we see Benedick choose love over himself as his characters changes and softens through his own confused heart. The character Don John tries to stir up trouble between the soon to be married Claudio and Hero. Through a cleverly thought out mistaken identity the infatuated pair soon dwindle to a public disgrace, only to be found innocent in the end. After this action has occurred Beatrice tells Benedick that she would like to see his friend Claudio dead for what he has done to her cousin. Benedick chooses the women he loves over the friend he knows. Although Benedick does not kill Claudio he still has made this agreement in his heart to betray him. Another amusing aspect of the play was the constant changing relationship between Beatrice and Benedick. We first find them deeply involved in their continuous war of words. Soon these two bickering characters find a love through the fight and through the constant misunderstanding these characters display a hopeful love for one another. However, the reader is left questioning whether or not this love is true. One of my favorite scenes takes place in the orchard when Claudio, Don Pedro, and Leonato plan to trick the attentively listening Benedick. Knowing that he is only feet away, behind the bushes, Shakespeare's writing pokes fun at his feelings and future desires of Beatrice. I love the humor and the way that their one conversation alters Benedick's choices. An important comic relief character would be Dogsberry and his trusty assistant Verges. The usage of malapropism adds a humor to the story and it's message unable to be matched by any other character.Shakespeare was making a point with the characters of this story by illustrating their obsession with the hear and the now instead of looking at the grand picture of their situations. He was showing his readers not to take life or your relationships too seriously. Another aspect of this play that posed a point and went equally along with the previous lesson was the crazy things people do for love. The characters in this story often would just pick up and do anything for the person they felt they loved., and on the flip side would just as quickly forget that person. An example of these actions was when Claudio and Hero had their misunderstanding Claudio shamed her in front of their town for what he had understood to be betrayal. The immediacy of actions and urgency of reason all to often compromised the characters and their emotions.Much Ado About Nothing was a refreshing comedy with a light, but also significant meaning. Shakespeare truly captures the mind of humans seeking love in a crazy world. The play proves relevant and although the language may be different the story is not unlike our society today. I would absolutely recommend this play to anyone looking to watch a humorous love story unfold before them. I very much enjoyed the reading as Shakespeare cleverly envelops his reader into a story of crazy characters and their crazier reactions to love and misunderstandings. I had so much fun watching this play performed and seeing the genius unfold that Shakespeare had intended for us all to see. This play will not soon nor easily be forgotten by generations to come. I'm so happy to have opened its cover and now hold it on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Shakespeare's comedy, \\"Much Ado About Nothing,\\" can have only a positive effect on its audience when read. His use of verbal sarcasm and intellectual farce turns the circumstances of love into exactly what they many times truly are: comedy. Shakespeare creates situations that appear serious to the characters within the script, and yet are actually humorous for the audience. Because they are able to observe things that the characters themselves are not privy to, the audience is able to witness the full absurdity of many of the messes that are created within the plot by the characters themselves.While evaluating this play, I found it interesting that while another of Shakespeare's comedies, \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\\" demonstrates how it is love that causes us to do foolish things, \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" shows the way people complicate love themselves. Each comedy centers on the theme of love, making it comedic and entertaining, yet the two hold contrasting views. The characters' actions in \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" are involuntarily controlled by their affections, whether they are real or perceived, and yet the actions of those found in \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" are what control the outcome of the love created.Throughout this story, Shakespeare purposes to illustrate the many foolish things that individuals do which only complicate love further than it already is. Many continually deny how they feel, as in the case of Benedick and Beatrice, while others, like Claudio, are quick to fall into love and just as eager to fall out again. Love's fickleness is shown when Claudio jumps quickly to sharp accusations based upon false testimony, and again when Benedick and Beatrice fall in love due to the supposed affection of the other. The story also demonstrates how others manipulate affections, with negative or positive results. Leonato, Don John, and other miscellaneous characters add to the complexity and show the increase in havoc that comes with the increase of people in a situation.This play communicated strongly to me that circumstances are not always entirely as complicated as they appear to be. Just as false identities and twisted facts create unneeded, yet hilarious, tension throughout the story, putting more stress and importance on issues within my life makes them more that they truly are. Because of this, it is not always the situation that is the problem, but my own distorted view of it. Claudio's assumptions of Hero's promiscuous nature and Benedick and Beatrice's quick reaction to the gossip heard about each other are two images of my own tendency to take specific circumstances to an extreme they should never reach. This play was therefore not only enjoyable for me to read; it brought to light one of my strengths that at times becomes my personal downfall, and, by making me more conscious of this fact, has allowed me the potential to correct it sooner.I wholeheartedly recommend this book, especially to those that enjoy Shakespearean theatre as well as a good laugh. It is a hilarious story of how manipulation and our own choice of action can create a complicated labyrinth that we are unable to get out of, and at times don't ever want to. Shakespeare does an excellent job of poking humor into the crevices of every situation, and lightheartedly reminds us that in the end it is our own decisions that create, or destroy, the mangled outcome we receive."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"William Shakespeare's comedy Much Ado About Nothing is a funny and interesting play that is very easy to comprehend. The story is about two groups of lovers who are Claudio and Hero along with Benedict and Beatrice. Both types of lovers end up in marriage but they start to fall in love in totally different ways. Claudio and Hero fall in love at first sight as where Benedict and Beatrice first hate each other but learn to love one another. The whole meaning to the title, Much Ado About Nothing is the fact that the characters would get angry at what seemed as something of great importance but in reality was nothing at all. An example of this is how Hero was suspected to be dead and actually was far from death but being deceived, Claudio experienced much grief. The grief that he had experienced was actually not needed at all because she was still alive and well.I believe that the idea of this story is to show us how blind love can make us. When you love someone it is important to trust them and to always think things through before acting on mere feelings to develop a good relationship. If you do not trust the one you love than you will have trouble trusting anyone which will lead you to become extremely paranoid. If you have everything in the world but not love than you have nothing at all.Claudio heard that Don Pedro was trying to get Hero for himself and actually believed this outrageous rumor! This showed Claudio's lack of trust, which was in my opinion his greatest weakness. The strength in his character may not be trust but it is in fact obedience and loyalty. Even though he believes Don Pedro to be taking Hero for himself he does not rebuke him but says \\"I wish him joy with her.\\" (II,i) This shows that he chooses his loyalty or obedience to his great friend Don Pedro over the woman he loves. The last thing that really stood out to me was the how honorable Claudio was when he thought Hero to be dead. He offered to do anything for her father even marry her cousin when he was asked too. When the wedding day came it turned out that the bride was Hero and the joy that Claudio felt was overwhelming for. This shows that if we persevere through the bad eventually good we will come out of it. We are never given anything that is too much for us to handle.I respect Shakespeare's amazing talent to be able to take such a simple plot and turn it into an instant classic. This story was of course very well written, the characters were all very good and some were extremely funny. One thing that I found that was very interesting was how both Benedict and Beatrice were deceived about the other one loving each other by their friends in the garden. The reason I thought of this as ironic was that man was first deceived in a garden, the Garden of Eden."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Much Ado About Nothing, by William Shakespeare, is a positive, romantic comedy of how petty scenarios can be blown to epic proportions. The reason I think it's positive is that the comedy makes up for the drama. Shakespeare allows comic relief throughout the play which makes the play enjoyable to read. Another positive aspect is because, \\"all's well that ends well\\" and this delightful comedy ended well. Shakespeare introduces his readers to two different couples, one being Hero, the daughter of Leonato, and Claudio, a friend of Don Pedro. The second \\"couple\\" is Beatrice, the cousin of Hero, and Benedick, a friend of Claudio who at the start of the play hate each other. Hero and Claudio on the other hand fall in love at first sight after barely even getting to talk with one another, which produces a shallow love. When Claudio asks Hero to marry him and she says yes without hesitation you would think nothing could go wrong but, there's always a villain in a play and in this play his name is Don Jon, Don Pedro's brother. Don Jon devises a plan to ruin this relationship. When Claudio thinks he sees something bad happen with Hero he decides in his enragement to humiliate Hero in front of Messina by telling everyone that she was unfaithful. Instead of checking the facts out he acts without investigating. Meanwhile, Benedick and Beatrice are tricked into loving each other by another scheme. Hero is devastated once Claudio humiliates her and her father even wants her to die but the friar calms him down and devises a plan. A plan for Hero to pretend to be dead and trick Claudio into marrying her cousin when it will really be her. Claudio agrees to marry \\"Beatrice\\". Once Hero and Claudio are married they fall in love once more and to no one's surprise Benedick and Beatrice marry also.Shakespeare's purpose in writing this play was to show others how when you take something that you don't know for a fact to be true and become angry and then act on that anger, you produce stupid actions. These actions are based on feelings that are about nothing. An example in the play would be when Claudio decides to humiliate Hero who he loves based on false accusations made by his so-called enemy, Don Jon. Also another point I think he was trying to make was about love and how it makes you do silly things, act certain ways and how it can be shallow. For Benedick and Beatrice they only loved each other when they found out that one loved the other by overhearing their friends. After finding this out they immediately fell in love with each other. Again with Hero and Claudio they only loved what was on the outside, they didn't know each others personalities. So when Claudio thought Hero was cheating on him he didn't know that that was something that Hero would never do but he just went by what everyone told him. The irony of the title \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" is perfect because all the arguments stemmed from nothing. Claudio was mad at Hero for nothing and the point that Shakespeare makes is how things like this separate us from each other when really it's over nothing.Something that I have personally learned from this play would be never to repeat what someone says and never act on what someone says. Gossip is something that needs to be stopped and by reading this it has helped me to see how powerful words are. They can make someone's day, but just as easily ruin someone's life. Also not acting out of anger of what someone has said about me. By acting out of anger I may say something that I might regret and you can never take back words. Claudio said some pretty hurtful things and accused Hero falsely once what he said was out, it was out and could never be taken back. By him acting on his anger I'm sure he regretted what he had done. With Benedick and Beatrice they overheard words of each other secretly loving the other and they instantly fell in love. The words they overheard turned their hate into love. I remember one more time in the play when Leonato told Hero how disgraced he was after hearing what she had done from Claudio without even asking her if it were true or not he even wanted her dead. Hero was devastated. Words hurt. This is what I have personally learned by reading this play.I would recommend this play because compared to \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" it is a comedic play with plenty of sarcastic remarks. The fact that Benedick is so arrogant along with Beatrice makes the play worth reading. There constant squabbling with each other is hilarious. Also there is comic relief throughout the play which adds laughter through the drama. I would also recommend it because besides the comedy the deeper meaning behind it is one of good morals. Knowing that most things that freak people out is about little things that shouldn't even be recognized. For those that love comedy \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" is a play that is timeless and fun for the whole family. The overall play is not hard to understand and is once again hilarious. The way Shakespeare develops his characters is brilliant and masterful. Everyone should read this astounding play."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Much Ado About Nothing was a very positive play written by William Shakespeare because it holds many lessons the average man should apply. This play is written as a comedy, and a very funny one it is in fact. The story unfolds with two couples, opposite in relationship characteristics, who by the end of the play have gone through many ups and down, but finally end up in each others arms. The main purpose of Shakespeare's writing, I think, is to convey the silliness that happens when two people fall in love. People do not think clearly, act prudently, or speak wisely. Many wrong things can happen when a person is \\"love struck\\" as we see in this play. Claudio and Hero have a very \\"puppyish\\" love towards one another, and we see this because they instantly fall for one another without even getting to know each other first. We see shallowness right away and later in the play when an evil character sets up a scheme to make it look like Hero is sleeping with another man. Claudio immediately thinks that Hero is guilty, no questions asked. Throughout the play Hero barely says anything, showing her shallowness in going with whatever is happening. On the contrary, Benedick and Beatrice have a love-hate relationship. They constantly fight. Both claim to hate each other, but when their peers tell them that the other likes them as a ploy, they believe it and fall in love. They each believe the other loves them when that isn't the case at all. In the end of the play, the plot is wrapped up by Claudio seeing that Hero didn't really sleep with another man and they end up getting married. Benedick and Beatrice learn that the other really doesn't love them, but they decide that through it all, they really do have true love towards one another and decide to get married as well. As these two wacky relationships unfold we truly see Shakespeare's motive for writing the play, to show folly in relationships.This reading had specifically spoken to me because of my current situation of not being in a relationship. I currently do not have a boyfriend, and at sixteen years of age, that is a hard pressure not to succumb to. After reading about how Beatrice and Benedick have their quarrels and fights and Claudio and Hero have their shallowness, this has made me think twice about getting into a relationship. First of all, fighting doesn't sound fun. I get in fights with my girlfriends; I do not need to get into fights with a boyfriend. Plus, someone else telling me that a guy likes me and not finding out for myself doesn't sound very dependable. A lot of people count that as true, even if they didn't find out for themselves, and that source ends up not being trustworthy. Hearts get broken that way. More importantly, if my boyfriend was so quick to think that I would even think about cheating on him, I would be disappointed because he didn't take the time to get to know me. There is one person I think of when I think of boyfriends though, and that is Jesus Christ. He is the perfect one for me because he died for me, who else could be better? Even though I am sixteen and feel the pressures of having a boyfriend, I still believe that I need to be in a place with God where I am depending on Him for all things. If I can't depend on God for comfort, why should I run to an earthly guy for that comfort that only God can truly give? Much Ado About Nothing has taught me not to rush into things so quickly, especially in the way of relationships.This play is expertly funny, expediently written, and a great one to read. I would highly recommend it for a comical yet packed with lessons type of read. Although the Old English is hard to understand, get past that fact and try to understand the hilarious and teachable moments that are so fully crammed into this book. Shakespeare is an expert at writing excellent plays and this one doesn't fall short of that standard. \\"I will live in thy heart, die in they lap, and be buried in thy eyes.\\"-Benedick"},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"The thorough analysis of Skakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing is intriguing and overall captivating in every sense of the word. This story is a prime example of the genius of Skakespeare's work and is generally positive experience to all who choose to read it. Upon the reading of this play, some may find the story bland and pointless, however, the plot is described in the name, Much Ado About Nothing.With all good stories, there is an intention or a purpose \\"between the lines.\\" The same goes with this story. Skakespeare's main purpose for writing this play is to showthe trouble that follows when people rush into relationships based on physical infatuations solely without truly knowing the other person. Claudio and Hero saw one another, and found each other desirable, so they decided to get married, yet the only thing that they knew about each other was there name and that they were attractive. So acting upon their emotion, they leaped into a commitment with no knowledge of who the other was. In contrast, Skakespeare uses the other couple, Benedick and Beatrice to show what a relationship should be. These two people are extremely stubborn and opinionated with a deep disguist for the other, however, through a series of unplanned events, they end up falling in love with each other. The difference between these two couples is that Claudio and Hero's \\"love\\" for each other had no depth or real feeling, whereas, Benedick and Beatrice had a relationship prior to claiming to be in love. For this reason, Benedick and Beatrice did not suffer the heartache and trials that Claudio and Hero had to endure because they had a real relationship based on love not solely infatuations.From reading this play I have learned more than I expected. The comparison made by Skakespeare between the two couples reminded me of the importance of knowing someone before I decided to be in a relationship with them. For example, because of her decision to marry Claudio, Hero suffered public humiliation and almost death by her own father! Honestly, it truly reminds you to think before you act. However, this play also did show the positive side of love in the relationship between Hero and Claudio. Following the \\"incident\\" at an attempted wedding, Beatrice and Benedick finally voice their true feelings about each other, and then despite his brother-like love for Claudio, offers to challenge him to a duel upon the request of his new found love, Beatrice. Here, Benedick is potraying what true love is, immeasurable and unconditional. By challenging his best friend to a duel, he is showing Beatrice that the relationship between the two of them supercedes the relationship between him and Claudio.I personally would recommend this play to all people who are curious about theatre and desire to study it or if they are just in extreme need of comedic relief. This play combines a life lesson with a plethora of humor and characters that a person can relate to on a deeper and more personal level; without dismissing the much needed conflict and hilarious dramatic irony. Though the play at times can be difficult to read and understand, the overall message is clear and is relevent to the society we live in. The day and age we live in is full of separation, adultery, and divorce and it is a lot of times it occurs because people attempt to have a relationship based on what they see and not on love for that person and their trueselves. This is exactly what Claudio and Hero did when they rushed into a relationship with each other based on physical attraction. Which just goes to show the genius of Skakespeare's work and the timelessness of his art."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Much Ado About Nothing is from Shakspear's day so it is hard to understand it. Shakspear's point for writing this is to make fun of lovers, it is also called Much Ado About Noting. It is about two lovers, Hero and Claudio, who are lovers at first sight. Their love is a shallow love because their love were by looks so if Claudio looked at Hero and half of her body was burned off, Claudio wouldn't have loved her. Then their was Beatrice and Benedick, who were enemies at first sight. They both were head-strong and quick witted people. Claudio and Hero wanted to get married right away but Leonato, Hero's father and Beatrice's uncle, wouldn't let it happen. While they were waiting, a masquerade party was going on and Beatrice didn't know she was talking to Benedick about Benedick's behavior and so that scene was funny. At the masquerade party Leonarto, Claudio, Don Pedro(friend of Leonarto), Hero, Margaret, and Ursula plotted to make Benedick and Beatrice fall in love with each other. Leonarto, Don Pedro, and Claudio talked about how much Beatrice loved Benedick while Benedick was hiding in the garden. Then Ursula fetched Beatrice and while she was hiding Hero and Margaret talked about how much Benedick loves her. It worked, they fell for each other. Soon Claudio and Hero were going to get married, Claudio and Don Pedro saw Hero sleeping with another man so right befoe the congress of people he disgraced her. Hero faintes and the frair came and clmed the furious Leonarto by saying let's say she died and bring guilt to Claudio. So they agreed and Hero \\"died\\". Claudio was sad and addented the funeral and said how sorry he was for his unkind words. Cl;audio, Don Pedro, Leonarto and the rest found out what happened and Hero was innocent. The friar was suppose to give \\"his daughter\\" to Claudio and Claudio took her hand in marriage. When he lifted the veil he found out it was Hero and they were married. Benedick and Beatrice were suppose to get married when they denied their love so Claudio went up and took a poem out of Benedick's pocket and handed it to Beatrice. Hero went up and took a poem from Beatrice's pocket and handed it to Benedick and they got married. I reccomend this book to anyone because it was funny but I didn't like it because I couldn't understand it without watching the movie that went along."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"My Critique of \\"A Midsummer Nights Dream\\"I recently read \\"A Midsummer Nights Dream\\" by William Shakespeare, I enjoyed reading this play, I thought it was hilarious how Shakespeare would toy around with the characters and make fun of the actors who were alive at the time this play was written. When reading this play was assigned, I thought man what is he thinking? I did not want to read this play because I thought it would be very feminine and I am not normally a touchy feely kinda guy. I would much rather read something that is funny or has a lot of martial arts in it. My opinion of Shakespeare was that he was an old fart, that he was too mushy and liked to say \\"Thy\\" entirely too often. But after reading the play, I feel more upbeat about reading more Shakespeare stuff.I think that his main purpose for writing this play was to show people how love will cause you to do crazy, crazy things. Two of the main characters Lysander and Demetrius fall in love with the same girl, Hermia. They both know the other is in love with Hermia, and they compete for her affection. Lysander, sings for her, he gives her gawds (fancy presents) and anything else that he thinks she will like. Hermia has a friend named Helena who is in love with Demetrius, and Hermia wants her friend to marry Demetrius. However, Hermia's father wants Hermia to marry Demetrius, so Lysander and Hermia run away into the woods so they can escape to Lysander's Aunts house outside of Athens. Lysander's Aunt is very wealthy and considers Lysander to be like a son to her. But when they are in the woods, they fall asleep and the King of the Fairies servant, Puck, finds them. The King of the Fairies, Oberon, tells Puck to cast a spell on Demetrius so he will be in love with Helena. Puck messes up and casts the spell on Lysander making him fall in love with Helena. Helena thinks that Lysander is playing a cruel joke and does not believe that Lysander is in Love with her. Puck then casts a spell on Demetrius making him fall in love with Helena. When Hermia wakes up in the woods she tries going to Lysander, but he is already in \\"love\\" with Helena. So, Hermia and Helena get angry with each other. Hermia thinks Helena stole her man and Helena thinks that Hermia and Lysander are playing a cruel joke on her. In the end, Hermia falls in love with Lysander and Demetrius falls in love with Helena and everyone gets married.This is kinda Disneyish.I personally learned from reading this play that love will make you make sacrifice for the person you love. When you love a person you will be willing to do many things for them. A good example of this is how Hermia and Lysander were willing to run away to be together and how Hermia was willing to fight Helena for Lysander when he was under Pucks misguided spell.I would highly recommend this play, it is the finest play by Shakespeare that I have ever read. I think this play has totally flipped my opinion of Shakespeare upside down. I no longer think that he is a pansy, tight wearing, geeky kinda guy. In fact, after reading this play I would give him the benefit of the doubt that if they had football back in his day that he may have even been able to catch it. I was really amazed that Shakespeare had a sense of humor. I thought all of these plays were boring love stories full of poetry and other romantic scmitty schmatt. Given the opportunity, I would like to attend a performance of this play."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"I thought Much Ado About Nothing made no sense really because it seemed shorter than Antigone, and there was a little too much love going on. I couldn't handle it all, especially the deception by Don John. The first love between Claudio and Hero were like two teenagers in puppy love, and Benedick and Beatrice who had crazy love, which means that they liked each other, but didn't confess about their feelings.William Shakespeare's main purpose was I think showing what kind of loves there were through different types of people. The first of which is Claudio, the desperate type only looking for a girl to look cool. Whenever Don John told Claudio a lie, he would get all mad and act like he could never forgive Hero. He would whine like a little girl. I think the purpose didn't really click into to me because I am too young and don't understand love.What I have personally learned from this is to not rush into love because even though Don John made up those lies and false judgments about Hero, those could really happen in real life, plus the fact that we are two young to understand it. We get into that high school puppy love which isn't the same as real love. When we are older we will understand because we will be at that stage where all of us will understand the true meaning of love.I would not recommend this book because I think it had really no point but to show us what kind of loves there are and, how we should treat them with the person we love. The comedy in this was really good, but in this book, I didn't see the mix of comedy and love."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Much Ado About NothingThis is a great story about two couples that like each other and will eventually marry each other, and the couple of Benedick and Beatrice tend to go against each other, but they are really do love each other, and there is the deception of Benedick and Beatrice, and they will both not like to hear that but they will come around eventually. Hero and Claudio on the other hand tend to be a bit more gullible and will learn that Hero had an affair and Claudio will call off the wedding, only to find out it was not Hero, but Margaret who only looked like Hero from the back, and he \\"killed\\" Hero by talking himself out of the wedding the first time and then learns that she was still alive when she surprised him when he was going to marry Beatrice, but then after the real wedding, Benedick calls forth Beatrice and will also marry her.Throughout the play Don John plans to go against Claudio and tells him that he saw Hero with a mysterious man and that made Claudio call off the wedding. Shakespeare wanted to make this play for all of the irony that it brings the readers or the watchers because of the deception in the Garden of Eden and the deception of Beatrice and Benedick in the garden about them liking each other and that was the irony that he wanted to follow.I have learned that I should not be gullible like Claudio and be more courageous like Benedick and I would do my best to work for God and not I like Don John.I would recommend this play for anybody, it was the greatest of William Shakespeare and was a great story, I really liked it, the best part was with Dogsberry and he was interrogating the prisoner, which was the greatest. Almost too good."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Much Ado About Nothing emerges as one of the funnier and more clever of Shakespeare's comedies. It is, as Beatrice would say, &quot;as merry as the day is long.&quot; I personally enjoyed the wit and cynicism of Benedick and Beatrice in particular as well as the complete and utter chaos concerning Hero and Claudio's proposed union that ensues due to the chicanery and wickedness of the Machiavellian, Iago-like Don John.The thematic dichotomy of marriage and misogyny resonates throughout the entire play. Much Ado shrilly reverberates in today's society as marriage has become a feared and loathed institution by many as we look at our mates with increased scepticism of the other's fidelity with the comical fear of being made a cuckhold and having the infamous horns grown on our heads. Shakespeare makes this serious theme into a witty and enjoyable comedy: one that ranks at #4 on my Comedy list - just below The Comedy of Errors, The Merchant of Venice, &amp; The Taming of the Shrew. A must read for all Shakespeare aficionados - BEFORE seeing the movie."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Even though I'm 12,I like Shakespeare.Actually,I like Much Ado About Nothing but that's because I haven't read other works.It started when I read a children's book of Romeo &amp; Juliet.Then,I read the play version and I went on trying to learn about it in this book about Shakespeare.I came over a sypnosis of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; and it became so interesting,I got a book.Ever since,I couldn't put down the book.Anyway,young or old,anybody would love to read this."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Standard disclaimer: when rating a play by Shakespeare, I rate it as compared to other Shakespearean plays, not as compared to the general run of literature; otherwise, the ratings in general would be too high to be very informative. This play, for instance, would certainly rate five stars in a general rating.As it is, this play can be read either of two ways, and depending on how one reads it, it's either one of Shakespeare's better comedies, or somewhere below mediocre. Naturally, I prefer to read it the way I like it better, and so rate it highly.If, however, one reads the dialogue at face value, this is a play bearing many resemblances to my absolutely LEAST favorite of Shakespeare's plays: &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;. It is a romantic comedy in which the main plot device is that two people who despise one another manage, in spite of that minor impediment, to fall in love. It has the saving grace that there is no hint of Benedick &quot;taming&quot; Beatrice; their idiocy is mutual and completely parallel, but I've always hated this particular plot, and continue to do so. The continuing popularity of it has contributed to an uncountable number of mismatches in real life, as people have been encouraged by their cultural mythology to believe that strong emotion equals attraction, even when it seems on the surface to be repulsion.On the other hand, in this play it is very easy to read Beatrice and Benedick's lines, right from the beginning, as more bantering than bickering (although there ARE a couple of places where it is a bit difficult to do so) and as the playful teasing of two people who actually ENJOY each other's company for the challenge of the verbal byplay. If one reads it that way, the play makes a great deal more sense, and is actually quite enjoyable. (Plus, it has the advantage of the romance being between two grownups, rather than lovestruck teenagers, as in &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot;.)"},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Much Ado About Nothing was a very well written play. It was a much lighter reading than Antigone and I think I liked and understood it better too. It was still hard to read and understand but I think the movie and actually seeing it being acted out helped a ton. I really didn't understand a lot of what was going on in the garden scene when they are trying to get Beatrice and Benedick to think they both love each other. So I was a little bummed when our group chose that to do the skit. But then as you read and actually break down the words it was actually very easy and fun to figure out what it means.I think Shakespeare's main point in writing was to show people how funny love is. He has done tons of serious works and I think this was a great piece that kind of gave you a breath of fresh air. I think that was one of the reasons for writing this. To give the people who were coming to see it something a little lighter. I think this because the play focused a ton on the comedy of love. How you can get to people who started out hating each other to like each other.I surprised myself in this question. I came into this play thinking that I will not like and I would not understand it. Although one of those statements is true the other one was false. I loved this script. In the beginning I thought it could show me nothing about my life or teach me anything and I was completely wrong. From this play I learned to not judge a book (or play) by its cover. I mean this literally. I came into this with a bad attitude and I realized that instead of doing that I should of had a good attitude and I could have enjoyed it more. Also in Beatrice and Benedick's situation they thought they could never like each other and they ended up falling in love. Some of the people I thought I could never be friends with I am very close friends with now.Another thing it taught me was to not believe everything I hear. When Claudio heard that Hero was having an affair with someone he got mad and disgraced her and everyone thought she was a horrible person. But she never did and she really loved Claudio. I am a very big gossiper and I now realize how much they can hurt people.I would totally recommend this script to others. Although you may think you can't learn much from it you really can. I would suggest, though, watching the movie after you read each act. It makes them so much easier to understand. Without the movie I think I would completely be lost and not understand the book at all. Also I would go into reading the book with a good attitude thinking that this can help you because if you don't, like me, you will wind up more confused than ever."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Guides to the greatest Renaissance museum in Italy, the Uffizi, used to tell tourists gently, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, it is not the paintings that are on trial here.\\""},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"I this is\`nt how i would have like to give my review but i need some help about this book, i have exam on \\\\16\\\\10\\\\2000 tomorrow monday the question(S)about the book is as follows what is the reason for the making of this book where, when and give main highlights about the story please re-ply me with answers immediately . glenddoa@solutions2000.net Rayburn I have to pass my literature exam ."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Much ado about nothing was a very entertaining book. It was about two couples, one is Benedick and Beatrice and the other is Claudio and Hero. The beginning of the story Claudio and Hero are so much in love that there already wanting to get married nut, Hero's father tells him to wait a little. Benedick and Beatrice really detest each other. So Claudio, Don Pedro, and Leonato devise a plan to have Benedick over hear them in saying that Beatrice loves him. Their plan succeeds and Benedick believes every word and he starts liking Beatrice. Then Ursla, Margaret, and Hero also do the same exact thing to Beatrice; Beatrice starts falling into the spell.Claudio later on thinks he sees Hero with another man, which wasn't true at all. This makes Claudio furious and decides to shun her in front of everyone at the wedding. When the wedding time comes and shamed her in front of the whole city saying she was no longer a virgin. Hero's dad Leonato gets angry, but then the Friar comes up with a scheme of his own saying they should say that hero has killed herself because it was better that way. Claudio is devestated at the news of his bride. Then Claudio is given a test to choose Hero out of 4 girls they were all in wedding dresses and veils. He picks right and they still end up together because it was all just a big misunderstanding. Then Beatrice and Benedick told each other how they were deceived but they ended up together.Shakespeare's purpose was to show that we make a big deal out of nothing. When we find out someone likes us we make a big deal out of it and start doing silly things that you never thought you would do. Secrets, when we find out bad things someone says or what we do that wasnt right and we get so mad without getting the right facts or going to that person and asking them if what they said was true. Thats why at the masquerade when they were all wearing mask it was showing they all had something to hide and sooner or later they would be revealed.For instance when Benedick first finds out that Beatrice supposedly likes him he starts acting nicer and trying to be a better person. When Claudio thinks Hero is cheating, he didn't go to her to see if she was really with another man. He just assumed and then shamed her in front of everyone when there was no need for that. He is also showing all the crazy things we do for love.I learned that I should be more opened and honest with people. If something I hear isn't good and it was about me. I should go to the person before I do something stupid, and get my facts straight before I lash out with revenge.I would recommend this book to a more adult group just because Shakespeare is hard to read, but this book was really funny and very well written."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Debatably, this is perhaps Shakespeare's greatest comedy. The combination of the hilarious scathing witticisms exchanged between Beatrice and Benedick, the &quot;malapropatic&quot; words of Dogberry, and the underlying beautiful theme of love make this an illustrious masterpiece. It is must-read for anyone interested in studying the Shakespearean canon for all it is worth. It is also a very understandable play; even to someone who is not experienced in deciphering the very awkward style of Elizabethan English."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"I was assigned to read &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; for my block class, and my initial thought was, Oh, how boring. I don't want to read Shakespeare. I won't even be able to understand it. Let me tell you, I was very wrong! This book was excellent- one of the best I've ever read. It contained romance, humor, comedy, and drama- so many diverse qualities that I rarely find in books these days! The main characters, Beatrice and Benedick, add humor and warmth to the book. They argue and insult each other, yet they are really in love. Hero and Claudio are the lovebirds, but the evil Don John tries to get in the way of this with a deceitful plan. Even though this book was written centuries ago, the main themes still apply to today, (such as the Beatrice and Benedick theme). That is why this book is a classic. Oh, and understanding it isn't a problem, either. This was my first Shakespeare book ever (I'm only 14), and I understood the plot, characters, and the theme. I enjoyed it at the same time. So order this book today. You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"I've read over half of Shakespeare's plays, and Much Ado About Nothing is by far my favorite. Shakespeare not only weaves a clever tale of love and wit, he produces a villain, Don John, who rivals only Iago in evil. Benedick and Beatrice of course steal the show, but the true romantic can't help feeling the love between Claudio and Hero. A true masterpiece!If you don't have time to read the play, I highly recommend the recent movie version starring Kenneth Branagh as Benedick and Denzel Washington as Don Pedro. It cuts a few too many lines, but it's the only version of Much Ado that seems to come close to the happy-go-lucky tone that Shakespeare probably intended. Kenneth Branagh at is at his best."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"A man and a woman meet. They outwardly seem to despise each other (or at least find each other annoying), but we know that deep down they're in love and just need a jolt to realize it.That's one of the more popular romance tropes -- everybody from Jane Austen to anime has used it. But the original feisty Will They Or Won't They couple was Beatrice and Benedick in William Shakespeare's \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" -- and while the plot supposedly revolves around an evil plot to discredit Beatrice's cousin, it's more fun to watch the two B's slinging insults and falling in love.Spanish prince Don Pedro has defeated his evil illegitimate brother Don John, and is coming to the estate of Leonato for a visit -- along with his entourage, his disgraced brother, and his officers Benedick and Claudio. Claudio soon falls in love with Leonato's daughter Hero, but Hero's cousin Beatrice has the opposite reaction -- \\"there is a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her.\\"Soon Hero and Claudio are happily engaged, and Don Pedro decides to matchmake Beatrice and Benedick -- and after a tidy bit of manipulation, the acid-tongued pair fall madly in love. But Don John spins up a malicious deception that tears apart the love between Claudio and Hero, creates a rift between Leonato and Don Pedro, and leaves it doubtful that anyone will live happily ever after...\\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" is one of Shakespeare's finest comedies, mainly because it often hangs off his clever wordplay and zinger-filled dialogue (\\"I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.\\" \\"No; and he were, I would burn my study\\"). There's even some hilarious scenes where Benedick bemoans the difficulty of writing rhyming poetry.Technically the plot revolves around the impending wedding of Hero and Claudio, as well as Don John's attempts to derail the whole affair -- resulting on some painfully raw scenes (such as Beatrice freaking out after Hero's public disgrace), as well as some goofy ones... like any scene involving the absurd Dogberry. But Beatrice and Benedick are undeniably the centerpiece of the story, as well as the most likable characters.Because they're so witty and prickly, Beatrice and Benedick are loads of fun -- they start off violently against getting married and content to just lob insults at each other. And even after they fall in love, Shakespeare keeps their wit intact (\\"Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably\\"). Don Pedro is a good supporting character, a wise and kind prince who enjoys meddling in other people's romantic affairs.The downsides: we never really get a REASON for Don John to be such a jerk. And Claudio comes across as a puffed up adolescent with a crush, especially since he deliberately humiliates Hero in public to salvage his ego... and for some reason, she doesn't hate him for the maliciousness.\\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" is one of Shakespeare's best comedies -- a tennis match of zingers and witticisms, wrapped around a solid plot about deception and lies."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"I believe that the reading of this book/play shouls be encouraged for students across the country, because it shows a comical yet realistic view of love, and the effects it has on people.When Shakespeare wrote this play, I believe that his purpose was to show the two differing sides of love. He uses two examples, the first being Hero and Claudio, who embody the spirit of romantic, superficial love. The two of them never seem to talk, and as far as the reader knows, they don't have a whole lot in common. Claudio puts so much stock in his \\"love\\" for Hero that he overreacts too easily. For example, at a party where Don Pedro agrees to woo Hero for Claudio, Don Pedro's bastard brother Don John tricks Claudio into believing Pedro wants Hero for his own. WIth this fresh in his mind, Claudio stomps off in a huff, without even checking the facts. This kind of love is based on gazing wistfully at the one's partner across the room, and sunshine, lollipops and rainbows.The other kind of love that Shakespeare chooses to display in this play is the realistic kind of love that is displayed more often in society around us.

The lesson is that love makes people act stupid where they normally wouldn't. For example, Benedick, who said he would be bachelor until he was buried, is discovered to have written poetry and danced around in the garden all giddy and such, where mere moments before he was condemning the man who falls in love as a fool.I would reccommend this play to anyone who enjoys a good comedy with just a twinge of love intrest in it."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"I started a Shakespeare Group at my school and after the first meeting 15 people came up to me begging me to let Much Ado About Nothing be our first show.

In this delightful play the imperfection of human nature is humorously revealed. Shakespeare shows the weakness of romantic love and the reality of true love. This play provokes the reader to examine their thoughts about love and questions whether their preconceived ideas and attitudes of love are entirely correct.In Much Ado About Nothing Shakespeare shows how the characters are swept away with violent passions, which lead to near tragic consequences. As various mishaps, ominous occasions, strong emotions, and betrayal occur, this creates much ado over trivial circumstances. There are many examples of this motif, including Claudio's suspicions of being deceived by either Don Pedro or Hero, Leonato and Antonio's threats empty threats to Don Pedro and Count Claudio.My study of Much Ado About Nothing has personally taught me of the different types of love. Claudio's love for Hero was very superficial and his opinion of her was easily swayed. Their love was unrealistic and based on romantic views their lack of communication was the relationship's biggest downfall. Benedict and Beatrice's love, however disorderly and unromantic as it may seem, was in fact very realistic and true.I have learned that love is not perfect; there are problems in every relationship. It takes hard work, commitment, and dedication to make it work, the more time and effort you put into a relationship the more benefits you get from it. There is no such thing as love at first sight. However, attraction at first sight is very common. Love needs chemistry, compromises, and genuine respect for each other for a lasting relationship.I highly recommend this play because it is not only very funny but it is laced with strong moral values and makes a lasting impression. It clearly showed the comparison between the two couples and the witty battles between Beatrice and Benedict were exceedingly entertaining. This is truly one of Shakespeare's best works; a play to read over and over again."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Much Ado About Nothing is a classic comedy written by William Shakespeare, the greatest playwright of all time. Written over 400 years ago, it is a popular read among many play lovers. The basis of the play remains relevant in today's society. Shakespeare attempts to explore the different types of love: the realistic and the romantic.He portrays the realistic love through Beatrice and Benedick, who have uniquely equal relationship. They enjoy slandering one another, as well as debating each other. In their heads, they wish nothing more than to bring the other person down, yet in their hearts, they truly and deeply love each other. Their friendship and intelligence was the attraction for the relationship. They have a solid foundation for marriage and love. They are a true representation of what a marriage should be: a union of two equals.Shakespeare also portrays the romantic love through Hero and Claudio, who are two lovesick puppies with a naive idea about love. They were both attracted to each other through looks. Their love is based on nothing else, which is not a good foundation for marriage. Marriage should be based on personality or intellect. Beauty can fade with time, yet the inner person will remain the same. You should never enter marriage without first knowing the likes and dislikes of your mate. Two people who have nothing in common cannot have a good and healthy relationship. When two people are united through marriage, they must first realize that the other person is equal with them in every way.I have personally realized through Much Ado About Nothing and other life experiences that marriage is not about the physical attraction, but rather it is a union of two people who love and respect each other. Without mutual respect, a marriage cannot last. A couple must realize that they are two individuals with ideas and feelings. They may disagree on various issues, but no one person is better than the other. In order to make a marriage last, a balance must be found between couple: a balance of ideas and personality traits. Much Ado About Nothing is an important example of love, and I recommend reading this play if any doubts arise about the meaning of true love."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Much Ado About Nothing, written by William Shakespeare, was a well written play. It was, for the most part, very understandable. Although, I personally thought it was a pointless story. It is about two young couples and the different types of love that are experienced in life. It was not a waste of reading, because it kept my full attention, but it literally is much to do about nothing!Shakespeare's purpose for writing this is to show the readers and the audience who sees the performance the real meaning of love. Love is not always what it seems to be. It is portrayed in this play that real love is \`puppy love'. The type of love that Claudio and Hero have seems to be based on looks and what the people around them think. They are not close personally. It gets to the point that Claudio jumps to the conclusion that Hero is cheating on him, without talking with her first. The real life love that is talked about in this story is the Beatrice and Benedick relationship. They act themselves when they are together, even having disagreements like real people. Although they deny the fact they love each other, by the end of the story they are ready for the world to know.I've learned from reading this play, the real meaning of love. One should not love for the physical appearance of a person but for their personality and what is inside. As corny as it may sound, it is the truth and what everyone needs to know. People also cannot jump to conclusions. That messed up Claudio and Hero's relationship for a big part of the play. They need to acknowledge the other person and have enough respect for them to approach them before assuming.I would definitely recommend this play to anyone who loves a good laugh. There are many scenes I did not mention that made me smile and makes the story worthwhile!"},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Much Ado About Nothing by William Shakespeare is a romantic comedy about two kinds of love. Realistic love and romantic love are both illustrated by two different couples. Benedict and Beatrice illustrate the kind of love that cannot be easily broken, realistic love. Claudio and Hero represent the type of love that is based mainly on appearance and can be hurt very easily. I believe that this is positive reading because it can teach us a whole plethora of life lessons that can still be applied in our daily lives, while at the same time adding a little bit of comedy to get the point across in a humorous way.I believe that William Shakespeare's purpose for writing this is to show how wacky people can get when love is in the air. Some examples of this premise can be clearly seen through the relationship of Benedict and Beatrice. In the beginning of the story they hate each other because they had some past issues they had. Once Benedict hears a conversation between Don Pedro, Claudio and Leonato when they said something about Beatrice loving Benedict he became the most anyone has ever seen. That is the same case with Beatrice she overhears a conversation where someone said Benedict loves Beatrice and now she is love struck as well.I stated earlier that this book had many Life lessons that one could learn. One of the lessons that I personally learned is that outward appearance is good and everything, but that should not be the basis for a marriage relationship. If looks are the basis for a relationship then that relationship will most likely fail."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Shakespeare's, Much Ado About Nothing, was cleverly composed and delivered in his Old English style of dialogue. It is excellent reading not only for teachers and parents, but also for students as well. I enjoyed the Dover Thrift edition because it is unabridged from the original text and it is exceedingly important to read versions that are as close to the original as possible. The dialogue is very swift and simple to follow.The action in this play is the result of \\"love battles\\" between the characters, Count Claudio and Hero and Signior Benedick and Lady Beatrice. It all began with the hate that Don John had for his legitimate brother and prince, Don Pedro. In the prince's close group of young lords, were Count Claudio and Signior Benedick. Conrade and Borachio were followers of the wicked, Don John. Don John then proceeds to wreck the one important relationship that his brother tried to promote- that of Claudio and Hero. Count Claudio courts the Lady Hero and gains her affection, but through a turn of events, Don John induces Claudio think that Hero has been a wench with the gentleman, Borachio and a myriad of other men in Messina. Paying Borachio handsomely for wooing the servant, Margaret, supposed to be Hero, Don John takes Claudio and Don Pedro to view it from the lawn of the governor's mansion. Then, disgracing Hero in the midst of their wedding party, Claudio is freed from blame and Hero is forced to be claimed dead for her own good. Signior Benedick, being a very cynical lord, tried to woo the Lady Beatrice (Hero's cousin), but she spurned him each time. With a few playful schemes from Don Pedro's party, Beatrice and Benedick are in love permanently. The story plot descends with the capturing of the men who took place in the cabal against Hero. Count Claudio is then forced to mourn and weep for the \\"loss\\" of his true love. Hero's father, Leonato, the governor of Messina, commands Claudio to marry his niece who is an identical copy of his deceased daughter. All this agreed upon, Claudio finds out that Hero is still alive and they are married.Shakespeare, in writing this play, tried to convey to all audiences that love will make people do very silly, giddy things. Benedick had been \\"the unmarried man\\" who would not stand for the thought of marriage let alone take part in it, but at the end, he falls in love and is engaged to Beatrice. In the course of the play, Benedick is made a fool of because of what he does for love. With the course character and disposition that he had, it would not have been expected that he would write frothy poems and sing silly love ballads to \\"sweet Beatrice\\". Also, Shakespeare let his audience in to the fact that women were not very trusted in his day. In England at that time, men were allowed to be libertines if they wished, but they were only accustomed to marrying virgins. Such was in the case of Hero and Claudio. The Count accused her of improper behavior, everyone else believed it and ignored her version of the story. No matter what answer she gave to the Count's questions, the group only believed Claudio.In reading this play, I have learned to place comic relief in my own compositions, whether they be poems, novels or short stories. Dogsberry, a very drunk, very unstable comic relief, stumbles upon grand discoveries as Messina's only constable, without even knowing the treasure he has uncovered. This was the case when he arrested Borachio and Conrade on the charges of slander and being \\"lying knaves\\". His mixed up dialogue and incredibly stupid actions, cause the reader to enjoy the plot even more.I recommend this play greatly to all avid readers because of it's incredible art of language and dialogue, knit together by its creator. This play could also be linked to scripture. God says that Satan is the author of all confusion, just like Don John was in the story. Don John caused everyone to doubt the innocence and stability of everyone else, including themselves.

This book had all of the makings of a classic love story and all of the elements of a comedy. The classic love story is displayed by two characters named Claudio (a man) and Hero(a woman). Claudio is a Count and Hero is the only child of a rich land owner Leonato. Hero and Claudio show an image of unrealistic love. Their friends Benedick and Beatrice display realistic love with all of the ups and downs that life has. Even though they were obviously in love they would not let on to each other their feelings for the other one. Instead they showed hatred to each other with querulous tongues. All together this foursome creates the hilarious yet serious love story of the book. As you can see from this review it is truly a story about nothing but also a story about everything because we all struggle with the love in all of its forms in our own life.If this is your fist time to read Shakespeare this is a good book to start with because it is written in a way that makes it seem like a modern book."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"In my opinion this is one of Shakespeare's best plays. You get his usual lovely poetic language. Also you get the usual turmoil until the climax and then all ends well which is a commonality in Shakespeare comedys. He also has the commonality of the mistaken identity which creates some of the turmiol. But this comedy in my opinion has the best plot. The two couples and what they go through make it very intriguing. I especially like Beatrice and Benidick's character's. Their lines in the beginning are so witty and clever. I found their lines to be quite funny. These are definitly Shakespeare's wittiest characters. In contrast, Hero and Claudio could be his sweetest characters. I like how he included these couples of opposite temperments in the same play. It makes it more interesting. Also, this play doesn't have a dull act. In some of Shakespeare's plays there's an act where nothing that exciting happens, not this one.

Witnessing and being involved in the deceitfulness of peers, and finding myself caught in the middle of complicated and thorny relationships, I find the play easy to relate to. This romantic comedy is about love interwoven with misfortune, full of confusion, deception, and of course, sexual tension, which Shakespeare often places in his plays. Much Ado About Nothing narrows the gap between tragedy and comedy, due to the temporary misfortunes of the characters; however, the misunderstandings are highlighted by the comical elements of the play. Characters throughout the story fall head over heels for each other within seconds or are tricked into falling in love (the term love in this play is used loosely). The main characters, Beatrice and Benedict, are brought together through the gossip of their friends, turning witticisms into affection. Hero and Claudio are meant to be together, but because of lies and deceit of the antagonist, Don John, their relationship is continually tumultuous. Of course, despite the evil and deceptive deeds performed by several characters, the play remains a comedy, where Shakespeare grants us a happy ending, with weddings and the capture of the villain, Don John.--This text refers to the Mass Market Paperback edition."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"&quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; is one of my favorite of Shakespeare's plays. Come on, it's worth five stars just for the three scenes with Dogberry (Shakespeare's greatest clown???). However, the rest of the play is brilliant as well. Some people read it as a straightforward love story. However, I am not sure whether or not any of the characters are REALLY in love with each other or not. I've read it as a commentary on society (as I've read many of the comedies). I think that the play is about how our lives are shaped by gossip and the opinions we believe others to have of us. Notice how both Benedick and Beatrice mention how others will perceive them if they do not requite the others &quot;love&quot; for him/her. I think it is a commentary on the flaws of placing so much emphasis on propriety and manner and the power of words in shaping our lives. But then again, that's just me. Whether or not you (or anyone for that matter...(gulp!)...or am I really alone???) read this play the same way, you should find much enjoyment in it and I therefore recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"I recently read Shakespeare's &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; during my freshman year in high school. I was surprised at how readable it is (even without Folger's aids on every other page). The story is very easy to follow and delightfully refreshing! There are some interesting themes in the novel including: women's rights (ironically), true love comes in all packages, male chauvanism, and more hidden deep. My teacher thought it was the perfect segway into &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; another of Shakespeare's works. Its a great way for one to 'wet their hands' into Shakespeare's, and Folger's edition of the play is marvelous in doing so due to the fact its one of Shakespeare's simpler plays to comprehend and ponder."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"I was looking for a small book for my college class on shakespeare and all i could find was these gigantic books of his workds but with other peoples interpretations.

The paperback print is small but okay unless someone has pretty poor vision."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Considering all the literature my high career covered, Much Ado about Nothing by William Shakespeare stands as my favorite piece by far. Not only is it a superb representative of Shakespeare's comedic works and a good opportunity to study them, the message ascertained from the obstacles and themes presented by the characters is important for students to gain. As most high school students read this during their senior year, the message they gain from the play, that worrying excessively or making \`much ado about nothing' is imprudent, illustrates a good lesson for the students as they go onto college or out into the career world. Furthermore, the additional lessons and themes students take from reading the play, such as the importance of honor and moral integrity seemed rather impactful as my senior class read this play during the time when college applications, SAT's, and recommendation letters were being completed. Also, entering college with a well-rounded Shakespearean background offers an academic advantage because his work will be assigned almost definitely at some point. That is not to say this play is good only for students; I would encourage everyone to read this, as it is a beautiful depiction of one of Shakespeare's more brilliant plays, in my opinion. The language may be a bit difficult to understand, but pressing on and learning to comprehend it is worth the effort as the incredibly witty dialogue between characters, specifically Beatrice and Benedict is highly humorous. Although at points the ridiculousness of the situations portrayed by the characters does become frustrating and you will want to just yell at them to stop and talk to each other!, the end result overall is satisfying and exactly what I wanted from the play. There is also a movie done by Kenneth Branagh featuring Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, Emma Thompson and many other amazing actors and actresses that is almost as good and is portrayed wonderfully. Plus, Mumford and Sons made a song based off of the play and who doesn't love them?"},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"This story centers on the misadventures in love between the characters Benedick and Beatrice. The pranks that are played to bring them together are some of the most heralded in literature. If they actually think they love the other, then they will fall madly in love.The class structure of the play, and Shakespeare's time also comes out well in this play. Dogberry is a stupid, yet loyal person. He is dispensing justice for Leonato yet he is not listened to in time to save a really humiliating scene in which Claudio destroys Hero's reputation. I think this play gives us an important philosophical point: that it is better to be less smart and loyal and good than smart and devious. And that even the evil doings of Don John can be found out even though Conrade etc. are smarter than their captors.Finally, there are some who like to wonder why Don John is such a bad person, well every good play needs a villain and he fills that role to perfection. Don John is just evil. There is no need for analysis, other than to explicate his treachery and underhandedness.As an introduction to Shakespeare's comedies, I highly rate this work. I think all will enjoy it, its allure has stood the test of time."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"This book was absolutely ridiculous. No copyright or publishing information. It looked like it had been printed from microsoft word. No sidenotes, line numbers. Don't purchase this book for Shakespeare's sake."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Claudio, a strong, simple, reliable man loves Hero who matches him in simplicity and reliability while replacing his strength with her shy quiet charm. Fortunately the play isn't about them. Their easy obvious love does drive the play's plot but it really serves as the foundation over which Shakespeare puts together the most interesting couple of all his plays: Benedick and Beatrice.Benedick is a friend of Claudio with whom he serves Don Pedro. Beatrice is close friends with her cousin Hero, the daughter of Leonato, the governor of Messina where the play is set. The two hate each other, or at least they think they do. Their friends know better.Each of them fears the submission that comes with love. They are an obvious match for one another and yet neither ever wastes an opportunity to put down the other, giving us some of Shakespeare's most delicious bantering.Unlike Petruchio and Kate from The Taming of The Shrew, neither ever decisively wins over the other. There are only two ways this play can end for them. Either they fall in love and thus they both win, or they keep to themselves and they both lose.Another difference between this play and The Taming of The Shrew is that the Shew is a fantasy about how men can rule their wives while Much Ado About Nothing is more realistic. This play portrays two strong superior individuals both determined to stay true to themselves and yet each needing the other to complete themselves. Claudio and Hero are a conventional couple, a good husband and a good wife, both following the social convention that the man rules the family. Benedick and Beatrice on the other hand show us that it is possible for a man and a woman to love each other as equals, social conventions be damned!Vincent Poirier, Montreal"},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"\\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" is one of Shakespeare's perennial crowd-pleasers and pops up in performance all the time in classical theatre companies. The reason is simple; it is a fun and witty play. It has some of the best verbal wordplay in all of Shakespeare, and it boasts the only middle aged lovers in all of the Bard's work, the lovely Beatrice and Benedick. This pair of former lovers bicker and snipe at each other with such intensity that the physical and emotional attraction is blatantly obvious form their first moment together on the page / stage.One of the reasons that I keep returning to \\"Much Ado\\" is because of how deftly Shakespeare handles the leading characters' pride and reluctance to take the dangerous leap into love. It especially resonates in our times when more and more middle aged people find themselves divorced and single. How does one take that risk again, often under the same emotional circumstances as Beatrice and Benedick? When these two finally put aside their pride and open up to each other it is as touching and lovely a moment as any in Shakespeare.Once again as with so many of Shakespeare's best comedies, the characterizations are key to the enjoyment of this text. Bedsides the two leads we get the malaprop prone constable Dogberry, who accidentally keeps the plot from becoming a tragedy, and the subtle characterization of Don Pedro the prince. There is more to this character than one gets at first glance, and the close reader will be rewarded by paying attention to Don Pedro's wooing of Hero for his underling Claudio. Shakespeare adds in layers there that are interesting to ruminate on.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feels like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period. Well priced and well worth it."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Throughout the last couple of weeks, my class has been studying much ado aboutnothing. Shakespear was an amazing writer in my opinion. He is able to write so little, yetget his entire, deep point across. The play was called much ado about nothing becausethroughout the entire play there was fighting and crying and decieving.. and for what?Nothing. I beleive that i learned a lot from it. Not only about Shakespeares sytle ofwriting, but about love too. To answer the question whats shakespeares purpose forwriting, i had to think carefully. But I beleive that his point of writing was to show thereal meaning of love. Throughout the entire play, there were people loving each other andnot knowing it, and loving each other but not knowing each other.. and it was just a hugemess. Claudio and Hero had \\"love at first site\\" but Claudio beleived what he thought hesaw Hero doing on a roof, which proves that he didnt know her as well as he should tolove her. So I think that Shakespeare makes you wonder if their love was true or not. Thisstory had many values in it that one could learn. I, personally learned something veryimportant to which I had not seen before- How easily people mistake love for lust. Anexample of this would be when Claudio and Hero met. They had no idea who each otherwere, not even something as simple as their names, yet they were \\"in love\\". I do not seehow you can possibly be in love with someone from first site. That is called lust. I alsolearned something very important to which I had not seen before- How stupid people actwhen they are in love. An example of people acting weird and stupid when they are inlove would be Benedict and Beatrice. At first, they hated each other. The play starts outwith them being cruel, rude, and sarcastic to one another and the reader knows there issomething between them. Then, when they are both deceived and told that they love oneanother, they start prancing around like fairies. Although this is funny, it is very weirdand confusing at the same time that their emotions towards each other can just changeautomatically. Another example would be at Claudio and Hero's second wedding. Afterall of this love talk, when their love is put out into the public, they start to deny it and saythey are just friends. Love makes them act so weird, but they end up deciding to betogether which I believe is for the good. This play is not extremely hard to understand, yethas a meaningful story. It is written in old english so that is probably the most difficultthing to understand about it. I would recommend it to someone who could use a goodlaugh because of all the comic relief in it. There is loads of sarcasm and its written in aninteresting way. After all, it is Shakespeare. I would not, however, recommend this bookto someone who is expecting a deep, poetic, tragic story because they are simply notgoing to get it. This story isn't complex nor is it deep. It is all, really, just much ado aboutnothing. I enjoyed the book, one; because I could understand what was going onthroughout the whole thing, and two; because the writing is funny and it kept meentertained. So, Id really recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Much Ado About Nothing by William Shakespeare is a romantic comedy set in Messina. The story revolves around the Prince, Don Pedro, with his regiment, and the house of Leonato, the governor of Messina. The reading was positive in many ways. The story has unpredictable suspense and comical characters, such as Dogberry, the constable known for his malapropism. Another favorable part was the masquerade party, which unraveled devious plans, confessed love, and humorous banter.The reason Shakespeare wrote this play was to show love. He shows all the happenings, excitement, and sometimes the stupidity that revolves around the surroundings of love. There are two couples that share love. But the love shown in each isn't portrayed or felt in the same way.Hero and Claudio have a seemingly perfect love filled with loving looks and content sighs. The moment Claudio saw Hero he proclaimed his love and dedication to her and his amazement of her beauty. While they held love for each other, they rarely talked together. Their love was fragile and easily tattered Instead of going to her and asking what the problem was Claudio was very quick to believe the deception against Hero. Upon hearing of Hero's faulted character he could not defend her in any way for he didn't even know her. The other couple is Benedick and Beatrice. Benedick's hotheaded attitude towards marriage and women made himself out to wanting to stay a bachelor forever. As for Beatrice, she had an outspoken manner and tended to enjoy disputing with Benedick. Regardless of their bickering the two fell in love, but not without the conspiring nature of their close companions. While Hero and Claudio had a shallow love that only went \\"looks\\" deep, Beatrice and Benedick came to realize that through their arguing and squabbling they truly did love each other. They came to know one another by talking and began to understand the other deeper. Benedick not only confessed his love to her but also took action to show his deep love for Beatrice.Shakespeare has shown the fickleness of love. Before love, Claudio was a soldier known to be firm. But under the eye of a woman he became desperate and dramatic. Then the previous obnoxious Benedick befell to sweet and giddy with his newfound love. Beatrice who held a fiery tongue became entranced with Benedick and fell for him also. The change that love brought to people was incredible in this story. It showed that when someone holds another so far up in their heart, the effort to strengthen that love is powerful.This reading has shown me the importance of love and friendship. As a friend I should remember the importance of the other first instead of myself. The trust that is in a relationship should not be abandoned but protected and held close. Claudio was swift to assume that Hero was no longer a maiden without even considering talking to Hero himself. The importance in trust is being able to communicate efficiently with the other person. I have been reminded that in any circumstance I should clear an issue personally before I assume the worst on someone's account. I have also learned the significance in showing love. The difference that a loved one makes in lives can be encouraging or without showing love it can be harsh. Remembering to show my care and love towards my friends and family is of high importance. The love that Benedick and Beatrice held for each other was deep and self-sacrificing. Showing how this one love made an entirety of difference is something to remember."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"This was the best play I have ever read.

These main characters get flustered over nothing explaining the title of the book, Much Ado about Nothing. Beatrice and Benedick both vow never to get married. They are constantly having a battle of wits, bantering back and forth. The Prince, Don Pedro, Claudio and Leonato, the Governor of Messina, set up Benedick to fall in love. When they are sure that Benedick is within hearing distance, they begin a conversation about Beatrice's love for Benedick. On the other side of the garden, Hero, Martha and Ursula wait until Beatrice is within hearing distance to carry out their part of the scheme, and begin to talk of Benedick's undying love for Beatrice. Benedick and Beatrice end up falling in love \\"against their will\\".In another plot of the story, Claudio and Hero are in love and are going to get married. But John Don, not wanting to loose his chance of becoming the king, cooks up a scheme to end the wedding. Don John sets up the Prince and Claudio to see Martha, Hero's maid, at Hero's bedroom window with a man who calls her Hero. Claudio, thinking Hero is being unfaithful, refuses to marry her shaming her in front of family and friends.Much Ado about Nothing has wonderfully developed characters and very descriptive scenes, so much so that you feel as though you can see the sights of Messina along with the characters. Although this is a wonderful and well written story it did have one weakness. Shakespeare used the same theme as in Romeo and Juliet. A friar has the idea that the young Hero, who wants to marry her true love but can not, should pretend to be dead. This seems repetitive and makes you wonder if maybe Shakespeare was running out of ideas.Much Ado about Nothing is a lively tale of young love and deception. It is a good read for anyone willing to put in a little effort to understand Shakespeare's language and play on words by reading footnotes. It is definitely worth the effort."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Claudio is in love with Hero, but there's only ONE problem Hero is scheduled to Marry the Prince.

This comedy of his is full of plots of mistaken identity and misunderstandings, which are all corrected with a comic flair. The witty verbal war between the characters make this an outstanding example of Shakespeare's command over the English language. I have given it 4 stars, however, because of certain plot inconsistencies, that I feel could have been fixed."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"William Shakespeare's play \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" was an extremely funny piece of literature. I thought that it was very cleverly planned out and humorously executed. With Dogberry and his men constantly mixing up words and their meanings it gave the readers a comic relief. The deceit and mistaken identities added so much humor to the already capturing story.I believe that Shakespeare's main point in writing this play was to show that many times, people get worked up over simple miscommunications. You mishear something wrong, or in your anger, you tune out someone before getting all the facts. All that we would need to do to fix a certain problem would be going to the source of the information, but many times we take the easy way out. We jump the gun a little and choose to believe whatever is told to us despite our gut feeling that the information is wrong.An example of this would be when Leonato has heard of Hero's scandalous evening with Borachio. Despite the fact that she is his daughter and he would know her better than anyone, Leonato believes the lies told about Hero. Leonato, being her father and the one who raised her, should have known his daughter well enough to know that she would not dishonor her fianc&eacute; and herself. Especially the night before the wedding that she has been waiting for. Instead of choosing to believe his daughter, who firmly denies any and all sexual relationships, he joins Claudio, Don John, and Don Pedro in disgracing her.One lesson learned from \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" is never should people automatically assume something to be correct. We should \\"take everything with a grain of salt\\"- test everything. People in the world these days are so willing to lie to us and readily do so without a second thought. Many times people are lied to without even knowing that someone has done so. True, sometimes the lying and deceit is all in good fun, but it still has the possibility of hurting someone. Even innocent lying has its consequences.Benedick and Beatrice both believed almost immediately that what they had overheard their friends saying in the garden was correct and completely true. Neither person decided to test what they had heard. To see if what was said was true. Because both did not check to see if the information they heard was correct, everything worked out. Both assumed what they had heard was true and acted on it. There were no visible consequences. What a mess you would have if Benedick decided that what he had overheard could not possibly be true. Beatrice would have made a fool out of herself while thinking that Benedick felt the same way. The same could be said the other way around.I would recommend this play to other readers. If people don't like to read, then I would not tell others about it. The combination of not liking to read and the difficulty of understanding Old English would not make a very fun and pleasurable read. Many would miss out on the humor and cleverness that Shakespeare brilliantly displayed to his audience. Readers on the other hand would most likely like this play. The humor and lightheartedness makes it an enjoyable play. I found myself constantly wanting to know what would happen next and how it would end- how Shakespeare would wrap it up. The happy ending was also a nice touch. Yes, the Old English adds a challenge to the reading. The sometimes hard to understand language makes you stop and think about what Shakespeare is trying to say and ultimately makes you stop and realize what he is truly trying to communicate to his audience."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"\\"Romeo, Romeo! Where for art thou Romeo?\\" Wait a minute, wrong play! In my opinion, Much Ado about Nothing was a very funny book/play and I somewhat enjoyed reading it. The only bad part about it is that it was a chick flick (or in its case a chick play). The old English also took away from the play sometimes. However, for the most part it was understandable. Overall, I believe Shakespeare probably had a reason for writing the play other than just for pure entertainment.Much Ado about Nothing is a classic Shakespearian type play. It is a comedy about two young couples. One couple is Benedick and Beatrice. At the start of the play they are in love with one another, they just do not know it yet. They are constantly bickering and fighting with each other. The other couple Hero and Claudio, who are madly in love with each other (or so they think) plot to make Benedick and Beatrice realize that they are in love with each other. They also have help in the form of Leanato, Don Pedro, Margaret and Ursula. Meanwhile, Don Pedro's evil brother Don John along with his henchmen, Conrade and Borachio, plot to break up Hero and Claudio. The plan nearly succeeds, and the rather unusual constable Dogberry and his somewhat merry men must come to the rescue of Claudio's and hero's relationship.As I said before, the main point of Shakespeare writing the play was probably for more than entertainment. I believe he also wrote it because he wanted to show how crazy love can make a person. In the play, Beatrice and Benedick fall in love with each other. After Claudio shames Hero, Beatrice was so upset that she asks that Benedick kills Claudio. Now that presents a problem because Benedick and Claudio are good friends. At first, Benedick is very reluctant to do this. So reluctant that he refuses to do this. After she says she will not love him any more Benedick immediately agrees to kill Claudio. Even though I would probably do the same thing in Benedick's position, it is still amazing what love can make you do.Surprisingly, I actually learned something from this play. It's the simple fact that assumptions are very, very dangerous. Thanks to Don John and his henchmen's evil plot, Claudio thought that he had seen Hero cheating on him with Borachio. In reality, it was Margaret and Borachio that he saw. Acting on only what he saw, he shamed Hero and \\"killed\\" her.In the end, it was another happily ever after moment. Personally, I expected a better ending, but that's just me. Yes, I would recommend this book but I myself did not love it. Too much love, not enough action and drama. However, it was very funny, especially the constable Dogberry (my favorite character in the book/play). Also the plot was well developed so that kept my interest. Overall, it was good and worth reading. I would give the book/play 8.11 out of 10. You would probably like it so go buy and read it. Great play, but it's just not for me."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Much Ado About Nothing is the best Shakespear book ever written. It is a funny, romantic book, perfect for snuggling up with on a winter night. I advise you strongly to read it. You will surely LOVE it!!!"},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"This play was a particular relief of your average Shakespeare play, in that it is not a deep philosophical piece of literature. I personally loved reading this play and it does have many interesting values and lessons that one could learn and apply. In several instances I found myself laughing out loud just reading the script. Over all I would say that this is yet another one of Shakespears timeless classics that can still very easily be applied in almost every persons life today. Shakespeare wrote this play, as I believe, to show people how stupid they are and the foolish things that they do when they are in love. I personally do not really enjoy the drama of a love story, but this is a whole different animal.The characters in the story are completely normal citizens of an almost care- free society, but, when love comes knocking at their door they transform into completely zaney lunatics. The characters are, however, people and react in different ways. No matter how they do react it is a far cry from what they normally would do. Indeed, this story shows someone to what great lengths they will go in the name of love. For instance, Benedict, one of the main characters, falls in love with the main female and all of a sudden becomes a quiet, softspoken gentleman, who now cares about his appearance. Whereas before he was an opinionated man, who used sarcasm to get his points across. The story does portray very well what love is, different types of love, and how it is reacted to. This play has taught me many things, especially about women, but most of all it has taught me that there are two very specific types of love and that a person should experience both. One type of love, presented by Beatrice and Benedict is the real heart felt one, where both people know and care for one another and the other was demonstrated by Hera and Claudio. This type is known as \\"puppy love.\\" Each couple represents their type of love very well and has helped me to realize which sort of love that I have, and have had with other people. This book is well worth whatever they are asking for it. If you really apply yourself you can get alot out of this story. The storyline is very good and lets you feel that you are a part of the story, like you know something that the other characters do not know. It is so involved that I often wanted to strangle some of the characters and tell others some great secret. Then I felt like a retard and stopped myself. This is a very light read and though it is mildly difficult to understand it is easy to understand what point Shakespeare is trying to get across. This story is so good because it teaches so many lessons without having this heavy blanket of philosophy shrouded around it. I would recommend this play to anyone who just simply enjoys a good read. If by chance you read this review, then realize this, I am not exagerrating of making any of this stuff up. This is a really good story without the deep thoughts and questions of life. So, in conclusion, this is just one person talking, but READ THE PLAY! It is really good and worth it, but you do not have to take my word for it."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Much Ado About Nothing, a play written by William Shakespeare, is about two couples, who through a series of trials and schemes, fall in love with each other. This is a romantic play, and it contrasts two types of love, romantic and realistic love.Benedick and Beatrice portray realistic love. They have a solid foundation for each other, they can tease each other, get mad at each other, and love each other at the same time. They are down to earth and practical about love. Once they fall in love, they cannot be swayed in their decisions even though they try to ignore their feelings. Claudio and Hero, on the other hand, represent romantic love. They live on Cloud 9, and their love is based on physical attraction. In the play they fall in love with each before talking. As soon as their relationship gats rocky, though, Claudio bails out, leaving a heartbroken Hero.I think that Shakespeare wrote this play to show how comical love is. Benedick and Beatrice, who both swore mutual hate for each other, and pledged they would never get marry, fall desperately in love with each other after overhearing their friend's schemes to get them together. Claudio, who swears his undying affection to Hero, mentally dumps her once in the movie, and then leaves her at the wedding altar, because Don John plays tricks on his mind, and easily sways him to quit loving Hero. I think Shakespeare also tried to show us that true love conquers any obstacle in its way.There are many life lessons in this play. The title, Much Ado About Nothing, relays one of the most important messages. Claudio constantly makes mountains out of molehills in this play. He is quick to jump to conclusions, and does not stop to verify the facts. He bases his judgments on perceptions, instead of reality.I would highly recommend this book. Although it was written about 400 years ago, it is still applicable to real life. It was a good book, and it contained drama, action, romance, comedy, and deception. One of its downfalls was that it was hard to understand the language because it was written so long ago."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"This story starts out as four people who don't really know how or that there fate lies with each other. Hero is a very charming innocent girl who likes to please people; she doesn't stand up for herself but basically obeys what her father tells her. She meets a man, Claudio, who falls in love with her because of her beauty. Claudio is very quick to judge and has no loyalty or consideration of other people. He is very selfish in what he acts on, he doesn't seem to care about anything else except what he wants. These two who fall in love with each other, at first they seem to be the perfect pair but soon much is found out about there character and perseverance when they face a trial that will test them and there devotion to each other.At a first impression you would never guess their feelings toward each other but little did Benedick and Beatrice know. Beatrice is a fiery woman who is very opinionated and never ashamed to speak her mind, and especially shares her opinions with a certain man named Benedick. Benedick also has a very wild outlook and also likes to speak what he believes is right. They often bicker which they state there differences in a very fiery manner. Benedick protests quite openly how stupid he thinks Love and marriage is, which is comical seeing that later on, he would be giddy with the same love that he mocks. Slowly but surely there obstinate passion and their denial of there true feelings fall into the right place.I think that Shakespeare's main purpose for writing this book is because he wanted to show how important marriage was. That you shouldn't base your whole relationship on what you look like but you should find out who that person is and then decide if you would want to marry them. Shakespeare wanted to describe the difficulties of having a fake-based love. Because then when you actually have to start dealing with the real issues then how are you going to be able to persevere. Whereas when you have that reality love, the love where you argue about stuff, but its realizing that there are different opinions and that you will get in arguments. So when you have that realistic love then you will know how to deal with the person you married. Whereas on fake love you dont even know who they really are let alone how to deal with them.I have personally learned how important it really is when you are picking whom you are going to live with for the rest of your life. I have learned that you really need to look inside of the person to know who they are and to look at how they react to situations. Also not to base it on looks, because if you marry them then you are going to live with them for the rest of you life. God told us that if we get married then we are to be as one, and you should totally love them. Not just like how they look, but base your relationships on their character and personality."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"I thought that the play \\"Much Ado about Nothing\\" was a very positive and a enjoyable play to read. Shakespeare's main point in the play is that Love makes you act weird. In the play when Benidick over heard Don Jon, Claudio, and Leonato in the garden giving the illusion that Beatrice was in love with him you saw his true feelings come out of him that you thought you would never see. Beatrice and Benidick fight like cats and Dogs but as soon as Benidick overheard that Beatrice was in love with him he acted like a 3 year old when they find out there going to Disney world. He was thrilled at the fact that Beatrice fancied him. Now on the other side of the garden, Hero and another Woman are doing the same Don Jon, Claudio, and Leonato did to Benidick, only to Beatrice. When Beatrice over hears that Benidick fancy's her she is in shock. She acts as if nothing in thw world was wrong with a huge grin on her face and singing like a love struck teenager. Now these are 2 adults that couldn't stand to be in the same room with each other and now they love each other!There's more to that story then just what we think. But you have to read to find out! I have learned a couple of things from reading this play. Iv learned to like people for who they are inside not on the outside. Hero and Claudio's relationship was based on looks. Iv also learned that when u do wrong things punishment may not come to you just then but eventually it will catch up with you. Don Pedro tricked everyone into thinking common things of Hero and he got what he deserved. And last but not least I learned to put family 2nd to God because when everyone else leaves you will still have family. When Claudio made that scene in front of everyone about Hero Beatrice was right there to comfort her. And I would recommend this book to anyone because it was funny and interesting, And I'm a teen. It's hard to keep our attention but me and my class seem to agree that this play was excellent!"},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"this is shakespeare's finest comedy. it has the most interesting and well-balanced romance, and a secondary story that is substantial and moving. besides petruchio in 'taming of a shrew', benedick is the only male character in a comedy that is close to being the equal of his female love interest. beatrice is still a bit too much for benedick, but he hangs in there, and their tete-a-tetes make for some of the most interesting lines in all of shakespeare. beatrice is also one of shakespeare's most interesting and charming female characters. i know many readers prefer rosalind from 'as you like it', but i find beatrice's wit, laced as it is with some unexplained bitterness, far more intriguing, even alluring. besides, maan is just a flat-out better story than 'as you like it' or 'twelfth night'. the story never sags as it does in these other plays. it's my favorite shakespeare comedy."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"The intricate characterization that is posessed in each person is intense. Don John, the bastard brother, however turned evil beneath our eyes. At least, to mine. Perhaps there is an imagery I did not pick up on.Hero was a delicate flower who had a quiet mischieveous maid at hand, Margaret. Her quick evilness was a surprise, and completely expected at the same time. It was unlike Shakespeare (at least in my readings of his plays) to have a maid be a villian. Margaret's character intrigued me the most because of her sincerness toward Hero but, her obvious greed in regards to foil play against Hero.The quadrant of love that was in the play enveloped me to read more and more. Although Hero and Claudio were to be the hero and heroine, Beatrice and Benedick provided much more fun. B&B; play a very well matched up intellegence, humour and humanity in pale comparison to Hero and Claudio (and probably any Shakespearean duo).Don Pedro, Hero and Claudio do everything in there power to bring B&B;,the non willing duo to say 'I Love You' to the alter. The plan ultimately succeeds.That bastard, Don John was far more interested however, in getting Hero for himself. So in tern, he gets Borachio to set up a 'date' between Hero and an unknown lover for Claudio to 'stumble' upon, with the help of Borachio.Read this fascinating play where humour meets dark, the beginning before Shakespeare goes tragic. The play fuses both emotions terrifically. The play is great and is open to great conversation."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"This is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays. When I first saw it as a play I did not understand the plot at all. Finally I read the play and enjoyed it immensely. I think one of the reasons that I enjoyed it so much is that it is not a tragedy. I really enjoyed this edition because of the fact that it is written using Shakespeare's vocabulary. But it has definitions of the words that you are most likely going to stumble over.It has two plots which makes it more interesting, but it is still very easy to follow. Much Ado About Nothing starts off with Count Claudio falling in love with Hero whom he is going to marry. Don John doesn't want him to marry Hero. So Don John decides to come up with a plan to keep Claudio from marrying Hero. The second plot has most of the characters trying to make two people who hate each other fall in love."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"The Oxford School Shakespeare series, edited by Roma Gill, is the best series in print for students of all ages. I have used them with high school students to great effect. They enjoy the small pictures that are on nearly every page, as well as the side-by-side layout of notes and text. The synopses (really a running commentary) that begins each volume are outstanding, and the sample test questions and suggestions for study will help anyone--student, teacher, or casual reader--to both think about and listen to the plays more carefully. The only thing that some will miss is a discussion of the play's textual history, but this is so rarely a part of graduate study that it can easily be supplemented at the right time by other sources (the new Arden series is great for this). I could not recommend this series more highly."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"While the laughs in this play do not quite equal &quot;The Comedy of Errors,&quot; this play offers a well developed serious side as well. Don John is interesting as the villain who simply can not tolerate people's happieness. While this is rare, it DOES exist. Hero is fine as the docile and submissive woman who grants Claudio a merciful and blessed 2nd chance. Beatrice is captivating as the quick witted woman who can not be outspoken and is intelligent enough to recognize Don John's mischief. The priest is striking as the man who can spot Don John's evil and offers an intelligent plan that brings salvation to the end of the play. Dogberry offers some welcome comical touches as the bumbling but also effective officer. Benedick is wonderful. First he is a bumbling character who can not stand women. He is quickly outwitted by Beatrice and he falls for Don Pedro's and Claudio's plan to get him and Beatrice together. He offers a hilarious soliloquy on the perfect woman. But he is not a weakling. When Hero is wronged by Don John's evil, he boldly resigns from Don Pedro's service and challanges Claudio to a duel. But leave it to Shakespeare to resolve everything and offer us a happy ending. Great comedy, a sudden dilemna, beautiful language, and a happy ending make this play another of Shakespeare's triumphs!"},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Much Ado About Nothing will entice even the most stubborn high school junior into reading Shakespeare. Forget about Romeo and Juliet's tragic love, don't even think about turning to Othello and Desdemona for entertainment. Instead, see what happens when Claudio plays out the classic role of never going to the source to find out the truth when he hears of his future wife's unfaithfullness. (He really missed the boat when he believed his jealous half brother over his bride-to-be's indignant insistance of innocence.)Then there is the other pair of equally 'star crossed', ah, enemies, Beatrice and Benedick who spend the majority of their time cat-fighting and spitting hateful nasties at each other; as everyone around them, Prince and Uncle included, know that they are truly, if hopelessly, meant to be together. This is Shakespeare's best comedy, and it deserves more recognitio"},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"This is probably the best play by Shakespeare I have ever read. It's funny, romantic, and classy. I loved the movie. I was first introduced to the play when I watched the film, and I loved it so much, I decided to buy the book. Now I read it whenever I can. Shakespeare isn't all tragedy and murder. He can be funny too."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"As a professor of Theater Arts at the University of Texas - El Paso, as well as a director and performer with the Shakespeare On The Rock theater company of El Paso, I had ordered this audio verson of Much Ado based on DH Audio's claim that it was unabridged. Much to my dismay and frustation, I discovered that it is in fact NOT AN UNABRIGED PRODUCTION. Shakespeare's text has been considerably edited. While I have no ethical problems with editing Shakespeare, I do have problem with the fact that DH Audio is selling this product under false pretence. Either DH Audio does not check its products before release, or DH Audio does not understand the difference between abridged and unabridged. Either way, they have failed to deliver the product they promised.As for the peformance of this edited version of Much Ado, I found it to be mediocre at best. The muffled sound quality and total lack of ambiant sound presents the listener with nothing but the image of actors sitting around a microphone in bare sound studio. This image is only renforced by the rusting of pages as the actors read from their scripts. The actor's delivery is often painfully slow, with few attempts at any actual comedy. The performances of these Canadian actors are futher hindered by their adoption of British dialects, a practice largely considered out of date for non-British perfomers since the early 1900's.In my professional opinion, this audio production should avoided in favor of higher quality productions of Much Ado such as those of Caedmon Audio, or better yet, the Archangel Project."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"Of the Shakespeare books I have read, Much Ado About Nothing is one of my favorites for several reasons. First of all, the notes on the bottom of each page were useful because I didn't have to take time to search for archaic words in a dictionary. When trying to read a long play, stopping to look up words every 5 minutes or so can be quite annoying. Secondly, this book had an intriguing plot. Although I do not clearly understand the motives of the cruel Don John, his plan to destroy the happiness of Claudio and Hero is quite clever. Furthermore, I found Beatrice and Benedick's relationship somewhat bizarre, it quickly transforms from hate to love with no logical reason. My favorite scenes of the play featured the characters Dogberry and Verges. I thought their constant confusion was quite amusing. Overall, I'd say reading this play is very worthwhile."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"oxford world classics are so much better than the other editions out there, especially when trying to read and UNDERSTAND shakespear."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"This is one of Shakespeare's greatest works.

Shakespeare tends to pack so many grains of information into his works, that it is easy to overlook some. While \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" is commonly refered to as a comedy, I fail to find humor in the pain. The sharp edged tongues of Benedick and Beatrice often steal the show as other characters manipulate this pair that was apparently made for each other into a compromising position. Yet the central plot seems less humorous.The story of Claudio and Hero seems much less easy to accept. A manipulative and vendictive Don John implies that Hero was unfaithful to Claudio in the days leading up to their wedding, causing Claudio to refuse Hero at the wedding ceremony. Hero disappears seemingly into death until Don John's guilty accomplice confesses.The story itself does not seem unrealistic by today's standards, yet I felt as though something was missing from the plot. Known as one of Shakespeare's best comedies, I felt I missed some of the humor in its subtleness."},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","review":"This is my favorite Shakespearean comedy.

I then found out after using this that it was a pretty funny book. I would recommend it to advanced readers."},{"Title":"Scientific Christian Mental Practice","review":"I love this book. It is a true classic, a true source of unlimited wisdom and inspiration for the truth seeker. This is one of those books with which you would LIKE to be on a desert island. In that way you would have the time and disposition to most fully absorb its content, which in fact unlocks your own unlimited and infinite resources. Do you see the promise?Emma simply states the Truth through 12 lessons. I myself am on my third reading. I find the book can be used in several ways. One, of course is to read it through, secondly you can read it and extract the lessons for your own use, thirdly you can use it as a bedside book opening it up for light and inspiration in times of need. Its words never grow old. It seems to pick up power with subsequent readings.Each lesson unlocks a power within us that is symbolized by a stone. In her words, &quot; Mind is composed of twelve powers. When mind exercises these twelve powers it has twelve characteristics, which shine like polished jewels. They make a perfect foundation for an absolute demonstration of Jesus Christ Spirit. The first time you go the rounds of these twelve powers, you may not show much difference in character. The second time, the third time, the millionith time around the statements, and how shining your life and mind become.&quot;She goes on, &quot;The first six statements are the beautiful powers of your mind as to your own looks, your own judgement. The last six relate to your surroundings... There are twelve conditions of human life which may be met by twelve truths. These twelve conditions being met by Truth, you may be sure that your life will be free, glad and powerful. The Brahmins had a teaching which read: 'So dwell on the highest thoughts; this is the life of the awakened.'&quot;The Science of Mind motto, Change your thinking, change your life has never been truer. Emma takes you by the hand and shows you exactly how to go about this. And voil&agrave;, the new you in all your DIVINE splendor!Incidentally, metaphysically, twelve refers to spiritual fulfillment...The twelve stones represent the twelve most important nerve centers in the body. All material things represent spititual realities.

It provides a modern interpretation of the teachings of Jesus Christ. However, the author presents them in the context of a deep mystical understanding of all of the world's great spiritual traditions. Written at the beginning of the 20th century, this book today is still about 100 years ahead of its time. Emma Curtis Hopkins was known as the &quot;Teacher of Teachers.&quot; Here's what her student Charles Fillmore, the founder of Unity, had to say about her: &quot;She is undoubtedly the most successful teacher in the world. In many instances those who enter her classes confirmed invalids come out at the end of the course perfectly well. Her very presence heals and those who listen are filled with new life. Never before on this planet have such words of burning Truth been so eloquently spoken through a women.&quot;"},{"Title":"Scientific Christian Mental Practice","review":"Mrs. Hopkins was a dedicated teacher and healer whose students included Ernest Holmes - founder of Science of Mind/Religious Science Movement, Charles and Myrtle Fillmore - founders of Unity School of Christianity, and the founders of: Divine Science, the Emmanuel Movement, Christ Truth League and Home of Truth. This, her masterpiece, is one of the greatest of all works based on mysticism. &quot;When the Lord is your confidence you will never find yourself at all deceived by the ways and speech of men and women, though they be very brilliant, if they speak outside of the Principle that demonstrates healing and goodness and life.&quot; (86)"},{"Title":"Scientific Christian Mental Practice","review":"My title expresses what I think about Emma Curtis Hopkins after reading and working with her book for 25 years. I don't know how she did it, but she took the essence of what was then known as New Thought, or Christian Science, or mental-spiritual healing, and put its practical teachings in words, sentences, and paragraphs which grow more and more powerful the more one works with them.There are other books and teachings which help me, such as those of Mary Baker Eddy (the teacher of Emma Curtis Hopkins) and, from the Hindu world, Sri Aurobindo and Sri Sathya Sai Baba. I also owe a great deal to Charles Fillmore of the Unity movement, who was one of Emma Curtis Hopkins's pupils. But I would not be without this book by ECH. I think of her as a true friend and guide who never ceases to amaze me by her wisdom and the reassurance and power which flood me when I work with her teaching.I admire also her book High Mysticism, but if I had to be with only one of her books it would be Scientific Christian Mental Practice. In comparison with it, the current crop of New Age panaceas and mental gymnastics seem minor and trivial. Emma was way ahead of them.It took me a while to get used to her style, which is highly unusual. If you work with it slowly, re-reading every sentence until you feel what it is trying to tell you, what seems odd at first will turn out to be a treasure of enlightenment.Maybe we all long for a Mother we can trust absolutely. Or a friend whose reassurance and wisdom never fail. And maybe you will find that somewhere else; but you may owe it to yourself to try this book. I would not be without it."},{"Title":"Scientific Christian Mental Practice","review":"Please note, before we even start, that no book, tape, etc. like this should be used as a substitute for any needed attention by a reputable doctor/physician. That would be sheer fanaticism.The general obscurity of many spiritual healing books may be, in the long run, for the best. Easy access to such material may lead many unwise/inexperienced individuals to run to the opposite of hypochondria, have too much faith in their own unpracticed ability to heal their own or others illnesses, and only tragedy may result. Even Emma Hopkins understands this problem, as you will gather from reading her books.first off, with regards to this book, you may immediately start gathering the benefits of it by going ahead and resorting to some form of relaxed, continuous prayer that works for you, and an attempt to acquire that spiritual awareness which can modify entirely an individual for the better. However, I am so sure that many will benefit so much from the approach in this book, that I heartily recommend acquiring it. See all the quotes at the end of this review.I am in much concurrence with the sentiments of the rest of the reviewers. If you're like me, and are finally coming to Emma Curtis Hopkins, rest assured that you are finally coming to one of the best and essential classics in new thought, creative mysticism, or whatever you would like to call it.Second, know that this Scientific Christian book is used in 'New Thought' classes, along with Ernest Holme's larger ' Science of Mind' volume.Experienced as I previously was, for over twenty years, with similar writings (oh, about twenty titles or so) I was pleasantly surprised and excited by reading 'The Statement of Being' on the internet, when i first encountered Emma's work. Having done it a year ago, I remain quite pleased with the memory to this day.I read the entire 'Life and Teaching of the Masters of the Far East' series by Baird T Spalding twenty years ago, and didnt get as much out of it as I am getting from this smaller work by Emma Hopkins now.To recapitulate one reviewer's observation: it IS one of the best friends you will ever have! I keep it like I keep Trine's 'In Tune With the Infinite,' another worthy volume which contains a particularly good and lengthy chapter on health, which many will apppreciate.Read Goldsmiths' 'Practicing the Presence', Shinn's 'Writings' collection, and Emma's ' Scientific Christian Mental Practice' together, and you will be doing as one person on the internet says she does, re-reading these books together constantly. Interesting idea, and not a bad combination, apparently.I occasionally return to Mary Baker Eddy's ' Science and Health' book, also.(Emma has an excellent booklet from 1893, 'The Resurrection, ' which puts much of her essential ideas in a nutshell. A near perfect companion to her ideas as I have found. In fifteen short pages, worth re-reading over and over, it's the best thing of its kind and length I have found on spiritual healing, whether of body, mind , or life.Yogananda has some small books on spiritual healing, yet they are not as good as Emma's 'Resurrection ' booklet, IMHO. If someone knows of one better, by anyone, I would love to know about it. I haven't found better, or as brief, than Emma's 'Resurrection,' as of yet.)3. Have patience with this book. Go back to it again and again. Get a right perspective on its contents. Emma's method is long-term and full-service, largely self-contained. You simply have to go over and over the lessons, 'til understanding shines.'It is an advantage, not a drawback, that this concise, rich book poses a few obstacles to its reader. You're more likely to master its richer contents more thoroughly/carefully/usefully, than that of a lesser, flashier work of equal size.The New Thought person can read Hopkins in the faith that they are reading one of the main teachers of almost the entire New Thought movement, such as it began.Those who, out of prejudice or formality, have avoided Christian spiritual healing books, and are finally coming around to them, can take consolation and encouragement in Hopkins' fairly educated background ( details of which may be found on the internet.) Hopkins' literary, historical, and religious references( Proclus, Parmenides, Lao Tzu, Plato, Carlyle, Bronte sisters, etc, etc, etc -- no end to it! ) taken from throughout history and from around the world, should reinforce the realisation of the traditional roots of spiritual healing, and also their faith in her work, as they read. This is especially so, if one chooses to read her other work, 'High Mysticism.'4. I came to Hopkins via reading of her on the internet. Searches will yield fruit. The entirety of the first ohapter of SCMP, entitled ' The Statement of Being, ' can be found and read by searching on Gooogle or some other search engine. One website even has an extensive collection of extracts contained in a nice series of .pdf downloads. Read those, read her quotes scattered about the internet, and you will be sure to want this book.5. Dr. Israel Regardie once wrote a book back in the 'forties called 'The Romance of Metaphysics,' later divided and retitled into two seperate books ' Teachers of Fulfillment( 1980s, Falcon Press.)' and a smaller, 'Energy, Prayer, and Relaxation.' (Both now o/p.) I am surprised Regardie didnt endorse Hopkin's book more highly: I would have purchased a copy sooner. ( He did recommend Trine's aforementioned 'Infinite' book, and said he would not be rid of it. I second that idea, and have reacquired the Trine volume.)Regardie's main theme was the origin of all this New Thought material from the one Eddy volume, ' Science and Health,' which one ought to own for a complete understanding of New Thought, spiritual healing, etc. (I am not exclusive: I like to blend and compare ideas, utilizing the best. Eddy fans may disapprove of Hopkins. I choose to be more discriminating in my eclecticism.) Certainly useful for comparison: Eddy and Hopkins are the two main seedings of the new thought movement, after Phineas Quimby, Emerson, Troward, Holmes, etc.Access also an essay, 'The Art of True Healing,' by Regardie, which should also be read by anyone interested in these matters, for reasons of completeness.6. Hopkins is more accessible than Eddy, overall, as far I am concerned. Certainly Hopkins seems less prone to Eddy's difficulties with apparent 'enemies' of her movement ( read about new thought history.) Yet I still keep Edy's 'Sci and Health' textbook. At the very least, certainly they are worth comparing side by side.7. The let-downs and diffuse doldrums one may experience with, say, Shakti Gawain, one will not experience with Hopkin's book. Hopkins is more careful and thorough, if more cryptic and difficult, clearly laying out for the readers comprehension the diffiulties inherent in spiritual healing, and a lot more of what it is really all about. In short, 'Scientific Christian' is the most complete book on the subject I have ever come across, new or old, and supplementation with her 'High Mysticism' is invaluable, for those with a taste for it. Still, I keep my copy of Gawain's 'Creative Visualization' book, and even admire even more her ' Living in the Light,' a copy of which I have proferred to a troubled friend.Emma can even be funny. Her quote about the 'snails and asteroids studies' that people devote their lives too, shld. be posted everywhere.8. Ernest Holmes and Chas. Fillmore were both students of Hopkins way back in those early days. I have gained some insight from Ernest Holme's ' Science of Mind,' which also sits on my shelf. Fillmore's ' Prosperity' volume (readable online) is worthy for comparison and enlightenment, to both Hopkins and Holmes.Florence Scovel Shinn can be helpful along the way: tho' she, as others, apparently derived somewhat from Hopkins, her fiery 20's 'flapper' style of Christian metaphysics may be a relief and release for some, and her pithy insights garnered about faith, mind, and protection may offer something useful to the reader( 'wilder' elements of Shinn's doctrine not withstanding.)In short, Shinn may usefully supplement Hopkins for many. Also for comparison purposes, useful. I do like many of Shinn's affirmations. (' Divine Love fills my consciousness with health, and every cell in my body is filled with Light.') Yet, Shinn is more of a 'weekend read,' by comparison. Shinn only manages to agree here and there with the rich horizons Hopkins offers to the reader in much more complete form.Louise L. Hay: I recommend her 'Heal Your Body' book. Worth checking out. I can imagine many will find this book useful. You can now find it in two editions, one aesthetically expanded with relaxing/inspiring graphics for those who like such things.For those like myself who have thought Shinn's four books incomplete( you can get all four in one volume,) supplementing her with Hopkins' two books, should be very enlightening! a quantum leap. Familiarity with both of these writers' books makes it obvious to me that Shinn, if she did not know Hopkins personally, at least was well-versed in her books.It is strange that none of the New Thought writers I have read so far, on 'net or elsewhere, have ever mentioned the brief Christian healing section in Robert Burton's 17th century classic, 'Anatomy of Melancholy.' I bet many would find it useful to acquire this otherwise difficult book for the sake of this section.Of course, Joel Goldsmith, a former student of Hopkins, may be a help: many swear by him. 'Practicing the Presence' and 'The Infinite Way' seem to be the preferred volumes among the cognoscenti; yet much to be recommended is 'The Art of Meditation(cf. Regardie.)'Yet it would seem that anyone interested in visualisation, manifestation, new thought, etc., ought to own Hopkin's book. There is much in it that is refreshing, easily grasped, and useful. The parts of it that may take a bit longer to understand ought not to alienate anyone from its study.Besides the matter of her archaic, turn-of-the-century American prose style, Hopkins was better educated than most New Thought people in the first place, before she ever came to spiritual healing. Again, this ought not to be an obstacle: live with her work for awhile, til the light dawns. Her vocabulary and phraseology isn't as daunting as some have given others to believe, and hardly obscures her healing meaning, at least for most readers.9. It is one of the tragedies of the new thought/new age movement, that so many of the religiously orientated volumes are so little recommended, when they can prove so useful, merely because an older style, termed 'archaic,' seems too likely to scare people off. What is the cure for this? So many could make such great use, if not initially daunted, bored, or frightened away by such.With Hopkins, one at least has the sense of utilising something with a bit more history back of it, than some flourescently vaunted new age writer, who has not yet stood the test of time, and may be less deep, thoughtful, and enduring.10. One can read and make use, without becoming dogmatic and repellant. Add Eric Hoffer's ' True Believer' to your shelf, for balanced perspective ! And the best work may be in silence.Hopkins has other, if less known or popular, works ('Resume' of other book, 'High Mysticism,' 'Class Lessons 1888,' etc.) Hopefully these will soon be reprinted in book form. There is a Hopkins revival, as may be determined from research on the internet.11. The entirety of the first chapter of ' Scientific Christian' may be read on the internet, assuming the Amazon sample pages don't convince. It may be searched for as 'Statement of Being.' Having read that, and any other Hopkins quotes scattered about the internet, I am sure you will want this book.12. There exists a well-meaning anti-quackery trend, where such as Emma Hopkins come under attack, or at least suspicion. I think much of such criticism is shortsighted and/or misplaced. I hardly regard Emma Hopkins as a substitute for what currently manifests as the more wholesome benefits of orthodoxy, whether in medicine or religion. And neither does Emma Hopkins: you'll see it in her text.Also, 'New Thought' Christianity distinguishes itself from the Christian Science school by regarding any spiritual metaphysics as an adjunct, not a substitue for, regular medical teatment by a qualified and reputable physician.I would also mention, that there is more sound, useful, 'down-home' practical psychology in Emma Curtis hopkins than in many acclaimed psychology books I have read.Of course, if any one reading here knows of one useful to accompany Emma's effort, or as good, won't they oblige us by a review, and recommending them here on this Amazon review page ?I suppose Emma has made her way into a kind of tasteful and classic obscurity, where she has been ignored in favor of some more popular, modern, well-advertised souls. 'Old standbys,' especially those no longer living, perhaps often do.A moot point perhaps: yet one worth considering. The revelations in the first chapter of Emma's 'High Mysticism' book offer much food for thought in few words, about the necessity for turning the 'inner mystic eye upwards' away from the things of the senses, a practice which Hopkins believes fosters sanity. This seems sound, if mystic, psychology to me, and some such idea ought to be adopted by our modern therapeutic psychologists. It might help create in their clients the healthy balance and wholesome sense of distance (from their worldly affairs, fears, emotions and such) that many of their clients may be looking for.In truth, I understand completely the reviewer who stated his twenty-five-year devotion to this book. If you are going to get just one healing book, get this one. I can see how, in the long haul, one can get so much from its 250-plus pages. It is worth reviewing over and over til all the ideas coordinate themselves and become useful.One problem may be the archaic quality of much of Emma's prose. SCMP has little of this, tho' the ideas can be difficult enough, and require many 'goings-over.' Beleive me, you won't mind. This book is fresh air for seekers. 'A million times around the statements, and how shining and bright your life becomes!' as Emma says. ' There surely comes a moment when the full power of the words comes surging through us.' Go over the material again and again at daily intervals, and gradually the problems will work themselves out.***some quotes, from SCMP and other Emma works:' Faith can fulfill your slightest wish.'' If God is your world, what have you to fear ? '' Look often to the Vast, Vast Countenance.'' You are the spiritual light that cannot fail.'' Great believers in miracles draw them. '' Touch not the earth - touch God !'' We must woo and woo the Majesty and Responsive Beneficenceever facing us. Our wooing will be astonishingly rewarded.''If you can redden your face with a thought, you can straighten your crooked bones with a thought.'' ...by some power whereby the trees leave forth.'' There is always a way out of the greatest or least seeming evil.'' There is no combination of experiences so hard, so black, so complicated but that God can work a miracle in them. '' Take your highest thought of God.'' Let us never flinch at what is happening around us. What is transpiring above us is our concern. And this wins all battles; for the kingdom across the bar is the Ruling Kingdom. '' By continually keeping His name you have everlasting rest in delightful companionship, unbroken family life, abundant blessings greater than you can ask or even think.'' Let me tell you the twelve effects of thinking of the Spirit: You will have life, health, strength, support, defense, thinking faculty, wise speech, ability to record well your ideas, joyous song, skill in carrying out your principles, beauty of judgment, and great love.'' A woman who had no faith but had been told what wonder might be wrought through faith sat down and deliberately determined to learn it. She sat down in the midst of her poverty and loneliness with her little children about her and practiced learning. She seemed shiftless to her neighbors, but it was astonishing what \\"luck\\" that woman always had. Something good was always \\"turning up.\\" Her children were all talented, beautiful, prosperous. '' Men may gather all the gold into a lump, and say you cannot have any, but by some way of Spirit you will come out with more abundant riches than all the rest put together. They may hold arguments and try psychological processes to chain your mind or change it, but the Spirit will make a way with you to keep you free from all such attempts. You will elude every mental opposition as easily as you elude material things. Jesus came through their belief that he was dead.'' a man kept praising God that he was so well, while a great tumor or some other kind of swelling was plain to be seen by his neighbors. But he praised God publicly that he was so well for a whole fortnight. Long before the fortnight was up he was well, so that even his neighbors could see it so. '' To say that 'My Good is supply, God is my Good, therefore God is my supply' is to stir the mountains and the seas to bring us our new provisions.'' Looking, mentally, upon Jesus Christ as present, will cure poverty; it will cure blindness ; it will cure deafness; it will cure palsy; it will cure rheumatism; it will cure insanity. '' He, never having gone away from our side, we can look upon Him now, and be cured of whatever ailment we are crying about.'' Many will tell of how wonderfully they have been led by repeating the name of Jesus Christ. There was never any other character in history who gave orders to keep repeating his name. ''There is one indestructuble substance pervading all things, from the remotest star to the nearest dust particle. This substance is finer than any substance cognized by the senses. It is finer than the attraction of gravitation, cohesion, destruction. It can only be cognized by the mind. It can only be handled by the thoughts of the mind. And only the understanding of the mind can make it useful. He who by any manner of thinking handles this substance soon finds himself experiencing vital renewals throughout body and mind. He has begun the 'animation of the particular from the universal,' an art eagerly sought by the ancients. '' \\"I would know none among you save Jesus Christ, \\" said Paul to the Corinthians. '' Who now is ignoring every disastrous state of affairs, and separating himself to the One Name by which the first Apostles wrought their miracles? - Jesus Christ is that Name.'' ... receiving the Holy Spirit that alone makes whole. '' \\"The Spirit of a man is the candleof the Lord(Ps 20:27.)\\" And by recognizing this candle sound health is established in the outer experience.'' When we know God, we have touched the very substance which can inform us how to work each minute wisely, so as to be clothed and fed and housed and healed, without any other process than simply knowing God. '' It is ideas of God which if you shepherd well, will get you into that state of mind called heaven, when you have health, judgment, prosperity. '' When we are spiritual, we do not try to bring great things to pass, yet they come to pass. '' The most wonderful achievements of mankind have been brought to pass by confidence in some wonder-working unseen power. '' As God is free now, so we are free now.'' Isnt it a joy to you to know that you within yourself the power to annul every evil thing?'' The ginger and glow of unvisioning life, cease for such as know that their true provisions and their true positions come from above, and nothing and nobody can take them from them. The Countenance that shines hot with healing tenderness and with rich giving is of more value than all that can possibly come by the clash of endeavor.'' Let us say, \\"Poverty is unreality; there is no such thing as poverty; poverty is nothing to Spirit. Spirit owns all things.\\"'' Nobody need strive or haste for his prosperity if his faith is fixed, and his words keep repeating his covenant.'' In the Lord's house is much treasure.'' There is a self-supporting power in the Holy Spirit which, when you let it operate unhindered through you, leads straight to your substantial support.'' \\"As I look into the God who is support beyond my idea ofsustaining and supporting, I bring forth the plenty I see as Ilook.\\" '' There are ways of thinking about your environment which will make you like a harp in the fingers of love, so enchanting will be your silent mind to the world hurt traveller, so blessed will sound your voice to the bruised child of human hardships. You need not worry about whether you shall speak or not. You will have your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel if you take the fresh morning for giving thanks and glad praises unto the spirit and speak forth with freedom some lesson of this Science. '' We cannot fail while we are daily speaking the lofty principles of that Kingdom on the Earth, though not of it, which will come up before our vision more and more. '' Always high vision stirs right speech, silent or audible, and right speech silent or audible stirs right convictions, and the accomplishment of the seemingly impossible is the outcome.'' Error can come in bright packages of beautiful words, but it is better to have a mind of your own.'' We must give our strict attention to something supernally worth while.'' The ancient Bible taught that it is good to tame the mind, which is difficult to hold in and very flighty, rushing whither it listeth, but once tamed it will bring you great happiness.'' Let us say to unhappiness, \\"There is no unhappiness in Spirit; All is joyous peace.\\" And let us say within our own minds, \\"Now !now !\\" '' We take the conscious teachings and train ourselves till our machine-like bodies spring to as quick intelligence as our consciousness itself.'' Health sits in as a first sign of spirituality.'' Take some wine of doctrine, stronger and warmer ideas of life.'' The only thing worth working for is a right state of mind.'' say positively, \\"I do not believe it takes hard work to succeed in Gods universe.\\"'' There is no part of the body that may not open and indraw the subtler-than-air stimulants that would soon burst forth as strength.'' The soft flakes of healing are falling all around you all the time, even on your shadow.'' \\"God works through me to will and do that which ought to be done by me.\\" Be sure this is true. It is a great rest to think how many unnecessary things we have been doing that we are now relieved from doing. '' Be not tenacious of your own will. Be not exacting. Let Go. All is well around you: say: Rest in the Lord and He shall bring it to pass.'' \\"I am strong in the Lord and the power of His might. \\"'' You are so ready with your abilities that you soon become known as a leader among your associates if you learned early this: --\\"Jesus Christ is all in all.\\" --'' Give thanks, and praise the Spirit of God for the law of the self-increasing potency of every substance.'' Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on Thee.'' say often, \\"There is only one God - one.\\"'' Deny that there are any causes, or results of causes, in you or around you, that could lead to disease, poverty, or failure. Take yourself for each year. '' If I were to be asked directly as to the quickest way for a Scientist to get his healing power going, I would probably say Praise, everything and everyone in your mind, and as far as your mental convictions will demonstrate promptly, speak these praises aloud.'' There is a faculty of your health whereby it loves to drop thru your mind and distill like the dew through your flesh.'' There is no warfare where the vision of God is. There is no disease where the healing Name is called. There is no inadequacy or failure while the Spirit of God is in the nostrils, inbreathed as the only breath. This is living truth.'' If you love anybody, why don't you trust that love to straighten out the tangles between you ? Never mind what is interfering.'' \\"Be still and know that I am God\\" \\"Look up to fields white for harvest,\\"(Jn 4:35) so shall old conditions dissolve; so shall the Holy Spirit arrive - white breath that makes strengthening wholeness.'' They will preach the at-one-ment according to Science. They will tell you that when you have spoken the words of Jesus Christ till you are at one with the Mind of God so that you see only Love and Truth and Life and Health and Peace in all your experience, that then you have partaken of the only at-one-ment signified by the history of Jesus Christ. '' Nothing shall by any means defeat us when we often lift up our eyes to Thee!'' Restorations hail from above. Expect greatly from above and greatly shall restorations multiply.'' This, too, is good; this, too, is God; this, too, is for me; and I demand to see the blessing in it for me.'' Take your business as it is, and praise divine love that there is a strong, wise way out of your dilemma.'' The man who molds the vital ethers of omnipresence by right thoughts about its bounty brings forth bountifully. '' For love is stronger than death. He that hath love hath freedom from every ill.'' Sight, beauty, strength, wisdom, lighted by one touch of divine fire cannot be stopped or limited.'' Keep your eye on the Eternal, and your intellect will grow.'' But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings. - Malachi'' Jesus taught that the body will shine with beauty if it is anchored above. So will the mind.'' \\"Thy faith hath made thee whole.\\"'' Give glad, joyous praises every night, before going to sleep, to the Most High Good, that the Holy spirit fills your thoughts with ardor, and fires your affairs to splendid achievements.'' Let Spirit utter itself.'' By the subtle touch of grace descending, diseases unformulate.'' Remember, that what you think is a wave of light going through the mental atmosphere of the world, and wherever your true thought strikes, somebody will be lifted off a bed of pain or healed of some sorrow.' -' I praise God that there is a strong, wise way out of this dilemma.'' The age of extreme religious sanctity and much checking of freedom is always followed by the license of immodesty and indulgence.Thus, the bondage of all beliefs becomes apparent:It is not Omniscience to believe anything. It is Omniscience to believe all things,which is to believe nothing.It is not Omnipotence to be powerful and dominant others. It is Omnipotence to be the only Power, which is Love.It is not Omnipresence to give instruction to mankind as to what to do and what not to do. It is Omnipresence to 'Let Be' and thus make manifest True Spiritual Being, the idea and demonstration of One Presence.'' I now speak what I speak from my Jesus Christ Name. So atoms and angels speak a new heaven and a new earth into their own view, empowered by my tongue with its elixirs of fire. I speak and the universe uttereth itself.'' Look out for zeal without judgement. Go alone by yourself and decide the question. Keep this text: - \\"God is with me.\\"' Often you catch the thoughts of others among whom you associate. Therefore, take notice of what your judgment spoke early in the morning. Say: \\"I am wise in Spirit.\\"' Earnest, faithful, kind. You express the kindness of the Divine Parent. Your word is:\\"The Lord God is my sun and shield.\\"' You have great powers of endurance if you have kept this saying: \\"I can do all things through Christ.\\" You may be tenacious in your own way when you realize that it is right. Keep this text: \\"The tongue of the wise is health. \\"' The world will persist in exhibiting before you what you persist in affirming the world is. '' The man who molds the vital ethers of omnipresence by right thoughts about its bounty brings forth bountifully.'' Turn away from all events and persons in order to develop the consciousness of a mystic and become God-conscious as an inner identity. I stress the realization of the Perfect Presence, the ONLY Life in which the elevated consciusness does the work. God is all there is; there is no other life.The undifferentiated unity between the person and the world is the essence of the introversive mystical experience.'\\"As Mary looked beyond all ideas into the Godbeyond ideas, she brought forth Jesus Christ.\\"\\"The Holy Mother Mary will teach you how to loveso that all hate shall be melted where youspeak and where your face is seen.\\"\\"The ministry of God is the Spirit of God,the Mother. The Mother is fair and kind anduntouched by the name of sin, sickness or death.\\"' Say 'I do not believe it - not a word.' 'I do not believe that side of the question. I believe in success, victory, prosperity for me, in the name of Jesus Christ.'... you say it to all that troubles you... The old conditions must unglue, let go. God reigns. Believe it.'' \\"Be still and know that I am God\\"Look up to fields white for harvest. so shallold conditions dissolve; so shall the Holy Spirit arrive - white breath that makes strengthening wholeness.'' Faith is the alembic wherein the right word is crystallized that can make you master of any situation.'' God lives in me in His strength and glory,He lives in me as my strength divine.By the light of His love I read life's story,And the key of the world is mine.'' If God will support a man who spends all his time in spiritual devotions, why not devote your life to the Spirit? If God has all wisdom, why not make God your Counselor, your Guide, your Friend?' -Emma Curtis Hopkins."},{"Title":"Scientific Christian Mental Practice","review":"I often hear references to Emma Curtis Hopkins, but had not read any of her work until \\"Scientific Christian Mental Practice\\".

I thought Marie Killilea's attempt to synopsize the story of Karen for young readers was a disaster. As much as I like &quot;Karen&quot;, that is how much I dislike &quot;Wren&quot;.In my opinion, the tone was cutesy and patronizing, some of the anecdotes were poorly chosen, and there were some real howlers, such as a bunny named &quot;little black sambo&quot; (which may have been acceptable in 1954). Also, the statement that Karen is a wonderful child because she never complains, works hard, and always has a cheerful attitude. This is an unfair burden to put on any child, much less a child with a severe physical disability. Also I disliked the repeated admonitions to Marie and Karen that they should not misbehave because that makes God sad and angry with them. That struck me as emotional blackmail.The technique of going back and forth between Karen's story and the happy, lively Killilea family worked very well in &quot;Karen&quot; because there was room for it. It did not work so well here. A few stories about the family are fine, but not this rambling about the Killilea animals (the bunnies chew the furniture; one bunny has a litter, the details about the wrens, etc.). This was meant to be cute but seemed pointless to me. The only animal who deserved the detailed description was Shanty, because he was Karen's &quot;second guardian angel&quot; (a phrase I liked).I also thought this book did not do a good job of explaining cerebral palsy at all, nor why Karen needed so many years of physical therapy. And characterizing therapy as a fun &quot;Game&quot; is patronizing in my view because it overlooks the years of hard work and dedication needed for Karen to gain use of her arms and legs. The therapy was described very well in &quot;Karen,&quot; but not here.I did like some aspects of the book. Starting out from Marie's point of view is a great idea. I also liked some anecdotes, such as teaching Karen how to hold her breath underwater, and the Christmas story at the end of the book. The illustrations, done by Bob Riger, are absolutely beautiful.On the whole, however, I thought this story was a jumble of unrelated, cutesy, somewhat patronizing little anecdotes and I would not recommend it to anyone with CP or their families. CP can be made understandable to young readers. A good book is Marylin Gould's &quot;Golden Daffodils&quot;."},{"Title":"Wren","review":"&quot;Wren&quot; tells for children the inspiring story of Karen Killilea, the child who lived a miracle, and of her remarkable family.

I read this book many years ago in 3rd or 4th grade and since I was a child, I did enjoy it. This children's book was also influenced me to read both \\"Karen\\" and \\"With Love from Karen\\" some years years later. Both of these books were written for teens and adults and as a teenager, I enjoyed both these books as well.Someone else suggested that parts of the story were insulting because of the manner in which certain terminology was used. I think some readers are not aware ORIGINAL book was published in a much earlier time (late 1940s or very early 50s, I believe) at a time before awareness of how politically incorrect statements can, and ARE hurtful. However, I am not sure the author is living anymore to make the editorial changes in order to keep up with the more enlightened readers of today. Marie Killilea was an adult and Karen was already older than I when I read the book as a child.In order to enjoy this book, it has to be taken for what it is, a CHILDREN'S book written many years ago and, therefore, rather dated as compared to children's books of these times.I gave the book only 3 stars because it has been many years since I read it. However, I feel that since it was the reason for reading the other 2 books about Karen when I was a teenager in the 60s, it deserves at least this many."},{"Title":"Wren","review":"I read Karen & From Karen With Love when I was a young girl.

The book reads like a little homespun saga, but in real life nobody is that loving and 100% self sacrificing. Even the &quot;nice appearance&quot; is a facade. I didn't like the fact that the rabbit was named &quot;little black sambo,&quot; which I felt was a racist slur. I also did not like the way Karen was portrayed as a 100% cheerful, uncomplaining little martyr. She wasn't. She was a bright, delightful, adorable little girl who had a physical challenge and who learned to cope with it. She got tired. She was ashamed of the &quot;ugly, yellow leather stains&quot; the braces left on her legs. She regularly saw her older sister Marie get relegated to the background while their foster sister stole the limelight in the books and in their mother's eyes. Wren is stupidly written and makes light of how serious an effort physical therapy is. Calling Karen's hard work &quot;games&quot; is insulting at best, misleading at worst.

The racist name that one rabbit was given was insulting. Read &quot;Karen&quot; and &quot;With Love from Karen&quot; instead as these books complement your intelligence instead of insulting it like &quot;Wren&quot; does. I didn't like this book at all.

Churchill wrote highly of their military exploits in his history and I was determined to read up on this unit in greater detail.The formation of the Commando style unit was put forward by Churchill in June 1940 as a highly mobile unit of regular army volunteers to be used to attack any \\"small landings or descents\\" by German forces as part of the home defense strategy. He also foresaw the role of these units employed in \\"butcher and bolt\\" raids along the French, Dutch and Belgium coastlines. In Churchill's words to his chief of staff, \\"Enterprises must be prepared, with specially-trained troops of the hunter class, who can develop a reign of terror down these coasts...\\" Churchill also realized that in order to conduct those types of raids required landing crafts and other vessels to transport these \\"striker companies\\" across the Channel. The amazing thing about this concept was that it began at a time when the UK was under the serious threat of invasion and England suffering from a ruthless air attack that is famously know as the Battle of Britain. Also the British forces were reeling from their losses to their best fighting divisions and the loss of almost all of their heavy equipment that had to be abandoned on the Dunkirk beaches. The genius of Churchill realized that keeping the enemy off balance was an important part of the home defence. Churchill also understood the mentality of the traditional minded senior military staff who did not believe that irregular units had a role in the British armed services. He therefore formed the Combined Operations Command and appointed Admiral Keyes with whom he and the Defence Office had close personal ties as its director and ensured that the command would flourish. The initial intake to form these commando units were from the regular army units. At a time when there was a shortage of experienced and talented officers and enlisted men there was naturally a resentment of the personnel drain among the regiments.James Dunning has written a riveting and fascinating history outlining the formation and exploits of this elite commando unit which virtually had to develop their own unique training and tactics from scratch with the belief that they would need to go into action sooner than later. What makes this book such a good read is that Dunning was there in the first intake and personally knew all the characters and personalities of the officers and enlisted men he served with. But Dunning is not just telling you his tale from the foxhole. This is a well documented history and he has kept his own personal exploits to a humble minimum. In fact, it is not until page 74 that I found out that Dunning was C troop's SM which naturally placed him in a position to observe the officers and enlisted men at their craft.Dunning's writing style is a clear and enjoyable read from cover to cover. There are plenty of quotes of his comrades in arms and a lot of good quality photos so that you can often put a face to the words. The diagrams help you get a good visual image of the narrative explaining the raids and battles the unit took part in. When considering that so many of the men depicted in this history met violent ends Dunning was able to express the courage, the sensitivity and the wit of these brave and selfless men in a commendable fashion. Upon finishing this book and unpon further contemplation of their heroic deeds, I am once again thankful for their sacrifice. This is a truly remarkable history of truly remarkable men. I pray that 'their finest hour' shall not be in vain but will be remembered forever. Dunning's book will be a valuable reference for generations to come."},{"Title":"THE FIGHTING FOURTH","review":"This is the second of three books about the Commandos ( which were created by order of Winston Churchill) according to the author. They were made up of volunteers only and his descriptiion of their training, and their actions are brilliantly written. The famous invasion at Dieppe cost them dearly as the Canadians had 65% casualties.The commandos went inland to destroy German cannon on that raid after climbing barbed wire covered cliffs.Uncommon bravery was common.A good read.The third and final book is soon to be published."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"God's Debris is an interesting book. I am writing this as a Christian. It is important that the reader knows this. The book states that it is not true and that even the author, Scott Adams, does not necessarily believe its contents. It is designed to be a mental exercise. I personally find it hard to fathom why anyone would write something with supposed truths that they claim to be uncertain of. The book starts with a meeting of a package delivery man with an old gentleman who begins to question him towards supposed enlightenment. I admit that the journey is fun and has some merit. However, many of the \\"truths\\" expounded upon in the book are fairly close to, if not allied with, heresy. The basic concept of the book is that the greatest power in the universe is expressed through probability. Probability is God's power and makes everything possible. The book then proceeds to endure itself to the reader by creating two very likable characters. Along the way everything from evolution to light speed is addressed. While the arguments are full of mental gymnastics the point becomes clear fairly soon. To wit: God is omnipotent, and the only thing that would challenge such a being is seeking a way to destroy Himself. Adams presents a \\"god\\" that is suicidal in a sense. The book states that God has blown Himself to bits and the universe, rocks, plants, animals, and humans are all working within all powerful probability to reassemble God. This cosmic jigsaw puzzle allows for all belief systems. In short, this seems to be another clever attempt to try and persuade the world that all beliefs are valid and ultimately lead to \\"god.\\" This is where the heresy is exhibited strongest. The book views a creator that is as interested in rocks as he is humans. After all, we are all made of the same stuff. All of us are part of \\"god\\" trying to reassemble itself. This sort of gobble-d-gook philosophy is like asking unanswerable questions like \\"Can God make square circles?\\" or \\"Can God make a rock so big he can't pick it up?\\" This type of circular logic is old hat to folks that want just enough of the truth to keep themselves confused. God's debris are not floating about trying to reassemble through all beliefs and positive probability behaviors. God is the great causer. He is the causer without a cause. He is not bored, but I admit He is unchallenged. He would have no need for this sort of exercise. God is not a Taoist. God incarnate became flesh and dwelt among man. He was crucified for our sin and rose from the dead. He did so without vanity or pomp and circumstance. He did so in humility. He will return in glory. God's Debris is entertaining and a fun read; however, the reader must be careful to have a firm grip on his or her beliefs lest confusion be nurtured by this hogwash philosophy."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"If you are interested in probabilities, read Pascal's Wager.If you are interested in God dying and coming back, read about the death and resurrection of Christ.If you are interested in apologetics read Norm Geisler, Ravi Zacharias or GK Chesterton."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I found this thought experiment to be interesting, however at least in my case there weren't many *new* ideas that I'd never considered before. It was more a case of &quot;Yes, it has been awhile since I considered that possibility. Not a bad book, but don't expect your brain to &quot;spin around in your skull&quot; if you've spent much time considering reality and religion in the past."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Scott Adams truly shows that he is not a one act show with his latest hard cover book, God's Debris. For the loyal Dilbert readers expecting the usual office humor, this is definitely a change of pace. But Mr. Adams has certainly outdone himself with this book, which will have you thinking in ways you never thought possible. The thought experiment is magnificent as it leads you down the deep corridors of your brain in search for the answers to the most profound questions of time. And that's just the first time you read it. To truly grasp the scope of the book, reading it several times over is necessary - and enjoyable. Dilbert readers and all others will enjoy this book. So why not pick up a couple copies - one for you and a friend - because the world would just be a better place if we could all start to think this deeply."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"The book's foreword mentions that this is a serious book, has no relation to Dilbert and is written as a thought-experiment. It also puts in a contradiction - the simplest explanations may sound right - but in reality may not be right. Try to find out what's wrong with the simplest explanation.This sets the stage for trying to reason with the paragraphs and the arguments listed under various chapters. Some of the questions do need further pondering:* Free Will and Omnipotence do not go hand-in-hand* Why do humans have an exalted sense of the world revolving around them* Why is evolution always listed as simpler-to-more-complex organismsRead on to get the author's take on various subjects. Be warned - don't take every paragraph at face value. Don't start believing in the listed argument because the author has already mentioned you have to evaluate, relate to other things that you know of, and then come to your own conclusions."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I previously gave a bad review of this book. At the time, the book shook me up so much with its ideas that I got offended. I think I was jealous on top of that. So I wrote a horrible review sometime around 2006. I can't find that review; maybe they deleted it. I just hope I didn't offend the author. In hindsight, I'm glad I took the rollercoaster ride. I even use some of the logic in the book when talking to other people. Anyway, if you're the author reading this, and if you once read my bad review, you now know it was a compliment, disgruntled and in disguise. It was an awesome book; a bit too....Spencer"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"A very interesting introduction to Epicurean philosophy, which is all about explaining free will and if free will actually exists. Definitely a quick read (short) and also easy to read (he tries and succeeds to keep things simple).One little thing keeps me from giving this book 5 stars. He mainly uses scientific examples and metaphors to make his points, which is unfortunate because the reader may not see the practical (and political) applications of epicurean philosophy. I don't want to string this out, but look into anarchism if you are intrigued by the social implications of epicureanism. I can't really find a book that goes well with this one, but I would suggest Crimethinc'sDays of War, Nights of Love : Crimethink For Beginners."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Adams packs a lot in what seems to be a short story (I finished the entire book in under 2 hours). Most of the book is a philosphical discussion between a UPS delivery man and an old man (called the Avatar). The discussion is just as good as anything I have read by Plato (I am thinking of The Apology) and basically tries to define who is God and what is his purpose. Towards the end of the discussion, the Avatar gives the deliveryman some great advice about relationships and life.I really enjoyed Adam's preface at the beginning that basically tells you not to expect Dilbert or any comic moments like the Dilbert strips. Adams is excellent deviating from what he is known for."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Highly recommended as discussion material, and as a \\"thought experiment\\", not as gospel or literal truth. Adams states right up front that he does not agree with many of the ideas put forth in his work, and that he has chosen simplicity as the determining factor when choosing a theory to present. This leaves the reader free to cull meaning selectively, sometimes in a very literal fashion, other times in a very abstract way, rather than trying to make sense of the disconnected dialogs as a whole.Rather than beating an idea to death, most chapters are very short and sweet, without forced segues to the following chapter or idea. The work can easily be read in an afternoon, but nearly every page contains hours of discussion material. Definitely worth reading, and re-reading."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I have nothing new to add the reviews already posted except that it is reasonable to think of this work as either religious fiction, science fiction or fantasy. The various puzzles may become more apparent with such a perspective. Personally, I first read it as a fantasy before I read it as a puzzle. It's great fun as fantasy."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"As Scott Adams says in the intro to this 'thought experiment', this is NOT a Dilbert book. Do not expect the humourous snide sardonic and ironic observations you have come to expect from Mr Adams. This guy proves he can philosophise and BS about the Universe with best of 'em. Part Richard Bachman circa 'Illusions', part a mesh of two characters from the Douglas Adams 'Hitchhiker' series (specifically the old man in the shack from 'The Restaurant at The End Of The Universe' and the ancient but all-knowing interdimensional pole-sitter of 'Mostly Harmless'), God's Debris follows the conversation between an express package delivery man and an ancient avatar of the universe. Prepare to have your mind and your conventional perceptions of what is and what is not completely rodgered, twisted, shaken and stirred and served to you in a blender. As you hold this new concoction of reality as you know it virtually in your hands, examine it, share it, discuss with friends, like you would an unusual but amazing wine you discovered somewhere in the back of your fave atmospheric hangout. You and your friends should have a real wild ride and not be disappointed."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I've always enjoyed reading Dilbert, so when I saw that Mr. Adams had written a non-Dilbert book I was most curious. When I found out it was a philosophic book, I was even more interested. This lovely, little book is very brief, but it does make one think. It's quite perfect for those who are just starting to read metaphysical type literature. Mr. Adams makes some excellent points in this engaging story. I don't think it should be over-analyzed, as this would take away the fun. It is what it is. I've highly recommended it to many of my friends and co-workers. I first read the ebook, and loved it so much I had to get the hard copy!"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"For those who love Dilbert, please realize that this book has nothing to do with that enjoyable character. There's also no humor here. Instead, you will find a fable that presents a unified theory of cosmology, religion, and knowledge. Before you get excited about all that you can learn, realize that this unified theory is deliberately flawed by Mr. Adams to provide you with a thought experiment to locate what is wrong with the argument. So the book is actually a brain teaser in its primary intent. It is a brain teaser that most people will find exceeds their knowledge of probability, physics, religion, philosophy, evolution, psychology and logic. So, to pick it apart you will probably need to assemble a team of people with deep knowledge in those areas. As a result, God's Debris is perfect for a serious book club. After understanding what's wrong with the arguments in the book, many will probably begin to see more unity in everything that happens based on a better platform of knowledge. That's well worthwhile.I found this book fascinating as a puzzle, and enjoyed picking the arguments and misstatements apart. It reminded me of a question on the bar exam from many years ago where I had to write about what the law was in regard to a will written by an illiterate person. Great fun!Mr. Adams warns that this book is for \\"people who enjoy having their brains spun around inside their skulls.\\" He also says that it is \\"a view about God that you've probably never heard before.\\" I certainly agree with both of those points. He also warns that what's in the book \\"isn't true . . . but it's oddly compelling.\\" He also notes that people under the age of 14 should not read it. Although he doesn't say why, anyone who reads this book without a foundation in the subjects described may actually believe what's proposed by the Avatar. The world has enough false beliefs in it. I applaud Mr. Adams for helping to avoid creating any more.After this book has honed your knowledge and critical thinking skills, I suggest that you take arguments that you read in other books and practice seeing what is wrong with them. All nonfiction books provide thought experiments of that sort!I do hope Mr. Adams will write another of these thought experiments.Overcome the appeal of simplicity to see through to the dynamic reality!"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"If you think that Scott Adams can only write comic strips (you know, Dilbert), you'll be as surprised as I was. Adams has tackled what many are tackling these days - basically a spiritual philosophy - but that few are succeeding at quite this well. I am telling you, this funny cartoonist is about as deep, thoughtful, and intriguing a writer as I've come across. Not complex, mind you, but deep.As I entered into his new book, God's Debris (just wait till you find out what the title means!), I was delighted to learn that he uses the language very well - especially for a philosophical piece like this, which, at its best, really only pretends at fiction. (It is primarily a philosophical dialogue between two men.) When the narrator steps into a room and sees a little old man sitting, I actually laughed to picture it as Adams described: \\"Something moved and I noticed, on the far side of the fireplace, in a wooden rocker, a smallish form in a red plaid blanket, looking like a hastily rolled cigar.\\" The narrator later tosses an extra log onto a dying fire, and we read that \\"the retiring embers celebrated its arrival.\\" Now, these points are not by any stretch the meat of the book - but it's important to know, this is not just some comic stab at writing.Nor is it a comic stab at philosophy. Adams examines really the core of who we are, and who God is, as well as numerous details of life, always conforming to certain central themes. His approach? Really a Socratic exercise, not necessarily answering the questions of the world, but certainly asking them. As for answers, these abound as well ... but Adams does not take himself so seriously as to insist on their accuracy. Rather, he wisely notes how intriguing many of the answers are, and challenges the reader to consider them too.I can tell you how I consider them: they are among the most convincing answers I have yet come across (for me, very much like What is Man? by Mark Twain - another comic with tremendous depth to his philosophy).Along the way, Adams certainly pokes and prods his readers, forcing questions that must make them squirm. \\"If people believed in God,\\" he points out, \\"they would live every minute of their lives in support of that belief. Rich people would give their wealth to the needy. Everyone would be frantic to determine which religion was the true one. No one could be comfortable in the thought that they might have picked the wrong religion and blundered into eternal damnation, or bad reincarnation, or some other unthinkable consequence. People would dedicate their lives to converting others to their religions.\\" He adds: \\"If you believe a truck is coming toward you, you will jump out of the way. That is belief in the reality of the truck. If you tell people you fear the truck but do nothing to get out of the way, that is not belief in the truck.\\" Now, do you believe in God?That example is a mere detail, though, and there is a much more important thread and theme running through this, dealing with the deepest questions of all. In its effort, it supports much of its philosophy with tantalizing scientific proofs, and with areas where science has fallen down. The philosophical portion thoroughly discusses who God is, what our relationship is to God, the nature of good and evil within these definitions, and other potent topics. I admit, I was sure at one point that the book was roaming randomly. But enough chapters passed by, and I was convinced that Adams was tying everything together. In the end, it's an experience!There are so many parts of this book that I'd like to share, but it would spoil the surprise. If you want a good challenge based in both science and philosophy for what God is, for what we are, for just what the heck we're doing here ... take a peek, and find yourself wondering about things, and probably - just probably - in brand new ways."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"In the Introduction, Adams states that some of the \\"facts\\" presented in the forthcoming view of the universe are consistent with prevailing scientific thought and others are \\"creative baloney designed to sound true\\". He also states that this book is a \\"thought experiment\\" - i.e. the purpose is to get you thinking - it's not meant as a serious attempt to explain the universe and God.That said, - those folks out here who have panned this book because its assertions are not scientifically sound are [people] who missed the point and need to go back and read the introduction again. And those folks who dismissed the book out of hand as rehashed metaphysical stuff that they already know - well, they failed the thought experiment because they didn't use the book as a springboard to thought.Both of the types of people above actually prove one of the points in the book - that they are totally wrapped up in either arrogance or delusion. In fact, they probably didn't even realize that Adams was poking fun at them - oh, well.Anyway, in this book Adams' character presents, in somewhat herky jerky fashion, an odd view of the universe. Although the theory itself could probably be torn to shreds by an undergraduate philosphy class, the purpose is to get the reader to recognize the folly of thinking that we know the answers and to open themselves to the possibility that everything we think we know (religion and science) is a wrong, albeit useful construct - and in fact that we humans are intellectually incapable of fathoming reality.If you ponder metaphysics/spirituality a lot then you might not find that this book breaks any new ground for you - given that you are already open to thinking strange thoughts.If you're an unflinching religious zealot you'll find the book somewhat sacreligeous and, unwittingly proving his point, you'll either pray for him or send him an email informing him that he's going to hell.If you're a sober, stuffy scientific sort you'll pick the specifics of the theory apart with righteous and snooty \\"I'm smarter than you\\" arrogance and in doing so, miss the whole point of the book.But, if you enjoy mental exercises and realize that sacred cows make the best steaks, then you'll enjoy mulling over the ideas discussed in this book.It's short and a bit rough, but I gave it five stars simply becuase it earnestly attempts to give the reader's brain a good kick in the arse (if a brain can have an arse), and because it tries to slap some sense into prevailing scientific and religious cultures which have raised \\"believing one's own hype\\" to an artform."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"If you're familiar with Dilbert, you will know how Scott Adams will often make his characters say little things that will make you sit back and think. In God's Debris, Adams lays out hundreds of thoughts on religion, god, probability, willpower, human fate, and other questions we as humans hold. The book approaches the idea of god in a way that has never been approached before, at least no way that I've heard. The book is absolutely incredible, and you cannot take it all in in only one reading. So many thoughts are displayed that it's almost overwhelming at times. It's like your discovering new secrets of life. This book also gives a wonderful view on religion, especially at a time we need it most. I am not a very religious person, but as this book points out: No one is right or wrong about religion. We're all just like curious bees looking through a stained glass window. My two favorite chapters, Curious Bees and Holy Lands, analyze our actions we take on with religion and war in a way that, once again, only Scott Adams could pull off. I give this book a 5 out of 5. It is incredible."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Three things piqued my interest in this book - one was of course that it was by Scott Adams who is without one of the best and funniest writers in the world. The second was that the introduction said that it would be a great book to discuss with buddies over a drink. The third was that it was a book that the author was giving away for free on the internet and I wanted to know why - there must be something he really passionately wants to communicate if he's willing to forego money he could easily get with his saleability.The book is basically a conversation between two men, one of whom (Avatar) is enlightening the other by asking him probing questions about life, the universe, etc in the tradition of Socratic dialogue. Scott Adam claims in the introduction that the views of Avatar are not necessarily correct or even his own... they are just things he would like the reader to question himself so that he can come to a better understanding of his own beliefs and whether they are flawed or not.I started reading it and soon got fed up. The views of the Avatar were by turns - obvious, well known or just silly. In fact the entire philosophy seemed like it had been written by a teenager after his first foray into metaphysics. The story was also flat and a little amateurish.But then after skipping through the last few pages I remembered that I wasn't supposed to believe every word according to the introduction. I was supposed to figure out what was correct and what wasn't in the philosophy which was going to be more interesting because it would bring to light just how little we actually knew about our world. So cursing myself for judging it too quickly I set about trying to read it againUnfortunately I once again found myself annoyed by the text. Some of the stuff was just wrong and I think people who don't know much about new physics, etc would assume that it was groundbreaking truth or if there was an inconsistency to mull over wouldn't spot it because after all how many people understand Einstein's general relativity view on gravity being derived from the topography of spacetime? And the people who did know anything about some of the philosophical, scientific, spiritual questions that Adams tries to raise would have been appalled at the cursory and inaccurate treatment of the subjects.Half the reviews I have read are ecstatic because they have a whole new worldview on what God and science are all about (scary thought considering that it means that Adams has created yet another religion of mishmashed inconsistencies). Or there are those who believe that Adams has stimulated their thinking in a very novel and wonderful way as to how little we actually know for sure about our reality. I personally think that it could have been done much much much much better (simply explaining Young's double slit experiment or Michelson Morley experiments coherently would have been enough!)The pissed off reviewers are those who forgot that it was a thought experiment and thought that Adams was actually trying to explain the universe (poorly).I personally think that despite Adam's protestations that he doesn't really necessarily believe the views of 'Avatar' and they aren't meant to be gospel he actually takes himself far more seriously than he admits. I think that he has actually started seeing himself as a mini-guru on the new physics and it's implications on philosophy. He believes that he can and should popularize the mind bending subject so that people out there get how weird the universe actually is. In other Dilbert books by him there have been arbit chapters at the end talking about these issues. Unfortunately he doesn't understand the subject in enough depth or with the intuition required to be the popularizer and what will happen is that the people who don't read philosophical and physics books will have no idea what he is talking about and the people who do will immediately see how poor his grasp of the subject matter actually is.It's interesting to see Scott try his hand at something that he is obviously very passionate about but not very good at. Can't blame him for taking such a huge risk. He is one of the best comic writers in the world and for Dilbert I'll forgive him anything - even this book. He's still a God in my eyes."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I've been reading a lot of books on reality, perception and the universe lately, and I've read a lot of books on different religious beliefs in the past. This is the most creative take on the whole creation/purpose of life/God thing I've ever read. I don't want to say what the old man teaching the narrator believes because it would ruin the impact of reading it for yourself when you get there. (I think it's in the 12th chapter)Scott Adams includes a warning in the introduction as to who should read this book. Summarily, no one who is: under 14, uncomfortable with new ideas or strongly commited to their view of god. For these people, this book will be confusing and/or infuriating. For everyone else though, especially those who like pondering new ideas and having their beliefs questioned, this will be a very satisfying and enjoyable read. If nothing else, it's entertaing, written with the same wit and humor (although it is not a humor book) that makes Dilbert stand out."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Not since &quot;Godel, Escher, Bach&quot; have I read a book with such relish. Yes, I know the book has some basic science errors, but I was nonetheless fascinated. I think that for most of us, the book's main value is that it gives us a light bonk on the head. We don't have to agree with everything it says; it can still get us thinking along new lines. (The same might be said of &quot;Calculating God&quot; by Robert Sawyer, which was also excoriated by people who thought it said something it didn't.)I chose to read &quot;God's Debris&quot; precisely because I was sure I wouldn't like it. I try to avoid reading only those books that affirm what I already believe. So I was astonished at how much of this book fit in well with my existing opinions.For example, I enjoyed it when Adams (err, the Avatar) points out that if people TRULY believed in God they would live their life in a much different way. By golly, I've been saying precisely that for 25 years, but I find it hard to get people to understand what the heck I'm saying. (Brief version: if you really believed that un-Saved people will burn for eternity in Hell, would you be at home at night watching reruns on TV?)Okay, I know some people with PhD's in philosophy will turn their noses up at this slim volume. But they're overlooking something: this book is enormously accessible. Anybody with a high school education should be able to &quot;get&quot; it. Of course, some will balk at the science errors, and some will dispute Adams's characterization of the skeptics' movement. (Not all, though: I'm a card-carrying skeptic and I think what he said is at the very least a good warning.)I'm going to read the book again in a few days. I'll probably nit-pick a bit more, but I can't change the fact that I enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"The evidence for the success of Scott Adam's &quot;Thought Experiment&quot; is the 50+ reviews posted below, ranging from &quot;love it&quot; to &quot;hated it.&quot; The success of the experiment is nothing more than it got people thinking. Those who are disturbed by the fact that they disagree with the conclusions of the book (most notably, are we really God's Debris, not unlike the Kabbalistic notion of the divine sparks in all of us...) are actually missing the point. Scott Adam's makes no claim regarding the factual accuracy of his little tome. In fact, to do so would violate one of its central tenets, namely that what we observe is nothing but illusions. Those who are scientists who complain that his science is bad, or philosphers who claim that his philosophy is bad, or spiritualists who claim that his views of God are bad, point exactly to the failure of most of us to recognize that what we think is reality is in fact absurdly simplified paradigms that may or may not actually resemble reality. If this book does nothing more than encourage the reader to ask questions and think openly, then it is indeed successful. I rate it 4 stars only because the dialogue seemed a little forced. I appreciated the use of the two person interaction as the vehicle for communicating the ideas, but I didn't feel it was as effective as it could have been. But the &quot;thought experiment&quot; is wonderful.If you are pretty sure that your view of the world, the universe, God and your place in relation to all of that is the only right view, then don't even touch this book. You will hate it. On the other hand, if you enjoy having your perspectives and paradigms poked and prodded periodically, stretched, kicked and rolled around on the ground, then you will in all likelihood find this book as fun and as interesting to read as I did."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Of course it's contrived, but no more than say, Schroedinger's cat is contrived. That's the way of thought experiments. Besides, it's fiction. Adams says so right there in the introduction. It was never intended to answer any questions about the nature of the universe any more than Star Wars was intended to be a history of the universe a long time ago.I thoroughly enjoyed God's Debris, even though I can spot several flaws in the logic. Part of its charm, really, is that despite being purely fictional, there is a hint of the odd sort of reality of quantum physics that no one truly understands (&quot;If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics.&quot; -- Richard Feynman), extrapolated to ultimate simplicity. But don't confuse that with any sort of attempt to propose the Theory of Everything. This isn't it, nor does it pretend to be.Adams's challange to the reader is to try to spot the errors. I found that challange to be very entertaining, even if I have no way to verify whether I met the challange or not. Add to that a light-hearted background story, and you get what I considered to be a very good read. My only true disappointment with God's Debris was that it was over too soon."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"God's Debris will have you re-evaluating your belief system, whether you are religious, agnostic, or atheist (but especially if you're religious!). In an engaging conversational format, Adams poses startling questions about God, probability, and its role in the way things are in the universe. Find out what you SHOULD have been &quot;worshipping&quot; all this time!This is as close to &quot;the meaning of life&quot; as you'll get for the price. In addition to provocative banter concerning God, evolution, and science, God's Debris is also a fascinating look at awareness, relationships, and illusions. The deaf blind sea captain analogy is reason enough to read this book! The ending is satisfying and provides a mental goal we should all strive to reach.God's Debris is a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone who loves to ask Big Questions. See you at the Fifth Level. What's that? Get this book! It's wonderful."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Anyone with a basic understanding of science and religion will wonder where the thought provoking ideas are.Want an example: Galaxies are formed following simple probability. i.e. a Bell Curve. That's why they all look like they do. I guess Scott has never heard of a cluster galaxy. The entire book follows that same pattern.And as for the part that tries to deal with religion, here is all you need to do. Read about Augustine and the little boy he encountered while attempting to come to grips with the depths of the doctrine of the Trinity. Here's a hint,you can't fit the ocean in a small sand hole.I truly enjoy Dilbert and believe Scott is an excellent comic writer but he should really leave science and religionto people who truly understand it. BTW, I returned the book the very next day and got something worth reading."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I expected to enjoy this book but just couldn't. Scott Adams is a smart man, witty and clever, but this book was just frustrating in its very weak logic and its ignorance of bread-and-butter philosophical ideas found elsewhere. I normally enjoy a good new-age thought experiment but this one was just too hastily conceived, too from-the-hip to be given any weight. I feel like I have wasted my time."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"From my reading experience was made of the following20% stuff I already knew70% interesting but useless, and thus I ignored it30% really useful information that I will write down and review many timesI give this book 5 stars because the useless stuff was atleast interesting enough to keep me reading until I found the useful stuff which happened to be very useful for me.

Simply stunning. That's really the only way to describe this uttterly flawless and marvelous work. I just finished reading God's Debris, and already I am seeing the world through different eyes. The ideas in this book cannot be forgotten, and they cannot be &quot;unlearned.&quot; They will stick with you until the day you die. You can fight it, or you can sumbit to the perfect logic contained within, and become a changed person. Thank you, Scott Adams, I will be sure to read this many times in the future."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"If you find you can't laugh while reading this book, no amountof explaining will help you. Like most jokes, explaining themmakes it *not* funny. But the next time you hear somethingsimilar you might get it.I do think Mr. Adams needs more practice writing. This was good,but definitly an \\"early work\\". Most chapters had me laughing,and on a few it took me several minutes to stop so I could keepreading. Telling a joke verbally and telling it on paper requiredifferent timing, and I think he's almost got it.I'm looking forward to more books from Mr. Adams - I'm prettysure he will improve with practice. God's Debris is easy toread, fun and really funny."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This little volume is a surprisingly engaging read. It offers vingettes of everything from cosmology to classic philosophy of religion. Not that there is much in the way of analysis into the issues but it will hopefully stimulate some into further reading. Lets see, we've got biochemistry, math, quantum stuff, mind-body dualism, and, oh, yes, the age old Augustinian issue of free will versus hard determinism. If God knows everything ahead of time how can we be free? A very formal and compartmentalized philosophy that has plenty of logical solutions if Adams would only take the time. The science involved is highly controversial to say the least. The angle regarding evolution is appreciated because it illustrates, as Ken Wilber cogently describes in &quot;A Brief History of Everything&quot; the utter ludicrousness of neo-Darwinian dogma. Only problem is, this view is equally bad, as is Wilbers. Everybody wants hopeful monsters. Another issue is the assertion that probability is a power. It is nothing - only a description of interpreting phenomena. If you want that which is probable, then nothing should exist in the universe in the first place. We see the exercise of Pure Faith that matter can turn into consciousness, a la Anthropic Principle or mother goddess universe or whatever. The mystics of our age embrace this impossible state of affairs with open arms and a defiance of western secularized indications that all there is is a purposeless accident. The science is sure to change over time, but a personal God who is responsible will continue to be the only sensible way to account for order and energy and minds and most especially, wills. That thing in each human being that asserts or denies according to his liking how things are. Or should be. Or will be. The volitional will, my friend, has a source outside of your chemistry. Disagree and you are only asserting your will! Yea, yea, too simplistic you say? Lets see if and when Adams with his red plaid blanket becomes one with the ALL and has achieved avatar status, that the next book he writes will show a true reckoning in his playful world of thoughts."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Don't get me wrong. I like Scott Adams; he's a brilliant cartoonist. But he's a very bad philosopher. As near as I can figure it, his philosophy is that the universe is the debris of God, who decided to blow himself up just to see if he could. Apart from the scattered remains of the Lord, all that's left are probability and inertia, and somehow Adams combines this ridiculous melange into a &quot;meaning of life&quot; philosophy. According to Adams, the &quot;law of probability&quot; causes the atoms of God to come together (as opposed to gravity) and we should therefore favor beliefs and decisions that also cause us to come together as a society. I don't disagree with the idea, just the foundational premise. As so often happens when someone bases their beliefs on shaky science, science goes and changes on them. This is true of Adams theory, since cosmologists have recently discovered the the universe is not slowing down and contracting, but appears that it will expand forever. In fact, there's a mysterious force that is pushing the galaxies apart faster and faster. So, in Adam's world, this means that inertia beats probability, and we should all do everything we can to separate ourselves from each other. I kept hoping that Adams was going to redeem himself in the end by revealing that the &quot;Avatar&quot; was really Dogbert, just having us all on. Alas, no; it appears he's serious. The only positive thing I can say about the book is that it's short. I purchased it at an airport, and then my flight was delayed. I was able to read the whole thing in about an hour, and immediately returned it to the bookstore for a full refund. Save your money -- and your time. If your interested in subjects like this, read books by Paul Davies or Fritjof Capra."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Author Scott Adams challenges the reader to seek out the truth or BS in the various statements made by the two characters in this book. I took him up on it. Conclusion: It's almost all BS.Most of the obvious &quot;fact statements&quot; were patently false. Some merely a trite condensation of complex physics. Very few were even relatively close to accurate. This &quot;thought experiment&quot; was not worth the time I spent reading it, let alone looking for the material to prove or disclaim the various statements made by the protaganists.In looking at the reviews, and his introductory claim that no one under the age of 14 should read this, I was looking forward to a truly interesting and thought provoking read. What I found was an ill-composed, poorly thought out mish-mash of New Age pseudo-philosophical concepts. The only reason I won't give this to my 12 year old is that I don't want to waste his time as I wasted mine."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Because God is all powerful & all knowing, the characters in Scott Adams' dialogue believe that self destruction would be His only challenge. Having taking up that challenge & having blown Himself up, God has been reduced to His own debris. We are part of God's dust, which (according to the characters) is now on a mission to reassemble itself (for another round of self-destruction?).Outside of some pretentious smart alecks with whom I went to high school 35 years ago, I don't know of anyone who could take this book's basic premise seriously! I guess the not-so-subtle inference is that anyone else's theology makes just as much (or as little) sense.If Adams is trying (in a very convoluted way) to make the point that the only reason for believing anything should be that it is true, I wholeheartedly agree! With that in mind, I suggest that theCompendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Churchand theHandbook of Christian Apologeticsmake far superior investments."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I wasn't expecting a Dilbert book, but maybe a bit like a Dilbert book. But it is something completely different. Enjoyable to read, something to think about, but like the Dilbert book, not to be taken to seriously. If you want to discuss the existence of God in a Monty Python kind of setting, buy this book."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Exceptional book that Scott clearly says isn't a definitive book on what to believe, but rather to open up your mind to the possibilities out there. Short and easy to read, I've bought several copies to give away to young people in particular. While the books is based on Deistic concepts, the underlying theme isn't about religion but instead about spirituality in general. Never preachy, interesting and enlightening. Worth a read by anyone who doesn't think preachers have all the answers."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Scott Adams started off with a simple question: What if you knew everything about everything? From that he creates an exercise in how you observe reality that will expand your mind and make you see everything differently. I can't recommend this short read (one, two nights tops) enough to everyone. If you read one book this year, make it this one. Really, do it."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Great book, reads well and was quite interesting to say the least. I enjoyed God's Debris and would love to find more books like it. I didn't feel like it was too hard a read at all and he really got to his points. A great find and I will be sure to share it with my friends."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"What a great surprise and a fun premise to take us into, to watch and observe the details of a normal everyday event with a wonderfully philosophical exchange about life, love and the pursuit of happy times. They get us thinking about our lives and how we can add something to it to make a difference.Scott gives us something to chew on and is not trying to change our lives but improve it. At times he may take on more with a smaller view than really is needed yet as you think about it the answers will come.I thought it was a good read and am looking forward to reading his other book, The Religion War."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read. It really changes the way you look at certain things in life. Very fun and amusing. And it's a fiction book, don't forget that when reading!"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I read this book not too long ago, and I can definately say it's a very mentally stimulating book. This book will make you question everything. It might not change your life completely, but it will give you a new perspective on the universe, you... all that is. Definately read it, it's a fantastic book."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Damn what a bunch of stodgy clods who gave this a bad review. No the philosophy is not \\"Deep\\" nor is it to be taken seriously. Its to get you to re-examine the doctrinaire religious and secular world views you have and think outside the box. Of course much of the ideas are BS. Mr. Adams says as much in the introduction. And if you're smart enough to see through them congratulations to you! Your critical abilities have triumphed and your faith in them is justified! If you cannot fathom the book and did some independent research to educate yourself again you've emerged victorious. And if you do the thinking AND the research to improve yourself better yet. But you'd have to be dumb enough to read Lord of the Rings for software design tips to believe that the book is more than what the author says. And if it truly offends your sensibilities, stick to reading aspirin labels."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I tend to base the quality of a story by how easy or difficult it is to put down. I read the first two-thirds of the book while attending my weekly bowling league. The ideas presented by the Avatar are not new to me, because I've been at least a Level 4 for as long as I can remember. This book had an &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot;-type effect on me. It's the kind of story that gives your belief system just enough of a nudge to not so much cause you to question things that you previously believe, but to open yourself to the possibilities that you don't have all the answers.The length of the story is perfect. Too much longer, and it would have defeated its own purpose. As I've told my friends, it's a quick read, but it's a &quot;meaty&quot; read. Well done."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I was thoroughly impressed by Scott Adams' work. His dialogues are realistic - throughout many late-night talks with friends and family, the same objections, the same reasoning always come up. And, yet, something about his logic seems to cut through all of those banterings - it cuts through the presuppositions and asks, again, the question, &quot;Why?&quot;For those who aren't content with simple explanations, or who love to argue, this is not a good book. Adams takes the approach that the simplest answer is the right answer. This isn't right for everyone. But, for those of us who seek a simple, logical explanation for the universe, this book presents a challenge and an engaging exercise in self-examination."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"God's Debris is small but packed full of interesting infoIf you enjoy philosophical debates you'll love this little book. I only wish it were longer. Scott Adams is more than just the creator of Dilbert and proves his worth with this book. It's really fascinating and thought provoking."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This is a small book on philosophical musings, where the author attempts to pose some questions and create arguments to counter some \\"intuitive\\" answers to them.First of all, as fiction, the storyline is as lame as More's Utopia, in that the personal stories and circumstances surrounding the conversation are pretty much meaningless. The book is written in a conversation style, where the old man does most of the talking, and the listener periodically asserts a couple of confused statements.The main problem I have with the book is that the questions are nothing insightful: in fact they have been asked and answered in much better - and better written - books. The answers provided by the book contain some elements of original thinking, but while some of them are a \\"bit out there\\", it simply comes down to the fact that they are just not that interesting."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Scott Adams' thought experiment was well thought out. In retrospect I say it was a good book, although it annoyed me at points during the reading. Being that it is such a small book it can sometimes be an overload of information all at once. The first half is a little slow and seems to just stretch one subject to the max, but towards the end it gets really fascinating to hear his veiw on why things are the way they are. I'm really glad I read it, and I think anyone looking to get a different opinion on life, science, theories, etc. would definately enjoy this book. :)"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Scott Adams is an amazingly funny comic strip writer. However, Adams fails to come up with anything interesting, new, or even profound in this non-comic endeavor. While some readers may find ideas here that are \\"new\\" (in the sense that the reader hasn't seen the idea(s) before), most people with any serious background in philosophy, science or religion will find anything new.The book itself is written decently enough, and as a story may hold some interest for some. I even like the overall goal of making people think. But after reading it, I find the overall \\"philosophy\\" to be sloppy and unimaginitive. At least I'll give him credit; he warns the reader in the forward that some of the \\"scientific facts\\" in the book are \\"baloney.\\""},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I do a lot of reading on spiritual topics, especially, metaphysics. I look for books with the word &quot;God&quot; in their title especially. So naturally, when I found this book in the metaphysics section of Border's Books, I took a look at it. I normally just open a book up somewhere, anywhere, and read a few paragraphs. If it sounds like something I am interested in, I will take a closer look. If I like what I am reading, I will buy it!First of all, being the creator of Dilbert (I love Dilbert!), tickled me to no end that Scott would write a book like this! I knew there would by rye humor and intelligent wit contained in its contents :)I have read many, MANY books on spirituality, no way to count them all, I think. And I have often thought...for all the so called &quot;knowledge&quot; that I have extracted from those books, I should write a book. But I keep thinking, why should I just regurgitate something which others have written? And that is what has stopped me.But Scott's book, if no other, has proven to me, that even though there are many books about Spirit, we can always say something original and new and refreshing, if we are willing to listen to our inner voice. It is clarity which one needs to write a simple essay like this, succinctly, and from the heart.Not since I read Conversations with God, A Common Dialog, by Neale Donald Walsch, have I read a book more worth reading than Scott's! And the tone and substance of hisbook, and the dialog, is so much in line with Walsch's, I knew that there was but One Source that it's inspiration derived from :)I think this book is a written Masterpiece! This is true Spirit in it's purest sense. I loved the down-to-earth, simple, humanistic and day-to-day common sense &quot;attitude,&quot; that is so typical of Dilbert, carried thru in the entire book. Once again we have the Old Master speaking to yet another new student, instructing us in the common sense of Who We Are. I recognize the modus.I think Scott has succeeded so well, where many others have failed, in communicating something valuable. I have observed something which seems to be true. In the book, he wondered, how is it that you can drive down the same street for a long time and never take note of a sign that has been there all along? Well here is something I noticed along the long road of my spiritual development...when God speaks, it is simple, succinct, direct, personable and in imminently common sense terms...God writes SMALL books with BIG ideas. God leaves the BIG books with SMALL ideas for all the rest of us to write to each other.What Scott has written, is another Conversations with God book, and its from The Old Man! You will know what I mean when I say &quot;Old Man,&quot; when you read this book for yourself.I hope, Scott will continue the dialog with another book. But for some reason, as I fear, so often happens, sequels, never are as good as the original. For some reason, when God speaks, He does so, one book and one person, at-a-time. What needed to be said gets said, the first time around. That is why, I devour such books deliciously when I find them, but always get to the end with an &quot;awwww, do I really gotta go to bed now mom&quot; feeling...that somehow, I wish that all that wonderful wisdom had not ended so abruptly when my mind was so much in sync with and wanted to continue with, the dialog.This is one of those books you wish had not ended so quickly.Finally, I couldn't help but chuckle with glee, when Scott said, to effect, to the old man (Avatar), (page 126):&quot;That sounds very charitable, I said, but I notice your level has the highest number. That's obviously the good one. You must be feeling a little smug&quot;I was sitting in a McDonald's having a hamburger when I read those words, and I couldn't help but burst out chuckling...I want you to know, my chuckling made a lotof mom's and their kids smile because I could not restrain my chuckling! I thought I would leave everyone who reads this commentary on this note...Scott Adams have done GOOD work here!"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Before you rate this book less than 5 stars, please read the title at least few hundred times until you understand the part where it looks something like this:&lt;Thought experiment>"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"But with an open mind, you will find a fun mental exercise that is neither going to make a religious zealot out of an atheist, nor vice versa. As an engineer, I did come across technical flaws; but I don't think they detract from the point of the story. On the contrary, I feel the concept of questioning the accepted precepts of science and society to be healthy. Many of the one- and two-star reviewers really took this way too seriously. (As Scott Adams anticipated many would in his Introduction.) Let's face it; if you are going to a cartoonist for deep philosophy, physics, cosmology or religion, one really needs to question your motives and rationale. However, what a gift to find one that can come out with a fun, non-comic-strip story to tweak both religious and scientific devotees with the message that we all follow the delusions that we choose to embrace."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Scott Adams, the well-known creator of Dilbert, takes a 180 degree turn from his popular cartoon series.This book tries to make you think of a few things differently than you have before. It tells a story of a man delivering a package to another old man who essentially tries to explain the mysteries of the universe. It is divided into several short chapters, each under a different topic.This book is also available as an e-book, which was how it was originally published.Contrary to how it seems at the beginning, this book isn't really fiction. It is also definately not funny or humorous in any way. Some of the ideas are pretty extreme and do provoke some thought.In my opinion, this book has quite a narrow audience. If you are looking for a good fiction book, this is not for you. If you are looking for something Dilbert-esque, or at the very least &quot;funny&quot; in some sort of way, this is Definately not for you. If you are a deep thinker who ponders the mysteries of the universe, or just an extreme Scott Adams fan, this book is a great choice."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I was very very impressed with this book. It presented wonderfully simple answers to questions that are unimaginably complex, all the while reminding us that the real and complete truth is beyond our own finate understanding. It paints a picture of a truely infinate diety rooted in probibility that goes so far as to transcend time and existance itself. Being a devout Christian, I would have thought myself offended by such an abstract vision of God, until I realized that it was still an accurate and practical depiction of what an omnipresent diety has to be. But the best part of the whole experiance was the realization that this book was not a collection of answers, but rather a model for a way of thinking that forces you to make your own. It goes beyond simple human concepts of reason, and into a place that has no why. If you're someone who thinks abstractly, and feels like nobody else does, read this book. Just keep in mind that it IS fiction."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"It was delivered to me at 10:00 this morning at work - since then I haven't done anything but read.

It needed a critical editor to push the storyline to achieve something. As it stands, it's a dialogue between a deliveryman and an old man, whom we are to assume is either God or omniscient or something, and the deliveryman is pushed by the old man into thinking about, and questioning, profound thoughts. It goes along okay, and I won't say it isn't provocative in some ways, and I won't say I didn't enjoy reading it. But a little over halfway through, the \\"deliveryman\\" starts bringing up issues of ESP, and the resulting discussion really brings the book down to amateur level. Again, if this weren't Dilbert's creator, no publisher would have considered it."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This book is a decent read, but it was very...

Worse yet, anybody who has considered these same issues has probably already discovered a better system. I guess if you're really desperate for an unchallenging philosophy book to read, then read this one. If you want something with novel, reasonable philosophical views, read something else.

Mere words cannot convey how this book has changed my thought process. I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I understand that I am 16, and that my opinon doesn't matter much. However I thought the book was amazing.

I've made my friends read it, i've sent it out to my college friends and we all talk about it. I myself had no faith, and this really made my think about that. The book opens up your mind.
