A thousand pages &amp; Rand is still not much nerarer to uniting the Aiel than before.The only part worth reading is Perrin in Two Rivers.While introducing the Aiel customs is new, this business of describing every Aiel, Ship captain &amp; soldier is rediculous!I would strongly recommend skimming through the parts on Elayne &amp; Nynaeve, but read in detail on Perrin &amp; Min.Bye!^_^"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is a continued saga in the Wheel of Time series..

This is the best book of the series and one of the most important. My favorite character is Perrin and in this book he gives a lot of coverage for Perrin. It is one of the most important because this book has where Perrin becomes a lord and Rand becomes He Who Comes With the Dawn. This has to be the most funny of any of the books (if they can be called funny) because of the Faile-Perrin interactions. (Dry humor maybe). I have read this book ten+ times and every time I get something new out of it. If you are willing to read a longer book this may become one of your favorites. Though I do admit that the parts when the women are in Tanchico are some of the most boring parts in the entire series and I am guilty of skipping over them.

However, it's not for everyone. Jordan is probably the most descriptive writer I have ever read and he will describe everything he possibly can in one situation in order to set the mood properly. This makes his books, and the chapters, very long. Some people don't like long and descriptive, elaborate writing like this, I do, and I believe that Robert Jordan is the best author I have ever read.

Having pushed through 4 books in a week, I have to say that I am only getting more and more excited about the story.

However, I am sucked in and hope the fun continues."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan continues to amaze me with his ability to weave the smallest of details into his stories in such a way that they later become the linchpin in what developed into a large story arc.

Sends them on different paths. So it becomes more like reading a couple different novels put together.My favorite thing about this book is how wonderful of a story Perrin has. His whole arc is the most satisfying for this book. I shall keep this spoiler free but he excepts some change in his life that sends him down a path with destiny. He is starting to realize just what it means to be ta'veren.The only one that I had any trouble with was Rand. His story line isn't bad. I believe that Jordan was setting up for the long arc with Rand in this book. So that means good for the series but bad for this book.I am still enjoying this series four books in. The cast is always getting bigger but I don't feel lost at all. I love the Wheel of Time."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I am currently re-reading the \\"Wheel of Time\\" series in antisipation of the final book, and I am finding that by reading the series a second time I am enjoying it much, much more. I have just finished \\"The Shadow Rising\\" and am now begining \\"The Fires of Heaven\\" and I have to say that next to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" this is one of the very best series of books in print. Jordan captures each charactor vividly, taking you inside their world and making you a part of the story. Now that Rand is openly proclaming himself the Dragon reborn, the Forsaken are loose, the Two Rivers is under attack, Perrin is fighting with being something he never wanted to be, as well as Matt, Moiraine (my favorite charactor of all) is still as mysterious as ever, but showing the human side that was there in the prolog book, Ninaeve, Elaine and Egwin all chasing something that they must catch, but that frightens them beond compare, this is a great read well worth investing the time into. I highly recommend reading this series one book after the other so you don't loose track of the story line. \\"Shadow\\" is exillarating, entertaining, captivating, and never, ever boring."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Author Robert Jordan's vast cast of characters go their separate ways after their stronghold is invaded by minions of the Forsaken, who appear to be jockeying for position in anticipation of their Dark Lord's return.This huge novel is essentially three intertwined novels. Rand goes into the Aiel Waste with Mat, Egwene, Moiraine, and Lan on a journey of self-discovery as he begins to confront his awesome responsibility as the Dragon Reborn. Perrin returns to the Two Rivers and finds it plagued by Trollocs, Fades, and the fundamentalist Whitecloaks. Nynaeve and Elayne, accompanied by Thom Merrilin, hunt the Black Ajah in the intrigue-torn city of Tanchico. Perrin's storyline is the most involving, with rousing action and a touching romance as Perrin is thrust against his will into a position of leadership. Such a lengthy novel will inevitably have sections that are a bit of a slog to get through and probably should have been cut, but the reader who perseveres will be rewarded."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I have read every book in this series so far and get completely sucked up into each volume.

Yes the writing in general can be laborious and weighted. If I was Robert Jordan I would cut some of the fat (filler) but fortunately I am not Robert Jordan. While the pace can be slow, the wait is worthwhile. No it is not the Lord of the Rings but who cares. I'm glad I was not his editor because I would had slash and trim here and there. Yea, I got frustrated sometimes and felt he needed to be a little more pointed.No I don't have a short attention span. Yes some readers have to be patient with Mr.Jordan. He is not the smoothest writer but he holds my attention. In general a very fine series after all it is a series. Some of the reviewers need to be a little less thin skin. Some of the critics were valuable. It is not just take or leave it but a little more complex. It is all about his style.

The introduction of Aiel society and customs in Shadow adds to the richness of the story. The three seperate plots are each different and interesting, although the girls' continuing hunt for the Black Ajah does get tiring after a while. Perrin's trek homeward is an excellent subplot, and affects the rest of the series' storyline for the better. Rand's journey into the Waste and Rhuidean lead to a very... interesting plot twist, and Mat gets his trademark hat. All in all, this is one of the best stories in the series, and combined with the following book &quot;The Fires of Heaven,&quot; make a superb story."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I have read the first 4 volumes of the Wheel of Time at least 3 times each. The &quot;Rhuidean&quot; parts of this volume are SO amazing in EVERY respect that I have re-read them more than any other part or whole novel of the never-ending series.The great thing about this series is that everyone has a favorite character (or two) and everyone has a favorite book, though they be independent of each other. To me, this is the last of the great books from Jordan... and though the rest of them disappoint, after 4 great ones, I am so hooked as to buy evey new one upon first printing... in other words, to this point he wrote 4 great novels in the series, then 4 unsatisfying ones... and yet I cannot help but buy #9 hot-off-the-presses."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

Fabulous... it &quot;kept me up past bedtime&quot; reading it. Simply splendid."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This was the best book so far with three rousing finishes. As many have said here, I liked Perrin's sequence the best. He has turned out to be probably the most &quot;real&quot; character and we get a good picture of his struggle to accept his role as a leader and &quot;savior&quot; of his people in the Two Rivers. Nynaeve and Elayne's story was a little slow, but I did like Nynaeve's battle with Moghedein (Sp?). Last, Rand's trip to Rhuidean gave valuable insight into the series as a whole and his battle with Asmodean in the end was a lot of fun as well. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Let's just get it out of the way...the book was too long. That said, it was still full of good moments. I enjoyed Perrins part in the story in particular, he's really coming into his own as an independant character. I liked Mats involvement in book 3 much more than this one. And RAND, finally making some decisions instead of just reacting and running scared. I really enjoyed his displays of strength (at last) and willingness to take charge. For the most part the female characters are still pretty annoying (except Min). I agree with one reviewer who said the Aes Sedai spend too much time working against Rand instead of with him. Don't get me wrong, this is a really solid book with plenty to keep you iterested. It just doesn't quite live up to the incredibly high standards set by the rest of the series so far. I'm still looking forward to reading the next books."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Well, I'm amazed! This guy is really a great writer! What with Rand going to Rhuidean with Mat, both of whom are being challenged by this Couladin guy, Perrin off in the Two Rivers trying to fight off like, 4 evils at once (&quot;Padan Fain&quot;, the Whitecloaks, this &quot;Slayer&quot; dude and the Trollocs) and Nynaeve and Elayne off in Tanchico tracking something as dangerous to Rand as the Seanchan are to any woman who can channel, you will not get bored. Asmodean is a brilliant touch, adding extra entertainment and a very important element in. Lanfear is trailing Rand all the way, and I don't quite like the looks of that. All in all, very good. Nice bit about the two similar ter'angreal, one in Tear, the other in Rhuidean... I wonder what they told Rand in the Tairen one? With Moghedien mixed into the action in Tanchico along with the Black Ajah, Nynaeve and Elayne have all they can handle and then some. Best one yet, best book I've ever read, and I'm looking forward to the next!"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This one of the best books Robert Jordan has ever written. From the search to find the Black Ajah, Rand and the Aiel, Perrin at Two Rivers again, this book takes the cake. A must read. Full of great adeventure with Rand, the Dragon Reborn, going to Rhuidean and proclaiming himself Car'a'carn to the Aiel and being challenged by Couladin of the Shaido. And every step of the way, Lanfear is there. Perrin has his trouble with Whitecloaks and Trollocs at Emonds Feild, and Nyneave and Elayne duke it out in Tancicho with the Black Ajah and a Forsaken.This book is the best fantasy you can get with a great story line, and the ongoing battle between good and evil. Having the best ending in the series, Shadaow Rising is a must for any fantasy lover."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I think this book deserves a solid 4 stars. I loved it, near the end I was especially in a have-to-read mood, but some parts you do kind of have to pull yourself through. And even though he does it excellently, I wish Robert Jordan would do a little less describing and get on with the story. And I wished the Aiel had remained more mysterious. But seriously, those were the only things wrong with it, unless you count the fact that I thought the first three books were a tad better. Definetely don't start this book if you haven't read the first three, and definetely don't fell overwhelmed by it's size (it goes by surprisingly fast!). I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes this sort of thing. And even to some people who don't...yet.

He seems to step into this world whenever he feels like it, take notes on what's happening, come back to the real world and compile his facts together.

Jordan makes WOT come to life agian with his best yet."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Shadow Rising followed the previous books very well. It kept with the same themes, while adding many new twists and conflicts at the same time to create yet another spellbinding novel to keep you on the edge of your seat until the last page. As in all of Jordan's books, the characters and conflicts are so realistically placed into the fantasy world that it seems real, and makes you feel as if you were there. The book enchants even the less imaginative among us, and to try and figure out the complex &quot;Game of the Houses&quot; or any of the Forsaken's twisted plans can stretch any mind. Every little detail matters in these books, and everything is incoorporated together very masterfully."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I REALLY dug this one. I mean, the opening sequence of the attack on Tear... the revelations in Rhuidean... seriously, someone else in one of the reviews says that the past &quot;sounds suspiciously like technology&quot;... and why shouldn't it? Jordan does a brilliant job of codifying the un-codifyable -- magic, folks -- and, in the flashbacks, showing its natural outgrowth in a developed and peaceful world! As Clarke says, &quot;Any technology, sufficiently advanced, becomes indistinguishable from magic&quot;... this works in reverse, too. And the the place of the Aiel, both in the present of the novels, and the past... jeez. It's just brilliant. And I still love Mat. Finally, he gets a way to stand up to the Aes Sedei.On the down side... wish that the portals and the races we met in this installment had been continued elsewhere. Wish that the Aiel baddies were a _little_ more human. I wish i hadn't been able to pick up on &quot;zaim&quot; (Aiel for &quot;corn&quot;) as a direct derivation from &quot;maize.&quot; I REALLY want to just slap Nynaeve around. GOD, she's annoying. But I KNOW people like that. So at least it supports the overall consistency.Jordan has a great imagination. If he's managed to parlay that into a vast and profitable series, which has, in turn, spawned hordes of ravening fans... well, more power to to him. And as I just shelled out $20+ for &quot;The Path of Daggers,&quot; I guess I'll just ravine (can one actually _ravine_?) along with the rest of them."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"For all of you who are just picking up this series, dont let all the negative reviews beat you down. Some of the readers need to remember that this is a GRAND story, with very far reaching effects into a rich world. Instead of seeing each book on it's own, look at them as an entire story, one that has got to have a middle that builds up the end. It just happens to be that this is one LONG story, and, with that in mind, you can understand its LONG middle! I am sure that none of the readers would want Bobby to end the story in one quick swoop. -Take as long as you need Bobby, we'll still be buying the books..."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Shadow Rising was not as earth-shattering as its predecessors, but it still comes filled with great fantasy. The descriptions are wonderful and the final battle(s) at the end create a great cliffhanger."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Before I picked up this book, I loved Robert Jordan's stuff. It was one of the best fantasy series' i'd ever read and looked like it was just gonna get better. After reading this book, I became an absolute utterly obsessed fanatic. This thing DEFINES the word &quot;epic&quot;. This is mindshatteringly HUGE, and I don't mean just lengthwise. This thing soars over an entire world while twisted plots and schemes rush in and out of each other, as everyone influences everyone else. The small things matter just as much as the big things, and Jordan's no slacker when it comes to details. This thing is extremely lush with intricate detail and is so well done that it is still extremely exciting.This book in particular draws ideas from everywhere into a synthesis of experience and pain and hope and light and dark. One large thread in the storyline gives a feel of &quot;Laurence of Arabia meets Tolkien&quot; in the lush writing that makes RJ's fans love him so much. All the while there's betrayal left and right, and while THAT's happening, off somewhere else events are taking place that lead to a much more stark, real feel without taking away a bit of the quality the hugeness lent. Every character is represented in top form and more character development happens in this book among the main characters than the next 3 combined! Please, if you like fantasy and like it bigger(like earlier Jordan or perhaps Michael Moorcock's &quot;Elric&quot; stuff) rather than smaller in scope(Lord of the Rings and Shannara gave me that feel, seemed a bit more petty), then get this now and read for the very first time the the best epic fantasy book written so far."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan never ceases to amaze me with his books.

To all those Jordan-bashers, let me tell you that this series has been a non-stop roller coaster ride from the beginning and I hope it never ends! If you people had any imagination, you would be just as enthralled as I am. Robert Jordan makes his characters real by giving them flaws and thoughts and emotion. Rand, Mat, Perrin, Egwene, Elayne, and Nynaeve are all experiencing a rite-of-passage in their lives. A rite-of-passage is an event or ceremony which significantly changes a person's life, such as marraige or puberty. Robert Jordan has masterfully incorporated their rites-of-passage with the plot and and excellent battles and magical abilities. From book one, I was captivated. However, in order to really understand the book, you must start with the first one and open your mind, because you will be amazed!!!"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I was enthralled by the beginnings of the Wheel of Time. I thought, &quot;Wow, this book has magic ( the True Power) in a completely new form no one had ever conceived before, and new races ( Ogier and Trollocs ) straight from the author's imagination. But 2500 some pages later, with little more to add than sensless rhetoric about the same doubts and misconceptions that troubled the characters from page one of the Eye of The World, it's getting old.

I haven't read through my Jordan books in a while, and for the last month or so I started them all over from the begining. For my money this is when Jordan really gets cooking, and for three books it looked like he was going to write something absolutely brilliant, original, and accessable. This was going to be the series that Sci-Fi/Fantasy readers could read in public, and recommend to their non-Sci-Fi/Fantasy reading friends. This is the start of the golden age of Jordan books...of course by the end of Crown of Swords the golden age had gone with a whimper, not a bang. But that does not diminish the excellence that is Shadow Rising. An awesome book, but it is an absolute must that you read the first three books before you tackle this one. (The first three are also very very good.)"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I just started reading these books about 3 months ago. My first delve into the fantasy genre started over a year ago with Terry Goodkind. His work was brillant (except for Faith of the Fallen)and I wanted to give other fantasy authors a try. So I picked up Eye of the World. I must say, there are some things about Wheel of Time that I like more then The Sword of Truth. For instance, the whole concept of magic. I like the male and female aspect of it and how different types of magic are placed into 5 categories. Earth, Fire, Wind, Water, and Spirit.But one thing Terry Goodkind does well is advance the plot. Jordan seems to be a bit sluggish in this area. It takes me longer to finish each installment I read just due to sheer boredom. The whole thing with Rand in the desert I felt was too long and drawn out. It would take me a day or two just to get past one of his chapters. Another thing about Jordan (and Goodkind to be truthful) is that he may sometimes give his character's a lack of realism. Like take for instance the whole thing with Nynaeve and Elayne. They are trying so hard to work harder at not getting caught by the Black Ajah. And Nynaeve practically pulls her braid out yelling at Thom, the theifcatcher, and Domon to be careful. But the next minute she is drinking tea and blabbing out all of their secrets to a woman she hardly knows and doesn't even flinch. And when she finds out the woman is Seanchan. She continues to discuss plans and Black Ajah in front of her. Her excuse is that they can't free the woman. True, but couldn't Elayne have woven air around her ears to keep her from hearing?And the continous jump from Rand's ancestor to ancestor was mind boggling. It took me awhile just to realize who it was they were talking about. And that lasted WAY to long.But all in all, it was a fun book and I like to see advancment in everybody's abilites and there was plenty of that. So I will give the next book a try. Hopefully it will be better then tis one was"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Perrin Aybara and Faile Bashere are simply the best couple in fantasy literature I've ever encountered. Simultaneously sweet and frustrating, these two are a constant joy to read about. &quot;Shadow Rising&quot; is also a classic coming of age story, with Perrin's tragic return to the Two Rivers, the maddening hometown hero worship, and his growth into a reluctant, but strong, general in a desperate war against the Trollocs and Whitecloaks. Throw in people who have a natural mystery about them (Tam the original heron-marked swordsman and Verin the brilliant, but noncommittal Aes Sedai) and the people Perrin once grew up with (the proud &quot;parents&quot; and the naive Companions) and we've got ourselves a truly enriching story.So why then am I only giving this book 2 stars? Because The Two Rivers story has been reduced to a simple side story in Jordan's world. It may also have been an unfortunate consequence of &quot;The Dragon Reborn,&quot; but I skipped almost every chapter that focused on Rand. And as I trudged through SR, I began skimming through chapters that were about Nynaeve and Egwene and Elayne and Mat and eventually skipped entire passages just to get back to Perrin (and to a lesser degree, the side story about Min and the Amyrlin Seat).I'm still recommending this book. The parts in the Two Rivers alone make it worth the read. I wish I could say it's a standalone, but there are too many details spread out in the first three books that you won't appreciate all the intricacies in SR. I can say that skipping uninteresting parts of this book probably won't hurt because the next book in the series supposedly shifts focus away from Perrin and returns to more important storylines."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"And thus do we enter an amazing stretch of books. I loved The Shadow Rising, I loved the parts of the world we got to explore here, and I loved the new points of view.I'm still amazed at how brilliant the idea of \\"ta'veren\\" was. I, along with the rest of the fantasy reading world, got sick of the farmer-turned-savior trope right about when the hobbits return to the Shire in The Lord of the Rings. It was fine for Tolkein but man, we all know how done to death it is now. So how do we make a fantasy novel compelling when you really just want your characters to start as farmers? Make them ta'veren! Brilliant! Of course they end up becoming important to the world, the very fabric of reality is weaving itself around them. Of course random people will all of a sudden look at Perrin and say \\"Now there goes a leader!\\" even if we the readers know Perrin sucks at it. The Age Lace or Time Tapestry or some other weaving analogy wants it to happen this way! I just love the idea, it makes it impossible for me to be annoyed that a couple farmers are deciding the fates of entire countries.I already feel so rewarded for sticking with the series this long. The little things, like Egwene saying \\"Be steadfast\\" when Aviendha has to go through her Wise One ordeal. The echo of Egwene's rise to Accepted brought a huge grin to my face, and it really meant something for her character. I feel like she's put all those crappy visions behind her and accepted her fate. The Aiel call their loved ones \\"shade of my heart\\" and that just made me melt, I think it's so sweet and endearing. And then the epic chapters in Rhuidean, where we learn how both the Aiel and the Tinkers started. A sharp eye will pick out all sorts of references in that chapter, and it really is amazing and rewarding if you've stuck with the series.Although this installment starts out pretty slowly, I love having Rand back instead of just glimpses of him through other character's eyes. I've never been a fan of Perrin but his chapters are really good in this book. Mat, to make up for being a non-entity in books 1 and 2, does something awesome in every chapter he's in. He is by far my favorite of the three farm boys! But everyone's opinions differ on that. The world has become a lot larger for the Emond's Fielders, but it shrinks at the same time. We have characters spanning the continent and traveling quickly becomes more and more simple. It really does give us the feeling that a world and everyone in it is at stake.Siuan and Egeanin are new points of view and I loved both of them. Really looking forward to more from both of them, especially Egeanin.Can't wait to start the next one!"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Friendship is a constant of mankind since our Creation. God *designed* us to need friends and to want to be friends to others. Often, the best stories and myths are those that take this very real element of the personal, and make that a distinctive part of the tale. Such was the case with *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*, as it was also true with *The Chronicles of Narnia* stories.Yet all too many movies and novels fall far short of the quality they could achieve and entertainment they could provide, if they simply focused more on camaraderie. One series that has not made that mistake is *The Wheel of Time* series by the late Robert Jordan. Since I have already reviewed the first three, I will not go over the plot yet again for the series, but will examine two main threads that were the most prominent in the current book's narrative.*The Shadow Rising* takes place shortly after the end of the events of *The Dragon Reborn*. Rand, Mat, and Perrin, the three ta'veren, and their friends and guides are in the city of Tear where Rand proved himself to be the Dragon, Lewis Therin Telamon, Reborn in a new body and personality. Meanwhile, we learn more of what it means for the three young men to be ta'veren. Rand, as the Dragon Reborn, was created by the pattern to be a ta'veren. His two best friends were chosen by the pattern of the Wheel of Time to assist him and are thus ta'veren who are gifted with unique abilities and pull others towards them just as Rand pulls Mat and Perrin towards him. This development of the abilities and significance of the three men is the first main plot point.The second main plot point is one that was, in many ways, inevitable. The Shadow, the evil one who is trying to break free and destroy all of creation had to have some victories and negative impact at some point in the plot. You can't have a multi-book series without this happening at *some* point. This book is where he does. Thus, the title. Between the catastrophes and near or actual losses that occur to the characters and their loved ones, as well as the release for certain of ALL of the imprisoned Forsaken or servants of the Dark One, the Shadow is not winning, but most definitely is rising.Of course, the ta'veren coming more fully into their own powers also means that the friends of the young men are also coming into their own powers and abilities, and finding new depths of skill and courage. All of this makes for some compelling reading.What ties all of this together? What I started out by mentioning. Friendship. The deep friendship and love of each other and family keeps these characters from separating when they otherwise might try. It is not just that they have no choice due to the Wheel's forcing them together, as Mat would like to claim. No, it is that they all, deep-down, care for each other, and want to help each other.For me, all of the action scenes, as neat as they were, were secondary in my enjoyment to the compelling depths of the love and loyalty these men and their friends have for each other.Despite all of my gushing, their were some problems. The romantic parts of the story seemed to move really, REALLY quickly. Even though some of the romantic storylines are plausible, they do not feel likely or believable. Not really.The second criticism is how one ta'veren's great victory at the very end seemed to be too sudden. I can see how it can work within the story, but it just felt like it was rushed, and that kind of soured it a bit for me, by yanking me from the story as I realized how contrived it seemed.Despite these criticisms, I must say that along with the emphasis on friendship, I also appreciated how this was one of the few fantasy books that actually had logical battlefield tactics, and military veterans that actually act like they are military veterans. Joshing and kidding around is one thing in peaceful times. When the stuff hits the fan though, well, it's time to pull out the aggression and no-nonsense part of each person from down deep. The overall aspect of the military man and tactics he might use was portrayed realistically enough given the setting it is in. For that, I was really glad.Despite the setbacks that occurred and the partially contrived ending, this book was a fun, memorable story of friendship and daring against all odds. A worthy volume in this terrific series. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book is great. How anyone can complain about a book that takes you to a whole other interesting world for 8 bucks is beyond me. Those who need action and plot movement in every single page may be a bit disappointed, but who has that short of an attention span?

They say it lulls a little around book 9 - 11 and I will have to see. I love the world Robert Jordan creates so I am happy to get as much of the world as I can even if some of the books slow down a bit.ONE NEGATIVE IS THAT at the time of writing this review I am UNABLE to purchase this book on my kindle.

I just bought the kindle this week with the main idea that I could read this series on it, so I will be incredibly disappointed if I can not do that."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Jordan makes a conscious decision to not only continue to bring in more details, more background, and nation-size quantities of characters with more plotlines than the typical entire novel, but actually ties up and wraps up many of them sufficiently by the end of the book that it frees your imagination to visualize the directions of the characters long after you read it.The sheer momentum of world class intrigue, nations with distinct cultures clashing in contradiction to their own best interests, major players from the past scheming to establish control of the present world in their own unique ways and with character flaws and quirks that consistently work to undermine their efforts; it all makes sense and becomes truly a fulfilling universe to visit after this volume.The politics of the White Tower begin to take on a life of their own, with Min feeling the brunt of some of it and with her own special gift revealing more than a handful of nuggets you expect to see come up in later volumes. The techniques Jordan uses to describe the nuances of each character and relationship not only begin to develop their own feel, but make every move and every frustration that much more realistic and enjoyable. The characters are believable precisely because they screw up, people misunderstand, funny things happen that seem almost corny taken out of context but are more realistic because of it.Rand has to go through his trial of temptation in the desert - with writing as 'dry' as the arid land, but you just know it has to be that way...then it explodes into multiple new revelations about much of what it to come. and then Moiraine shows up. Elayne and Nynaeve develop a mutual respect during their adventure in Tanchico, and Nynaeve seems poised to be the one that may take down a particular Forsaken.Every great war leader of natural ability still needs a history of developing the skills that will serve him later, and Perrin is no exception. Jordan begins this journey with some well-written skirmishes in Emond's Field, and portrays the struggles with his acceptance of this role and trying to understand his new wife Faile absolutely brilliantly.One head's-up; although most of the major storylines begun in this volume are resolved in this volume, the characters are only understood well through the context developed in the first three, and many of the sub-plots and scenery are carried directly - as expected - from the previous one which left an especially large volume of activity that carries right through the end of this one. You'll need all four to fully appreciate what Jordan is doing with this world, and you won't be able to put off getting your hands on the next, Volume 5, The Fires of Heaven."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"this is a good book...I actully read it a while ago, and have just purchased for my son...the book was in excellent condition..."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Great Book in a Great series.

The plot, though well conceived, has been made so complicated that reader looses track and well as concentration.At certain places where the story gets interesting, a sudden shift of focus to other sections of the story can boil your blood. An example of it is when the defences of Two Rivers were being strengthened and Perrin had stepped in a new phase of his life, the story suddenly shifts to Tanchico and spoils all the interest that had been developed. This happens many times in the book and is quite irritating.The author seems to be quite Displeased with men, and for unknown reasons a lot of focus is being given to the women of the storyline, with situations if picturised would be rated above 16 and if you include violence, then R with above 18. The feminist qualities and appearances are being constantly highlighted, not just through text but also through characters, such as Avieda's constant bickering of Elayne's beauty in half of the book (though what can we say, she's an Aiel, but author should have taught her some manners).With lots of fantasy about Rheudean and 20% more story than the previous installments, this is a hard to finish book. It is certainly larger than the first 3 books of Harry Potter put together and too tiresome.One thing is for sure. You wouldn't want to read this book more than once :)"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I have read this book for the 4th time now. It is still my favorite one. Robert Jordan knew something very important about people. In fact he knew several important things about people. First, the fact that communication between humans is way less than 50% verbal to nonverbal is explicit in these books. Every twitch of a shaw, every yank of a braid and every \\"not looking so hard he might as well have been throwing rocks\\" is a snapshot in the lives of these charagters and you and I. And even though you may not care that every little nuance is there, someone is watching and that is the point isn't it? These guys and girls are growing up in this book. Well they are growing in different directions which once again proves that they are human or maybe that much more real. The girls in girl fashion are going to prove they are grown up if it kills them, the guys are growing in the direction the pressure bends them. (or not) Matt (failure to launch comes to mind) is stuck, Rand is growing sideways, without nurturing and in his self imposed isolation becoming harder than a stone spire, Perrin reminding us how important luck is. (not a pun)These books are rich in substance and meaning if you know where and how to look. Some people that I know have stared at me when I have pointed out that there is humor in these books and there is you know. I suspected from the first time I read Eye of the World that Jordan had an epic tale to tell and this book proved it beyond a Shadow of a doubt. This book validates the fact that these people, willing or reluctant, scared or brave are in it to the end. They do as we all would like to do when they deliver a great blow against evil or create catastrophe for those who hurt the innocent. The lines between good and evil and right and wrong were not so blurred in Jordan's time and for nostalgia freaks such as myself it is like a bath in a cool spring (or Winespring) listening to the good people of the Two Rivers regale their values that would be unrecognizable to many people in the world today. I could not live with all thier values but it is good to at least read about even fictional characters that have some. Thanks Mr Jordan."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Shadow Rising is book 4 of 14 in The Wheel of Times series. The Shadow Rising had just been released when I began reading The Wheel of Time series (wow, that really dates me). The end of book 3 marks an inflection point in the series. The Shadow Rising is where The Wheel of Time, for better or ill, breaks free of the fetters of stories limited to a single book and truly becomes epic. It is considered by many to be the best book in the series. I was thrown off by the lack of the kind of closure provided by the first three books in the series at the time I originally read it, but with the benefit of now having all but the final volume I can better appreciate The Shadow Rising.Plot threads no longer diverge and converge within a single volume. Instead, there are three main plot threads, each with a satisfying climax. The Shadow Rising is the first book in the series to fully feature Mat as a main character, fulfilling the potential he shows as a character in book 3. Perrin also really gets to shine. Only his role in book 13 compares.Romance is not one of Jordan's great strengths, but I believe he does it here, specifically in the first third of the book, better than anywhere else in the series. The roots of romance have had time to begin to flower, and the divergence of plot creates an easy tension for Jordan to exploit for drama, and most of the tics that will grate so on so many readers later on are still fresh.The \\"Scouring of the Two Rivers,\\" one of the few remaining direct analogues to The Lord of the Rings that remains at this point in the series, is a great plot thread in its own right, but it only tells us something about each of the characters from Two Rivers. We see what aspect of their personality causes them to choose to stay, and what aspect cause the lone character to return to do so.The Shadow Rising heavily features the Aiel, a pastiche of Bedouin, Zulu, and Native American cultures. They are, along with the Seanchan, one of two great \\"exotic\\" cultures created by Jordan. The two mystical Rhuidean sequences are among the best in the entire series.The Shadow Rising is notably for having perhaps the worst print cover and perhaps the best e-book cover.Supergirls \`It's a Trap!'

That compares Robert Jordan to anyone who's ever made a splash in what used to be the fantasy pool. From Burroughs, Howard and Tolkien through Brooks, Eddings and Donaldson up to Goodkind, Salvatore and Sanderson. Stephen King singlehandedly reinvented the horror genre by updating the archaic nightmares of Poe and Stoker; left to his own devices Robert Jordan breathed likewise new life into an endangered species called fantasy whose heretofore chief revenue draw, sub-genre stepchild sword & sorcery, died a shuddering death in the marketplace almost 15 years earlier. Thanks to Jordan's innovative casting off the limiting space constraints of a mere trilogy and pioneering the truly epic idea of a long series of long books, that once semi-exclusive fantasy pool is now an ocean brimming with long series' of long books. Which may not be such a good thing.THE SHADOW RISING is a good thing though, great in fact. Rand's back in a lead role aided and abetted by the Aiel and Avientha; Mat gets a scratchy throat visiting an eerie nether-world in the desert; Perrin's engrossing return to Two Rivers unfolds; and Nynaeve and Thom are always a lively pairing of Jordan's cast of players. Besides, speedy transportation via portal stone tunnel is still in fashion, not those teleporting windows that open like a TV coming on.At this point in the series, one of its highest highs, what's not to like?"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Oh, Robert Jordan - you so clever! Completely subverting the pattern established in previous three books, are you? Instead of the book comprising several parties journeying across the known world and converging for some major battle where one of the Forsaken is destroyed, people split up, go separate ways, make their journeys in moment or at most days that barely take a few pages to describe, spend their time establishing themselves in the culture in which they've arrived, and the ending battles kind of don't really resolve too much and end up with the Forsaken enemy as Rand's tutor. Now I'll have no idea what to expect in the next book!The Good: Subverting the pattern here was definitely a good idea; a fourth example of \\"the plot\\" would have been too much. Jordan returns to the Two Rivers we saw so briefly at the beginning of the first book, and defies the adage that the prophet cannot return to his home town - Perrin does quite well by himself there, and Emond's Field is as fun to read as a battlefield as they were the quaint touchstone of fantasy normalcy. For that matter, Matt continues to grow as an interesting character, and we return to seeing Rand frequently, and as someone worth seeing that frequently.The Bad: Could Nynaeve be more insufferable? Or Egwene, for that matter? Or any of the women? Or the men, too? Okay, so by this time almost all of the characters are caricatures of stubbornness, of handling their own affairs poorly but knowing how to meddle best in others', in driving drama due to emotional stupidity. In other words, they're kind of like me, and like most everybody who has drawn breath, but that doesn't make it fun to read. It's so frustrating!The Takeaway: Another solid novel; I barely finished reading this one before I was a quarter of the way into the next."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"One of the best in the Wheel of Time series. His fantastical world and its characters are as big as Robert Jordan is verbose. But take your time and enjoy walking, fighting, loving, and talking with his characters in this world. You always want to come back. Will not make sense without starting with the first novel though."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Shadow Rising . . . the longest book in the entire Wheel of Time series, along with Lord of Chaos, and perhaps the best installment yet in this epic series.As with the Dragon Reborn, the plot is divided across three primary threads. This time, however, Rand has come back into the limelight and taken one of those. He heads off to the Aiel waste with Moiraine, Egwene, and Mat. In the second thread, Nynaeve and Elayne journey to Tanchico to continue their quest to thwart the Black Ajah. In the third, Perrin Aybara returns to the Two Rivers with Faile, Loial, Gaul, and several Maidens of the Spear. In the fourth, Min is at the tower, where she witnesses some seismic events in the tower's history.Of the characters, Perrin has the most individual POV, but the largest portion of the book is spent on Rand's thread, which is dominated by Rand himself but also contains the POVs of each of his major companions. Min's portion of the book was, thankfully, the smallest.Of these three, I enjoyed Rand's the most. The other two major ones were definitely good, but both got a little side-tracked at times. Min is far from high in my opinion, but at least she wasn't given more than a minor amount of page-time.In terms of character development, The Shadow Rising proves to be even better than the first three books. The best of it all has to be Rand's character interaction with Elayne and Egwene. I stated in my review of The Dragon Reborn that the scene where Rand pwns Egwene was the best. Well, an even better scene was served up in the chapter \\"Playing with Fire\\" where Rand matches Channeling with Egwene and Elayne. Then there's the following chapter \\"Hard Heads\\" which was just as awesome.The plot has an excellent premise and resolution, though it tends to drag a bit in the middle. The earliest and latest parts of this book and indisputably the best. I really, really liked the ending of TSR. We get a lot of plot points tied up, some very intense action scenes, and Rand's Channeling makes a quantum leap into the next level.Jordan's worldbuilding is also at it's best in this book. We really start to see the finer points of the magic-system in this book, and Rand's powers are(thank the Creator) growing stronger and more developed in every book.With every book that passes, however, the women of the Wheel of Time seem to become more and more annoying, and not just Nynaeve either. Aviendha(sp?), Egwene, and even Moiraine have turned on the power in this regard. I applaud Rand's stoic tolerance at being able to be around those three without tearing his hair out.The women aren't the worst, however. The character that really blew it for them in my opinion is none other than Thom the Gleeman. Previously, I'd thought him to be a pretty good character, albeit one that was unnecessarily kept alive and dragged through a plot he didn't have much involvement in. However, in the chapter \\"A Cup of Wine\\" my opinion of Thom promptly took an express elevator ride down to the sub-basement of the despised.All in all, the Shadow Rising is an excellent book, another great work in an awesome series, one that I, as always, fully recommend.4.5 stars."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"As you can see, \\"The Wheel of Time\\" is a colossal fantasy series. Each volume is over 600 pages long (except the prequel New Spring), the details are vastly complex, & the characters are many. And it's addictive, at least sometimes. It's really hard to understand what's going on if you read the fifth volume or the seven volume first, so you'd have to start way back in the beginning with The Eye of the World. I started reading this series back in 2003, and continued on with the story ever since. Being the first volume in the series to exceed over 900 pages, The Shadow Rising is considered one of the more important and enticing volumes, and I tend to agree. It contains important background information from some of the major characters, and it reveals more about the world that the late Robert Jordan had created. Some of the details are fuller, and the characters are more carefully thought out. We also get to see some stronger character development from some of the characters (and that's a strong point since Crossroads of Twilight didn't have ANY).Picking up where the third volume has left off, Rand al'Thor has discovered in the country of Tear that he is the Dragon Reborn. And now he, along with his friends, must go to the Aiel Waste and see to the Aiel (People of the Dragon). Meanwhile, Perrin Aybara, a friend of Rand, decides to go to The Two Rivers to defend his home against Trollocs and Whitecloaks (Children of the Light). With the help of Faile (his female friend) and Loial (his Ogier companion), he travels West, away from Tear. In the Two Rivers, Perrin leads the people against the Trollocs while building an uneasy truce with the Whitecloak Dain Bornhald, who believes that Perrin has killed his father and now wants him arrest and held as a Darkfriend. But it doesn't stop there! Nynaeve and Elyne travel to the dangerous city of Tanchico to stop members of the Black Ajah and bring them to the White Tower (in Tar Valon) for justice. Thom the gleeman, Juilin the thief-catcher, and Bayle Domon the sea captain assist them during their journey. In Tar Valon, Min is disguised Elmindreda to avoid being questioned by Elaida, who is starting to see some connection between her and Amyrlin Seat.I did have a few problems with this book. Some characters had a very 2-dimensional tendency (such as Ordeith and Couladin), while others felt very forced when it came to their personalities (such as Nynaeve and Aviendha). Aviendha was especially annoying as she kept taunting Rand about Elayne, whom he loves. The Trollocs were written as if they were only distractions. They could've been given at least a more believable appearance, instead of being seen as mindless maniacs who are looking for nothing but human flesh. As seen in the earlier books, we see the continuing romance between Nynaeve and Lan. I don't see how this really works. It's as if Jordan was compelled to add just one more subplot to a few add more pages to the story. I didn't really see any connection between them. The minimal amount of foreshadowing must've ruined it for me. I also didn't see any connection between Rand and Elayne. So he's the Dragon Reborn. Does that directly make him your future husband? Yet another problem I had with this book was something from the writing itself. I've seen the words \\"seem\\" and \\"seemed\\" many times here, and it got irritating when I was in the second half of the book.But alas, the good outweighs the bad. Jordan's writing continues to amaze me. I have never seen so many details since Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Information about the Aiel and the Black Ajah is made interesting. I especially found the Aiel a very compelling race of people; they sound like they're from the Middle East and Northern Africa. And what can I say about their sense of humor? They humor is twisted! And let's not forget about the cast of characters. Each are highly distinctive, and are unforgettable. Rand al'Thor, Egwene al'Vere, Mat Cauthon, Moiraine Damodred, Siuan Sanche, Loial, Rhuarc, Dain Bornhald, and Egeanin are just a few of the many that really stand out. Some may be annoying at times (Nynaeve and Luc, for instance), but at least they're given a good purpose.This year and last year, I started to reread the entire \\"Wheel of Time\\" series. After a second reading, I've come to admire this series much more (though I have no idea how I'll feel about Crossroads of Twilight when I reread that one). The Great Hunt and The Shadow Rising are just two of my favorites. I'm hoping to finish the eleventh volume (Knife of Dreams) by this November, when the next volume (written by Brandon Sanderson) is being sold in bookstores.Grade: A-"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book still haunts me. My original impression at the end was thatthis was my least favorite of the series. The Great Hunt and TheDragon Reborn left me thirsting for action, and this book deliverssome action, but it is well-spaced and well-intentioned, unlike thatin The Dragon Reborn, which was all over the place. The Shadow Risingis, on the other hand, a big, long plodding epic with great twists andturns, and great glimpses into the workings of the world where ittakes place. This is a very emotional book: many of the charactershave their worlds turned right upside down and things are verydifferent at the end than they are at the beginning.For specifics, Rand sees right into the Age of Legends in one verypowerful set of scenes, and it was not what I expected at all. Mat'swhole outlook on life changes in a set of scenes that are not veryWoT-esque at all, and some critical changes in the White Tower changethe tone of the story forever (even though this only occupies a fewpages, it is critical to the story).Furthermore, we see the intricacies of Aiel culture quite thoroughly,which is very interesting. It turns out, of course, that the Aiel,their origins and their peculiar culture are critical to understandingthe themes of the story. Perrin returns to the Two Rivers andeverything there changes, in a place that seems like it would neverchange (another great theme).I have to recommend this book: I found certain passages so moving thatI have marked them in my copy and re-read them several times beforefinishing the book (and afterward). The title is appropriate: this isa dark book where the outlook at the end is rather bleak for all thecharacters, and the world has changed dramatically. It's reminiscentof The Empire Strikes Back in that respect."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is the point at which I became more involved and more replused by the Wheel of Time series. (Does Love-Hate sound familiar to anyone here? Anyone?). If you are reading this, you have either read this far, or have just finished and are seeing what other people thought. Either way, no plot spoilers needed.The characters are separated into four groups as other revewers have discussed. The book gets more involved as Jordan decides to further develop his second line of characters. However, it starts to have a Sunday afternoon mini series feel.Main things this book does well1) Doesnt leave it to Rand to save everyone2) Gives some of the other characters (Perrin, Nyaeneve, Elayne, Thom) room to breathe and develop3) Has a better handle on the action sequences (not just 100 pages of Inns and smalltalk followed by 2 pages of action)4) The dream sequence in Rhudean is pretty awesome5) Nice return to the Two Rivers (Tolkien-feel) environment6) Dramatic last 200 pages (first time I have been unable to put the book down since end of book 2)Main things this book does poorly1) Terrible opening 200 pages in Tear (esp the discussions between Elayne, Egwene and Rand)2) Lot of stuff you never wanted to know about the Aiel3) Moiraine's character role is getting weaker, as is Lan's, Mat's4) Faile (although better than book 3)5) Far too many redundant second layer characters6) Poor English paragraphs more frequent7) Blatant rip-off of various Dune book aspects (which I wouldn't mind in of itself, borrowing is perfectly acceptable in fantasy, but not taking a crisp concept for a people and watering it down to the point where we even get to know things about their society that we wouldn't even know-or care- about our own.

Don't know for sure yet but will find out!"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The fourth book in The Wheel of Time is chock full of detail about people, places, societies and plots. As far as I'm concerned, this is where the series really departs from just another, albeit exceptional, fantasy series. The amount of detail in the world is mind-boggling. Every character -- even those you thought were only in that one scene back in book one -- has a purpose and every society is so intricately thought out that it is literally hard to remember that this place was invented by some guy.Sometimes the plot in this volume is a little slow as action gives way in favor of information. However, some of the action is the best yet. Perrin's return to the Two Rivers is particularly affecting and the climactic battle scene there is so moving that I actually cried.I was also glad to see Mat coming into his own. From humble beginnings as an annoying sidekick, he is starting to have experiences that make him one of the most interesting characters in this book.Another fine job by Robert Jordan!"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Wheel of Time is probably the best-known and most widely read fantasy series other than The Lord of the Rings.When The Eye of The World was published in 1988 or 1989, it created a sensation -- a tremendous first volume that had the usual good-evil battle and tons of action but also was filled with magic, history, politics, sociology, cultural background and realistic characters. When I re-read the first five books, I was amazed at the details of history and politics that Jordan provided in his world. Jordan also has numerous protagonists, not just one or two primary ones like many other fantasy writers.The Shadow Rising continues to feature strong men and, through their magical abilities and powerful personalities, stronger women characters that are a constant feature of the first three books. Jordan has been rightly lauded for the prominent and powerful roles he created for the female characters.The Shadow Rising's overall excellence is part of the reason the first five books in this series became the dominant entry in the fantasy genre by the mid-1990s -- so much so that The New York Times noted that Jordan had come to dominate the genre that Tolkien made famous. In The Shadow Rising, the writing is still smooth, the various characters and their motivations work well, and there's action aplenty. Jordan also produces some outstanding imagery and action and history in the middle portions of the book (concerning the history of the Aiel) that provide tremendous background to the series as a whole.Unfortunately, starting with Lord of Chaos (book 6), Jordan's creation became unwieldy. Instead of concentrating on following the themes and story-threads of books 1-5 (which combined are more than 3500 pages, hardcover), he created new storylines, bogged down the narrative and halted the pace of the epic. Book 8 in particular is an unmitigated disaster -- 650 pages (hardcover) of wheel-spinning (pardon the pun) with almost no progress to the story. Book 9 seemed to have jump-started the narrative once again but reviewers have generally panned book 10; there are likely at least 3 more volumes forthcoming and the series will not be completed until at least 2007.The Shadow Rising is great, as were the previous three and The Fires of Heaven (book five). But narrative stalling and the increasing time intervals between the publication dates of each volume have made the series more frustration than fun."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Who knows if this review will in fact be read (as there are so many), yet none-the-less here goes. I had a little difficulty keeping this one open for the second half (if you believe it, usually the problem lies with the first half)! Don't get me wrong, it's a great read, but the reader HAS to be commited to this series to completely enjoy #4. Mr. Jordan gives us further insight into the characters of Rand and company.Rand is going into the Aiel Waste, to do what HE wants and thinks has to be done (still under the watchful eye of Moraine). For the reader, this (I should say these) section(s)of the novel is/are where the Aiel become more in-depth, including their customs, septs, clans, etc.Perrin... he has his hands full! He hears of Two Rivers being under attack from Trollocs, and decides to go and see what can be done about it. Personally, I feel that the main &quot;chunk&quot; of this novel is about this scenerio (but others may differ).Elayne and Nynaeve are still searching for the Black Ajah, and they get themselves into a big 'ole frying pan there!I won't give away any kind of endings to the scenerios above (as I myself hate that)but I will say that &quot;The Shadow Rising&quot; is by far (hands down, no contest, etc.) the best and most descriptive &quot;chapter in this saga&quot;. Even with the slower parts, it still easily gets five stars! Oh, and the total amount of pages (1008 pages) is including the Glossary (starting at pg984) and the &quot;About the author page), so while yes it is still a high number, don't be too discouraged by that amount of pages...

So it is (rather was) safe to say i assumed this would be very good. Suffice to say I was wrong.First of all this book takes forever to get moving. But then it never really does. Every one of the stories is so long winded. You could take out a third of the chapters for each character and have the same book. Also it just gets so repetitive. All the conversations start to run together. I originally disagreed with reviews that said bashed the childish dialogue but now i completely agree. It is all about how men don't understand women and vice versa.Rand is the main character and i honestly found his story to be the worst. The other ones at least held my interest. Whenever he could be wrapping up or at least moving forward with a story, Jordan just adds characters to slow it down. I really don't know how he got so far off track. i guess it would have been wishful thinking to start a series that is already ten books long and think it never declined. Back to Rands story. This moves slower than any of the other sideplots in the book and the characters just get more frustrating as it goes on. The thing with Egwene and her dreams never really did much for me either. Probably because nine hundred pages from where it started she hadnt improved the least bit.Really all i can say is that Perrin's story was the only compelling thing in the book and the one with the girls was tolerable but Rands was just boring. By the end i was really just reading it to get done. I figured i could get through this series just to say i did it but after this book, which had a promising start, i just dont see that happening, especially when the majority of people didn't like the most recent one. These books also have very slow starts do to all the characters. Somehow unlike the songe of ice and fire series the storylines are more seperate with each individual book. Jordan should learn from him and just have a prologue to explain the newer developments and then pick up right where the last one left off.i have read many books longer than this but this seemed like the longest book i have ever read. By the end i didn't care about the main character at all. Really think it over before deciding to read this."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I Promise: I'm going to be spoiler free.This is the fourth book in the Wheel of Time (WOT) series and the second best in my opinion (#3 \\"The Dragon Reborn\\" is the best in my humble). All of the tenants of excellent fantasy are there. Jordan is a great writer who builds an incredible world with a compelling history. In this book, Jordan gets the balance of history, character, exposition and action right.Shadow Rising is a treasure, but be warned: as of this writing Jordan hasn't finished WOT. By the end of this book, the series is MOVING and you are riding through at a great clip. You cannot WAIT to find out what happens next, so you HAVE to continue. Unfortunately, Jordan doesn't pick up the pace and from here on things start to slow down.My guess is the end of this series isn't going to happen until 2006 (I believe there are going to be 12 books, but I don't think there's an official word).Is it going to be worth it? I don't think so. WOT has gotten very complicated and is becoming turgid. Sometime around Book 6, the action began to crawl. Book 8 (the last one I read) was almost 700 pages and took place over three days! BUT there are those who say there's light at the end of the tunnel. Book 9 is supposed to be head and shoulders above Book 8.Is Robert Jordan the Van Halen of fantasy writers, starting off with a bang then fading off into mediocrity? Or is he the Rush of fantasy writers, high highs and low lows but not giving up and always working on making it better?I've read the first five books twice now beacuse it is too difficult to wait a year between reading books. (And he's coming out with them once every three years at this point!!).My advice is to wait until Jordan's finished them all. The books are complex enought that you are much better off reading them one right after another. Especially since there are books where one or more of the main characters don't even appear!By the time he finishes, we'll know if it was worth the wait.You've been warned!My grade for the series:1. Wheel of Time: A-2. Great Hunt: A3. Dragon Reborn: A+4. Shadow Rising: A+5. Fires of Heaven: A6. Lord of Chaos: B7. Crown of Swords: C+8. Path of Daggars: C9.

The Shadow is rising to cover humankind. In Tar Valon, Min sees portents of hideous doom. Will the White Tower itself be broken? In the Two Rivers, the Whitecloaks ride in pursuit of a man with golden eyes, and in pursuit of the Dragon Reborn. In Cantorin, among the Sea Folk, High Lady Suroth plots the return of the Seanchan armies to the mainland. In the Stone of Tear, the Lord Dragon considers his next move. It will be something no one expects, not the Black Ajah, not Tairen nobles, not Aes Sedai, not Egwene or Elayne or Nynaeve.Against the Shadow rising stands the Dragon Reborn.There are many masters in high fantasy. J.R.R. Tolkien would certainly be lauded highest when it comes to development of the world in which the events he illustrates transpire. Robert Jordan, for all the criticism leveled against him for what appears to be a marketing ploy - stringing the series out as long as humanly possible to generate greater book sales - would certainly have to rank near the top for character development. His series is filled with various interesting folk with varied viewpoints and motivations. While most (decent) authors go well into detail in describing the motivations and quirks of their heroes, Jordan doesn't stop there. Even his villains are thoroughly detailed. Moghidien, for example, one of the wickedest of the fallen, has a history and personality that influences how she reacts, as well as insecurities and frailties. Good, evil, benevolent or malign, all of Jordan's characters are fully fleshed out, and we get a fair view into their minds and motivations as the drama unfolds. Yes, the world is on the simple side, and yes, the plot, of late, has lost its pace; but it's a world and plot filled with only the most fascinating of folks. At a series currently juggling over 50 characters, all unveiled over the last 10 volumes, it's a commendable and laudable feat, indeed.Fans of Jordan's epic series of many volumes of many pages have been whinging since book six that the series seems to have no end in sight. Unfortunately, it's now a race against the clock for Jordan and his publisher, whose decision to prolong the series as long as they have may result in the work never being finished. Ironically, Rand, the hero destined to die on the slopes of the Dragonmount, may outlive his creator. Full sympathies to Jordan, and I, for one, hope he holds out long enough to complete the story he began."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"For many people, The Shadow Rising is the book that hooked them on the series. Rising above the more formulaic aspects of the previous 3 books, TSR introduced a narrative complexity and a palpable sense of history that captured the imagination and humbled the gentle reader. This is where the meat of the series truly begins, where we really are in the thick of it. We've got Rand and the Aiel in Rhuidean, Perrin in the Two Rivers, and Elayne and Nynaeve in Tanchico. We've got secrets and deceptions, action and suspense, surprises and revelations. We've got the history of the Aiel and the making of history in the White Tower. TSR gives RJ a chance to stretch his abilities, and he makes the most of it.We start out where everybody is still catching their collective breaths from the climax of book 3, but the plot soon splinters into 3 distinct parts. Rand attempts to fulfill his Aiel destiny, while Perrin sets off the rescue the Two Rivers. Finally, Elayne and Nynaeve continue to hunt the Black Ajah. Along the way, much effort is spent developing characters, giving protagonists like Elayne and Mat some needed time. As well RJ gives us a glimpse into the Aiel's past, a two-chapter section that I would stand up next to the highlights of any great literary giant with pride. Every thime I read those chapters, I get a marvelous chill down my spine, as if I'm reading the histories of my own people.I still have some nagging questions that threaten to break my mind in two (What was preventing Asmodean from walking into Rhuidean before the ending?)but without question, TSR is the book that vaults RJ into Tolkien's league.PLOTTING: Remarkably, RJ gives all 3 main plot threads about the same amount of attention. He may have been tempted to skimp a bit on the Tanchico thread (when you think about it, not a lot really happened there, at least when compared to the other 2 threads), and he wrapped up the Two Rivers thread a little too quickly, but the narrative was always clear and engaging.CHARACTERIZATION: TSR spends a lot of time building up Elayne and Nynaeve's characters, and of course Perrin gets a third of the book all to himself. I liked Elayne's drinking episode, and Perrin's eventual reaction to the tragic news of his family, but the character that really surprised me and grew a third dimension was Min. Here's a girl who wanted very badly to head down to Tear and find the guy she desperately loved, and when the chaos started in Tar Valon, she had her chance to flee. Instead she stuck around, and help bust Siuan and Leane out of there.PACING:With 3 plot threads, Jordan had the freedom to switch back and forth to keep events from happening too soon, and the narrative moved along so well that he could throw a subplot or two in the mix without missing a beat.BEST SCENE: It has to be the 2-chapter section detailing the history of the Aiel.(I know that's a long scene.)MOST POV: Perrin, Elayne, Nynaeve, Thom, Moiraine, Mat, Rand, Min, Egwene, Egeanin, and even Jaichim Carridin all had thier POVs represented, but this was Perrin's book more than anyone. What's odd is that RJ never used anyone else's POV in the Two Rivers. I guess he wanted to keep Faile and Verin mysterious for the time being.OVERALL: TSR is satisfying, complex, and character-driven. TSR has plenty of scenes that tug at the memory years later, and RJ still trying to match the quality of this effort.P.S. Sorry for my rambling on, and making the review so long. Hope this helps!"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Despite my having only finished to the end of the fifth book ( the last three should arrive monday.. courtesy of amazon.com ) I have found this one thouroughly engrossing.

Without a doubt this is my favorite of the series and I reccommend it to anyone, even though at times it reads like a trashy romance novel.This and the other WOT books, captivated not only my imagination but my life as well. An almost ridiculous compulsion to finish each novel only to pick up the next drawn by the anticipation of &quot;what next?&quot; makes this series, and this novel in particular, a favorite and memorable to the last.I hope those of you who buy this and other books in the series enjoy them as much as I have.

While they do linger a fraction in Tear, the story picks up pace once the group of main characters breaks up into smaller portions. Rand's section is particularly potent with a fabulous insight into Aiel society; most notable is the strength of the plot devices and handling used during the Rhuidean segment. Perrin's inclusion also adds great strength, however, the revelations about the fate of his family perhaps should have affected him more deeply than is evident. The final story arc in the novel is also involving, yet is easily the weakest of the 3 - the ending seems largely full of ease and convenience. The greatest improvements, however, are the adversaries. In contrast to previous novels, they're more 3 dimensional than ever before, without simple black or white agendas.

At a whopping 1,000 pages and just shy of 400,000 words in length, it's also the longest.The Shadow Rising picks up after the events of the third book. Anyway, Rand al'Thor has taken the Sword That Is Not A Sword, Callandor, The Sword Which Cannot Be Touched, The Sword Which Has Too Many Fricking Names, Just Pick One And Stick With It. As a result he has been proclaimed the Dragon Reborn and the nations of Tear and Mayene have sworn loyalty to him. With the evil Forsaken seizing control of other kingdoms across the continent, it appears that Rand has little choice but to go to war against them. Instead, he wrong-foots both his enemies and allies by delivering humanitarian aid to the neighbouring, warring kingdom of Cairhien and travelling into the Aiel Waste, where he hopes to unify the feuding warrior-clans under his leadership. At the same time, his friend Perrin returns home to the Two Rivers, which is under attack by Shadowspawn, and Nynaeve, Elayne, Thom and Juilin head to the distant city of Tanchico in pursuit of the evil Black Ajah, Aes Sedai sworn to the service of the Dark One.This breaking of the narrative into three storylines which proceed simultaneously worked very well for the third volume, The Dragon Reborn, and continues to work well here. Jordan's sometimes sluggish pacing isn't so much of a problem as we flip between events in Tanchico, the Two Rivers and the Waste fairly rapidly, and there's an additional subplot set in Tar Valon which delivers some devastating plot developments on the Aes Sedai front in a very economical manner. The worldbuilding is advanced impressively as we get a decent look at the Age of Legends and the way the world was before and during the War of the Shadow, and character-wise we see some interesting maturing and advancement for the likes of Mat, Nynaeve, Perrin and Rand. Unfortunately, other characters come off badly. Moiraine is inert for a lot of the narrative, and Elayne continues to annoy whilst Aviendha is probably the most irritating character in the series at this point. Also, Jordan's somewhat juvenile views of male-female relations reaches their apex here, with supposedly comedic or ironic musings on the way men and women interact falling very flat indeed. The book also wears its influences strongly, although the mixing of Dune with the Scouring of the Shire is diluted by enough original characters and ideas so it doesn't irritate as much as the first book's nods to Tolkien.The pacing is crisp, the characters and world develop most satisfyingly, and Jordan very cleverly laces some narrative time-bombs into the mix which don't bear fruit for several books, but when they do are all the more satisfying.The Shadow Rising (****) is indeed the best book in The Wheel of Time sequence and impresses as it marks the transition of the books from the 'adventure' phase to the 'political' phase and does so most satisfyingly. The book is published by Orbit in the UK and Tor in the USA."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"'The Shadow Rising' is the fourth book in Robert Jordan's 'Wheel of Time' series. It follows the adventures of Rand, Mat, Perrin and an ever growing number of secondary characters and plot threads. It's a good book, but I'm glad there are websites that give quick summaries of the books in the series, so I can quickly get up to speed on a particular plot thread that was last mentioned briefly two books ago. There is a lot going on and there is no way I would be able to keep it all straight without some kind of help. But with those resources to rely on these books are a lot of fun as you can see things hinted at by Jordan two books ago start to play out now, and you know that some things hinted at now will manifest a couple of books down the line.Knowing that there are seven (soon to be eight?) more books to come is daunting, but let's face it- I've been sucked in and am in it for the long haul."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I've already loved the series in book form.

All this with Aes Sedai and their hidden reasons, Seachan and Children of Light plotting and the Dark One and his minions in the shadows.The story is wraping, the text is fluid and surelly at the end you'll want to read the next book of this saga (Fires of Heaven).I liked it a lot and strongly recommend."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Love this series!! the writing on this series is great!!

The book opens strongly and carries itself for a while but is ultimately unable to sustain its momentum. That being said, Jordan's work here is still better than most authors' best moments. The overall narrative of the series expands into some new areas that leave some intriguing future possibilities. If you're already into the series, this book will satisfy and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The shadow rising is the lengthy continuation of Jordan's vast epic the Wheel of time series. Strangely, although this story was flawed, I found myself really enjoying this one. I think, because the characters behave less like children but more adults (at least most of the time).That said, there are a few things I really don't like.There is something quite artificial about Jordan's view of women in the Wheel of Time Series. He doesn't quite get that women can be just as competitive as men, cruel, heartless, and mean, especially to our own gender.. If we are competing for the same men. we don't become best friends with the competition, discuss hairstyles and clothing tips over tea. Nor do most women think its cool to share a husband and fondly discuss how dumb and predictable men are every 5 minutes. In fact men might be surprised at how little they are actually discussed!I mention this because Jordan has a lot to say about how women act and behave and most of the time its quite a lot of nonsense. If Nynaive and Egwayne do not get along they simply would not spend any time together! If Elayne and Min love the same man they would fight for him. The women bond and coo, and collect friends like Barbies is very strange and unnatural. Its like a man's view of how women act, but its just doesn't ring true.Then lets bring on the uber-raced Aiel. Okay, can we get it... They are stronger, faster, more perfect warriors than anyone else. Not only that they seem to practice poligamy. The perfect guy fantasy. Please. The moment I heard of a red-haired fair-skinned race living in the desert I kept wondering where they kept the sunscreen. The moment the Aiel women begin discussing sister-wives I get the icky feeling that this will be played out between Rand/Min/Elaine in the future... Meh4 stars. Entertaining, but flawed. Jordan might want to tone down the guy-fantasy elements, and the male-bashing clone-women."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"In response to the Publishers Weekly Report. It is a FANTASY EPIC! It is not something you would want to read if you have the patience of a newt. I think the book is awesome and the way he seems to put everything into a cause and effect, helps a lot. Also, Jordan has an amazing sense of detail. More accurate than most history. I love this series and reccomend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"THE SHADOW RISING is my favorite of Robert Jordan's often overblown Wheel of Time series. In it, Jordan gathers together some of the cords he's been flappin' around in the first three books (never mind that he tangles them up again post haste). What sets this one apart as being head and shoulders better than the other nine books in the series is the reader's emotional investment in the characters, especially in Perrin's (a supporting character)desperate defense of his home against a seemingly invincible swarm of adversaries. The series is ponderous enough that I eventually ceased caring very much about what happens to anyone (with the exception of Perrin and his wife, Faile). I suppose I continue to read the series out of momentum: having invested so much reading time in the first few volumes (these books are huge), I don't want not to know how it all ends. Maybe this is what Jordan is counting on, but I wish he'd get on with it. This one, however, I actually re-read with some satisfaction."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I really like the Wheel of Time series thus far-they are captivating books. The characters are, for the most part, interesting, and the plot(s) are well developed and are nicely planned out. However, I do have a few problems with Robert Jordan and the Wheel of Time.I feel like Jordan is dragging on the series a little to long. (Note-I have read the reviews for the fith book onward, though I have not read the books.) Jordan is elaborating much more than is necessary in some points. Basically, I feel like he could have cut a few books.Also, I think that some things are much to coincedential. For instance, I thought that all of those who set out from the Two Rivers meeting in Tear at exactly the same time after being in different coners of the world a little much.However, I think that the books are well-written and fun. In particular, I liked that Rand was involving himself more with the Aiel in this book, that Perrin backtracked to the Two Rivers, where everything started, and how Nynaeve and Elayne realized, inside the Panarch's Palace, that no woman can do everything. All in all, I think that this book and this series, despite some flaws, is truly excellent."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I was wondering whether I should write a review of this book or the fifth one in the series, but then I realized I couldn't remember the difference between them.I can't remember which events took place in which book, and I'm having a hard time even remembering the events themselves. How is it possible to write thousand page novels in which nothing happens, or something happens but seems so insignificant that you can't remember?Actually, most of the Wheel of Time books don't seem like novels at all. There's no three-act structure to be found in them, but really there isn't any plot either. People just run around, do things, run around some more, and never really seem to get anything accomplished. Horribly, it's as if each part of the series is just hacked out of a longer book, some demonic novel that's far worse than any single book in the series.And don't listen to what you hear about how this book deals well with relationships between men and women. Okay, so Tolkien had maybe two major female characters. That's better than what we get here. Do you know what we get? About every two pages a female character will think, &quot;Men! I'll never understand them!&quot; then go and have vague desires towards somebody. Conversely, every two pages a male character will think, &quot;Women! I'll never understand them!&quot; and also have vague desires. Really, that's it. That's the extent of those groundbreaking relationships Jordan constructs.This series was never great, though the first book was better. But I think the concept of a well-planned fantasy land with magic and monsters and an Evil One was what really caught my interest. Unfortunately that interest stayed much too long. Now I can't believe I read so many of these books. So save yourselves!

Jordan had outdoned himself again in this book, as he did in all of the last three and the six or seven to come.As an answer to all of those who complained out there that the book is too long and ask when Jordan will stop writing, look at the back cover. It says clearly that he will only stop in his grave, so ya all have an answer.This book is certainly my best so far after finishing the fire of heaven. With its twisting story lines, real character developement, and good action, not mentioning great discription, make the reader feel right in the book. As many fan do, it almost feal like living in the book once you open it. Well, it earned me a few scowls from my mom who hates me reading more than 5 hours a day.Now, if you need some other series to compare the wheel of time to, Dune by Frank Herbert is pretty good. Rand is so much like Paul and Ase Sedai as Bene Gesserit it's not even funny. What does this suggest, copying? Mmmmm......Any way, another thing I find intersting about the Wheel Of Time is that the world and its magic can be explained by Physics if you really think about it. The one power appears to be a better gravitational controll, and so on.Another interesting fact, every one seems to like Perrin. Flip through a couple of reviews is enough to prove it. Personally, I wouldn't disagree. Rand is almost mad and Mat always off chasing girls not mentioning inapropriate comment and no brain. Perrin apears to be the only one in the book who is good, and think. He is kind of nicer than others too.Yah, hope ya like it."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I loved this book!

By the time I came to the end of this massive 1001 page volume, only one question remained: Why can't this man learn when to stop? And to think that this novel is just one *small* part of the full series! Alas, at least 500 of the pages within contained very entertaining and well-developed high fantasy. The way Jordan deals with Mat and Perrin is particularly good (though Mat's sections were much better in &quot;The Dragon Reborn&quot;). Beyond the problem of needlessly excessive length, Jordan's writing suffers another crippling flaw--The author knows how to write only ONE female character: the beautiful and stubborn girl who thinks males are &quot;goat-brained&quot; or &quot;harry lumoxes,&quot; and spends most of her waking hours ranting about how stupid they are. Hmmm. This silly sketch comprises the whole of 90% of Jordan's female characters, and makes for very dull reading indeed. In fact, Jordan spends an inordinate amount of time in this book writing about the clash between the sexes. Warning: It's terrible. It's boring. It will make you want to rip the pages from the book. You will wish the letters in the name &quot;Faile&quot; had never been invented. Otherwise, the book contains, as said before, some compelling high fantasy.

I'm working my way back through it in anticipation of A Path of Daggers. I don't read each book anymore in all-night, can't-put-it-down seiges. Rather, they are like good wine - consume it slow and enjoy it. Shadow Rising is terrific. The story disperses the key players to different places to carry out important tasks. Perrin goes back to the Two Rivers which has come under attack by Darkfriends and White Cloaks. His tale is a central part of the book, and it's exciting and poignant.On other fronts, Rand is playing a high stakes game in the Aiel Waste, and he seems to be an able strategist. But, so many people want to harm him or to use him to get something special that he begins to withdraw into himself. Mat, travelling with Rand, continues to have the strangest things happen to him. We get to know more about Elayne, as she and Nynaeve pursue the Black Ajah to Tanchico. She becomes one of my favorites.If you haven't got into this series, give it a try.

Make no mistakes i am a fan of fantasy in its better forms such as \\"The Lord od the Rings\\" and the like, however Robert Jordan seems to be paid by the word. The story spirals into a mess which by all accounts is going to take another eight books to complete.

Perrin's relationship with Faile improves and it turns romantic at some points.Robert Jordan is able to write stories that are not just good, they're addicting! There like soap operas, they suck you in and never let you go. The same happens while reading the Wheel of Time series. The characters develop wonderfully and they all grow into seperate plot threads and then at the end of each book, they all meet with a big kabang. Jordan is famous for his wonderful endings like never leave you completely disappointed.I would recommend this book series to anyone who loves to read books that take you off to a new world.

Jordan can write, I will give him credit for that, but after so many, many pages his flaws and frailties become far to noticable...and ingratiating. I found myself hating some of the phrases and mannerisms so much that the story was all but chased from my mind.It all starts well, and after taking the time to work with the story you find yourself hooked and the pages fly by. At first Moraine and Lans distain are justified, he is reclusive and she is feared by most...not making them very polite and socialable people. But soon, every other person adopts this behavior and everyone is fighting everyone constantly. They act more like children than the adults they are supposed to be.Someone said that Jordan was sexist. I am not sure I agree with this, but he is certainly childishly portraying the interaction between men and women. Men are bumbling idiots that can't hold their own against the amazing intellect of women and women can't stand men at all (except to use them). In fact, I was ecstatic when Rand finally turned his powers on the females, they had become so annoying.Also, I couldn't keep things straight with Rand. His character cartwheels between attitudes and personalities like the weather. I should say Jordan is doing a good job portraying his descent into madness, no one can make any sense of him.Perrin's in the only charachter that I found myself tolerating, and if the books were based on him, not Rand, Egwene, the Aes Sadi, etc. I may have finished the series."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I am about to start reading the series for the third time and look forward to reading this book more than any of the others (although the seventh one comes pretty close.) Of course Perrin is great in this book, and for the first time, the reader can really get a good look at his character and his ta'avereness. Rand has changed to become much harder since we've last seen him at the beginning of the Dragon Reborn, and his dealings with the complex culture of the aiel are fascinating. Mat as always, is great, and provides a light tone to parts of the book. Also, unlike some of the later ones in the series, I actually really like the Nynaeve and Elayne subplot in this book. It is interisting, complex and has a fast pace.Overall, there is a lot of good action in this book, the plot takes a few directions you wouldn't have suspected and there is a lot of character development for some of the previously more vague people. Please ignore all the idiots who were put off by this book because it was so long, or these annoying people whining about how Robert Jordan is a male chauvenist pig.

Jordan has done it again! Once again the reader is treated to a wonderful tapestry of fantasy and adventure woven by the words of Robert Jordan. Here we see our main character(s) continuing on their journey fated to them ever since they left their small town three books ago. I just got done reading this book and am so exhilirated it is unbelievable. I would never have thought that a book could do this to me. I found myself rushing to get to the next page, the next chapter to find out what happened next. It was GREAT! I loved every moment of it. I don't know how Jordan does it but he has written the best series of books that I have ever read, and I am sure he will continue to do so until the stunning conclusion of &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;. The only negative aspect I found in this book was that I had a hard time keeping up with all of the different names of the Aiel. Including their septs and titles as well as customs. The book as a whole however was so amazing that it was almost an insignificant problem. I can't wait to read the next book! I would really like to hear from other Jordan fans out there so drop me a line. It is always nice to talk to people with the same interests as me"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"In all my years of reading, never have I come across a book so terrible that I had to put it down. Always, there was some redeeming quality to it; some last lingering urge to finish it and see it through. I am not one to give up easily. I give all things a chance no matter how bad they seem.That is why I read \\"The Great Hunt\\" when I absolutely loathed \\"The Eye of the World\\". And found myself thoroughly surprised at how much better TGH was. When I read \\"The Dragon Reborn\\" I thought, 'If Jordan could focus more on his well-developed, interesting male characters and less on his females, he's got a fan!'Sadly, that is not the case with \\"The Shadow Rising\\".The book starts off with the same style of TGH and TDB (books #2-3). For about 2 chapters, I was quite pleased that I was holding book #4 in my hands after a week of no Jordan. However that quickly changed due to one thing: Jordan cannot write women.Why does Jordan feel that in order to create strong female characters, they must all be beautiful, haughty, challenging, petty and immature? How many times can one woman cross her arms under her breasts and glare at another? Whether it's Nynaeve snapping at Moiraine, Elayne snapping at Nynaeve, Egwene glaring at Nynaeve...They are all incredibly annoying.As if that is not enough, these under-developed female characters are each linked to at least one male character; I happen to like all the male characters. Nynaeve, for example, is romantically linked to Lan, the Warder. Why? Where on earth did this romance come from? Are we supposed to gasp with delight when Lan storms into a room and sweeps Nynaeve off her feet for a kiss? She is petty, short-tempered and mean, and carries a grudge against Moiraine that has no founding. He is barely conceivable as a person. As a friend put it, the old \\"Petulant Ice Queen somehow wooing the attentions of the strong, noble king\\" is one of the weakest, not to mention most clich&eacute;d, foundations for a romance ever laid.Jordan either knows very little about women or else knows very little about writing them. It is more than possible to create a strong female who is not young and pretty as Elayne, Egwene, Nynaeve, Min and Faile are. It is possible to show that they are strong without having them be defiant or quarrelsome. It is possible to show their passion for their ideals without having them \\"bristle with anger\\" anytime someone disagrees with them. I found myself continuously wondering if Jordan thinks all men perceive women this way; or just him.I think it is wonderful that Jordan has found a way to have equal male and female roles. I, however, would take the few strong and truly admirable heroines that Tolkien created (Galadriel, Eowyn, Melian) than these dozens of under-developed, catty women.I stopped reading this series, as well, because of the excess in descriptive words. Jordan needs to realize that over-doing it with the descriptions does not equal a richly portrayed world. Quality, man, not quantity. There are only so many descriptions of inns and common rooms, fireplaces and swords, arrows nocked and people sighing, a person can take. Two pages devoted to describing the shores of Tear don't make me any more excited about reading the book. I have seen ships before. Next time, perhaps he should concentrate on describing scenic beauty. That requires actual writing talent.Readers who think Jordan exceeds Tolkien are thoroughly misguided and I pity them. I am quite glad the professor is not alive to see his work being compared to that of an amateur, self-indulgent man such as Jordan who thinks his pseudo Olde Englishe, his over-the-top descriptions, his unnecessarily lengthy glossaries and his painfully under-developed female characters place him in the leagues of the fantasy greats. Jordan will never have the skill of prose that Tolkien had, nor will his series ever touch readers the way \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" did. However, if he cultivates his writing abilities and exchanges the excess description for better characterization, his series might earn some of the longevity reserved for the real great works of fantasy literature."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I got into this series of books a couple of months ago and each book is better than the last."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Note I read this on the smaller gray 2nd-gen kindle. The maps are pretty much unreadable because of the contrast ratio or not being optimized for the screen. A minimum of formatting issues in this one.As I have stated in my other reviews I find the strict adherence to the plot formula a little annoying. I mean it's not like it's network TV or something. It's not like Jordan had to account for commercial breaks and a strict budget or something. For instance as in books 2 and 3 all the characters stay exactly where they were for the first 25% or so of the book. There were maybe two action sequences in that time and the rest was just summarizing the plot and re-introducing the universe. And fretting about where they'd go next. Finally all the characters started leaving to their various destinations around the 31% mark. It is great motivation to get through the first third as quickly as possible.Assuming a \\"major plot line\\" is defined by number of chapters dedicated to it there were three major plot lines and a forth relatively minor plot line. Of those I enjoyed Perrin's story the most, probably because some action stuff seemed to happen with some regularity. He's like if some one combined Forrest Gump with General Patton. As in \\"woops, I'm a general\\".I'm not trying to imply I want ONLY action. It's just hundreds of pages of riding horses and talking, staying some place to camp and talking followed by more horse riding and...talking...gets a little dull after a while. So a Trolloc invasion every so often is a fun change of pace, albeit rare.The Tanchico stuff I just found long and plodding. I just tried to get through it as quick as I could to get back to Perrin.Rand's tale was a slightly more interesting than Tanchico but I still found it on the dull side.As some point I thought I knew how Perrin's tale would end up as it would have been a perfect re-intro into the story for the next book. But I was way off. Probably. I haven't started five yet.The last chapter I actually didn't see coming at all. I wasn't sure how it would end but I wasn't really expecting that ending.I've always thought there were some passing similarities with this series and star wars: a chosen one, special sword from his father, a \\"Darth Vader\\" type of villain. And actually a perfect Han Solo and...well maybe I shouldn't compare Perrin to Chewie even if Perrin is large and harry and in a matter of speaking talks with wolves. The only thing missing is some sort of Yoda-like figure to teach Rand. Maybe in book 5!I remember wondering what happened to Min in my last review. She was in the first couple chapters of book 3 and then disappeared. Well she showed up in the first chapter of this book as a way to re-introduce the The Tower. Her's was the forth plot line I mentioned: at least she played some part this time around and not insignificant. I don't know why I like her so much.One thing I have noticed about these books: no curse words other than \\"she muttered an oath\\", only subtle alluding to sex with phrases like \\"a good cuddle\\" and even the evil seems to have some kind of black-and-white feel to it (no gray areas or ambiguity in the good vs evil, you're one or the other.). But some how tobacco smoking seems perfectly acceptable, which is fine with me but seems some how in contrast with the last 15 years or so. It's like this book is out of a different era. Personally I find it refreshing. When I'm done with this series I'll be reading \\"A Game of Thrones\\" which from what here is about as opposite of this as a series can get.Conclusion:Despite what may seem like complaints above I actually did enjoy this book for what it is and will be reading the next book albeit after a break. I only knocked a star off because of the strange procedural-like formula Jordan seems to insist upon and because parts of it are just agonizing to get through. The great parts, I feel, balance it out."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"It has been a while since I didn't read something so well written, not since the original Dune series by Frank Herbert and Lord of the Rings by Tolkien. The complexity of these novels is astounding; its characters and their world seem so real. I recommend Wheel of Time as the greatest fantasy series of all time. TSR is better than TDR and the scenes describing the Aiel story and the Emmond's Field Battle are the best of the saga so far."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Despite the fact that the extremely famous Wheel of Time series seems to have lost some popularity with fans by the 10th book, this is a good epic (at least for the first 4 books I've read so far). Just like Tolkien allegedly created his world to explore the various invented languages, so too it seems that one of the motivations behind Jordan's creation is to suggest how mythology is born, lived and forgotten. As a result, the Wheel of Time world is centred on the idea of the revolving wheel where the succession of ages, is circular. The series contains a very well thought out universe and mythology as well as interesting characterisation and good writing. I don't really consider fantasy a favourite genre but this series has been good at least in the beginning.This fourth book contains many good parts that I enjoyed - the description of the history of the Aiel and their insanely harsh world, the mysteries of Rhuidean and some of the investigations in Tanchico. However, much of the book is spent in Rand-space - waiting for Rand to decide what to do, looking for Rand, Rand moping etc etc. This seems to go on for a few hundred pages and the tidbits of information in the midst of all this just aren't enough to stop the mind from wandering.These faults (which are basically the same in the previous book) largely spoil what could have been a much punchier continuation of the saga."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Shadow Rising an especially pleasing book, and better, I would say than any of the first three. The scenes on Perrin and Faile are the best, I like how Jordan has managed to effectively potray their thoughts and feelings and thus, enhancing their personality. Jordan's advance into love between Perrin and Faile is also nice and steady without the usual rush to immediate smooching and such (as movies and some books tend to.) Nynaeve and Elayne's parts are good too, progressing steadily into the story, yet Rand and Egwene's parts are too long-winded, especially the part when Rand takes up the feelings of his anestors. The switching from one ancestor to another is too long and frustrating after a while, making me wonder when it will end. (Not having it go so far back maybe better.) The desert part isn't too well-written too. But overall, it is a good read which will at times thrill the reader."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Wheel of Time series never ceases to tire of its incredulous and interesting change of events.

Rand al' Thor is the Dragon Reborn and in Robert Jordan's fourth book, the Shadow Rising, he will face hardships like none other.This story weaves peoples lives in a magnificent tapestry. The story shifts back and fourth between a number of people as they share the same problems and the problems of their friends. Rand al' Thor, Matrim Cathon, and Perrin Aybara are taveren, people that bend the pattern of an age around them. Rand is fighting against the Power and Mat is trying to help him while Perrin is trying to free their homeland from Children of the Light and Shadowspawn.Overall this books weaves the pattern of these three lives into a tapestry. They all face troubles that none but themselves can face. This book and series are among the best I've ever read."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"After slowing noticably in &quot;The Dragon Reborn&quot;, Robert Jordan regains the pace, and my interest in the series, in &quot;The Shadow Rising&quot;. After struggling through &quot;Dragon&quot;, I found &quot;Shadow&quot; to be much more enjoyable to read.There are many subplots going on at the same time in this book. Rand, having declared himself the Dragon Reborn by removing Callandor from Tear, is trying to decide on what his next move will be. Ultimately, he decides that there should be a conference of all the Aiel clan chiefs, so he proceeds to the city of Rhuidean, where he learns about the Aiel customs and practices, albeit in a rather strange manner.Dain Bornhald, captain of the Children of the Light (Whitecloaks), is determined to avenge the death of his father, Geofram. Dain believes that Perrin is responsible for the death of his father, so he leads his Children to the Two Rivers, home of Perrin, Mat, and Rand, where he is determined to face off against Perrin.Elayne and Nynaeve are still pursuing the elusive Black Ajah, led by Black Aes Sedai Liandrin. Their journey, where they discover the strange &quot;Sea Folk&quot;, takes them to the town of Tanchico, where their search continues. They are determined to find the Black Ajah before the Black Ajah can spring their trap they have prepared for Rand.At the White Tower, rebel Aes Sedai, lead by Eladia, have overthrown Amyrlin Seat Siuan Sanche and stilled her. Forced to flee the White Tower, Siuan, Min, and Leane set out into the wilderness. How long will Siuan live? Most Aes Sedai who are stilled don't live very long, but Siuan is determined to gain revenge on Eladia and her allies.The only complaint I have about this book, and the reason for four stars, is the number of new characters that Jordan introduces. There are so many now that I've found it hard to remember who everyone is, except for the characters that have appeared in all of the books so far. However, I did think this book got the ball rolling again after book three's let down. Let the Wheel of Time continue to turn."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I must say that I find the lack of REALL praise for this book rather upsetting. Robert Jordan is an excellent writer in nearly every aspect, and from a writers point of view (meaning me), I envy Jordan's creativity and foresight.In Shadow Rising some may complain it moves too slow, that he focuses to much on the thoughts and small actions of each character. My friends, it is called Character Development. While some may believe the characters should have been developed and made by the first book, it is far from the reality of actualy and SMART writting. Rand and his companions are changing drasticaly, especial Rand himself, and Jordan did an excellent job of helping us follow these changes.As for confusing plot lines..... if you can't handle it, don't read it. I found the plot (s), entiricate and fasinating, some of the most &quot;boring&quot; parts of Jordan's writing usualy come back with a twist at another point, he's shown this time and again, and I've learned to pay close attention. The writing is colorful and demands concentration, its a book that while it has lots of action, displays other part of the characters lives and personalitys, which in my oppinon, makes it more realistice and belivable.I believe The Shadow Rising is just as well written and worth reading as the three novel's before it, and I recomend it to anyone who loves a good and thriving fantasy novel. And if you have to spend a little extra time reading the slower parts, Jordan always rewards you in the end."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I wont write any spoilers,so feel free to read this.. :)The Wheel of Time spins,and weaves the lives of our heroes..I like the fact that they are gaining in Power..When I played ADND I never liked low level characters,and I was always anxious to grow..The heroes grow in power here..And at last Mat shows some of his ..Rand is as always talking to himself,thinking,plotting,not trusting anyone etc..The chapters in Rhuidean are truly masterfully written.I like the fact that the Forsaken show some intelligence (well,not all of them..but Lanfear does..)I dont like the fact that they have no apparent purpose in their evilness..It is as a previous reviewer wrote a \\"I ll take the world cause it is there\\" story..anyway..Now to the ever present most annoying feature for me:The women!Ok,I ve actually met some women that act like Nynaeve,or Aviendha,or Egwene..BUT NOT ALL OF WOMEN..If I lived in this world I would surely take oaths of celibacy ,and become a monk in order to avoid them..They b&^$h and nag all the time.Aviendha especially this time takes the trophy of \\"Bi%ch of the milennia\\" from Nynaeve's hands..She expects Rand to respect and act according to an honor code he hasnt ever heard of..And he gives him hard time for not acting as he \\"should\\" ..The book is not a page turner..It took me a month to read while the previous,only 3 days at most each..It [isn't horrible],it just is not THAT good..I like the fact though that is one of the few books that I tend to like the \\"bad guys\\".(Lanfear)Oh,and somebody SHOOT FAILE... :)"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Shadow Rising is a great boook. It keeps you guessing and entertained. Like all the books in the series there are some things you can do without. One that really bugs me is how muuch Jordan describes the characters. It's good to know about the characters, but you don't have to know every little thing they are wearing. You just want to get on with the book.Another thing that is good but bugs me is how he acts like you haven't read any of the books. He thinks it so much that he describes the same things over and over again. It gets old really fast.Over all the book is real good and you don't hate it when it starts talking about the other characters and their plots because none of them are boring. I would recommend this book to everyone (after they read the first ones)."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"As you all already know, this is the fourth book in The Weel of Time series. Some say it is the best, some even say it is the best literature ever (which is totaly ridicouluos, but nevermind). I read first three books, and this one indeed seemes the best one. Rand is in Aiel waste, facing stubborn clan-chiefs together with Moiraine and Wise ones, trying to fulfill his destiny as He who Comes With The Dawn, Perrin is defending Two-rivers, at three fronts - Whitecloaks, Shadowspawn, and misterious Slayer, Nynaeve and Elayne hunts black Ajah in Tanchico, Mat regained his memories, and everything just started to boil. This book is a good fantasy, a kind of book that will keep you wake during the nights, turning pages and reading. Only thing that is very poor done is composition of the book (not only this one, but all three of them). In every book, protagonist find cuendillar, and in every book there is one major battle in the end. One can't shake the feeling that this whole WoT series could be much shorter, becouse Jordan has this habit of finishing book in last twenty pages, quickening his pace at maximum, so you start to wander couldn't those 980 pages be used to something more than endless slow pa ceted blabber. Kinda getting on nerves sometimes. Forsaken (chosen) are rummaging the world more freely now, and for the first time in series three Forsaken finds themselves in the web of the RJ story. This book is just the thing to set your mind to wonder on a grassy plain in these summer thay, but beware, this book isn't nothing more."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"My thoughts about this book can be summed up by a quote by Lanfear herself: \\"you don't use one tenth of your potential\\". The most frustrating element of this book (and the series as a whole, for that matter) is the wasted potential. The world of this series was so vividly realized and the plot was complex and engaging. Now, it is difficult not to sit back and wonder where exactly Jordan went off track.Most other reviewers commented on the fact that all the characters did not \\"miraculously\\" end up in the same place for the last battle. Personally, I found it very disapointing. Three of the four plot lines are resolved satisfactorally (even the Nynaeve/Elaine one...though I will admit it wrapped up too neatly and had me hoping at the end that the Black Ajah would come back at the last minute and wipe the self satisfied smile off Nynaeve's face). Even so, I was left wondering whether the weeks I'd spent reading this book were worth it.What this book lacked most was direction. It was very much a filler book for the characters/readers to take a breather in between major plot movements (at least I think that was what the original idea was). Readers can debate about whether the book was a success or not until they turn blue in the face (as I know they will) but for me, the book (and the series a sa whole) has fallen very flat."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I'm writing just as I'm starting Knife of Dreams (Book 11). I really feel the series peaked with this book and *The Fires of Heaven*. The info (especially the big thread of getting Rand recognized by the Aiel) is fresh, original, and thought-provoking (and Lan, for my money the most interesting character in the series, is still a Presence). Definitely a page-turner. I was sad to learn that the later books where the plot is really bogging down and Jordan is introducing yet *more* characters to an already mired series, are the ones that made #1 on the NYT bestseller list while the earlier books, where something was actually happening that you cared about, didn't rate as highly. I'm reading the series mainly for closure at this point and have been borrowing them from the library rather than buying. But at this point, the series was still a real grabber."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Fans generally agree that the Wheel of Time series peaks somewhere through books 4-6. Certainly, this book is as entertaining as Book 3, and better than books 1 and 2. While the first three books have artificial endings (where all the main characters \\"coincidentally\\" end up in the same place for a climactic battle), this book ends with open resolutions to most of the subplots.To wit: Of the Big 7 original characters, 5 (Rand, Mat, Egwene, Morraine, and Lan) undertake a journey into the desert wastes and the homes of the Aiel. This race of people is finally developed, and we get a feel for their culture and origins (not what you'd expect!). This is Jordan's forte and this culture is possibly his greatest invention of the series. Bad feelings start to brew between Aiel, and there is something strange about the peddlers that tag along with the merry band, but there is little action outside the nifty flashback sequences of Rand's trip into Rhuidean (the best part of the book), until the last few chapters. That's okay because (aside from the introduction of YET ANOTHER surly, obsessive female companion for the group) the development of the cultural and historical basis of the Aiel is neat stuff.That leaves Perrin and Nynaeve, who each go off on their own adventures. Perrin's blood feud with the inquisitory Whitecloaks reaches a new level as the latter occupy our heroes' hometown. Trollocs also start to arrive, and Perrin soon finds himself the leader of his besieged kinsmen. His girlfriend Faile (Book 3's most irritating addition) reaches new levels of inanity in the first half of the book before settling down into a reasonable and even likeable character. Finally Nynaeve and Elaine continue the hunt for the remaining Black Ajah, which leads them to a city under siege from numerous forces - the Seanchan (the cross-channel invaders of Book 2), more Whitecloaks, and at least one of the Forsaken, in addition to the Black Ajah. This plot line is left gapingly wide open, but that's okay because it is a series, after all.In general, the book is highly readable, exciting, and contains lots of new information and neat ideas that flesh out Jordan's world. Sure there are the usual Jordan irritants - Faile and Aviendha's behaviour most obviously, but more distressing is his treatment of Lan, the Warder. He has gone from the formidable sword-swinging prince/warrior to a simpering child, pouting over Morraine's treatment of him and mooning over the bullying and annoying Nynaeve. But most of these problems work themselves out by page 500, leaving the last half of the book as the best reading of the series, so far."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Detail: 10Plot: 10Pace: 3It seems that many of the negative comments regarding the Wheel of Time series (including my own disparaging thoughts) revolve around the comparatively slow pace of action in books 4 through 8. While this may be a true statement, that the action slows down so much and almost hinders the enjoyment of a good story, perhaps what we are really seeing is not so much the fault of the author as the fault of the reader, for expecting that every moment of every book should be action-packed. Because of the nature of writing (and reading) a novel, there will never be a book which takes as long to read as the action it describes, and for that reason, we have become spoiled into thinking that a \\"good read\\" is something which grabs our attention and never lets us go. Unfortunately, life isn't always like that, even for those around whom the Pattern is weaving itself constantly.As Jordan has created such a richly detailed world, so much like a 'real world' that could actually happen, and one so imaginative and interconnected, there will invariably be slow days. Imagine yourself riding along a Sea Folk ship for eight days, your only distraction wondering just exactly what kind of wood a certain beam was made of, or trudging through the Aiel Waste with nothing to do for hours on end but to look at the desert or listen to the plodding of horse hooves, wipe the sweat from your eyes, and dream of water. Instead of complaining that Jordan has \`dragged it out', maybe instead we should be thanking him for providing for us a way to experience and comprehend the actions of a few years' time in the span of only a few thousand pages.That said, I should say that it is a mark of good storytelling to \\"show, don't tell\\". Jordan, however, tells more often than he shows, and it shows. I do wish he would keep the points of view a bit fewer, too. We need not see inside the heads of everyone in the story, yet it sometimes seems like we do, and this can be distracting. For 'readiness', it would only get 2 stars, from the length and the sometimes abrupt POV changes. For 'description' it would get 5. For 'an example of how to write a best-selling series', it definitely gets 5. Lucky me, I can borrow them from the library. Overall, if you've read 3, you're probably not going to be wondering whether or not to read another, and you're just here to find a synopsis of action or a head-up as to how many you have yet to go. If you haven't yet started, maybe take a glance at how many there are still in the series and ask yourself if you want be that committed. Chances are, you do."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Shadow Rising is in many ways better than the first two books in the richness of the story, and would be made better if Nynaeve and Elayne's Tanchico jaunt would be made shorter. But, unlike The Fires of Heaven, it doesn't completely ruin the story in it's mind-numbing repetitiveness.In The Shadow Rising Rand has taken control of Tear and it's nobles and lords. Mat, in the meanwhile, has become a sort of rebel, avoiding Rand and Moiraine as he gambles the night away with Tear's lordlings. Perrin, in the meantime, is struggling to do what must be done and protecting Zarine (Faile) at the same time. Consequently, his adventure is vastly better than either Mat's or Rand's.All in all this fourth book was one of the best in the series, and ties with The Dragon Reborn in being my favorite volume. Well done Mr. Jordan."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The story continues as Rand, having subdued (in a sense) Tear, sets off for the Waste. _The Shadow Rising_ has a few amazing chapters about the history of the Aiel, helping make it one of the best books in the series. The Aiel customs are worthy of a book just to themselves, and watching Rand try to learn them is hilarious. The sense of lurking evil is also slightly more potent in _The Shadow Rising_ than in the earlier novels. Rand encounters the Shadow while trying to gain Aiel support; Mat, while obeying the prophecies of the mysterious people in a ter'angreal; Perrin, back at home in the Two Rivers, in scenes that are some of the most affecting in the series. I'll just say that the Bornhalds come back to haunt him. Egwene begins to study with the Aiel Dreamwalkers, eventually gaining the most maturity of any of the Two Rivers friends so far. Elayne and Nynaeve continue the search for the Black Ajah with two additions to their team and a few surprises to discover in post-Seanchan Tanchico. The ending, although not as battle-filled as the previous two books, is one of the most vivid-- I hate it for what happens during it, but I'll read it over and over. For a while, the fate of the world literally hanging by a thread of the Power."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"After reading 4 books of a series that currently stands at 8 (with at least 2 more on the way), comprising more than 3000 pages thus far, it is perhaps time to take a step back and try and determine just what it is that Jordan is doing. This is no generational saga--the same basic set of characters is maintained throughout &quot;The Wheel of Time,&quot; give or take the odd disappearance or even death (though, it should be noted, thus far no one of any importance, save a few of the bad guys, has bought it for good)--and there are no breaks in the flow of events to give the reader a chance to catch his/her breath (unless, of course, he/she simply becomes tired of it all and stops altogether). This is purely genre fiction, which is to say that it will appeal only to those who go for the sort of high/epic fantasy largely invented by Tolkien and practiced by countless more or less derivative, and more or less rewarding, writers in the decades since the appearance of &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; Unlike other such genre writers (Stephen R. Donaldson, for example) Jordan has nothing particularly new to bring to the high fantasy concept, so for fantasy aficionados &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; provides at best another imaginary land to explore, another set of fictional &quot;cultures&quot; to experience, another reworking of commonly used myths and legends (the Arthurian legends in particular) to re-familiarize oneself with. In short, this is nothing groundbreaking, nothing to mistake for literature, and nothing that will be read decades from now, when future writers are busily rehashing Jordan's rehashes and are the more popular for it--assuming, of course, that high fantasy is a commercially viable enterprise then.As I say this, I must admit that &quot;The Shadow Rising&quot; marks a turning point for this series, and one for the better. There are moments--most notably in the chapter entitled &quot;The Dedicated&quot;--when Jordan ceases being derivative long enough to be what seems to me genuinely inventive. While his central characters are spun to the four corners of his imaginary land in a manner similar to &quot;The Dragon Reborn&quot; or &quot;The Great Hunt,&quot; for once Jordan is under no compunction to hastily arrange for their simultaneous meeting in one particular locale at the end. And it is no small thing that for once I was wrong in a prediction; Jordan's first in-depth exploration of the Aiel society surprised me, if only because I was very much expecting a simple copy of the Fremen from Frank Herbert's &quot;Dune.&quot; Beyond such high points, most of the action amounts to the sort of wish-fulfillment that characterizes most of the genre; in other words, whether you imagine yourself in the place of Rand, of Perrin, of Elayne or anyone else, Jordan will make you feel good about what you...er, the characters...have accomplished.Jordan is not the finest writer you will ever read, but he puts together a competent enough narrative. If you enjoyed the first three books in this series, you'll love this one; if you didn't enjoy them, you probably didn't make it this far, and you're not reading this review. Enjoy your new doorstop."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Wheel of Time series hits some new heights with this fourth book. It starts where the third book left off--the Stone of Tear. Rand is the Dragon Reborn, the Stone has fallen, and the sword called Callandor is in Rand's possession. But Rand can't stay in the musty fortress forever. The Last Battle is coming and Rand has a long way to go to get ready for it. Meanwhile, Mat is trying to find some answers, while the women are hunting down some of the members of the Black Ajah. In some parts this book is slower than the previous three, but some of the parts that I mention below are what make this book an easy 5 stars. About a third through the book is a part where Rand has a series of visions where he learns about the true history of the Aiel. There is lots of history in those two chapters for you Wheel of Time buffs out there, so you might want to make a chart or something when you get to that part. That part's very fun to read. Another good part is where the young Tinker named Aram picks up a sword for the first time. I found that scene very moving and convincing. When you read about Tanchico, there will be mention of a museum-type place where there is a dinosaur-like skeleton (from what I gather of RJ's description). If you've been paying attention, he mentions it in book 2 in a sentence somewhere. Although I started the series with book 3 (and loved it!), I wouldn't recommend starting with book 4--unless you're really desperate to read this book. There is simply too much stuff you'd have missed out on. Like most of the Wheel of Time books, I own this one in hardback and am most pleased with it.

The electronic version shares almost none of those expenses yet they have decided to charge the consumer an extra $2.00? Shame on you Macmillan.

Book three &quot;Dragon Reborn&quot; definitly kept me going, although I was begining to have reservations about keeping interested in a storyline that lasts for 8 books (or more). With &quot;Shadow Rising&quot; I have finally had enough. I only read the first 200 pages of this 700 page book. It was boring reading! I looked ahead in the book to see if it got any better, and all I could see was more plot twists and turns that could keep this series going on for 100 books. I've had enough! I like epic's, but I also like a story to have an end in sight. I'm tired of hearing about the Amirylan Seat. I'm tired of hearing about people's hate for Aies Sedia. I'm tired of hearing about all the threads of the pattern and what it can do to people. I'm tired of the whole series and where it's plot is going (if it goes anywhere). Robert Jordan is a very competent writer. I have enjoyed the places he has taken me. But it is time to move on. I need storylines that have a resolution to them in at least 4 to 5 books, not 8, or however many books Jordan will need to finish this series. Goodbye &quot;Wheel of Time&quot;, with no end in sight it is time to move on."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book has its ups and downs, as many of the other critics have said, but Jordan does do somethings right. He has kept the characters intertwined and seperate by secrets and assumptions. He does this in the other books in the series as well. People who critisize his jumps in reading don't understand how this just keeps you wanting to read more. And yes, I have, as well, skipped chapters to find out what happens to Perrin and the Two River Folk, only to miss out on the big picture. Jordan also does give enough chapters to most of his sections that you almost have had it up to here with those characters, to coin a phrase.I have read all of the series up to the sixth book, and I must say I feel really dumb upon losing it at school, a few months ago. I can't seem to read other books with out relating all of the characters to Jordan's. She is such a Lan of a girl. He gambles with life like Matrim. All I can say for Jordan is that he does something right with h! is constant cycles of creating knowledge, letting the characters absorb it, then forming their own oppinions about it, and keeping it to themselves until they explode it all out in a frenzy of emotions which jolts the readers to no end, and no end in sight."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The best book I've read so far in the WOT-series. There were some quite complicated moments, but they all made sense after some logical thoughts. Robert Jordan is just an enormously clever author.There surely is some new character development in this book. I got the chance to get further into Perrin's personality. I love the the new sides of Faile's which was presented in this book too. I've fell in love with her. Also I got the chance, for almost the first time, to get into Moiraine's mind.I hope that I'm not the only one who has got the chance to do all that. I know I'm not the only one. So all of you other Jordan fans: Get finished with Dragon Reborn and read this!Some serious plot-twists awaits too. What happened in the ending must have been one of the most surpring moments in any of the WOT-books. As an ending to my review: Take some time off and give yourself the joy of reading this, the fourth instalment of the WOT-series. Have a good time!"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The shadow Rising is the best book in the series.

Of course it seems slow, can't anyone else see that it is setting the stage for the great works that are to follow? Rand is not a muttering madman, he is putting his Two Rivers stubborn personallity into the work he knows he has to do. The underlying plots are woven together with subtlety, something that few people seem to be able to understand. Perhaps they don't read the glossary at the back of the book. It's there for a reason!"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The series is great, but this book is lacking something, ah yes, a good main character. After Rand being almost completely cut out of third book, he is reintroduced but lacks the appeal the pre-Dragon Reborn Rand had. He has become a cackling madman, who no longer needs to be the center of the story.But what saves this book is the character sub-plots, and new and old characters. What saddens me though is that at the end the sub-plots did not ravel together for a spectacular finale, as did the first three. And Nynaeve is becoming feminism personified. She was my favorite before she met the Aes Sedai and began her transformation in personality. Jordan you need to tone her down a bit!Overall a great book, and everyone needs to read it."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Okay so it's almost impossible to write a series this long and not have some dull moments.

When I read the books I find myself so enthralled I wake up (so to speak) from his world hours later but yet, it seems much longer. In this book Rand has to unite the Aiel under him, as the Prophecy says. I see this book as The Dragon Reborn proving who he is. Prophecy is fullfilled and the people of Jordan's world are starting to believe in him. I am ordering the next book in the series as of this very moment! I will finish the series, of this I have no doubt at all. I also recommend that you finish the series. If you find it becoming boring or off the plot, remember that books require more then just a Reader, they require an Imagination."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"We finally get some big glimpses back into the age of legends and the history of the Aiel.

It is about 3 young men that find out that they are ta'veren, Rand (dragon) ,Mat (gambler),Perrin (talks to wolves and the senses of them).They meet some people and they try to separate them from friends and enemys.It has Mideville time and Magic in the book.

Some may complain that it is too long, that it drags on; but I hope it never ends. Who would have thoughts that Perrins adventures in Edmond's Feild would be the best part of the book. Wow! I hope Jordan writes this series for another 200 installments. Well maybe not, I have to work sometime. Action, romance, adventure, suspence, humor and even brain twisting political schemes.

Though the plot is slowed by an onslaught of physical details, the book still manages to hold your attention. It also tells more about the history of Jordan's land, and allows the reader to learn the history of the mysterious Aiel. The only I had with the novel is that it doesn't really bring the series any closer to a finale than any of the first three books.

While the books themselves are long (nearly 1000 pages) I just can't get enough. I have read all of the books that are currently out and cannot wait for the next one. The world spun by Jordan is rich and realistic. And there are strong female roles as well as the typical male roles. Truely a must read series.Tricia Shaffe"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The fourth book of WoT series, its better than previous three.But still its not as good as others are claiming it to be. First of all, I want to know what the hell was Rand's Masterplan?? In the entire book, Rand and others act as though he has come out with an ultimate plan to defeat the enemies. But when the climax happens the plan is never mentioned by anybody. And I think its the tradition of WoT series that everytime the villians are explained as very strong, cunning and powerful, but when they confronts with Rand, they are so easily won over as though they were waiting for him only to screw them up. The females...... more female characters are introduced and they doesnt show any kind of difference from previous female characters, all are rude and ignorant. Even the Aeil woman are annoying.I'm saying again, dont bother to go for this series."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I'm consistently amazed at how high many people review books in general. The same goes for this book, which is good, but not 4.5 star material. If I could give it 3.5, I would, because that's where I think it is so far as fantasy goes.I like the book. I do. Jordan is able to keep me turning pages from page 200 to page 900. The first 200, however, are painfully slow as he attempts to bring those people who have not read the first 3 up to speed. For those previously uninitiated into the Wheel of Time series, it's probably helpful. But for those of us who have read his other works, it's a slow, dry stretch of pages.The book does get more interesteing after that, and Jordan does have a decent way with words that makes the pages go faster. But some of his literary tricks are just plain tiring. As another reviewer asked, how many times can a woman fold her arms under her breasts and how many men's faces are carved out of stone? Similarly, is it really necessary to continuously portray the characters as 12 years old? The maturity level of the characters is severely lacking, which is more pronounced in the beginning of the book than the last 3/4 of it, but nonetheless something that never ends.Conversely, there are some plots that are worth reading. Perrin's saga is good. Min is a great character. And of course we always want to know mroe about Rand. And that's where the problem begins. All in all, this is 1000 pages where Rand accomplishes as much as you could read in 50 pages. And that's where my real problem starts to come in with this book.Nobody ever dies. Characters keep being added. At this stage, there is war raging all over the world and not 1 of nearly 40 characters ever dies. They're only ever grazed or nicked. Not that I'm rooting for anyone to die, you see. But every battle is the same formula: Describe slow anticipation, start the battle, then in 2 pages of action end the battle in a nondescript manner.And yes, I said 40 characters that are entreneched in this book. And 7 different plot lines (Rand, Perrin, Min, Nynaeve/Elayne, Black Ajah, Whiteclocks, Padain Fain, the White Tower, and the Forsaken/Dark One). Well, make it 9, and that keeps Matt, Thom, and several other characters out of it. Among those 8 plot lines I can count can count 37 characters that are running with some story. Nothing ever ends. Even when Rand battles at the end, there is no finality.So, in reviewing the book, I'm not sure it's worth even 3 stars. Maybe more like 2.5 or 2. I don't want to say it totally sucked, especially the Two Rivers part of it all. But the remained of the book was clearly lacking, not nearly enough of the plot talks about Min and her role in the overall picture.I think it is best left at this. Around page 900 I was looking forward to book #5. After the last 100 pages, I'm not really looking forward to it quite so much because the ending was so lame and predictable, the payoff of 1000 pages just was not there."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I enjoyed the 1st book of the series, however, by the time I reached book four I could care less about most of the characters. In addition, I found myself interested in only a few of the many plots, and completely fed up with the writing style (every woman is folding their arms under their breasts, and every man's face, it seems, is &quot;carved out of stone&quot;). I awaited a likable female character, but only manipulative annoyances were introduced. I know this sounds like a cliche, but I honestly wanted some of the main characters to be killed off, although I got the impression that the author intended for me to like these characters. One last side note to those who read these reviews: I have found it helpful to skip the reviews that claim that the book in question was THE best or worst book ever written."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"At nearly seven hundred hard back pages, this isn't a book to read if there's a lot going on in your life. Beyond the basic complexities of the plot, and the worlds he's created, Jordan's fourth installment weaves in new characters while still giving the regular cast plenty to do, especially Perrin and Rand.Ending on much more of a cliff hanging note, this latest chapter of He Who Comes With The Dawn feels ultimately like great set up for the subsequent books. And if you've become as addicted to them by this point as most people have, you'll want to have the next book, &quot;The Fires of Heaven waiting on deck."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book is the fourth book of The Wheel of Time series and it's a great book!In the books before this one Rand, Perrin, and Mat live in Two Rivers along with Egwene and Nynaeve. When an Aes Sedai comes, Moiraine and her Warder Lan, their lives change.Rand is the Dragon Reborn also known as Lewis Therrin. He denies it, doesn't want to accept that he is the Dragon Reborn who must someday fight the Dark One. He travels to the Aiel Wasteland fulfills the sayings ... fate has decided that he is the Dragon Reborn and even as Rand tries to run from it he just ends up proving he is the Dragon Reborn. He is now in the Aiel Wasteland and awaits for the leaders to proclaim him the Dragon Reborn. They will follow him because the proficies say that he will unite the clans and lead them but also one of the sayings is that he will destroy them. Some of the Aiel are uncertain what to think about that and others decide to go against him. What to do? Who to trust or turn to? Rand doesn't know anymore ... there isn't anyone he can trust ... maybe Ewgene but ever since she became Aes Sedai she acts just like one and that is just what he's trying to get away from. The Aes Sedai who try to keep him on a leash.Perrin goes back to Two Rivers, hearing that White Cloaks have been poking around. He finds things uneasy and full of tension. He has to put aside his jealousy ... what he finds is Lord Luc who seems to have an interest in his companion and friend (more than friend) Faile. He also finds White Cloaks who have overstepped their authority. They have taken Two Rivers people prisoners and they are guarded. Perrin takes the risks involved and decided to rescue them. Faile supports his idea and even though she is suppose to stay out of harms way she goes where he goes, watching his back. After the prisoners are rescued Perrin says it's time to hunt Trollocs. But more is in store for him than he would have believed and it's something he wouldn't ever want to happen, maybe Trollocs are smarter than he has thought ... the price is too high to pay ... And he soon finds that out ...Meanwhile the Tower is splitting. It's been rumored that there are Aes Sedai who serve the Dark One. The Ajah (Aes Sedai) are categoried in colors, the colors mean different things (like Brown Ajah seeks knowledge and Gray Ajah seek harmony and peace, and so on.). Well it's been rumored there are Black Ajah in the Tower who serve the Dark One and all Aes Sedai swear that that is not true. But unfortunately it is ... they act like any other Aes Sedai and wear are Ajah, wearing a color (not black) so they fit in perfectly. So who is it that is splitting the Tower? The enemy is from the inside and there isn't any knowledge as to who it is ... until it's too late. The Black Ajah have started to play their hand in the game ... Do they have a winning hand and if they do what will that bring?Basically about bad vs. good it is filled with adventure and mystery, fear and danger, a little romance mixed in it, triumph and happiness all make a great story and this has it all!"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Shadow Rising is the fourth book of the Wheel of Time series and in my view the best.Rand is now the ruler in Tear, and we get to see him play a bit of politics before he heads off to the Three Fold Land to claim what is his as 'He Who Comes With the Dawn'. This is also the book where Mat gets his hat, ashandarei, and memories and where Perrin truly becomes his own character. Elayne and Nynaeve head off to Tanchico to take care of the Black Ajah, and Egwene also heads to the Three Fold Land to learn Dreaming. The White Tower is not left behind either as Min arrives.The pace of this book is just perfect and it has a good amount of action to keep us happy."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"In my personal opinion, (I have all the books in series) this is the best in the series. Perticularly the Battle of the Two Rivers. The whole sequence was incredibly detailed and imaginative.

I highly recomend this book, of course, only after you've read the 1st three books."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Shadow Rising takes place on at least four major fronts, three of which I'll mention here: Tear, Rhuidean, and The Two Rivers. In Tear, we see Rand Al'Thor taking command of an Aiel army and fighting off Trollocs and trying to avoid falling in with Lanfear, who apparently is in love with him, or what she can use him for, in a well-described and choreographed close quarters battle. Matt Cauthon is as irrascible as ever about Aes Sedai meddlings, and soon follows Rand, Egwene and Moiraine Sedai to Rhuidean, a sacred and restricted city of the Aiel that is located deep in the waste. Meanwhile, Egwene Al'Vere has been stretching her skills at entering the dreamworld of Tel'Aranrhiod and has accompanied Rand into the waste not to explore Rhuidean as he has, but to gain dreamsleep instruction with the Aiel Wise Ones. In a really meaty section, Perrin Aybara travels to The Two Rivers to give himself up to the Whitecloaks. Faile follows him. What happens there is some of the most vivid storytelling yet in the Wheel of Time, with tremendous character and relationship development, and invention at showing us how the Wheel can warp events around the Ta'veren. An outstanding book, which I may well follow up soon by reading Jordan's book 5."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is the first book where one of the Forsaken does not die at the end of it, or is at least wounded. But Rand achieves a statusquo in this book where he is finally starting to exercise somecontrol over events, in stead of running around re-acting to themHe starts to plan how and what he is going to do, and he startsbecoming independent of Moiraine. Also, this is the last book that is able to deal extensively with all of our three heroes. I found book six to be slightly more exciting, but only just. Book five was slightly less exciting, but it also accomplished quite a bit. It was during books seven and eight that the series started to drag. The fact that none of the Forsaken die in this book does not take anything from it, but in fact keeps the ending from being &quot;same old, same old&quot;."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"one thing i've always had against fantasy stories, including this series is that they never seem to give the enemies more than a two dimensional characterization. this one attempts it rather well with the forsaken and some of the darkfriends, but trollocs are just fodder for rand's lightning strikes.but my own pet pieves aside, this story is rich and complex. this world that robert jordan has created is imaginative and innovative. it may seem like he is using some stereotypes from our own cultures throughout our world, but he's mixed it up well enough to be considered his own creation.the story will engross you, as it should and you will be caught up in the characters' drive for survival. enjoy it, and all nine books so far."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is a good book which expands the stories developed in the first 3 books of the series. I like Jordan's resourcefulness, his ability to assign his knowledge of different cultures to different peoples that appear in his series(roughly, japanese =Shienaran; Tuareg=Aiel; gypsy-Flower Children=Tuathan etc.)and combines them with assorted Tolkiana and mythologies. Especially wonderful I find his encorporation of serious concepts of shamanism, lucid dreaming etc. Reading his books is, in my opinion, not just \\"empty entertainment\\".Also, I really liked the detailed descriptions of people, of blackmith's work, for example, or of sailing, animals,... his inventions on new flower species, animals.. etc. ... Shows that RJ has a keen eye for facts as well as a good imagination and info-resources.The only (and i guess minor) problem i have is with the psychology of the characters, especially concerning \\"love\\". He has a few cliches he employs time and again. Worse, as opposed to the often sophisticated settings, the relationships tend to be rather linear and sort of pre-adolescent, with a lot of pouting, weird insecurities and little psychological growth. So that as the story develops the characters themselves remain frozen within their own cliches. As a consequence, the storyline becomes at times rather simplistic and repetitive."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"(Do *not* read this review if you have not read the book and still care. I just give too much away, because I am going to be very specific about what annoys me).I read this book in three days in late 1995. I have never reread it. There are reasons for that. Lots of 'em.Positives first. If it really distresses you to read anything negative about this book, then you can just read this part.-Rhuidean. Forget about selling the prologues to the books; Jordan should just sell the Rhuidean sections on their own. I would say they're worth the cover price, except that to fully understand them you have to wade through lots and lots and lots of sand of Aiel descriptions, dress descriptions, facial expression descriptions, and angst descriptions...Whoops. Excuse me while I put the annoyed part of my memory back in the cage for a moment.-Mat finally starts to develop 'special powers' as a character. That this, too, will become a dead end is not yet visible.-We see the Two Rivers again. Interesting idea in conception, though the execution was depressing.-Lanfear turns out to be the most interesting female character in the book. I think it's a bad sign when I'm cheering for the Dark side and I'm not supposed to.All right. Unleash the annoyance!-The villains are *unrelievedly* Dark. The Forsaken probably sold their own mothers into slavery. The Dark One wants to take over the world because...well, because it's there, I think. No one on the evil side seems to have the shred of a good quality, with the exception of some intelligence on Lanfear's part. That the supposed heroes are stupid, bratty teenagers does not help.-Rand has become rather crazed, and not due to the taint. Many of his actions left me scratching my head. *Why* does he trundle from one disaster to another? *Why* does he not tell the people around them things it could be vital for them to know? *Why* does he keep up this ridiculous prejudice against killing a woman? (This is yet another sign of the unrealistic quality of Jordan's world. Chivalry has no meaning when the women are so powerful).-Everyone seems really, really desperate to get out of Tear, especially considering how much time they spent to get there in the last book. And yet Jordan drags the scene, and drags the scene, and drags the scene. I kept expecting the characters to just bolt out of the Stone screaming.-Moiraine here officially succumbs to Creeping Female Rot. She tells other female characters that she suspects she knows the face of the man she will marry better than they know the faces of their future husbands. Does she bother explaining this? No, of course not. It would get in the way of her regular schedule of meddling.-For the first time, I started really noticing how many times a woman \\"crosses her arms beneath her breasts.\\" Why? Was it just so Jordan could add the word \\"breasts\\" more times per page?-Faile is back again. She's posessive of Perrin, she won't listen to him, and she somehow convinces him that he loves her, even though you'd think Perrin would love a dead bird before her. She poisons the Two Rivers plotline, not that it wasn't bad enough without her.-Lots and lots of people have managed to survive in the Two Rivers. Is Perrin's family among them? Of course not. They have been destroyed, so that Perrin can Angst! And then there is more Angst! And then there is more Angst!-The Whitecloaks continue to get on everyone's nerves. If this is the Light, may the Dark come swiftly!-You learn more about the Aiel than you ever wanted to know, yet somehow, none of it is new. The women are still pushy, and they still abide by codes of courtesy they somehow expect outsiders to know by heart, just like the Aes Sedai. Take Dune and sprinkle it with Jordan's \\"endearing\\" descriptions of rocks and sand and the battles between the sexes, and there you go.I ended this book determined to ignore the female characters other than Lanfear as best as I could, other than dreaming of imaginative ends for them. Jordan doesn't write strong women; he writes a collection of shallow, shrill stereotypes, labels them \\"female,\\" and slaps slightly different names on them.*sigh*It really is too bad that seeds like Mat and Rhuidean got planted in this manure."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"If you've made it this far into the series, you pretty much know what you're getting yourself into. Rand and his friends split into three groups (four if you count Min) and go on their separate missions. Rand ventures into the Aiel wasteland, Nynaeve attempts to discover and thwart the plans of the black ajah, and Perrin ventures home to defend Emond's Field against the Whitecloaks (and Min gets trapped in Tar Valon and gets to witness important events unfolding there).The book succeeds in many ways. It sets definite, tangible goals and is fairly straightforward in its storytelling (when following multiple groups, it is important that the plotlines not get too convoluted). The storylines are weighted with appropriate seriousness and the process of reaching those ends is well told with exciting and interesting events appropriately spaced along the way. When we reach the end, we feel like the characters have accomplished important tasks and have made progress toward the ultimate goals of the author.This installment provides some very satisfying developments, such as insight into the culture and history of the Aiel, and the introductions of two more of the Forsaken.There are also ways in which this book disappoints. First of all, the first few books in the series had a hook, at least one situation or storyline that I found compelling to the point where I couldn't put the book down. While this book's stories were still interesting, I never lost any sleep while reading it.The second major flaw in this book almost seems to come from an oral tradition. When I was in school studying Homer, we talked about how each character had \\"catchphrases,\\" phrases that were uttered every time a character came into the scene (I specifically remember the phrase about \\"grey-eyed Athena\\"). The idea was that stringing a few familiar words together would give the bard a few moments to think ahead and remember how the next few lines went. Unfortunately, at 1000 pages, I very much doubt that this book will ever be recited from memory, and what was forgivably eccentric in an oral history, grows tedious in such a long, written work. Heck, I could probably reproduce half of the scenes in the book just by making something up about how Perrin had trouble talking to women, or Nynaeve picked a fight with whoever was around, or Egwene berated men for being so foolish. It would have been even more irritating if I had read the first four books consecutively, instead of spacing each one a year apart.The third major flaw in the book, and of the series in general, is that it suffers from bloat. The plotline moves swiftly enough that it never loses the reader, but the book would have been much better at half the length. Even though I haven't read any further in the series, knowing that there are going to be at least 12 books has seriously dampened my enthusiasm. Even though this book gives the illusion of progress, having the characters basically abandon the gains of the previous book doesn't engender faith that the author doesn't have them on a treadmill.Overall, the book is enjoyable, but not as good as previous installments."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I finished &quot;Eye of the World&quot; in a few weeks, but it's been months since I started this book, and I'm only about halfway through. I don't think I'm going to finish it.The title of this book had me intrigued, but it's very misleading. So far, there's very little of the Shadow in it, and almost no forward movement of the overall plot-arch. The series seems to be meandering and getting bogged down in too many subplots and new characters...and if reviews of future books are anything to judge by, I can expect it to get worse in later books (not that I plan to read that far).A large part of what makes it so hard to get into is that I don't give a flying flip about the characters. They seem to spend all their time whining, arguing, and being angry at each other. They rarely laugh together, they never comfort each other, and they seem incapable of carrying on a civil conversation 80% of the time. It was less bothersome in the first three books because I was still interested in the direction the series was going, but now that the plot is losing focus, there's not a lot to keep reading for. Now Rand is traveling through the desert with the Aiel. Why? Where are they going? What's their goal? I'm not even sure anymore. The reason is lost somewhere in the dense forest of the plot. I've lost all interest in Rand. I have no idea what's supposed to make him so special--he just seems like an ordinary guy (and not a very interesting one, at that) who just happens to be really powerful. You'd expect the Dragon Reborn to be unusually courageous or intelligent, or *something.* I thought that maybe he'd develop into someone interesting as time went on, but his motives and personality are just growing murkier. This could be blamed on his growing madness, I suppose, but somehow, Jordan manages to make even incipient madness dull and tiresome.It's too bad. This series started out with some promise, but I just don't care anymore. The only time I could recommend it is if you need something to read on a long plane-flight; it passes the time, but that's about it."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Of all the books in the Wheel of Time, this was definitely my favorite. It is full of amazing detail into the Aiel society, and it was definitely cool to have a return to the Two Rivers. What distinguishes this series from others is the fact that there are multiple conflicts occurring at different locations, including the boys' home. This Slayer character, I suspect, is Lan's cousin, who was briefly mentioned in the first book with the name Isam. Other avenues of writing are also opened with Birgitte's warning about the Eelfinn and Aelfinn, those snakes and foxes through the ter'angreal doorframes. This book is Robert Jordan's finest."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I love this book!!! Heck I love the whole series, but I like this book the best because it has alot of story concerning Perrin. Perrin is my all time favorite character. To those of you who have never read this series before, this is a must read, if u liked J.R.R. Tolkien or Frank Herbert, you really MUST READ this!!!!!!!!! This series you can read over and over again, and you will not get board because every time you reread it, you will pick up the little, yet signifigant details that you missed the last time. I've read this series 4 times, and even on the fourth time I was still very much engrossed in these books. Even though this series looks really long, it isn't, considering that you'll love it so much that you will read, and read and read untill you have finnished the series in two weeks. I've spent hours just reading this, and when i stopped, i couldn't believe how much time had actually passed. These books bring you into the story, so you feel like you're experiencing all the struggles, physical or mental, hardships, and friendships.Just to answer the question that you may be thinking, but you don't want to ask, no, i am not a fanatic, it's just this series is sooooo good"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Actual rating: 4.5 starsThis of course is the 4th book in the Wheel of Time Series, which at the time of this writing, has 11 books (+1 prequel and an encyclopedia). As with the other books of the series, I will rate and review this book on its own merits instead of allowing any shortcomings in other books to mar this one.After the major events of the previous book (The Dragon Reborn), Rand, \\"the\\" main character (among many \\"main\\" characters) must now decide what to do next while other major political and powerful entities react themselves to those same events. At this point, Intrigue begins to play a more major role in the story, but not at the expense of some very well portrayed battles. Once Rand makes his decision, he then endeavors to pursue it until it comes to a resolution one way or another. Because of this, I feel it's fair to say that this book had a clear cut beginning and clear cut ending, qualifying it as a stand alone book despite the fact that quite a few things wouldn't make sense to someone who hasn't read the first three books. The story isn't all about Rand though. There are other side stories as the other main characters pursue other objectives. The best of these is Perrin's. Nynaeve and Elayne also pursue an important quest. This book also provides a greater understanding of the Aiel and the Aiel history. The book ends with a couple of great battles, one of which was the funnest to read about at this point in the series.What I liked:*Great Battles! Even the smaller ones have great importance in the over all scheme of things. They're not just thrown in for filler.*Better understanding of the Aiel.*Political Intrigue. I find that as fascinating as good action and battles!*Rand doing what he feels is best and not necessarily what is popular. Not enough people like that in the real world! That's not to say that Rand is always right, mind you.*Perrin's \\"coming of age\\".*Even Faile, a character I don't particularly like, gained some respect in my eyes in this battle.*More laughing out loud moments due to Mat.*Moghedien's entranceWhat I didn't like:*Though she gained some respect in my eyes, Faile is still quite irritating at times.*Nynaeve and Elayne's quest, though important to the story and at times exciting, is a bit tedious at times. Their constant snippishness gets tiresome as well.*The history of the Aiel was a bit long winded. The main points probably could have gotten across with more brevity without losing much if anything. I've reread the whole series multiple times but I always find myself having to skip over this part of this book.In Summary:Despite those minuses, it's still a great book. I can't bring myself to punish a book just because I don't like some of the characters (in real life I don't like all the people I've met after all, but I still work and interact with them). I don't mind the pace of a story slowing down, if the information that is provided is relevant and leads to an exciting conclusion and that's what this book provided. For that, I give this book 4.5 stars. Since amazon doesn't accomodate fractions of stars I had to either round down to 4 or up to 5. Since some people who have read the whole series are allowing there opinions of later books to affect the rating they give this single book, I feel no guilt in choosing to round up to 5 stars to offset one of those silly people (If they hate the series so much, why do they keep reading it?)."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Wheel of Time is not a series for those with little patience. The story moves slowly, painfully slowly at times; it takes over 200 pages for any character to leave the city of Tear, for example. Nor are all storylines created equal. Rand's journey into the Aiel waste (with the exception of his visions of Aiel history) is both endless and tiring. Min's adventures in Tar Valon are far more gripping, but receive minimal treatment. Perrin's return to the Two Rivers, however, is the best we have seen from the entire series so far. Every page with Perrin is read literally on the edge of the seat, eagerly turning each page.It doesn't hurt that of all the main characters, Perrin is the most (and perhaps the only) likeable. The others are too wrapped up in their own selves and generate no sympathy, especially Mat. It is striking that the friendship that had been so close in The Eye of the World is now virtually non-existent. Rand, Mat, and Egwene are together but seldom interact except to criticize or complain, and none of them care at all about what had happened to Perrin. A disappointing turn, as the ability to form and hold deep friendships is often what separates the good guys from the bad."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"One of the most compelling aspects of Jordan's epic fantasy series is the intertwining of salvation and destruction, as the very man who will save the world is also destined to tear it apart. That's a process that comes to the foreground in the fourth book of the series, beginning with disrupting the political reality of the country of Tear and ending by destroying the way of life of an entire people. Jordan has always done a magnificent job of mixing the macro scale of his fantasy with the micro scale of his people, and it's that talent that makes the tale of Rand's journey with the Aiel so compelling and painful. Over the course of The Shadow Rising, we learn not only the secret history of the Aiel, but we see what knowing that history would do someone raised in ignorance of their true nature, and it's a powerful and horrifying reality. Of course, there's a lot more going on in The Shadow Rising, from the Two Rivers turning from a small village into the second coming of Manetheren, Mat beginning to come to terms with his past, Egwene beginning to realize the full scope of her talents, and the plans of the Dark One beginning to come into focus. But as rich and fascinating as all of that is - and it really is riveting, giving us one of the best books of the series - Jordan always lets his plot be driven by its characters and their inner conflicts. Even Rand's tentative rival among the Aiel is eminently understandable and even pitiable, even when his response is at its most brutal; who wouldn't fear their people being torn apart, and who wouldn't be worried when that threat came from someone who knows nothing of their traditions? It's a question that rings true even to a reader in our real world, as do so many questions raised by the book - What does it mean to be a hero? When must a secret be told, no matter what the cost? What cost are we willing to pay to do the right thing? - and it's that method of making a high fantasy story truly human that makes the Wheel of Time such an incredible, powerful, and riveting piece of reading."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Another great read from Jordan. This story furthers the plot and ties up a few more loose ends.I really enjoy the series."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I read this book twice a couple years ago. I loved it; it's my second-favorite of the series (after Lord of Chaos). This is a VITAL book in the series, it answers many questions about Rand's background and the Forsaken. In fact, for the first time in this series, a book manages to tie up more loose ends than it leaves!There are a couple parallel threads in this novel (Rand/the Aiel, Nynaeve/Egwene, and Perrin/Faile). All threads are independently resolved nicely at the end with no major cliffhangers, although the protagonists remain in different parts of the world throughout the book and at the end. The Rand/Asmodean and Nynaeve/Moghedien conflicts in particular were very well written, with outstanding portrayal of these characters' distinct personalities coming alive in their struggles.The Two Rivers part with Perrin/Faile vs. the Whitecloaks was in my opinion weak compared to the adventures elsewhere. However, this narrative takes up so much of the book that it's impossible to ignore, and interesting questions are brought up (i.e. Who is Slayer? What is the significance of the Manetheren heritage in the Emond's Fielders?)."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Wow. Action, adventure, romance, mystery, humor - this book (and the entire series) has it all. I can't even begin to describe it. I love these books so much, when I'm not reading one I go through a sort of depression, in which the world around me seems drab and dull...until I pick up the next Wheel of Time book. Jordan describes everything so well, making the land rich in detail AND history/lore. You can picture the great White Tower of Tar Valon, and this image also brings to mind the history and current affairs of the Tower...it's just amazing. I've heard that Robert Jordan made ten pages of notes for each country in the Wheel of Time...and it shows! All the history is very consistent, and believable. But, don't get the idea that it bogs the books down - it's just the opposite. It makes the land much more believable and enjoyable.You really care about the characters. Each one treats the situations he/she gets in differently - Jordan doesn't go by stereotypes, he actually creates &quot;real&quot; people, that are very easy to believe in and identify with. There is a large cast of characters, and each one basically has different adventures that appeal to different people. This makes the books rather complex - the Shadow Rising is the first book where all the seperate threads didn't come together at the end. But this just makes the books more interesting. For example: Some people thought Rand's adventures in the Aiel waste were the best scenes in the book. I didn't like them at all, and would have found them pretty boring if Moiraine hadn't been there. (Moiraine's my favorite character.) Instead, I was hooked on Elayne and Nynaeve's quest in Tanchico.There are three main plotlines in this book, with a fourth (Min and the White Tower) popping up occasionally...which was funny, because I thought that was more important to the series as a whole then, oh say, Perrin's adventures in Emond's Field: population 10. But there were several good battles with Perrin and Faile - the last one brought tears to my eyes, and the note he left her was sooo sweet! All four are all resolved (somewhat) at the end, but like I said before - they aren't connected.Once again, there were several humorous scenes in this book. Incredibly, I heard some people complaining about them, saying that they're &quot;immature&quot; and a &quot;waste of time.&quot; I, personally, am very glad that Jordan puts them in, because they certainly help you care about the characters more. Remember that this is a STORY, not a TEXTBOOK. If Jordan suddenly made every character not make ANY mistakes, and ALWAYS say just the right thing, then the series would get drab and dull, fast.The Wheel of Time books are the best that I've ever read. But if you haven't read the first three, then by all means do so now, because they MUST be read in the right order to get the best enjoyment out of them. And if you choose not to read them at all? It's a pity, because you're missing out on the best fantasy series (no, the best series, period) ever created."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Wheel of Time turns and brings Volume 4 of the saga, TheShadow Rising (TSR). For my money, TSR (perhaps along with Volume 5)form the peak of the series, before it meanders and loses itself. In TSR Rand edges ever closer to his destiny and we start to understand the Aiel, that fascinating people based on Frank Herbert's Fremen of Arrakis. We learn a bit more about Min (my favorite character of all!). Perrin too comes fully into his own in TSR as the attack on the Two Rivers reaches a crescendo. The White Tower is shaken with dissension. The Atha'an Miere or the Sea Folk also make their appearance and one can sense how the Dragon is slowly but surely gathering all his people for the final campaign. But the highpoint of the book is the Rhuidean experience where the history not just of the Aiel but the world of the WOT series is recapitulated as series of time capsules. At long last, many of the threads spun by Jordan... start to make some sense. The ingenious manner of the unveiling of these threads is almost enough to make one forgive Jordan for the absence of a decent prologue to the series. A book not to be missed; even if you are one of those tired with long plotlines, keep at it and I promise you will not be disappointed. But still only 4 stars for my now patented complains about Jordan's cartography and the excuse for a glossary of characters and concepts.

Rand, after getting proof of just exactly who he is, continues his fight against the Shadow, while all around his world chaos multiplies. Robert Jordan has done a wonderful job of mixing action and adventure with romance in very intricate detail. You skip so much as one page, you miss something important. Every page is essential. The only thing I'm not sure of is how Perrin &quot;Goldeneyes&quot; Aybara fits in...I guess the Pattern has yet to make his purpose clear. This series is greater than epic: the word hasn't been invented that can describe this series, and (so far: they've been getting better and better!) THE SHADOW RISING is the pinnacle of it all...I hope that Book Five continues this trend. This is a must-read for everyone at some point. You've got to get this series."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The fourth installment of the neverending Wheel of Time sees our hero Rand traveling to the Aiel Waste to fulfill another prophecy. Rand isn't only the Dragon Reborn, he's appearantly He Who Comes With the Dawn as well.The premis of this book was a lot more interesting to me than book 3. I mean, finally Rand get's some limelight and half the book's not about three girls at school? A lot of interesting background about the Aiel is revealed in this book as well as where Rand's own history fits into all this. You'll be surprised at some things.Unfortunately, by this point, Jordan is now Juggling over a dozen characters over four separate story threads. Let's count them. In the first thread we have Rand, Egwene, Moiraine, Lan, and Mat. In the second thread we have Perrin, Faile, and Loial, In the third we have Elayne, Nynaeve, Thom, and Juilin. In the fourth thread we have Min, Siuane, and Leane. That's not to count all the other supporting characters that readers of Jordan know could have their own threads at any time.In some ways this is both good and bad for the story. For those that enjoy the long drawn out soap operah, it's great. There's plenty to get sucked into. For those anxious for the plot to reveal itself however, it's sometimes agonizing. This book had a lot going for it. The subject matter was more interesting than in the previous books, but unfortunately, Jordan doesn't give you enough of it and worse, he doesn't stick to it. Everytime the book jumps to the characters and the storyline happening in Tanchico you're tempted to skip the chapter.Present, again, is Jordan's use of \\"convenient\\" storytelling. This time however, it's not Rand who's miraculously able to save the with much overdone powers-he-never-knew-he-had. Who woulda thought that one of the other characters (besides Rand and Moiraine who really cant) had the ability to take on a Forsaken toe to toe? I sure didn't. Well in this book, one of the characters is instantly elevated to Forsaken power level status. There hasn't been anything this dumb in the series since Nynaeve and Lan instantly fall in love in a matter of pages with no foreshadowing whatsoever in the first book.Some parts of the book are so great and others make you want to pull your hair out in frustration. Nothing really gets resolved in this book, though we do get to learn about the Aiel and Rand's history which is not limited to this life. This makes the book a worth addition to the series, but I sure hope it doesn't it doesn't turn into an \\"another book, another forsaken\\" formula.This book is not quite as good as the books two and three, though parts are fantastic (ie seeing Perrin develop into the part he's destined to play). It's good enough to get fans to read the next book, but you just can't help thinking these books could be so much better."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"After the last three books, where everyone embarks on a long journey for their own reasons and end up in the same place, this one is mildly surprising for breaking that mold, and having everyone embark on a long journey for their own reasons and ending up across the world from each other.Rand travels to the desert to recruit what he views as his promised people, the tribal Aiel. Mat goes with him, and obtains some neat little items and a scar. The Aiel Wise Ones, a group of matriarchs, are introduced here. Unfortunately, rather than making them an interesting counterpoint to the manipulative Aes Sedai, Jordan prefers to just make them a grittier version of the same. Egwene also tags along, and is apprenticed, after a fashion, to the Wise Ones to learn about dreamwalking.Perrin travels to the Two Rivers to ward off various threats to his hometown. On the way, he is involved in an inane subplot involving Faile's commandeering of the expedition as revenge for him (completely understandable) trying to protect her. Frankly, Perrin deserves better than to be caught up in that kind of adolescent crap. I kept expecting Loial to wash his hands of the whole affair and leave for the stedding. Once they arrive in Emond's Field and surroundings, the stupidity tapers off and Perrin leads the defense against both Trolloc hordes and insidious Whitecloak plots.Elayne and Nynaeve embark for Tanchico, to combat a Black Ajah plot to attack Rand. On the way, they are assisted by the Sea Folk of porcelainware fame. This first glimpse of the Sea Folk is interesting, and hints that their women may not be as arrogant or domineering as they are seemingly everywhere else (this notion will be nicely disposed of later, but it's nice while it lasts). In Tanchico, our heroes meet a new Forsaken and guerilla strike the Black Ajah.Overall, this book maintains the inertia of the series while developing along different lines than the previous three. Tarmon Gai'don is still in sight (though no one seems very concerned about it), and the characters still seem focused on that fact. There is a sense that the story is starting to get away from the author though. Several new elements are introduced without being clearly tied into the main story. Still, fans of the series won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"When I said that 'The eye of the world' was the best book ever, I was wrong. The first book was just outlining the plot, the second and third were good (Not as good as the first.), but this beats all. This is where it starts to get interesting. There's so much going on in this book, that when R.Jordan switched from one character to another, I didn't mind as much. The story was quite complex and there wasn't a great amount of travelling as in the first three books, more interaction between characters and a deeper plot. Having read the first three books, reading number four was a lot easier as I understood the societies and the background. (I do recommend reading the 'Robert Jordan's Wheel of time' for geater understanding.) There was less of 'what age is that? What on earth is a fade? and such, but more 'Perrin, you can't do that.' and 'Mat! Oh my God, I can't read on.' sort of thing. I thought the books would get less enjoyable as the series went on (As most series do), but this book totally turned it around. It made me laugh, it made me cry and at one point I refused to read it for a fear of what might happen. I enjoyed this book because no matter how the plot goes, all the characters are human. They aren't all innocent and pure, or all evil (except the 'Dark one'). They have faults and are not always right. Rand was much better in this book, I felt. He was less unsure and more determined. Mat was the same, but I love Mat they way he is and Perrin's character was more matured and defined (The interaction with Faile really made me smile, It was like 'Wow, couples really act like that, not always 'love struck' and romantic). This was the best book ever and all I can say is 'read it yourself, and all will become clear'."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan triumphs in this, the fourth volume of his grand, epic, and best-selling fantasy series. This characters grow, the narrative matures, and the already complex plot twists and turns until the reader is either swept up in the storm or left bewildered. The Shadow Rising is an intesnse and tasking novel, but the patience required is well worth the wait.In Shadow Rising, we find Rand meeting the Aiel in the wastes, discovering both who the Aiel are and more about himself. This plot line is one of the more interesting and epic in the novel. Here, Jordan eschews the simplistic narrative style he started with in The Wheel of Time, and Rand experiences a series of dream sequences. This gives the novel a richer and more complex texture. That makes it more intereting, but also harder to follow. Readers who expect just more swords and blood will likely be left bored and disappointed (at least until the action quotient picks up).We also see Elayne and Nanyeve pursuing the Black Ajah in various places. This forbodes the splitting of the White Tower as well as the coming of more Foresaken.Meanwhile, Perrin learns that the Children of the Light have overridden the Two Rivers and that his homeland is now being terrorized by Trollocs. This sequence is fascinating, because the old Jordan would have made it a straigtforward adventure. The new Jordan has added texture which helps bring Perrin and the Two Rivers folk to life, adding complexity to the narrative in his relationship with Faile, the closing and reopening of the ways, and of the tough choices in challenging the Children, the trollocs and Lord Luc.The novel starts off slow--even slower than the previous three volumes. What makes the novel tough also is that at the beginning, none of the characters is particularly appealing. Rand is a jerk, Mat is boring, and the others seem to have entirely lost any semblence of friendship or even of decency. Jordan seems to have struggled to keep the plot going while making his characters interesting. But when the adventure begins, the characters again become likable.Jordan continues to &quot;pay homage&quot; to Tolkien. The Perrin return to the Two Rivers is, in plot and theme, a retelling of The Scouring of the Shire from Tolkien's Return of The King.The characters, most of whom strarted the series as young adolescents, continue to grow and mature. Jordan's thinly veiled treatment of sexuality is still very adolescent. At a certain point one hope the characters grow even more. We see the beginnings of adulthood in Perrin's relationship with Faile, although one hope that this also begins to show itself in other areas as well. His childish stubbornness in the first charge on the Two Rivers is annoying. Well, there are five more novels to go.With that caveat and the fact the Jordan does not seem to know what to do with Mat, the world Jordan has created has more depth, more magic, and more history than before. The reader also has the very strong feeling that this all comes togethor in some thread, woven into a large tapestry. We can't see the whole picture, but we can feel it out there.Overall, Jordan has taken a fairly simple and straightforward fantasy to a far more complex and nuanced level. The Shadow Rising is intricate and imaginative tour de force--a triumphant fantasy novel."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Book Four of the Wheel of Time is a transition book for the series. Yes, this book has much action, but there is more explaning and revelation of the plot. Where in previous three novels, there was a goal to be acheived, (i.e. Finding the Eye of the World, Finding the Horn, Getting Callandor) this novel acheives nothing specific. It provides a link to whatever follows in the following novels. If I were to compare this series to Tolkien's work, I would say the each of the first three books would be similar to the Hobbit, while the Shadow Rising is similar to The Two Towers, lots of action without much changing.What does happen. Rand leaves Tear with Mat, Egwene, Moraine, and the Aiel to go to the waste. Nyn, Elayne, Julian, and Thom go to Tanchico to hunt the Black Ajah. Perrin, Loial, and Faile go to the Two Rivers to fight Trollocs and Whitecloaks. In Tanchico, the Black Ajah escapes, and Nyn fights one of the forsaken. In the waste, Rand becomes He Who Comes With the Dawn, and finds a teacher in one of the Forsaken. Egwene learns more about dreamwalking. Mat almost dies, but has his memory filled with other soldier's memories. Perring defeats incredible odds, marries Faile, and rescues the Two Rivers.I like this novel because of the development of Mat and Rand who are my favorite characters. I have just finished reading it for the second time and highly recommend reading the series. While someone could start the series from the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd book, too much has occurred to start with the 4th book."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"There are great novels, there are good novels and there are bad novels. What is frustrating thing about the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series is that there is so much that is exceptional within them, so much potential for greatness, that you feel cheated as they fall short. When these books are good, they are very good; but there is so much tripe between the exceptional parts that it is difficult to keep one's interest up.One major problem with these books is that Jordan has created caricatures, not characters, and their character traits are used simply for flavor. As an example, take Nynaeve - she's bossy, stubborn, opiniated, doesn't take advice, and bashes the male characters constantly for little more than &quot;being male&quot;. Yet these traits never push the story forward. Jordan uses them to describe her, to guide her dialogue, but she never pays for these obviously negative traits, never fails because of them, never learns from them. She could be an intensely interesting character, chronicling the growth of a woman who thinks she knows it all into a powerful Aes Sedai who is truly wise, yet as written she is simply annoying (and it's just as annoying that she's getting away with it). I suppose she will become the latter by the end of the series, but I fear it will be unsatisfying.Of the main characters, only Perrin has been allowed to grow, progress and become interesting; all the others (especially the women) are trapped within their cliches, never becoming more than a few emotions and habits.Another major problem is the that &quot;good&quot; side is simply too powerful. There is no situation they get into that they are unable to handle in an immediate fashion. While some plots will take the entire series to resolve, the &quot;tense&quot; situations (which provide an immediate connection to the story) are resolved far too quickly and with too few consequences. Whenever a main character is in a &quot;bind&quot; you can be sure they'll be back in control of the situation by the end of the chapter. The only real &quot;power&quot; of the bad guys is their omnipresence...they can appear anywhere at any time, beyond all logic and reason.The last major problem I'll mention is that for all the enormous power the main characters possess, there are no consequences for using that power (other than the bad guys trying to get you). You'd think that the ability to &quot;channel&quot; a huge amount of energy would come at great cost, or have some potential for backlash that could work against an untrained wielder. This is not the case, and as such channeling becomes like simplistic &quot;Harry Potter&quot; magic. I enjoy the Potter books as much as anyone, but that simplicity seems out of place in this more mature work.I realize I've been very negative here. To be honest there is much to appreciate in these books. The writing is very good, the descriptions are beyond complete, the scenes effective and the world he's created is compelling. If only Jordan had the ability of a George R.R. Martin concerning character development and plot twists, these would be classics."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Awesome book. As good as the rest of the series. Deserves 5 stars. A really good read."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Still keeping the same Trolloc-buttkicking plot (with other twists to keep us comin' back for more!), the Shadow Rising is as good as ever, if a bit slow at times. The events in Tanchico and the author finally doing something with this Bors person (not to mention the whole Ordeith/Fain thing) keep you on the balls of your feet up until the very end. A great series, and an especially great book, (although I can say I liked The Great Hunt a bit more) HIGHLY recommended to ANYONE who likes fantasy."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This whole series, right from Book 1, has been absolutely fantastic, and each book is better than the last! (Although Book 1 was right in there with the rest of them.) Mr. Jordan keeps adding new plot twists, and I must say, he's come up with some pretty surprising developments! The appearance of the Black Ajah in Book 2, Ordeith and the Aiel/People of the Dragon in Book 3, Rand, as usual, keeps everyone on their toes and 1 step behind at all times. The girls come up with a...strange...way of keeping in touch over long distances. This is a true literary masterpiece! Everyone needs to read this series, and this book especially! It really clears up a lot of mysteries that went unanswered through the first three books."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"It's a great story. Jordan definitely has something here. His only flaw is writing every book as if new readers were jumping in in the middle of the series. He explains everything over again, wasting words. Other than that, it's wonderful."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The book is brillant in my opinion as are all the the WOT books, yet no book is perfect (although The Great Hunt was right up there) and for one am not going to criticise, just have a little winge. Yes buy now in the series (after the Dragon Reborn) we are all to familiar with the females (Aes Sedai, Min and Faile) and by crikey they really start to get on your nerves, with their eternal criticism of the male sex. With that said it\`s Jordans world and that\`s how people are so like it or lump it. The Guys yes well, still killing trollocs and winning pouches of gold. The battle scenes in Shadow Rising are brillant and in looking back the wheel of time has truly turned for these Two Rivers folk. All in all Shadow Rising is typical WOT and after Dragon Reborn quite refreshing. It is nice to get back to Rand although it seems we have missed quite a bit since Falme to Tear, quite like the gaps in Matrims memory. Stick with it guys it makes the finales all the more worth it.Groundzero."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I loved Shadow Rising.

Books one and two were really great. Book three was good for the first 200 and the last 200 pages but I was still interested. But book four was absolutely boring. I felt as if nothing was happenning.

I just finished the fourth book (which I was told by many was the best) to reach the conclusion that I only have so much time on my hands, and reading 700-1000 page books whose endings are generally no surpsise don't cut it anymore. There's a monetary and chronological cost to reading WoT, and although I enjoy most chapters (the finale in Two Rivers is Jordan's best yet), it's just not worth the effort.Jordan should also split up books when characters go different routes - I have no interest whatsoever in hearing Nynaeve tug her braids any more - she is the single most annoying character I've ever come across. Should there be a WoT book on Perrin alone, I will buy it."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I thought this was surprisingly good. I thought it was much better than the first three. I recommend this book to all who love fantasy."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Right away, let me tell you, I rate this a 6 out of 10. After giving each main character lovely detail and promises of further revelation in The Dragon Rebown, Jordan bogs down quite a bit.Egwene loves to learn. Naturally. This was hinted at. When she is called to learn about her dreams and how to control that world of her identity, is there any style or depth to it? How about a fascinating journey into learning and dreams? Nope, just a bunch of naked ladies running around in a deserted waste.When Mat hears he has a future which contradicts his raucous lifestyle, does he grow from it, does Jordan use it as a launching point of some great statement? Nope. Mat just becomes stubborn, futile and begins to become unlikable.When Perrin's strength is finally challenged by a female of far more strength inside, is the revelation heart wrenching and saddening? Nope. It feels like a bickering episode of the Beverly Hillbillies amidst WWII heroics. In the return to Emond'! s Field, a great reward is given to avid readers in old, charming characters being resurrected, but their lack of action makes them more like nicely painted chess pieces. What is, undeniably, the crux of the book, the holding off of the massive Trolloc army is written very well if you can stand Jordan's cynical points he feels he must make _for_ the reader.Nynaeve and Elayne start losing appeal (like Nynaeve was ever anything but a complete dominatrix who needs to have her braid chopped off in the first place) as the massive sex war starts in this book and serves to loosen the maturity of the series with what is ironically, subject for mature readers.And Rand. Good ol' Rand. When he experiences the only other link to the series' promising philosophy, the Wheel of Time, Jordan fails to deliver with a world with sounds all too much like technology. Even if this adds some much needed historical depth and fantastic detail to the series, it is not used well at all. Rand is al! ready a pain in the arse to read about because of his arrog! ance and biting cynicism, as well as Jordan's recycled duty metaphors and idiotly masculine behavior. Secrets. Keep them, because you're a man! Pat your chest and pound the Aiel spear! Surround in two billion plodding details and you have...dull, uninspired reading, with an ending that is hilarious because it is so pathetic.Jordan, right here, right now, let me assure you. You blew it."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"&quot;The Shadow Rising&quot; is my favorite book of the Wheel of Time series so far. It is a fast-paced page turner where each of our intrepid heroes and heroines are all involved in some important part of the plot. Unlike a couple of other books in this series that can read like travelogues, this one is brim full of action and revelation. A lot happens, the plot moves, questions are answered, (and even more are left unanswered), history of a people is discovered, destinies are revealed and a war is fought. A very satisfying read that will keep you sated until you get to the next book."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"In this age of television attention spans, it is wonderful that a contemporary author can take the time to create his own history and develop believable characters that have substance. The Shadow rising is a book which does to the Wheel of Time Series what Empire Strikes Back did to Star Wars, it allows the enemy a chance to be developed into the true evil it should be, setting the stage for the final confrontation. A must read for Fantasy Fans as well as those of us out there who actually enjoy good writing and imagination."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book goes into detail about the Aiel (The coolest people in RandLand).Who could not love this book?

It cant get any better.FOR GOODNESS SAKES, READ IT!"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Jordan uses description, settings, people, and philosophy with the skill of Faulkner, Twain, and Dickens. He even goes so far as to make the material enjoyable and brings a fantasy world to life. Unfortunately, all of his talent appears to dry up in the last 3 chapters. In these final 3 chapters, his descriptions are sketchy, the writing is jumbled, and he changes his descriptive style by forcing the cumulation of many unanswered questions and plots into a few pages. Changing writing styles so dramatically destroys the 628 pages he used to develop these questions and plots. The reader is either left wondering why Jordan didn't take the time to finish the book properly; or instead condense the whole book to 200 pages or less. Inspite of this small flaw I will continue to read his work and enjoy them."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I loved this book. I think the Wheel of Time series is great and I think this was the best so far. It has a lot more about the Aiel, and the rest of the world.

Yes, Nynaeve, Elayne and Aviendha are lousy characters. Yes, this is where what appears to be a structural sexism in Jordan's writing is blatantly confirmed.HOWEVER, Jordan's talents - for recasting (some say plagiarizing, but I fervently disagree - it's called genre convention, folks!) archetypes and symbols is at its peak, and some of the most emotional moments in the whole series occur here: particularly Perrin's return to the Two Rivers - this is the plot thread I enjoy the most. The subtleties of Aiel culture were a real drawcard as well. Rand - at last - is getting a grip on strategy and even on channeling. The scenes at Al'cair Dal and Emonds Field are among the most memorable of the series, equalling the submission of the Aes Sedia at Dumai's Well (vol. 6), the cleansing of saidin (vol. 9) and the climax of the Great Hunt (vol. 2).Its a shame so much focus has (by and large) been lost since."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Well, I thought this book was wonderful! I love the proggression of Perrin, but some people might think that he was mentioned to much. Poor Rand! He must choose between Min, Aviendha, Elayne, and his brotherly feelings toward Egwene. Faile is a rather annoying little chit. She controls everything! Mat is sooooooo interesting. I wish that he would have gone into the ter'angreal with Rand, at Rudhiean. It would have been cool to see what his past ancestors did, and to have him, a wetlander at that, become a clan cheif. Egwene and her bunch are too prominent in this book, half of the book is about their terrible lives."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"this is a great book. everyone had a great role in this, especially Perrin, with his going back to the Two Rivers and the mixed up romance with Faile, which started in the Dragon Reborn. then Rand's romance with Elayne and the beggining of his one with Avhienda. Elayne and Nynaeve went to Tanchico with Juilin Sanders and Thom Merilin and Rand, Mat, Egwene, Moirane and Lan go to the aile waste. the only downside is the beggining where there is 200 pages of ____. but its good, probably as good as the Fires of Heaven, which was one of my favorite books ever. Read this book."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"There is little comparison to this one, all my friends that have read this series agree with me that this stands alone in its creativity, riskiness, adventure, character development, enjoyment... ok the list goes on. Basically I'll do a quick little review of the others leading up to this, since I doubt I'll review them individually: Book 1 Wheel of Time set it up but feels oddly segregated from the rest of the series, even if the majority of main characters are introduced here, so I'd give it an 8/10. Book 2 The Great Hunt certainly picks up the pace with quite a few character developments and a kick-shove into Jordan's world of magic that takes your breath away and leaves you begging for more, so this is definately a 9/10. Book 3 The Dragon Reborn seemed like it'd be the highlight with a title like that, but almost slacked-off the pace with very few chapters from Rand's perspective and only one really great twist to the end, so I give it an 8/10.Finally we reach this one, the great one, one of the best fantasy books I've ever read: 10/10 easily. Every anty you can think of us upped in this book: characters are richer, enemies are trickier, twists are some of the best seen in any genre, and every character gets his share of the glory and grandeur of the storyline. Let's hear it for Perrin! The series drops off this climb like a boulder plummeting down a cliff after about Book 6, but you should enjoy Book 5 after this one, it doesn't disappoint, just not nearly as inventive."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"So Far, this book has been my favorite.

Read and appreciate."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book marks the beginning of a change in the characters that, so far, have been shown as naive and somewhat timid youngsters. As they have more responsibility and duty laid upon them, they adapt into stronger, more forceful personalities, and by the end of the book, are all quite different to what they were at the end of book 3.Jordan does a very good job of carrying this out, the characters still act in a familiar way, they just reveal a stonger side to themselves. He has avoided the pitfalls in this area which would have led to botched characters that are completly different people to those followed in the first 3 books. TSR is a very strong book aside from the skilful character develepment too, it introduces the Aiel properly, who are always extremely refreshing and entertaining to read about. And we see Rand finally beginning to get to grips with the One Power, which has so far proven a very fickle gift. It also is split neatly into 3 separate plots, with their own separate climaxes, interspaced by sub-plots that are all entertaining to read. Jordan has done well with this book; it takes bold strides forward from the last one, and ends on a note which promises more in books to come."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I've read the entire series of The Wheel of Time, and, so far, this one is the best.

It felt a bit different than RJ's work, a bit lack luster but I will get the final book and finish the tail with my imagination inserting how RJ writes into the book if I find it out of his character.

The new writer for books 13 and beyond is very good. RIP Mr. Jordan."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This one is all about history.One of the things that makes the world of Wheel of Time so attractive is that it is clear from the outset that Robert Jordan put a lot of work into the world of his story before he actually started the story itself. I get the feeling, reading these books, that he could tell you everything that happened here for the last four thousand years, if not more. In detail, with names and dates and places, all off the top of his head. Or at least from his copious sheafs of notes.In this book, the emphasis on history is most clear when Rand goes out to meet the Aiel. For those of you with a taste for classic sci-fi, the Aiel resemble the Fremen from Frank Herbert's Dune books. They're desert people, and unsurpassed warriors, with a complex system of honor and obligation. There's where the similarities end, of course - in these books there is no Spice, there are no sandworms, and no one in this would would ever think they could conquer the Aiel. Twenty years prior to the start of the series, four of the twelve Aiel clans crossed the mountainous barrier into the \\"wetlands\\" with the singular purpose of killing King Laman of Cairhien. Those four clans alone broke every army that stood against them, and only returned to their desert because they got what they wanted - Laman's head on a pike.No one knew why they had done this. Prior to the Aiel War, the nation of Cairhien had exclusive rights of passage through the waste, a gift that they didn't understand, and ultimately didn't fully appreciate. But without those rights, and without the offense that King Laman caused, and without the Aiel retaliation, this story never would have begun.Reading this book, you start to get a better view of the historical context in which it is placed, and nowhere is that clearer than in Rand al'Thor's trip into Rhuidean, the forbidden city of the Aiel. Any man who wants to become a clan chief, or any woman who wants to become a Wise One, may go there, but only once and twice, respectively. What they learn is their final test - the true history of their people. Those who cannot face the truth do not come back. Stronger men and women go on to become leaders, but never speak of what they saw. In order to fulfill his destiny, Rand must learn the history of the people he was born from, and by doing so, change the world.It's a fascinating sequence, actually - it's the history of the Aiel from the day the hole was bored into the Dark One's prison, through fifteen generations of the Aiel as refugees until the establishment of the city of Rhuidean itself, only told backwards. We find out why they never touch swords, why they veil their faces, and why they believe they are punished for sinning against the Aes Sedai. We get to see the incredible changes that occurred in only three or four hundred years, and then reflect that the time span we see only covers a small portion of the time that has elapsed since the Breaking of the World. We truly begin to understand how broken the world was and how hard life became, once we compare the hardened warrior Aiel to their Da'shain Aiel ancestors. It's a fascinating and moving story, and it serves as an excellent centerpiece to the novel.History rests in other places as well through the book. Mat gains the memories of two thousand years, in a surprising exchange with otherworldly entities in a land beyond a twisted red doorway. We learn that the Sea Folk are looking for their Chosen One, just like everyone else, and Elayne and Nynaeve are pretty sure it's Rand. They're off to Tanchico to look for an artifact that could prove Rand's undoing if the Black Ajah or the Forsaken get their hands on it first.In fact, speaking of history, there has been a lot of speculation over the years on how the world of this book is related to our world. There are clues scattered about that suggest it is our extreme future - fairy tales about Anla, the Wise Counselor, Materese, Mother of the Wondrous Ind, and Lenn who rode to the moon in the belly of a fiery eagle (who could be Ann Landers, Mother Theresa and John Glenn, respectively). Jordan never came right out and said whether this is our world's future or not, but a short passage in this book dropped a pretty big hint. While looking around a palace in Tanchico for the artifact that could harm Rand, Nynaeve travels the Dream World into a museum of antiquities. There, she sees many things that amaze and baffle her - fossils of extinct animals, for example often with some kind of emotional resonance. In her search, she finds this:A silvery thing in another cabinet, like a three-pointed star inside a circle, was made of no substance she knew; it was softer than metal, scratched and gouged, yet even older than any of the ancient bones. From ten paces, she could sense pride and vanity.If that ain't a Mercedes-Benz hood ornament, I'll eat my library.Over in the White Tower, history is being made as Siuan Sanche becomes only the third Amyrlin Seat in history to be deposed in a move orchestrated by the hardest of the Red Ajah, Elaida a'Roihan. And all around, the shadow is indeed rising - the Forsaken are out there, building their power and waiting for Rand so that they might defeat him before he battles their master, the Dark One.But the best part of the book, in my opinion, is none of these. The best part centers around Perrin Aybara, the young blacksmith who was one of the original three young men to travel out of the Two Rivers on that spring night long ago.Back in The Great Hunt, the vile Darkfriend Padan Fain challenged Rand to meet him - failure to do so would result in pain and suffering brought down on all those whom he loved. Through circumstances not entirely under his control, Rand never got to meet Fain, though he did manage to cause him great inconvenience nonetheless. Fain meant to keep his promise, though, and in this book that promise is realized. The Two Rivers has been under siege by creatures from the Shadow - Trollocs and Myrddraal - and less Dark, though still not very nice Children of the Light, an army of zealots who sees Darkfriends in everyplace they look. Rand can't go home to help - his destiny lies in the Aiel Waste - and Mat's destiny lies with Rand. Egwene has to go to the Waste as well, to learn Dreamwalking from the Wise Ones, and Nynaeve is off to Tanchico to hunt the Black Ajah.That leaves only Perrin, who goes back to his home to find it a very different place. He and Faile, the Hunter for the Horn whom he loves, along with Loial and three Aiel, travel back to the Two Rivers and Emond's Field to put paid to the Trollocs and see that the people there are safe. In the process, Perrin the blacksmith's apprentice finds himself becoming far more than he ever thought he would be.This sequence is one of my favorites in the series thus far, and I'm including all the books that come after this one. It's written with such depth of character, and the relationship between Perrin and Faile is built with such care that every scene between them resonates with emotion and meaning. In one book, Jordan has taken a character who had been the least interesting of all the protagonists, and made him into the one you care the most about. It's not for nothing that Jordan gave Perrin an entire book off in The Fires of Heaven.The historical insight we have gained here will help us along through the rest of the series, as we take a broader look at the world as it is in the present. Every character, not just Perrin, is changed and moved forward, if not always in likable ways, and we get the real sense that a new history is being made right now. We know that stories will be told of Perrin Goldeneyes for generations to come in the Two Rivers, that Elayne and Nynaeve will become legends among Aes Sedai, though whether as heroes or object lessons we can't be sure yet, and that the fate of the future rests not on Rand's back alone. He makes the Aiel face their past, and those who can survive the ordeal will be the shapers of the future.The thousand or so pages of this volume can drag, if you're not paying attention to what's going on. The history of Rhuidean is a good example - the first time I read it, I was really confused and didn't really see the point of the whole thing - I wished it had focused less on the post-Breaking history and more on the Age of Legends, with its jo-cars and hoverflies, the Nym and the Ogier and the Da'shain Aiel working together. But once you give it thought - why it was vital that the clan chiefs and Wise Ones remember, and how the events of nearly three thousand years ago directly led to the birth of Rand al'Thor and the very story we are reading, it goes from being a slog to an adventure.Still, I recommend taking notes.----------------------------------------------------\\"Rand al'Thor may be lucky if the next Age remembers his name correctly.\\"- Thom Merrilin----------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I love Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, and so this book was a perfect fit in my library collection of hard cover books. I received it in excellent condition, and was very pleased with the service, and over all purchase experience."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"If you liked the first 4 books, you'll like this one. This is the one where things move past the beginning level adventure and into the nitty gritty. If you haven't read the first 4 books...do it. Start with the Eye of the World."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I started by being a fan of Terry Goodkind...and it took me a while to get into this series. But this book finally grabbed me.My favorite of the series so far, lost of action and suspense."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This has always been my favorite book of the series. That it should never have come to pass and that this series should have ended at three is something I have mentioned in my series of reviews before. The backstory of this particular book, or the set-up takes a full third of the book to get thru.We have a technique that Jordan has used before, in this book which shows us that often no amount of read and find out, his RAFO term that is a disservice to fans of the series and if he were still being raised you could scold him for it by some authority figure that Jordan might listen to. Instead Jordan's Hubris is such that he would use RAFO often and it is clear at least here, that he does things for which he does not think of the consequence.Men can channel, so why do we have our male lead hero (we have several by now) lose it with a miasma of the power leaking thru. (If you are afraid of spoilers in these reviews, my reviews are of my many times reread, and this being the fourth book of the series (fifth with the prequel) you should have some idea of what has happened and what will happen.)Oh the Aes Sedai covers the gaff and says that these things happen. Rand has been able to channel since book 1, and this is the first time it has happened. And it will not happen again. So a better name for the problem and better explanation should have been done.But why do I think this book is so good... Perrin and the Two Rivers. Here Perrin really develops. In the very first book and the others since, we break up our questers into various groups, once again three as one group is Rand, one is the near Aes Sedai girls searching for the Black Ajah, and Perrin.The sequence that takes place in the Two Rivers has always been amongst the best best i felt that was written, still (I have read all of it up to the 11th book.) Rand and his walk through the Aiel Waste could have been better I think, why just clan chiefs and a small honor guard. Why not the dream messages to the clan chiefs summoning the entire clans on the move. Rand wants an army to use.He has learned a little in two years away from being a sheepherder, and he has more to learn. But as he talks to himself he wants to assemble a force. He knows he wants an army, he has delayed the sense of urgency he keeps harking on.With the third leg of the quest we begin the world is so large I forget who I have whose met who problem. Thom Merrilin spent several days aboard Bayle Domon's boat, and they both know Floran Gelb. It would seem that they should acknowledge each other, why keep it secret, they can trust each other, and a run in with Gelb would surely have been a resolution to that bad person, who is just bad and not a Darkfriend.Then there is Byar and Bornhold. Perrin emerges as a good leader but he is shortsighted when it comes to these two. Bornhold also is not written convincingly. First he cares about the people he is charged to protect then he doesn't. Certainly does not have any of his fathers genes... These little quibbles are something that Jordan, or someone who could have talked to Jordan, could have made better. Life does have inconsistencies, but not so significant ones.Overall, the series is still worth constant rereading. and a very good time of it. Worth the price of admission and then some. And now rumors of movies... I hope that transition to the screen is handled as well as Tolkein. It is all worth it."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I finished this book this evening, and am rather unsure how to go about even reviewing it, let alone assigning it a star rating.When I first started reading it, I was enthusiastic, but that quickly waned. The first third of the book felt like a history textbook. Dates, names, places. Political plots, too-detailed descriptions of things. \\"Wool-headed men\\", \\"unfathomable women\\", \\"Rand/Mat/Perrin knows about girls\\" memes kept on to the point of annoyance. And when things did start to move, we'd shift to a different set of actors in similar boring activities. I almost stopped reading.And then it all changed. Everything I loved about the series came back. The story pulled me in. The characters were again vivid. The shifts in location were mostly acceptable (though sometimes frustrating). New friends, new enemies, and we're not always sure which is which.The time with the Aiel was priceless, even though it did repeat the \\"wool-headed men\\" (or \\"wetlander\\") theme way more than needed.The ending to this book was good, but not great as the endings to the first three were. Yes, there was a triumph of sorts, but very little was resolved, and there was some sadness there on the last page. (And no, this is not a spoiler, it's a minor detail.)If it had a better start, or even a typically grand ending, I'd have probably given it 4 stars. But I just can't bring myself to do so just now."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"With the Shadow Rising, Jordan's narrative takes a turn away from mainly adventure mode, and starts mixing in a lot of political intrigue. It's not too bad in this book, but it definitely becomes a problem in later books. The trip to Rhuidean produces numerous repercussions down the road, and the historical backstory is quite interesting and adds good depth. However, it was in this book that Faile really grated on me, and I can't help but cringe every time I see her name in subsequent books. This is also the last book where all plot lines complete the mission they set out to do within the same book. Overall, a good read and relatively tight narrative."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The entire Wheel of Time Series is phenomenal the first time around, but even better the second. A familiarity with the characters provides even deeper insight, making them more like a family than a novel. Even for the first time through, this one delivers new character, shows the growth of the familiar characters, and in true Jordan style, has plot twists you'll never suspect. This book is faster paced than some of the later books, and full of intimate details, the like of which Jordan is famous for. Enjoy this one when you can read it through for a concentrated dose of The Wheel of Time!"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book was SO unecessarily long, but in the end, I loved it and thought it was possibly the best yet in the Wheel of Time series. First, I'd like to give props to the online WOT encyclopedia, which details all thousand+ characters (and their duplicate/triplicate names) in the saga that you might have forgotten about up until this point. You won't believe what perils await Perrin, and I don't mean Trollocs. His girl is about as obnoxious as they get, until the development of other girls in the story. Such a shame to see something like that happen to such a cool hero. I'm just glad I've never met women even close to this whack. But something wierd happened as I read this book - I actually didn't want Nynaeve to die. Nynaeve has become much less annoying. Moraine's lines are basically that same old as the wheel turns comment, and little else. This book also contains one of the most dragged out and ridiculous breakout scenes I've ever read. Will our hero Rand fulfill the prophecy of the Aiel? Be prepared to meet a lot of fremen...I mean Aiel characters. Will Rand slay the nefarious Asmodean? Find out here!!! If you have a life, this 980-page small-fonted long-winded and repetetive beast will take some time to read, but it's enjoyable."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The story is entertaining and most the characters (all male) are realistic and enjoyable but the women are just too annoying. I've never read a book with so many occurences of people glaring at one another. Robert Jordan needs to cut most of the bickering between characters and move this story along. The reviews for these books only go downhill from here so I'm doing what Matt should have done; left the women behind. Shame on Jordan's editor too. It's their job to cut out the crap and this book is gold buried in a huge pile of crap."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The usual cast of interesting characters and a (relatively) fast moving plot generate enough action to maintain the reader's interest. The tale of the seige of Two Rivers with the intertwined love story of Perrin and Faile is very well done. There is even progress in some of the other threads in this bloated epic.Unfortunately, this is the last book in the series worth the time or money. Someone desperately needs to remind Mr. Jordan that he's not getting paid by the word. Of course, if he is it would explain a lot about the agonizingly slow and plodding nature of the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The seals binding the Dark One in his prison are ever weakening.

(I hope) this one took me a bit longer to read, mainly because I just couldn't get into it at all. It was, however, a good book because you got to know the others characters better. Like Perrin always had that window dressing theme until this book, and Mat got a better look, it was ... interesting to see what make him tick. I was relived to see the three boys start acting like young men rather than the past &quot;goody two-shoes&quot; they all seemed to be growing up. I love how shy Perrin is and also how life like. I loved the book mainly because I loved getting more of Perrin. I reccomend reading this book just for the insight on the characters besides Rand."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I'm really distressed because when I was reading this book I realized that there might be a mistake. Master Bayle Domon was supposed to have met Thom Merrilin in 'The Eye of the World' because he almost stumbled in his ship fleeing from some Trolocs. This happened just before they arrive in Whitebridge. Then, when they meet again in Tanchico they don't seem to know each other. Is this a mistake or am I wrong? What the heck was Mr. Jordan thinking about when he wrote this Chapter?

I could not read the pages fast enough."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is just a terrible book. That's too bad, because the first three were so good. Robert Jordan tries to put too much romance in this one, and it comes across as lame. The plot isn't nearly as epic or dramatic as the previous three. This book, in fact, has caused me to stop reading the series. For newcomers, I reccomend reading the first 3 books. For fans looking into #4, skip it."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Okay, some of you may have read my negative reviews for The Eye of the World and Dragon Reborn. I've also written a positive, 3 star, review for The Great Hunt (the best in the series so far). Well, despite all my complaining about the series and Jordan as a writer (he's a lousy writer), I'm still churning away (I've just started book 5). The Wheel of Time, I've realized, is just a soap opera. And I'm embarrassed to say, I'm hooked!That said, The Shadow Rising is easily the most entertaining since The Great Hunt. The Aiel are indeed quite interesting. Nevertheless, I'm put off by this book's sexism. Now, I had always suspected that Jordan's writing bordered on the edge of extended male fantasy (why do the novices in Tar Valon have to undress before passing through the arches? Why does Jordan again and again refer to such-and-such female character as crossing her arms under her breasts? Why does Mat view every woman, from Moraine to the Queen of Andor, as kissable?) But in the previous novels, Jordan's chauvinism at least TRIED to be subtle. In The Shadow Rising, Jordan throws all caution to the wind. Mat and Rand wander down to Rhuidean fully-clothed, but Moraine and Aviendha, poor women, have to strip down to their birthday suits and dart off to the Aiel city without a stitch of clothing. Rand faces Berelain, who's dressed to tease, while Mat flirts with every plump servant girl in the Stone of Tear. Later, the Aiel Wise Ones, along with Moraine and Egwene, hold a serious discussio--about Rand-- completely nude in a sort-of Aiel sauna! Nynaeve and Elayne, while in Tanchico, are constantly in either their shifts or some tight, revealing dress. Aviendha, when talking to Rand, cannot stop mentioning how nice Elayne's body looked once while taking a bath. Throw in some female shipwrights who set sail, if you can believe it, completely shirtless, and I'm at a loss for words.Lastly, and perhaps most sexist, every woman in this novel is fighting over Rand. Egwene loved him, but gives him up for Elayne. Elayne loves him, but she's got to be wary of Min. Lanfear has the hots for Rand and, I'm going out on a limb here, it seems that Aviendha may also have feelings. Other reviews that compliment Jordan's strong female characters are way off the mark. If anything, Jordan's females are surprisingly weak, wielding so much power yet still allowing themselves to stumble, awkwardly, schoolgirl-like over the men around them. These women need some self-esteem. Hey, here's what the world needs, a Chicken Soup For the Channeling Soul self-help book!P.S. I've started book five and the first chapter has Leane (yes, prudish, awkward Leane, former Keeper/Assistant to the Amrylin) flirting like a hussy with Gaebril Byrne. Really, Mr. Jordan, if you're reading this, find another outlet for all this stored-up sexual energy. I'll buy you a one-year subscription to Playboy. You can consider it an early Christmas present :)"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is one of the best series I have read.

However, what the Shadow Rising acts upon is Jordan's perfection in highlighting the development of secondary characters. This book is not written all through Rand's point of view as he explores the Aiel Waste but also through the point of views of Nynaeve/Elayne as they battle the Black Ajah and Perrin as he returns to the Two Rivers to aid them in a fight against the forces of the Shadow and Whitecloaks.

It helps me see how the psalms relate to my personal life as well as how to use the psalms as part of my prayer life. If it were not such a helpful part of my daily prayer life, I would not still be using it. The commentary that Dr. Quillo provides in italics that runs down the outer edge of the page next to each psalm helps to relate the concepts in the psalms to contemporary spiritual and life issues. The only way the book could be better, in my opinion, would be if it used, instead of the New Revised Standard Version, the translation of the Psalms copyright 1963 by the Grail that is used in the Liturgy of the Hours and the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary, for this is the translation that is, to my knowledge, best known and loved by Roman Catholics who have personal prayer lives centered around the Liturgy of the Hours or the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary."},{"Title":"The Psalms: Prayers of Many Moods","review":"We are using this book for a ladies bible study.

All too often in the retelling of the history of art, the Symbolists get left out entirely, or at least are not considered as a movement, unlike the much better known and more highly celebrated Impressionists. Yet, there are some very good reasons for anyone interested in late 19th century culture in the wider sense to know more about the Symbolists. For one thing, the movement produced a number of very interesting painters, including Bourne-Jones, Moreau, Rossetti, and others. In addition, other artists not primarily considered Symbolists had close ties to them, especially Gaugin. A number of painters coming after Symbolism were very much influenced by the movement, including Franz Marc, Munch, Klimt, and the young Picasso through the Blue Period.This last alone would be sufficient to reconsider their work, but Symbolism, unlike Impressionism, was a movement that extended well beyond painting and sculpture to include poetry and literature. In fact, the number of literary artists influenced by Symbolism far outstrips those working in the arts. Not merely Huysmans, but Yeats, Valery, Joyce, Eliot, Mallarme, and Proust were all indebted to one degree or other to Symbolist themes or concerns."},{"Title":"Symbolist Art","review":"Wonderful book for art research. Short and very to the point, but also throughly informative on the different artists that manifested the ideals of the Symbolists. The vivid pictures, half in color, half in black and white, are filled with dreamlike images and an escapist attitude that the fin de siecle embodied."},{"Title":"Symbolist Art","review":"Great introductory book on Symbolism. I learned a great deal from it. It's well written with terrific art prints for a paperback book."},{"Title":"The fairy-faith in Celtic countries,","review":"This book was written in the early twentieth century, and my opinion is that no faery book has yet been written to equal it. Evans-Wentz was a sophisticated scholar, and yet treated faery beliefs with the utmost of respect, and even devoted a chapter to scientific and psychological findings that render such beliefs valid. Without looking down his nose on anyone (except maybe stuffy fellow scholars who lost their imagination somewhere along the line), he reports stories of faery encounters in every Celtic nation. He interviewed great numbers of Celtic people in his travels, and collected a vast treasure trove of tales. These range from firsthand accounts to &quot;a friend of a friend&quot; legends to stories handed down through the generations.After presenting a mass of information on the modern faery faith, he goes on to relate the ancient faery beliefs held by the Celts of old, as recorded in their mythology. Many pages are devoted to the adventures of CuChulainn, Arthur, Bran, and other figures who moved in and out of the Otherworld. He also discusses the Otherworld itself, the misty land where the faeries, the gods, and the dead dwelled. Especially stunning is his assertion that the Celts participated in mysteries much like those of Eleusis. The mythological evidence IS THERE, as Evans-Wentz proves. I only wish someone in those days had written something down to indicate whether or not this is true!This is the best book ever written on the fae, IMHO. It ought to be on every Celtophile's shelf right next to Squire's _Celtic Myth and Legend_. As a matter of fact, the two books make excellent companions for one another."},{"Title":"The fairy-faith in Celtic countries,","review":"...to what others have said.There is no book on this subject I have found that equals it.This is a testament in itself, as this was first published around 1890.Wentz was an academic, a scholar, yet in early chapters his descriptions of each area of the Isles is breathtaking. It's not dry, it's not stuffy. He spent years collecting encounters, traditions, and beliefs from the most correct source. The people themselves. This contrasts rightfully the tendancy (even more so these days with anything Celtic especially) to project things onto a culture it does not contain. No frilly, watered down, ... little creatures at your beck and call here, which is what other \\"authors\\" would have you believe.For some, the latter chapters of this book will seem a bit dry compared to the first. Regardless of what you think of his theories, they are all intriguing, and well thought out by the author, though I agree he became a bit enchanted himself during the writing. (not a bad thing, IMO, I was enchanted as well) The collection of tales alone is worth the price. I enjoyed every page.This should be on the shelf of anyone who says they want to learn about Faeries, Celts, and the cultures they came from.Why read what any old outsider says? Read the words of the people who were born and raised in these cultures. They know themselves better than anyone else, no?"},{"Title":"The fairy-faith in Celtic countries,","review":"Walter Evans-Wentz set out to write this book as his dissertation, at the dawn of academic anthropology. Along the way, he became more than a little entranced. Still, Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries is one of the best, and most important, scholarly works on the topic, and I strongly recommend it. Don't get sucked into buying a lot of phoney 'fairies-with-wings' junk. The real deal is much more interesting. Stick to Rev. Kirk, Peter Narvaez, K.M.

Almost every page is defaced by art that's silly, cartoony, and does little to illustrate or advance the author's argument.An even worse crime against Evans-Wentz's work is the incompetent typesetting.

I think this is possibly the most accessible book to describe the REAL fairy faith that has been written.

The belief in the unseen world of fairies and its \\"Fairy Faith\\" was changing with the times.

Newly divorced, determined to be independent, and robbed of her meager funds, Josephine accepts employment as the cook on a trail drive. There is only one problem: Josephine doesn't know how to boil water. Until four months ago she was worth four million dollars. Now she is destitute and despised by former so-called friends. Dismayed to find the Western town of Sienna unlike the description in the Beadle novel, Josephine squares her shoulders to face reality. The death of her father stamped &quot;closed&quot; on her former life; all bridges to the East burned behind her as the train sped West.J. D. McCall knows to take a pretty woman on a rugged trail drive is akin to folly, but Josephine is the only one who applies for the cook's position. Trail-hands will tolerate almost anything but bad grub. Dressed in a gown of silk, Josephine looks nothing like a cook, but she assures J. D. pan-fried beef is her specialty. By coincidence it is the favorite meal of all the cowboys at the McCall ranch. The way the touch of her hand, the smell of her perfume, the warmth of her smile makes J.D. feel has no bearing on his decision to hire her. What he feels is just an anomaly. He will survive it like all of the other illness he's contracted. At least that's his plan until the first time his lips feel the delicate brush of her mouth. When the sparks die, and earth again begins to rotate, J.D. is a doomed man. Prim and proper Josephine Whittaker lists his heart as her new residence.Josephine's first attempts at cooking prove disastrous. Yet, what is a newly independent woman to do but try again. Determined to earn enough money to settle in San Francisco, she takes the recipe book as her bible. However, nowhere in the cookbook is there a formula to cure the way J.D. makes her feel. His first kiss literally curls the toes in her shoes. The mere touch of his hand and her will-power flies South with the migrating birds.Josephine and J.D. battle more than trail dust on the long journey to the Spring pasture: fears of failure, old memories, and the constant presence of the cowboys play a tug-of-war with the lover's burgeoning emotions.Stef Ann Holm writes an unforgettable novel filled with insight, memorable characters, and picturesque narrative. The original plot moves at a quick pace, but never looses it way. The dialog works to enhance the storyline, and clarifies the images of her characters. Ms. Holm's ability to understand the working of a shattered heart is nothing short of marvelous. Her empathy and insight create a book to cherish.Kathee S.

Imagine having all your money and worldly possession mistakenly taken. Imagine applying for the job of ranch cook in order to survive and you have never cooked a meal. Imagine falling in love with a man whose own mother abandoned him as a child and who has no time for a fragile city girl. If you can imagine yourself in this situation, you're, Josephine Wittaker, the heroine of &quot;Forget Me Not&quot;.On the surface, the book is filled with humor. Some scenes are absolutely hilarious, but under the humor is much much more. The book is about relationships, about people who've been hurt and who're learning to trust and love again. One of the novel's forte is the brilliance of the author's characterization. Each of the major characters is unique in his/her own way. Even the minor characters are not stereotypes, but individuals with their own personality and voice. Boot, the hero's father is a vivid and unique personality and so are the cowboys who work on ranch.Josephine is a fiesty heroine, a woman who has suffered and is brave enough to go after a new life. J.D is strong and silent, afraid to love but when he does he loves fiercely.The story is fast-paced and readers will be sure to applaud when Josephine eventually proves to J.D that she has the grit and gumption to be a rancher's wife.

Can we learn anything from it? English author John Pollock has given us several full-length biographies of Christian heroes in the past. In this book he collects 28 biographical sketches of great Christian men and women from whom we can indeed learn a great deal. Although all are either Englishmen or Americans from the eighteenth, nineteenth, or twentieth centuries, there constitute an amazing variety of people, including many you would not meet with in a standard book on church history. The book is divided into five sections. The first section, Setting the prisoners free, has four sketches dealing with Englishmen who helped bring the slave trade to an end, including John Newton and William Wilberforce. The second section, Make the foulest clean, has four skecthes of English Christian social reformers, including the prison reformer Elizabeth Fry. The third section, Soldiers for Christ, portrays three military men, including American Stonewall Jackson. The fourth section, Assist me to proclaim, is about evangelists, such as D.L. Moody and Ira Sankey, and Lord Radstock, who took the Gospel to Russia in the nineteenth century. The last section of twelve sketches, Into all the world, is about missionaries. It includes William Carey, Adoniram Judson, Hudson Taylor, Mary Slessor, the martyrs John and Betty Stam, and others. John Pollock gives us a well-written record of a galaxy of Christian heroes. As he says, &quot;They differed from each other in character and achievement but their dedication shames a softer age.&quot; I read it out loud to my family (which includes five children) to their enjoyment and profit.

In a word, the scenarios -- that are hard to find any argument against -- are \\"scary\\"!The story of gold itself is also fascinating. I had never realized the extent of the sudden U.S. law changes under FDR (who closed the banks) and the national confiscation -- complete with prison sentences! -- that was carried out.

The play's reputation exists in part because it is presented as the paradigmatic example of the Greek tragedy by no less an authority than Aristotle in his \\"Poetics.\\" No doubt this reputation played a part it making it one of the relatively few plays by Sophocles that has been preserved from ancient times. Whenever I have taught the Greek tragedies in various classes my students almost always find in the play the best examples of Aristotle's key concepts of harmartia (\\"tragic error of judgment\\"), anagnorisis (\\"recognition\\"), peripeteia (\\"reversal\\"), catharsis, etc. Still, there is the fact that because even those who do not know the play know the story about the man who killed his father and married his mother, \\"Oedipus Rex\\" is usually misread by students. Because they know the curse they miss something very important: the curse that the oracle at Delphi tells Oedipus (ln. 752-57) is not the same curse that was told to his parents (ln. 676-78).The only reference to Oedipus by name in Homer appears in the \\"Iliad\\" (Book 23, ln 756) where it says that the king of Thebes died in battle, which suggests he was not blind. At some point in between the time of Homer and when Sophocles wrote this play, the tradition became that Oedipus blinded himself (Ismene refers to it in \\"Antigone,\\" ln 37-39, which was written 15 years earlier but may have been edited later to conform with the more famous work). Sophocles could be playing with the legend again by having the prophecy change because this way there is an explanation for the sin of incest being part of the prophecy: it is added when Jocasta tries to thwart destiny and she herself gives the baby Oedipus over to the huntsman to be killed. Consequently, in the view of Sophocles at least, the incest is a punishment for the actions of Jocasta and not something that the innocent babe Oedipus faced from the moment of his birth.Anyhow, there is no need for me to convince you that \\"Oedipus Rex\\" (a.k.a. \\"Oedipus the King\\" and \\"Oedipus Tyrannos\\") is a great play and the epitome of the Greek tragedy. So let me instead recommend this Literary Touchstone Edition with it use of sidebar notes to explain terms, concepts and mythological references. Once upon a time it seemed like only Shakespeare got this treatment, so it is nice to see Sophocles being treated the same. Before you read the play there are some Reading Points for Sharper Interest, which give readers some key things to consider whether they are reading the play for the first time or the twentieth. A list of Dramatis Personae is provided before the play and a look at the Mythological Background follows, although reading that latter one first as well could be quite useful.Actually, a lot of what is included in this book would be useful reading before rather than after. The rest of this volume is devoted to brief considerations of the Origins of Greek Drama, Tragedy and the City (looking at the importance of these dramas to the Athenians), Conventions of Greek Drama, and Aristotle's Influence on Our Understanding of Tragedy. If anything, depending on how much you already know about such things, these sections may be too brief. But they do provide some key concepts for better understanding \\"Oedipus Rex.\\" Even teachers who cannot get classroom sets of this edition to give their students to read can take advantage of what they find here to benefit their students."},{"Title":"Oedipus Rex - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Don't buy the Kindle version!

It is a fantastic version of the play."},{"Title":"Oedipus Rex - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Oedipus Rex has been an immortal world literature classic for nearly 2,500 years. Long considered the greatest Greek tragedy, it was hailed by Aristotle as the tragedy par excellence, and in the millennium plus since only Shakespeare's greatest work has even approached it. It remains a model of what tragedy should be; deftly plotted and perfectly executed, it has a sympathetic protagonist, a crushing climax, sublime poetry, and a wealth of meaningful themes. The play remains on the very short list of incomparably and undeniably great world literature masterpieces - one of the six or so best works ever. It is essential reading for everyone.Perhaps the aspect that has always spoken most strongly is the character of Oedipus. The archetypal tragic hero, He is one of literature's most thoroughly sympathetic personages. Whatever his faults, he is far more sinned against than sinning; his rise from humble background to king is matched only by his even more awe-inspiring fall. Arrogant, haughty, and somewhat impulsive, he has distinct flaws, but they only make him more human; we feel for him because we see his profound humanity. However ostensibly different from us, he has the indisputable human core necessary for a truly moving character. His downfall's pathos is near-unbearable; it is hard to see a man so truly broken and heavily suffering. The play is valuable for showing the nadir to which people can sink, bringing out life's inherent tragedy with incredible force and emotion.The story itself is also key. The original audience knew the Oedipus story well, and it has continued to be so famous that most will know a lot before reading, but Sophocles portrays it with such skillful mastery that it affected Athenians with mesmerizing power and continues to do so. A tighter plot or more perfect execution could not be conceived; no one has ever made better use of foreshadowing or dramatic irony, and the breathtaking climax has rarely even been approached. The story is put together with almost mathematical precision, and the close is simply devastating. The totality of bitterly ironic events that comes down on Oedipus is so crushingly malevolent that it shows the absolute worst that can happen to a person. For this reason among many others, the play remains the consummate tragedy.The work's lasting value may be due primarily to its extraordinary dramatization of numerous weighty themes. All Greek tragedies were broadly philosophical in a way later plays - to say nothing of current ones - rarely are, but this is again the top example. It most famously deals with fate and has indeed never been matched for showing fatalism's dark possibility and potentially fatal consequences. However, this has also been exaggerated, because a close reading clearly shows that Oedipus himself inadvertently caused his downfall; this is what makes him a tragic hero. Denying the conventional depiction may seem strange, but it after all makes him more relatable. As far as we know, we are not victims of venomous fate but are fragile beings suffering from limitations we are unable to overcome. The play in any case has other important themes: the creation and enforcement of taboos, questions of political succession and family relations, pride vs. humility, etc. That Sophocles was able to do all this in a work of less than two thousand lines - not even half of Hamlet - is a testament both to his genius and to ancient Greek art's essential concision.There are few works for which reviews are more superfluous; the real question is what translation to get. Robert Fagles' is undoubtedly the best for current readers. It is not that prior ones are inaccurate, but inevitable language changes have made them ever less readable; some may think them more stately, but they lack Fagles' flow and readability. All one need do is compare his rendering of the famous closing speech to prior ones; his is so much more immediate yet also more poetic. Dedicated Greekless readers will of course want several, but neophytes should start with Fagles, the only version most will ever need.Translation aside, the question of what edition to get is also important. The play is well worth reading on its own, but many versions pair it with Antigone and Oedipus at Colonus, Sophocles' other two Theban plays. The former is nearly as great as Oedipus Rex, and the latter has great merit, meaning the trilogy is ideally bought complete. Standalones are hard to justify unless one wants a deluxe edition with Greek text, extensive criticism, or some other bonus, but the important thing is of course to read the play in some form."},{"Title":"Oedipus Rex - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Sophocles ancient classic engrips and horrifies the reader with a tragic tale of fate and horror. Young Oedipus is destined to murder his father and marry his mother. So it is written. Eager to avoid the fickle hand of fate, his parents send young Oedipus away at early age to evade the inevitable, which of course, proves unavoidable. In addition to tragedy, this stunning classic from Ancient Greece asks that age-old question, \\"who am I?\\" This version provides useful annotations for readers. It gives away the ending, but how many first-timers don't already know it? We read this play freshman year in high school and struggled with certain parts, although naturally we grasped the ideas of fate, tragedy, and incest. A classic perhaps not for the faint-of-heart."},{"Title":"Oedipus Rex - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I found this version of the play to be too cumbersome in its language. I had previously read Robert Fitzgerald's translation, which was marvelous and easy to understand. The argument between Oedipus and Teirisias, for example, clearly shows the anger, frustration, and weariness felt by the characters. In this Literary Touchstone edition, the emotion is drained from the argument, and each character ends up sounding like a lawyer.Although I did find the annotations on the sides of the page helpful when explaining the references to the Greek gods, I found them frustrating when they would reference things that would not happen for another twenty or thirty pages. It seems that the editors wrote the annotaions assuming the reader was already familiar with the play.The deal-breaker for me, however, was the fact that the play is not only summarized on the back cover, but specific details to the plot are revealed, robbing the story of any surprise at all for the first-time reader.For those thinking of purchasing this book, I would urge you to take a look at the Fitzgerald version. Amazon lets you browse the pages of both, and I think you'll find the translation of the Fitzgerald more easy to understand, and more suspenseful in its delivery: http://www.amazon.com/Sophocles-Oedipus-Cycle-Colonus-Antigone/dp/015602764X/ref=pd_cp_b_3"},{"Title":"Oedipus Rex - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"THIS EDITION HAS SPACE FOR YOUR NOTES, AND ALONG THE SIDE IT HAS NOTES THAT HELP YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND THIS ALREADY GREAT STORY.

It has a very good price, so it does the job."},{"Title":"Oedipus Rex - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"It is clear why the tragedy of Oedipus has been passed down for centuries upon centuries. Following the traditional format of a tragedy-the one tragic flaw of King Oedipus in many ways led to his ultimate demise. This theme can be seen in everyone's lives. While the fall may not be as pronounced, we can often see a single flaw in ourselves leading to unfortunate circumstances in our lives. And Oedipus's flaw, excessive pride, is exceedingly common in society. Because it is so easy to relate to, the play is somewhat enjoyable to read. Also, the story itself is quite good. The theme of blindness (to the truth) is an extremely important component of the story, and allows the reader to, yet again, consider any blindness to the truth on their part, in their own lives. Additionally, it is fun for readers to be able to place themselves in ancient Greece, allowing themselves to see the morals and philosophies of this society.All this being said, as far as Greek classics go this one would fall somewhere in the middle, not exceptional but certainly not terrible. It is logical to see why it would be taught in school-it is a solid foundation for any study on tragedies as well as ancient civilization literature. It is a prime example of a tragedy; containing all the components necessary for one. But it is not something I would heavily recommend to a friend, and, if written today, would not consider a classic in the making."},{"Title":"Oedipus Rex - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This is an old and famous play and I have to say, it is interesting, suspenseful and with an unconventional plot. I am not a native English speaker but as far as the language interpretation goes, this edition was easy to follow and the side notes were very helpful.

In this novel, against a background of violence and fear. When I first read 'Fair Stood The Wind For France' as a schoolboy, I was attracted by the story of the heroic RAF bomber pilot shot down behind enemy lines in France, and his efforts to escape back to England. As I read it I realised that war was not heroic and glamorous, but filled with fear and disfigurement. Hardly an unique epiphany to be sure! But what brought it home to my fifteen year-old mind was Bates' simple illustration of his hero contemplating his inability ever again to open a bottle of wine and pour a glass. A banal task whose infinitesimal pleasure is usually lost against the noise of our lives. Bates brings home the happiness we can glean from the everyday, through his ability to conjure beauty from the mundane. Read this book for the beauty that Bates can evoke. Read it again to learn the value of a moment."},{"Title":"Fair Stood The Wind For France","review":"Bates write so well, i am starting a project to read everything he has written"},{"Title":"Fair Stood The Wind For France","review":"I would recommend this book to anybody, as it would appeal to all ages from teens onwards.

An Amusing History of Potato Heads, Block Heads, and Magic Whiskers, A History and Value Guide","review":"Toys, always, had been played with then discarded. Now they have a shiny second life as nostalgic collectibles.In the colorful, profusely illustrated FUNNY FACE, Mark Rich and Jeff Potocsnak take us through picture blocks, magnetic 'magic whiskers', interchangable pictures. Quite quickly, though, they get to the immortal Mr. Potato Head. And there they stay, exploring the phenomenon of plastic facial features stuck onto an actual vegtable.There's much to see. Who remembers, for instance, that Mr. and Mrs Potato Head, products of the consumer culture of the 1950's, had cars, trailers, planes, boats, kitchen sets? Who would have guessed that their child would be all plastic and have human features?The art, especially the original advertising (see the freckle-faced little girl on page 59) is a wonderful, somewhat unsettling look at a bygone time. The text is clever, tying the coming of Mr. PH in 1953 to the contemporary fascination with science fiction and space aliens. And pointing out that he was indisputably (and almost uniquely among then-contemporary toys) an adult.Best of all, the book has the great good sense to quote me!"},{"Title":"Funny Face!

Great deal, recommended"},{"Title":"Swan Song","review":"The British mystery author, Michael Innes a.k.a. John Innes Mackintosh Stewart wrote the introduction to &quot;Swan Song,&quot; wherein he claims that Crispin solved the dilemma of the 'Great Detective versus the bumbling police' scenario that many Golden Age mystery authors had to contend with. The dilemma in a nutshell: why would a twentieth-century policeman, who was much more adept and scientifically trained than his counterpart in the late Victorian era of Sherlock and Mycroft, call in an amateur (no matter how intelligent) to help him with his inquiries?According to Innes, &quot;The Great Detective was, curiously, often a person of title, like Dorothy Sayers's Lord Peter Wimsey, or at least the familiar of persons of title. It is never easy to render plausible the acceptance of a meddlesome private investigator by a group of professional policemen standing round a corpse, and novelists appear to have felt that a lord will be better received...&quot;Innes himself wrote a series of mysteries starring the titled Sir John Appleby.Crispin avoided the 'blue-blooded detective' solution. His detective, Gervase Fen is part of the same social milieu as the police. He is a professor of English literature at Oxford, but his cherished hobby is criminal investigation. His detective counterpart (Sir Richard Freeman in &quot;Swan Song&quot;) has a passion for literary scholarship. Their dialogues (mainly disagreements) keep &quot;Swan Song&quot; swimming right along. It's definitely not a 'Great Detective versus bumbling policeman' relationship---it's more like two crotchety friends with mutual interests who keep running into each other in various Oxford pubs and murder scenes.&quot;Swan Song&quot; starts out rather unpromisingly:&quot;There are few creatures more stupid than the average singer. It would appear that the fractional adjustment of larynx, glottis and sinuses required in the production of beautiful sounds must almost invariably be accompanied---so perverse are the habits of Providence---by the witlessness of a barnyard fowl.&quot;I would have thought that the above statement applied to tenors and sopranos only (singing in such a high register seems to destroy their brain cells), but it is the bass in &quot;Swan Song&quot; who sets himself up for murder. Several members of &quot;Die Meistersinger von N&uuml;rnberg&quot; cast have good reasons for wishing Edwin Shorthouse dead, in spite of his voice and its drawing power.Even his composer-brother has a motive for killing the bass, and after a meeting with him, Fen is also made to question the intelligence of composers: &quot;As a general rule, composers aren't the brightest of mortals, except where music's concerned.&quot;Since Crispin himself composed music, it might be better if the reader did not take his commentary on the intelligence of musicians too seriously!One of my favorite characters from &quot;The Moving Toyshop&quot; shows up in &quot;Swan Song&quot;-the deaf and (according to Fen) senile Professor Wilkes who makes a habit of stealing Fen's whisky. He and Fen are always good for a round or two of acrimonious repartee whenever they meet.A third dialogue element that threads merrily through the book is a crime writer's attempt to interview Fen about his most famous cases. Every time Fen clears his throat and begins, &quot;The era of my greatest successes...&quot; someone is bound to interrupt him.We never do get to learn what Fen considers his greatest successes, but surely the outcome of &quot;Swan Song&quot; must be counted among them.NOTE: &quot;Swan Song&quot; was also published under the title &quot;Dead and Dumb.&quot;"},{"Title":"Swan Song","review":"The ubiquitous Gervaise Fen finds himself literally &quot;on stage&quot; and proves again that his powers of observation and deduction are second to none. The language and style of Crispin are reminiscent of Dorothy Sayers and are fully as entertaining. Great vacation reading, as it is very hard to put down."},{"Title":"Swan Song","review":"All of Crispin's boks are wonderful, funny mysteries. I am only sorry that he was so creative that he spent a lot of his time doing other things."},{"Title":"Swan Song","review":"Edmund Crispin is an author of classic murder mysteries who wrote his works in the early to mid-20th century, during a period when Dorothy Sayers, Agatha Christie, and Marjorie Allingham were also active. It's an enjoyable era in fiction. I had enjoyedThe Long Divorce: Gervase Fen, #8very much, and decided to read another.While the Fen character in \\"Swan Song\\" seems to have less dignity and poise than he did in the earlier work, his capacity to keep the action moving at a sturdy pace continues. The two new central characters, Elizabeth and Adam, are charming and enjoyable, especially the first few pages of their interactions with one another, which read like a Wodehouse novel or a Coward play. These types of witty comments and attitudes can still be seen in classic \\"screwball\\" comedies from the the 1930s; thinkIt Happened One Night (Remastered Black & White)with Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert,The Philadelphia Story (Two-Disc Special Edition)with Cary Grant, James Stewart and Katherine Hepburn, orBringing Up Baby [VHS] again with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn.I enjoyed the Opera and music ambiances and the brief glimpses of Oxford college life. It appears the author, whose real name was Robert Bruce Montgomery, had attended Oxford and later had become a successful composer. He was also for a time a schoolmaster. His understanding of all these venues adds considerable veracity to his descriptions, while his parody of the personalities that populate them seemed not only amusing but probably \\"spot-on.\\"The prose style, as in the earlier book, is rather convoluted and may not appeal to all readers; dialogue rather than narrative prose is more heavily employed in today's works, making them seem almost terse by comparison. The vocabulary, too, is very arched; I don't think I've seen so many novel words used to describe ordinary things and circumstances outside of a thesaurus (sounds like a dinosaur, doesn't it?) Much of this is a matter of period and genre. Most writers of fiction with a satirical or humorous bent used the same wordy and slightly \\"off-the-wall\\" prose style during the early half of the 20th century. Authors like P. G. Wodehouse,Bertie Wooster Sees It Through (A Jeeves and Bertie Novel), Noel Coward,Blithe Spirit, Hay Fever, Private Lives: Three Plays, and James Thurber,My World-and Welcome to It (Harvest Book), were all well know for it, and it remained a popular narrative form even with Erma Bombeck,The Grass Is Always Greener over the Septic Tank, in later decades of the century.The plot is particularly well designed and is an example of the \\"locked room\\" mystery. All the clues are there. They are subtle and very carefully disbursed through the story. Those with more experience of the classic murder mystery genre will probably be alert to them. I know I was. Although I knew how the first murder was committed very early on, I was not really sure who had been responsible, and I was quite amazed at how complicated the event had been when it was explained. As to the second murder, how it was done and why, I was totally taken by surprise, not because the author broke any rules, but because of his deft slight-of-hands in misdirecting my attention.A pleasant afternoon's reading."},{"Title":"Providence","review":"Arguably the best treatment of the Catholic doctrine of Providence: how God governs the world, to what purpose, and how we should respond. Rooted in Scripture and the teaching of St. Thomas Aquinas, this book offers solid doctrine, clearly expressed, to anyone seeking to discern and follow God's will. I try to read the fourth chapter every couple of years, where Garrigou-Lagrange explains when we should accept our circumstances, as coming from God, and when we should seek to change them. I recommend this book to all those who tend to worry too often and too much.As a point of interest, Fr. Garrigou-Lagrange taught at the Angelicum in Rome from 1909 until 1960, and the future Pope John-Paul II was one of his students."},{"Title":"Providence","review":"This work by Fr. Garrigou-Lagrange is more accessible than his work on Predestination. The two themes are somewhat related, but providence examines the meaning of God's sovereignty over all creation and history for us His creatures. The first two sections of the book are an examination of God's nature and perfections and how this necessitates His absolute control of all events, even the slightest or least significant. Because God is supremely good we can therefore have confidence in His providence and good will toward us. He quotes Bossuet who said we are much better off trusting our eternal salvation to God than trying to insure it ourselves. This should give the Christian much confidence and courage in the daily trials of life, knowing that all things work together for the good of those who love God.The third, fourth, and fifth sections of the book deal specifically with providenceand its bearing on the spiritual life. Great emphasis is placed upon how God's justice and mercy are manifested through His providence and how both of these aspects of His nature join in bringing about our conversion and growth in grace. A trusting abandonment to God's providence is the key to our relationship with God as our loving Father.While I enjoyed this work by Fr. Garrigou-Lagrange, it did not impress me as much as his work on Predestination. Much of what was said was covered already in that earlier work, but for those who would like something with less theological terminology, Providence is more reader friendly."},{"Title":"Providence","review":"Very good theological work on the subject. It's also a good spiritual read. This book is a must for those who do not understand things related to God's plan (providence) like evil in the world or prayer. God is not a genie in a bottle.

Professor Laurence Kutler composed the absorbing account of Nelson Glueck's archaeological excursions and discoveries, while Rabbi Jonathan M. Brown reconstructed the story of the protagonist's career as educator and college president. In other words, the co-authors respectively describe Dr. Glueck's passionate exploration of the earth of Biblical lands -- a lifelong labor which served to connect the burgeoning Israeli population with the history and traditions of its forbears -- as well as his relationships with prominent societal and familial figures at home and abroad. The portrait that emerges captures the nuances of the personality of a secular but devout man of great accomplishments who also sought with only partial success to extend his personal religious freedom as an American to the citizens of the orthodox theocracy of Israel."},{"Title":"Nelson Glueck: Biblical Archaeologist And President of the Hebrew Union College Jewish Institute of Religion","review":"Nelson Glueck (1900-1971) was a prominent Jewish intellectual. He filled--admirably--a variety of roles in his life: biblical archaeologist (e.g., see hisRivers in the desert: A history of the Negev); Reform Rabbi; as well as President of Hebrew Union College (the main seminary for Reform Judaism; he was born of Orthodox parents, however) from 1947 until his death.This fascinating 2005 biography gives a balanced portrait of the man. The Foreward states, \\"This book is about a human being whose many gifts of mind and heart enabled him to make an indelible imprint on the contours of Jewish life in both America and Israel.... He lived an extraordinary life in tumultuous times.\\"The authors write, \\"In 1936 biblical archaeology is seen by many Palestinian Jews as part of the struggle to establish a legitimate claim to a Jewish homeland.... That is why a thirty-six year old American Jew, Nelson Glueck, opens first a Bible and then a field handbook, and with a scholarly mien, suggests that the route of the exodus from Egypt ... ran along ancient sites bordering Trajan's highway in Transjordan.... How extraordinary that this American-born Reform rabbi ... should find himself at this crucial moment in the Jewish homeland, standing at the juncture of geography and history.\\"William Foxwell Albright became his mentor in biblical archaeology. \\"Working with Albright, Glueck encountered a personality and a dedication to archaeological research that resonated completely with his own emerging awareness of what biblical archaeology and the biblical archaeologist were all about.\\" However, Glueck was not uncritical of the Bible as a sourcebook, and he once wrote, \\"The chief source of information [about Palestinian sites], the Bible, is deficient in complete, objective, historical fact. It is not a book of history, as we understand the term today. It is essentially a theological document presenting a specific religious point of view.\\"He also held strong opinions about Christianity: \\"the only possible way in which Jews would make any rapprochement with Christianity or a reappraisal of their attitudes towards Jesus would be tantamount to accepting some of their doctrines with respect to Jesus' divinity.... there was nothing of Christianity and its theological definitions that we could accept.\\"This book will be of keen interest to anyone interested in Israel, Reform Judaism, biblical archaeology, or biblical studies."},{"Title":"Nelson Glueck: Biblical Archaeologist And President of the Hebrew Union College Jewish Institute of Religion","review":"Great record of an interesting life!

While I've read several books under those more popular names, this is the first I've read penned under Roumelia Lane. With a title of Stormy Encounter, I must say I expected more storm, and found this book rather tame and exceedingly long on the descriptive. Ms Lane has an obvious love for Ibiza, Spain and she is brilliant at making the landscape come alive on paper. Sadly, there is very little interaction between the hero and heroine, and it's not until the last quarter of the book that you even get a feel that they care about one another.

Saw this at an airport bookstore and, as I had a long flight ahead of me, bought it. It was okay... not the worst book I've ever read, but not the best either. What really drove me to distraction, though, were the numerous run-on sentences on every page!! Either Binchy never learned good grammar in school, or her copy editor didn't. It also seems unbelievable to me that Lena would give it all up for that loser Louis. You could see what was coming a mile away."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I truly enjoyed listening to the book on tape.

Her characters are well-drawn, her scenery is the beautiful Irish countryside, and her stories are blissfully uneventful. At her best, Maeve Binchy is an Irish Jerry Seinfeld. While Seinfeld has for years presented an entertaining half-hour show about 'nothing', Maeve Binchy is capable of penning novels in excess of 700 pages with no discernable plot. This is not always a detriment...indeed, as with Seinfeld's show, it is often refreshing...no car crashes, explosions, nuclear devices...just the enjoyment resulting from finely-detailed characterizations. But then there is 'The Glass Lake'...and somehow, characterization alone is not enough to sustain a 700+ page novel. This is a book begging loudly for a bit of plot. If you decide to read the book, I would encourage you to read the first, say, 300 pages and then skip to the last 100 pages for the non-descript ending. You will not miss a lot, either in plot or character development, by leapfrogging over 300 pa"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"The Glass Lake is about the eighth book I've read by the Irish author, Maeve Binchy. This novel, like many others, including _Circle of Friends_, is set in a small Irish village with parts set in London and Dublin. Also like _Circle of Friends_, _The Glass Lake_ has a very compelling central character in Kit McMahon. There are several problems with this book however, that I didn't find in _Circle of Friends.Another central characer is Helen McMahon, AKA Lena Gray, Kit's mother. Their relationship and the events strain reality. Helen runs away from her family to be with her one true love, Louis Gray. Kit finds a letter for her father but burns it, thinking it is a suicide note. Her reasonbeing her mother could never have a Catholic burial if the village thought she committed suicide. The village does find a water-logged corpse so the village and her family mourn her death. Meanwhile Helen/Lena is setting up house with Louis in London. When she finds out her family thinks she is dead, she allows them to continue thinking this. She begins a correspondence with Kit as a &quot;supposed&quot; friend of Kit's mother.I cannot buy the idea of a mother leaving her two children, especially the way Helen's loving nature is emphasized in the book.There are a few love subplots in the novel but for the most part there is an awful lot of padding. Of 757 pages, about 500 is repetition. I have to admit though, the book did hold my interest. I never once considered stopping reading it. Although not very believable, I did enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"...could not get into the premise of this book. Not the best Binchy."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"the best thing about this book is the dialog, in which you can really hear the irish accent. the story hook, the disappearance of the mother, is very clever, and some of the characters are also fine, kit mac mahon and her mother in particular, but i felt the plot got away from her; MB has a tendency to pack her stories with characters and some of them always get lost, and this happened here. and her fixation on &quot;smart&quot;--meaning trendy and fashionable, not intelligent--got to me. but i was in ireland last summer and all through the book i kept hearing those lilting, lovely voices."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"The radio reception in my car is quite..., so i resort to books on tape for my long drives. This book by Maeve Binchy is a first for me, and probably a last. Before i wrote this review, i read what others had thought, and someone complained that the story begs for a plot, and that it is much better to read the first 300 pages and skip to the last 100. I can't agree more. In fact, that's basically what i did with the tapes. I went all the way through tape 4, returned the audio book to the library, and checked out the printed version, where i skipped to the end. The story has a lot of fluff, a lot of filler, and therefore it becomes draggy and lackluster. The last pages were a bit more interesting, but the end was a big letdown for me. There are too many issues that are left unanswered, such as Kit's inheritance, Louis' new life and repercussions, Emmet's romance with Anna... I would be extremely interested in reading justifications as to why this is such a long, drawn out story, when the basics could have been very well told in less than half the book. The result would have been much brighter."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I found myself reading faster just to get to the end to see if there was any equitable solution to this whole messy saga caused by immature lust for an illusion that really could not be sustained in the light of reality. I'm trying not to give spoilers so I will not use character names. I did like some of the main characters, but I found myself having no empathy or sympathy at all for several of them, the main one being the woman who caused so much heartache for absolutely nothing in the end. Having done what she did, the character could not overcome that obstacle of dislike I had for her, no matter how \\"successful\\" she became, how \\"beautiful\\" she remained, or how many \\"liked\\" her. The people who should have mattered most were discarded like yesterday's leftovers, except for her feeble attempts to somewhat make amends, but even in that you felt it was because of her own loss and loneliness, not for the love she should have naturally had. I never saw one redeeming thing about that character, not even at the end.I saw no reason for the length of the book as it could have been told better and shorter. It needed a good editing. Some of it dragged on and on and you found yourself tempted to skip huge sections, but I didn't for fear I'd miss something crucial to the story which was not the case often. Again, it was my first Maeve Binchy book, so I really have nothing to compare it to as for her other works. I probably will read another one in the future."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"This was my first Binchey book and i have to say i had mix emotions about it. My problem with the book was that i couldn't stand one of the main characters, Lena. I had no sympathy for her for what she did. Having two children myself, i could not imagine ever chosing a man over my kids. Also, Lena's character was suppose to be this amazing modern career woman, and guiding woman to be strong in the work force however, throughout the book she allowed Louis to lie, cheat and make a complete fool of her for years and she continously forgave him. In some chapters i actually found myself cursing Lena for being such a weak person and always thinking of Louis instead of her children. I enjoyed Kit's character and how strong of a young woman she turned out to be regardless of what her mother did."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"This was my first Maeve Binchy book and I have read several others by the author since.

It has a darker undertone than her others ~~ but still, Binchy writes riveting of her characters that makes you keep turning the pages.Kit has a deep secret ~~ tormented by the possible fact that her mother committed suicide, she finds a letter on her dad's pillow and burns it without even reading it. And this is the story of a tormented daughter and her mother, Helena, who had run away with her first love. Somehow they get past through all the deceptions and found each other again ~~ and this is their stories.It is a book that delves deeper into darker questions ~~ how could a woman just abandon her children and let them believe that she is dead? Then Binchy writes convincingly of Lena's love for her children and how she longs to see them again ~~ pushing aside her doubts and fears.

Maeve Binchy's books always seem to be able to draw the reader into the story and I have enjoyed all the ones I have read so far but I found myself skipping some pages of The Glass Lake as I found some parts of the storyline a bit irrelevent and uninteresting. I also thought that the ending was a bit rushed in comparison to the rest of the book and I would liked there to have been a more about some of the smaller characters in the book, such as Sister Madelaine.I would recommend reading this book however, as I did find it compelling and hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"Which is the better choice -- Passion or a peaceful life?

But then,after i read it..it was more than what i wanted to know.Now,although i'm not in love anymore with that man..i still love Binchy's Books..with her Irish touch and everyday life..The Glass Lake is a touching story, about a women who had to choose between her family (a nice husband she doesn't love and the children she really loves)AND a man she always loves.How her decision changed her lifes and also her daughter lifes..how the love of a mother to her children never stops although she had to pretend..This books shows the devotion of a woman to a man she really loved and sacrifice anything, even her children, for the man who doesn't deserve it. A very touching story about love,courage and also friendship.. Although the ending is kind of disappointing, but the main story is very touching..A very sensitive and bright Author!"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I do enjoy reading Maeve Binchy, but most of her books are only worth reading once. The plots and characters often seem to repeat themselves. Often several main characters are little more than cardboard cutouts or, worse yet, cariactures of themselves. She doesn't seem to know what makes them tick. In &quot;The Glass Lake,&quot; however, she has managed to create a believable and sympathetic cast. There is, of course, the typical Binchy dyed-in-the-wool villain: loving but weak, insensitive, self-centered; in essence, a handsome spoiled child. With the other characters, however, Binchy has avoided this sort of easy answer. Kit, her heroine, is, as always, a triumph (it is not her heroines Binchy has trouble writing). But she also manages to make Helen, Kit's mother, a heroine herself. The dilemma Helen faces is entirely real, her sadnesses entirely sympathetic, and yet the pain caused by her &quot;solution&quot; is undeniable.Martin, Helen's husband and Kit's father, is unusual for Binchy, who often seems to have difficulty writing men. He is a loving man, a beloved father, yet an unloved husband. Binchy shows us these things in such a way that they seem entirely inevitable, and without taking sides. You cannot condemn Helen for not loving her husband, but neither can you condemn Martin for not being loved. Equally unusually for Binchy, she manages to create a romantic hero who proves to be neither unfaithful nor unbelievable. Minor characters are dealt with in a more sympathetic light than Binchy often uses: mean people are often so because of private miseries, bad people can reform, and those who are not good can still be happy.There is a happy fairy-tale ending that somewhat stretches credibility. But it is, after all, a Maeve Binchy book. One I highly recommend to all her fans."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I enjoyed this book a great deal.

I was so sorry to learn of her passing earlier this year. Glass Lake was extremely entertaining & suspenseful, as well. It's one of those novels you can't put down.

Awesome storytelling, makes you feel you are right there living in lough glass. I eagerly await her next novel."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"My daughter Laurie induced me to read The Copper Beech on August 5, 2012, and when I liked it she suggested I read this 1994 novel. It involves the disappearance of a woman, leaving behind a well-meaning husband and two children. One of the children, Kit, is a girl of 12 who for reasons which seemed good to her caused the small Irish town to believe the disappaeaer had drowned in the lake. The dramatics of the story are very intense for the first half of the book and again in the final denouement and it is hard to not want to keep reading even though the theme is not fraught with universal significance. I don't know life in small town Ireland in the 1950's but it is easy to believe that the book captures that life in its essence. Maybe some of the mood changes in the characters seem unusual and not likely, but one doesn't hesitate to wonder how the dilemma will be worked out. Whether you will like the way it works out I don't know, but on reflection I decided it was satisfactory."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"Like her other novels, this one has plenty of great character studies. The twist is the mystery created in the main character, and her unusual choices that impact so many. Lots to keep you turning pages and enjoying the story."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I have yet to come across a book that Maeve Binchy has written and I did not enjoy. Maeve has the ability to make you laugh and cry in the one book. Her characters are so real and it is very hard not to become totally absorbed in the every day life of the characters. Maeve writes about families and individuals in such an insightful, beautiful manner. When reading her books you feel transported to Ireland (or wherever the novel takes place)and can just visualise the communities, characters and lifestyles she is writing about. My only issue is Maeve does not write fast enough for me. I would love a new Maeve Binchy book every week."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I have read Scarlet Feather and Heart and Soul, but The Glass Lake is by far the best. It is an intricate story with interesting characters. Binchey's use of the secrets, particularly in this story are thought provoking for our own lives. I think of how one thing we tell our children, as Kit was told, causes a domino effect (burning the letter) which changes many lives. I am saddened that as I just find Ms. Binchey as one of my favorite authors, it appears she died just days ago on July 31, 2012. The Prime Minister said, \\"We have lost a national treasure.\\" We have all lost a treasure and I am blessed by her books.

My first Maeve Binchy book was Circle Of Friends, which I read in a flash, and started reading her other books right away. I think she is such a talented author, and I love her work! Every book I have read of Maeve Binchy is extremely interesting and real from the very start of the book to the end. I never want to stop reading and put the book down. Any age group can read her books because they pertain to everyone. I am 16, and I enjoy her books more than any other author I've known. My mother and I take turns reading books of Maeve Binchy's because we both love them so much. The Glass Lake was one of her best books I believe because it made me feel that I was in the story. I could relate to all of the characters, and when Kit or Lena was feeling something, I felt the same anxiety, frustration or compassion that they did. I felt like I knew the characters in the book personally because they were so well described. It was most definetly the best book I've read, and I recommend it to everyone to read!"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I loved Glass Lake. That is until I got to the end.

I decided to read this one (loaned to me by a friend) to confirm or change my opinion of how this author's style fits with what I like to read.Interestingly I felt pretty much the same things in reading both books. For example, in both Binchy fills the pages with long, drawn out stuff that doesn't really matter and adds little, then the end is fast and disappointing. All of a sudden, in both books, something happens abruptly in the last few pages and it's over. It's almost as though she suddenly (finally?) got tired of writing and decided to end it. Stuff, filler, stuff, filler, filler, stuff, filler, Boom - END! With both books I turned the last page because I thought there just had to be some more of the ending.I skipped about 75 pages partway through this book - it just didn't seem to matter at all and it was plodding along. I finished the book because I was laying awake unable to sleep one night - and I was left with the feeling, as with Tara Road, of &quot;hey, wait a minute - it's over??&quot; (actually, I was ok with that, but wasn't left with any feeling that I'd read anything of substance or value.In the books I read I like to keep guessing about &quot;who did what&quot; or what's going to happen next - there was very little of that in this book.So, I have confirmed that Ms. Binchy simply doesn't fulfill my taste in novels - Binchy fans will most likely love this."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"In the beginning of the story Kit is a young girl. She makes a decision that changes her whole life. She burns her mother's letter to her father. Kit pulls through her mother's death with the help of her Mother's friend who she goes to meet when she is older. Kit deals with many of her problems fairly well. She uses her brains and talent to fight against the odds. The novel is about spousal cheating, hidden identities and going out there and making the best of what you have. The title is a very important part of the story. Glass Lake it the translation of Lough Glass the town where everything happens. A boat is found floating in the middle of the lake which leads everyone to believe that Helen is drown in the lake. The book was O.K. I like the mystery part of the book but the cheating and sleeping around is not what I enjoy reading about. The relationships between the man and women in the novel are not very good. The book seems to say that any one can get away with anything if they can charm people. Kit is a strong character. She overcomes several life changes throughout the novel. She was nave about many of the problems that she faces and makes unwise decisions because her lack of knowledge. Kit did not understand why her mother never fit into the lifestyle of Lough Glass. She sees her mother as she cries and then soon after found out she was drown. This leads to Kit to believe that her mother took her own life. Kit than burns the letter that her mother wrote to her father. Later when she finds where her mother really is she is able to forgive her and keeps writing to her about how her every day life is. Her forgiveness for her mother shows strong character though her mother's decisions change her whole life. I thought the ending was interesting and unusual. Lena is very afraid that Louis would tell Martin that she is still alive and mess his life up once again. She was so upset that she became crazed and drove her car head on into an oncoming truck on accident. Kit gets all of her mom's money and pays Louis back by telling him that Lena was always in contact with Kit. This was not true but it hurt Louis. This book has influenced my thinking. It shows that with the right clothes, a charming personality and deceitful dealings with others can get people somewhere in life; or so it seems in this book. It also helped me to decide not to read any more of Maeve Binchy's books."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I really do not like giving this book even one star.

Binchy is a superb story teller! all her characters are alive and reliable. She has the supreme gift of building a plot that maintains the interest of the readers without a single boring word. It is a masterpiece the way all the lives intertwine with each other. I won't spoil the reading for the future readers so I am not telling anything about the story.The only reservation I have is about the end. Until the last 40 pages the plot made sense, everything was possible and could have happened. The last developments were, how to put it, a little TOO MUCH and with light speed. Too bad Binchy didn't refrain her vivid imagination because I stopped believing her.Beside it, I couldn't understand how can a person without any papers or identification build a life in another country, work in an office, buy a car, fly from England to Irland .Binchy doesn't explain it, like it was something trivial.The smooth way that they found new careers in the new country sounds to me a little like fairy tales.But, again. IT IS A WONDERFUL READING!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I have read most of Maeve Binchy's novels but this one is still among my favourites.This novel is rich with characters and setting, drawing the reader into many different lives and situations as they develop and unfold from the small Irish town where Kit's mother disappeared and everybody believes she has drowned in the lake.Kit's strength of character and the relationships with her friends and family was intriguing and satisfying and kept me reading.This is one I have read a couple of times already, and each time I find myself re-discovering the richness of the mother/daughter relationship, the complex family saga and the wonderful nostalgic feel."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"One pivotal scene between main characters is one of, if not the most shockingly emotional that I have read. I felt as though I was punched in the stomach when i read it, started to cry and felt all the pain the female was feeling. So in that Binchy excelled. I think Binchy used this book to explore moral dilemmas and present characters that were all flawed in some way. Not one is truly likeable except perhaps the housekeeper of the main family. The various plot points come together in a melodramatic and pat way. A character dying is the easy way out for an author. Then, other plot lines seem to go no where. I remember enjoying some of her earlier books but I can't really recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"How did I miss this novel with all the books that I have read by Binchy? I have no idea but it is not to be missed. I found the book in my mom's book shelf last week and then of course I could not put it down and read until 4am on night to complete it.Helen McMahon has moved to a small Irish town and married a man that she does not love. She is the mother of 2 young children and when the love of her life, Louis Gray, a cad among men, returns to her life, Helen makes a decision that impacts her entire life as well as the lives of family and the town of Lough Glass.The years pass and Helen McMahon finds that her actions have consequences. Her handsome lover Louis Gray is despicable and Helen gives up her entire life to be with him. However, the friends that Helen makes and the people who love her help her to make a success of the life she has chosen. I cannot imagine having a mother like Helen McMahon. In the end her daughter, Kit McMahon, forgives her mother and finds for herself a love that she never expected.If you are a Maeve Binchy reader, then this is one to savor and enjoy. The story moved me to tears at times but Maeve Binchy delivers a wonderful story here of a small Irish town and the inhabitants who live there.

I fell in love with her style in The Glass Lake.The main character, Kit McMahon, rather than hurt her dad, chooses to burn an unopened letter from her mom the night of her disappearance.The rest of the book describes how life trudges on for the McMahons and Kit's guilt over burning of the letter becomes a central focus for Binchy to elaborate upon. In the end, Kit comes to peace with her mother's final departure.Binchy's novels are peaceful reads which focus on everyday trials predominantly set in Ireland with religion being in the midst of the turmoil.Catherine Jean Schoenbauer-Humphrey, author of When the Smoke Clears- How to Survive and Be Better Off With or Without Your Cheating Spouse"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"being a huge maeve binchy fan, i would have to say this is one of the, if not THE, best ever. good story, satisfying ending, not put-downable."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"The reason I thoroughly enjoyed this book was plain and simple: it was a very good story. Along with very good characters and background. May not sound eloquent, but it's the truth.With Binchy I have had a bit of a love/hate with her. The first book I read of hers, Tara Road, I had a hard time with. The reading was a bit tedius to me, and Binchy's voice was not what I was used to. However, since then I've read several other of her books- Light a Penny Candle, Silver Wedding- and while beginning them I need to give myself a push because honestly, they are quite long- keeping at it I am always pleased in the end. The Glass Lake is no different, at approx. 750 pages, you have to dedicate yourself to the reading. However, this story flowed well, was full of anticipation for the reader...the pages started to fly by.I think out of the several books I've read of hers this is my favorite so far. Mainly because the characters and story is one that will stay with me- how could it not? I won't give anything away, but it was certainly very unique and it was interesting to see how it was handled and ended."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"As with other older Maeve Binchy novels, this is mostly a rites-of-passage novel set in a small Irish country town, Lough Glass. One day the young Kit's unhappy mother disappears, leaving a note which Kit destroys, not wanting to upset her father. Everyone assumes that she drowned in the lake, and life for Kit and the others goes on, but not without heartache as she grows up.I was really engrossed in this book as it developed, looking forward to finding out the solutions to the various mysteries Binchy had set up. But as I got closer and closer to the end, with seemingly no real resolution to some of the issues, I found myself wondering how Binchy was going to tie up the book.Then, in the last thirty pages, she rushed through several very major plot developments, reintroduced some characters and dealt with some serious emotional issues... in a very rushed and unsatisfactory manner. The pace had been leisurely throughout the rest of the book, and as such this really looked to me as if Binchy had suddenly realised that she was over her word limit and needed to tie up all the loose ends as briefly as possible. It didn't work, and really spoilt for me what could have been a wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"Other English majors might scoff at my giving a Maeve Binchy novel five stars. True, she is no Toni Morrison or Thomas Hardy, but she is a tremendous storyteller. That's what I always tell people. She's more of a storyteller than a writer. We can't all always be sitting down to Melville and Hawthorne (though we should be reading them as well) - the human mind and heart needs a little break every now and again. Some English majors read Stephen King or John Grisham or Michael Crichton for that break. I read Maeve Binchy. Because of how much myself and those I love are like her characters. And because of how much more we want to be like them. This is a marvelous story. Real people in here. A sort of mythic surrealism surrounds the lake, like something out of Yeats. I've read of people complaining that her novels never break too much new ground. That she should venture into something new. This is what she's good at. And there is no one better. I always look forward to the lulls in my studies, to the next time I'm able to pick up a novel of hers."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I'll tell you right now that I have no problem believing that there are readers who love Binchy's books and those who hate them. Her novels are sentimental and nostalgic, set back often in the 1950s and 1960s, as this one is. She probably isn't far from maudlin but for me she doesn't quite tip over into being that heavy handed. Her novels are also romances combined with family sagas. I admit to having a very wide sentimental and nostalgic streak, however. Hence, I like her books just fine. With that warning in mind, and if you're still here, this novel involves two lead women, a mother and a daughter. The mother has run away with her boyfriend. Her daughter and rest of her family thinks she is dead. But she's not. She's working her butt off in England to support the bum boyfriend while her family remains in Ireland. It gets better because the story is even more the daughter's, who comes of age and meets the man of other women's dreams, Stevie Sullivan, who she needs to go out with so Stevie will stop going out with her brother's would-be girlfriend. On the surface, Stevie seems like a hard working version of her mother's boyfriend. One is tempted to think he's otherwise the same womanizing scoundrel. We follow the stories of both mother and daughter and at one point, the stories intersect. I couldn't put it down. Stevie Sullivan, for my money, is one of the best romance heroes ever written but the rest of the book is splendid as well. I read this huge book on one entire Saturday starting early in the morning. I even promptly started rereading parts of it when I was done, the true test of a book that's gotten under your skin. If you can resist it, you are a stronger person that I am!"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"After Tara Road, I decided to tackle all the Binchy I can get my hands on! Her ability to enter so many characters into a story, keep you interested in all of them and watch as they develop and work into each other's lives amazes me more with every book of her's I read. I loved Kit's character... her strength and ability to weigh all her options in relationships with her mother, father, brother, men and friends. I just love Ms. Binchy's writing style, her ability to take me to Ireland and see into her characters' lives. Don't be fooled by the thickness of any of Binchy's books... you'll finish them in three days and wish there were a dozen more chapters!"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"This is my favorite of Binchy's novels, and I've read most of them.I had the pleasure of asking the author about this novel while I was at a book signing for &quot;Scarlet Feather&quot; a few winters ago. &quot;The Glass Lake&quot; was so sad, that I asked her if it made her sad to write it. She said that her intention when writing this book was to show the lengths to which people would go to have a loved one buried in hallowed ground. With that information, you can tell that this will not be an upbeat novel. If you are looking for a light read, I'd suggest &quot;Evening Class&quot; by the same author.If you are looking for a book that makes you feel as if you know the people and the landscape of somewhere that you've never been, read this book. Binchy takes her time in weaving a story, and lets her characters develop and change in the course of a novel. These characters will draw you in. These are characters that you'll remember long after you've read the final chapter."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"The Glass Lake, as all of Maeve Binchy's stories, is about a small Irish town and the interwoven lives of the people who live there. It is difficult to explain the plot without giving away too much information, but basically it deals with betrayal, good intentions and lack of discernment when choosing friends and spouses. It is a wonderful book, full of unforgettable characters and sad thoughts of &quot;what might have been&quot;. It tells of love which remains steadfast and love that flees in the face of temptation. It is one of Maeve Binchy's best, which is high praise when the whole body of her work is considered. This is highly recommended reading!"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"This was the third Binchy novel I have read. I devoured it with the hunger of a wild animal, so excited to see what she could possibly have in store given the amazing stories I enjoyed in Tara Road and Echoes. This book will not disappoint you. Though a large amount of pages, you will be amazed at how fast you get through this novel about family, love, and lust. By far, this is one of the most engaging, irresistable, what will happen next, kind of books. Read it, devour it, enjoy it to the fullest, I did!"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"When beautiful, restless Helen McMahon goes missing, the small Irish village presumes that she has accidentally (or not) drowned in the nearby lake. She left a sealed letter for her husband which was discovered by her daughter Kit who feared that her body, when found, would not be buried in consecrated ground. Poor foolish Helen had never grown out of loving the man who deserted her years before and was still so in thrall to him that she left her husband and children with barely a qualm. The main body of the story is the rites of passage of her children through their childhood and teenaged years, and that of Helen and her life with the charming but feckless Louis who dominated her world for the rest of her life. I loved this book, despite loathing some of the characters (whom most women will recognise), and would recommend it for a weekend's reading marathon."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I truly enjoy Meave Binchy and her amazing style of writing that is more like an illustration into the thoughts and minds of peoples lives. The Glass Lake takes you into the small town of Lough Glass and spins you into the lives of these small town people. It will leave you feeling as if you were sitting in spying and eavesdropping into there lives as if you are merely a character your self witnessing the events unfold. And if you love getting lost into a Novel and then at the end somehow thinking that you must know these people and that they truly must exist you will love this book!"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"This was a terrific read..better than Tara Road, the only other Binchy I've read. I thought the ending was weak tho,...as if the author had had enough and wanted to wrap it up as quickly as possible. Didn't do the story justice. A story filled with such &quot;alive&quot; characters and good plot, deserved a better ending. I still enjoyed it, and would recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"Maeve is a great storyteller. There were quite a few plots, but it flowed wonderfully. A great three dimensional book full of characters that makes you feel that you know them. I thought this one was a tad better than Circle of Friends (although I liked Circle of Friends too!) Great read, I could not put it down!"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"This was the best book I have read since The Shell Seekers, by Rosamunde Pilcher. I cried off and on throughout this book. I love when I read a book and I am able to feel the emotions of the characters. This book showed how one's actions effects peoples' lives including the person who committed the action. I could totally relate to both Lena and Kim. This is the first book I have read by Maeve Binchy, but if this is any indication of what she has to offer, it won't be the last. Since reading this book, I have been searching for another book that will make me feel emotions like this one did. Any suggestions?"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"Maeve Binchy weaves magic every time she writes - the characters become friends, the Irish countryside becomes real. This is another wonderful story, which I have read over and over again, with an emotional ending that always reduces me to tears. I defy anyone to dislike this book!"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"Helena, or rather Lena Gray, made the mistake of marrying a good and kind man whom she did not love when her lover left her. Her daughter, Kit, later made the mistake (or was it a mistake?) of burning the unopened letter Lena left behind the night she disappeared. This act was to leave a scar for the rest of their lives. This book is great as a family saga, all the more thought provoking as it leaves unanswered questions behind for the reader. What if Kit has opened and read the letter? What if Lena has gone back to her hometown to clarify the misunderstanding? The only fault I could find was that this book tries to cover too many areas. When I started the book, I thought it would be focussed on Helena's disappearance mystery and the consequences (the mystery of the body that never was Helena's was never solved or mentioned). Later, it covered Lena's life in London, Kit's life and romance, life or the others in Glass Lough. The ending was not really linked up with the beginning. Nevertherless, this has been a good read, the author brings across loving unconditionally very well."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"This book made me want to pick up and run away to Ireland. Maeve Binchy has inticed her readers, or at least this one, to travel to this magic country one day.I liked the style with which she used...pinning a mother's romantic side versus her daughter's practical nature. These roles tend to be reversed in storytelling today.Anyone who has ever fantasied about running away from it all will find a friend in The Glass Lake. Lena Gray is the woman I wish I could be. She is gutsy without overdoing it. Binchy has made a charater that I could read about many times over.This book is for the romantic dreamer in us all. If only I could close my eyes and find myself in Lough Glass...."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I always enjoy Maeve Binchy's books, she is one of the best story tellers writing today. The Glass Lake, however, really excels. Her characters seem like old friends, and I was lost in 1950's Ireland from the first page. If you're looking for true &quot;escape&quot; fiction, and a book that you wish will never end, this is it. Take it to the beach, read it on a rainy afternoon, immerse yourself in it on an airplane, it doesn't matter where, but do read it"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"Maeve Binchy has a way of making you care about the characters in her books. I felt so much for all the characters in The Glass Lake, especially Kit, and how well she seems to read people and at how she manages to forgive her mother, and form their unusual daughter-mother bond. I also felt for Lena. To be so in love that you sacrifice everything in the world only to find out he wasn't at all what you thought. Haven't we all loved like that at least once in our life?"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"Good book, great characters, not enough resolution. This frayed-cord of an ending was inexcusable after teasing us readers through this long long LONG book. What was the point? After spending so much time with the characters, I felt no sympathy for them after all was said and done. It's terrible the way the last stinky hundred pages of a book can over-shadow the first good six hundred."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I stuck with this book because I wanted to see why Maeve Binchy seems so popular. I still don't get it.How many times did we need to hear that Helen married a man she really didn't love, or that Philip was in love with Kit but she did not return his feelings?Kit fell in love with Stevie, but I just don't believe that she would have still cared for him when she found that he had beat Louis so badly that he lost teeth. That would not be the kind of person Kit would care for.Parts of the story were pretty good, like when Kit threw away the letter, but overall I found it terribly slow with lots of uninteresting reading."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"This is by far the best of Ms. Binchy's books that I have read. It is my fourth and all but this one took me several pages to &quot;get into.&quot; This book, however, got me from the beginning. Unbelievable character depth and kept my interest at all times. Never was this one boring. I loved it."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"If you read this novel,you will agree that you were unable to put it down.The pages practically turned themselves.The Glass Lake is Binchy's best &amp; it has great characters b/c Binchy really is an expert of human nature so her characters are well described.The monologue is absorbing &amp; this book is full of great events so that you'll keep wondering what'll happen &amp; you just root for or against the characters &amp; almost become part of the book.Enjoy it !!!!!"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"Days after I finished reading _The Glass Lake_ I found myself wondering what had become of the characters, like they were friends I lost touch with rather than fictional creations. It was the same with _Tara Road_. Binchy's characters are so real: not many women out there can say they have never been involved with a man like Louis.I found Kit's strength literally inspiring. And as much as I wanted to find Helen contemptable for deserting her family for &quot;love&quot; of another man, something in me understood. The plot twists itself through the intertwined lives of the people in the small town of Lough Glass, and each person will get stuck in your heart.The only reason this book didn't five stars from me was the rushed ending, as detailed by another reviewer."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"One could certainly point out deficiencies in The Glass Lake, with implausible plot twists and tiresome later chapters at the top of the list. However, Maeve's brilliance in character development, the depiction of every sort of love relationship, and the underlying theme of facing heartbreak and hard choices at midlife makes the temptation to criticise evaporate.The action drags at certain points, but several characters, particularly Helen, Ivy, and Sister Madeleine (three highly different personalities), are a marvellous kaleidoscope of women who took odd directions to seek a cherished change in their lives. As well, all would face the consequences of the choices - and I'll not spoil the outcome for the new reader by saying whether they were positive or not. Helen, for all of her intelligence and flair, is to explore whether a goal related to her career is what actually frustrates her after all.Perhaps Helen and Madeleine have a bit too outstanding a flair for magical fixes (in all lives except their own), but this, after all, is Ireland!This rich, compassionate, deep novel must be Maeve's best."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"No one weaves characters like Maeve Binchy. This book hooked me from page 1 and I didn't want to put it down. That's the only problem with Binchy books... you want to read them in one sitting! This book is all about sacrifices and how decisions by one person impacts all the people around them. It's a great book about relationships between family members. Her books are always colorful, the images wonderful and the characters memorable."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I was not immediately taken with the book, however, as the characters developed I caught on to MB's style. She is constantly weaving in and out of situations and characters. Finally, you see all of it forming a amazing tapestry. The plotting is well crafted and the character's grow and develop through out the book. I miss them now that I am done. I definately recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I love all of Maeve Binchy's books, but I thought this one was her best one yet! She makes you want to keep reading. Her descriptions of the small Irish towns make me want to take a trip there! :)"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I fell in love with this book the very first time that I read it and was so enchanted by it's story and characters that I have re-read it AT LEAST 8 times. This is the kind of novel that pulls the reader in...once you start reading you are almost instantly transported to the world of Lough Glass and you start forgetting that the characters in this book are not real people. I've had to buy another copy of this book because I wore out my first one! All I can say is THANK YOU Maeve Binchy for this spellbinding story and the warmth and love that radiates from every page."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"Once again, along with many other readers, I have to agree and point out that Binchy's characters and ability for story line are absolutely amazing. The Glass Lake was a story that you just get wrapped up in. Being from a small town myself, it's very easy to think her story possible.My major complaint in comparison to her other novels is that the ended just gets too rushed. It's like she looked at the bottom of her word processing program that said &quot;Page 700&quot; and then said:&quot;Oh, Gosh! This is long! I better finish it while it's still a sellable length!&quot;.In about five pages you have Kit seduce Stevie AND fall in love with him, I mean COME ON! It's just a little too melodramatic after working so hard to make an unbelievable story rather realistic.I think my advice to Binchy would be that the next time you see 700 pages, just realize that it's ALREADY long, another 50 pages to keep true to your wonderful characters and explainations is not going to offend the readers any."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I read Tara Road and enjoyed the book enough to research more books by Binchy and bought The Glass Lake. At first I thought I was not going to like it....it takes a good 50 -75 psages before you start to get hooked. By the end of the book I couldn't stand to put it down just to see how it ended. I had my suspicions of the ending but I was surprised. The characters in this novel were more restless than Tara Road....and it proved to be an excellent recipe! I reccommend this book to anyone who is wanting to slip away into another world, another place and another time."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"The book, as always is well written. About a family in Ireland that experience the loss of their mother twice. The wife of a pharmacist, is a very independent woman who never interferes in anyone's lives, and who is very private. She is a good, faithful wife and mother who runs her home with precission. However she had to give up a lot, as her husband was never her true love. They were married under No pretences and she was always very honest with him regarding her love and her thoughts, and movements. Her two children were always her priority where she gave her all, as her husband never permitted her to work, not even in his own pharmacy. When she disappears, she presumed dead, some believing she may have taken her life. This is a devastating misunderstanding.The story contnues where she starts her new life over, with her 1 true love. And where her daughter,son and husband try and pick up after what they believe is her death. She is allowed to become the person tht a part of her always wanted to be. She is extremely successful and dependable. A story about powerful love and family. But a great deal of her life still remains an act, as it did in her home town. But I can't helping thinking perhaps a little far fetched - what mother would ever leave her children at will, a mother that was always devoted to them?In then end everyone finds their true love and meets their &#34;forever&#34; partners, which make life turn out perfectly, especially for those who gave up so much in return for very little. All except for the &#34;mother&#34;, who had to sacrifice so much and to a major extent was never happy. For her the story ends sadly. But I do believe there are many life lessons learned in this story!!! I am glad I read it."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"it made my life easier when i was in great pain.i hope she'll be healthy in orde to write new books"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"The Glass Lake is classic Binchy with all the characters and their different stories that combine to create a great read.

The worst part of reading any of her books is when they end,so I really enjoyed the length of this story. Provides love,family, mystery, intrigue and life. Buy it!"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"Maeve Binchy wrote this book delving deeply into human feelings like I've seldom read before. I enjoy all of her books, but this one is my favorite."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"Maeve Binchy remains one of the world's most beloved storytellers and with good reason. The Glass Lake is a rich novel that is driven by its endearing characters. Kit and Lena are the kinds of heroines you want to root for: flawed and hopeful, put upon yet able to find redemption when it matters most. Making the reader care about her characters is something Binchy does beautifully, and here is no exception. Like several of her other works - The Scarlet Feather, Quentins, Night of Moon and Stars - the writing is comfortable, if not a bit predictable, but still just as enjoyable. It's like visiting with an old friend: the reader is assured of a good time and a good read."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"When beautiful, but restless, Helen McMahon goes missing the small Irish village presumes that she has drowned in the local lake (accidentally or deliberately?). Helen left a sealed letter for her husband explaining her actions and motivations. The letter is found not by her husband, but her daughter, Kit, who in fearing that when her mother's body is found that she wouldn't be buried in consecrated ground, burns the letter -- not knowing what was written inside. And so, a sequence of events unfolds like dominoes unleashed with a single push. The story is both beautiful, remarkable and tragic with moments of happiness and moments where you just want to hit yourself upside the head with the book. I very much enjoyed this book even though there were characters that are unlikeable (and women will despise). There were some aspects of the story you could see coming a mile away and other elements that were surprising, touching and make this book a great weekend getaway read. I would read other Maeve Binchy books based on this book."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I could not put this down once I started in.I am notan advocate ofparents abadoning their children under ANY circumstances, however...I could not help but to becometotally immersed in the characters. The cross between 'mystery' and small town story telling worked so well. You could not help but to become involvedwith these characters. I recommend this above ALL of Ms.Binchy's novels... Forgiveme if I am not saying too much about the story,I don't want to give it away toanyone who hasn't read it!"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"This a wonderful story of how small towns are. If you are from one; then you know that every one knows everything, or at least thinks they do. As always, Binchy's characters are witty and delightful. If you are looking for an amusing, wistful and sometimes emotional read then \\"The Glass Lake\\" is for you."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I listened to this book on tape. The author does a superb job in narrating - I could hardly pull away from it. She holds your attention so thoroughly you feel like you are living it. I have since hoped to see a movie made of this book."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"This will go down as one of my all time favorites. It was sad at times but I felt a real connection with all of the characters and was very sad to have it end. I went back and re read the last 20 pages just to be sure I had not missed anything. Another good book to read is Copper Beech by the same author."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"This is my first Maeve Binchy novel and I truly enjoyed it! It's a real page turner with a well thought-out plot. Great summer reading! I would definetly recommend it to anyone who has visited Ireland, you will have an enhanced feel for the book. However, I'm sure it's still great if you haven't been there either."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I'm only 14 and I enjoyed this book. Or some might think, maybe it's because I'm fourteen that I enjoyed this book. I read some reviews, and some people are complaining that this book doesn't sound realistic enough. If a person were to write a book about realistic everyday people without any sort of mystery you would complain about there being no plot.You have to love the book for the emotions, and the fact that she does use fairly realistic everyday people, with an entertaining twisting plot. I think I would have put it down if she didn't have the slightly questionable realisticness outcome and doings in the plot. But no, it's my favourite book, and all through the book I had the feeling of rush, the want to get through it to see how it all comes together. Once I was finished I wished there was more to read. It took me three days to read. I loved every minute of it, and do not consider those days wasted at all.Since this is the first of her books I have I read, I'm afraid I wouldn't enjoy any other ones by her, I loved this one so much. I would love to see how a movie turns out, although movies are never as good if you've read the book. This book has the entertaining enough plot to keep the veiwers attentive, and would be far better than some of the movies that are making all the money on the big screen. At least this one would have feeling."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"It was really good. I could hardly put it down. Some of her books I was quite disapointed in, but maybe it is because I read this one first. No book could be as good as this."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I loved this book! Although, the beginning was a bit slow, it DID pick up. It's beautifully written and the characters are realistic. You really feel for Lena and Kit and see how strong their bond is. In the end, Lena had to become the strong woman that she should've been in the first place - but like all of us, had to learn from her mistakes."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"Like so many of the other reviewers, I felt sadness when I came to the final page of this book. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and felt a kinship to both Lena and Kit. Binchy has such a talent for drawing you into her characters; you almost feel that you are in a personal relationship with these fictional people. This was my first Binchy novel; I'm going to read Circle of Friends next and am looking forward to another satisfying read."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"If you want to spend a nice cozy night curled up in bed with a great book this is it.

In this novel, she tells the story of a small town in Ireland called Lough Glass. She writes about how the whole town is shook up by the disappearance of the local pharmacist's wife, Helen. She shows how the reactions of the citizens of Lough Glass affect the other characters in the story. Binchy demonstrates this well as she illustrates how Kit, Helen's daughter, copes with the tragedy and what the people in her town are saying about it.The many characters of Lough Glass, that make the story, help to engage the reader. The people in the story are very easy to relate to. The reader can see members of her own community in some of the characters. For example, Lough Glass had a town gossiper, know it all, wise women, and drunk. It also had many families and neighbors that made up the small town.As the reader goes on the journey, with the many characters, she is never lost. Binchy's writing is clear and easy to understand. The reader gets to watch each character grow over the many years that the story takes place. Throughout the book it is easy to become familiar with each character and get to know them.Just when the reader thinks they have all of the characters figured out, Binchy will throw in a surprise. Binchy tests several characters when they are faced with new problems and tough decisions. Their actions lead to many twists and turns in the storyline. The reader will be shocked and surprised several times throughout this book. She will be eager to read on to find out what is going to happen next.The story of Lough Glass is very compelling. It is impossible to put the book down. The reader must not let the 700 plus pages scare her away. The book will be over before the reader realizes it. When the book is finished, it is sad to see the characters go, and hard to not wish for more. I would defiantly recommend people to read this book."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"This story is hard to believe. How could a mother leave her two young children for the love of a man? I was surprised at the beginning and a little dismayed that my beloved Maeve Binchy would consider such a topic. As usual, she weaves a tale that you CAN believe.Helen leaves and is presumed dead due to an unfortunate turn of events brought about by her (well meaning) young daughter Kit. Helen is living with the pain of separation of her children; Kit is living with the guilt of what she has done.Through the years, the secrets unfold and both mother and daughter have to learn to cope with the results.This story burns in my heart."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"Maeve wrote a great story. The plot moved quickly. The characters were excellent. Was a great tape to listen to while I walked or drove in the car! Sort of brought me back to the old radio soap operas of many years ago!"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I have read most of her books and so far this is the best! I highly recommend this if you like a good romance and characters you really care about."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"From the moment I picked up this book I could not put it down. When I had finished reading it I wanted to start all over again. I honestly felt that the characters in the book were real people, I wish they were. The author has an amazing ability to keep the reader excited and interested through all 670 pages. A must read."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"It's hard to explain... The Glass Lake is one of those books that you can't wait to finish because you're so curious to find out what will happen to the characters. However, at the same time, you never want to story to end because it's just so wonderful! I can't give enough praise to this novel."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I couldn't put the book down.

Every detail drew me deeper in and made me cheer along with them as they fell in love."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I loved the characters in &quot;The Glass Lake&quot;. The story was very captivating and held my interest and I couldn't wait to finish it to see how everything comes together. Well, guess what? There was no conclusion to the story."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"The Glass Lake is the story of a woman who marries a man because her first love left her for someone else. She moves to a small town and is never happy. One day the &quot;love of her life&quot; comes back and she just walks away from her husband and two children and starts a new life filled with lies. The Glass Lake does not have the same wonderful group of charactors as the other books by Binchy and there was not one person in this whole story that I liked. It is an ok read but just not quite up to par."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"The first Maeve Binchy book I read was Tara Road. I loved it so much I felt compelled to read more of Binchy. This book is equally as good. It drew me in from the beginning and it made not want to put it down until the last page. Throughout the book Kit grows into a remarkable yound woman who stands true to her morals. The character of Helena starts off very mysterious, but in the end she is someone who you really feel sorry for. She escapes a comfortable life with little happiness and goes off with her first and only love- only to be betrayed in the end. The only part that I find disappointing (besides the somewhat rushed end) is that while Lena Gray aches to write to her daughter and see her grow- there is little mention of her son. I realize there is a connection between mother and daughter, but the fact that she hardly inquired about her growing son is a little disturbing. Nonetheless, a great read. I'm looking forward to reading another Maeve Binchy page-turner."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"Some of the best by the best. I loved this book from beginning to end. I couldn't believe the turn of events. The book is a real page-turner.I do have to agree though in the last few pages too many quick decisions to tie up the story were made and it didn't really do it for me. I would have liked a better ending in a way, but I enjoyed the story without a doubt."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"It's hard to find a good book that does not contain a lot of foul language or lewd situations but if that's the kind of book you're looking for, this novel will be perfect for you. Maeve Binchy is an amazing story teller. Binchy writes about the common man, people you know and can relate to. The Glass Lake is what one would call a \\"real page turner.\\" You just can't wait to see what happens next. Binchy has a real talent for creating characters that you care about. This novel has the ability to hold your attention to the end. You just won't be able to put it down.I reccomend this book and just about anything Maeve Binchy writes. I have yet to read a Binchy book that I didn't enjoy. Please give this novel a try. It's a great book to curl up with."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"Maeve Binchy does it again. In this book she brings you lives in a small town, with many little secrets, and one big one.Two young girls grow up together in a small town. For all intents and purposes, their lives, should end up being carbon copies of one another. However, one has a mother that doesn't quite fit in. She's from out of town and never quite fit the mold. As time goes on, both girls consider themselves inseparable until one major event in the town changes, their lives forever.From this point, their paths are changed, the mold is cast and they will never see things quite the same again. The rest of the town as well, reels from this event, bringing it from its sleepy complacency.However, as all children do, they grow up and start to stretch their horizons. A small connection to the past that helps one of the girls heal from the earlier events nearly tumbles her into a new despair. It is a situation she can't fathom and opens many old wounds.This story of Kit and Cleo, one of Maeve Binchy's fine novels, reminds you that things are not always what they seem and a point of view can change over time, when the world tests your character and your relationships."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"If you are even slightly tempted to pick up a copy of this book, do it! It is a great story about Helen McMahon, a young mother living in Ireland in the 1950's. When the story begins, Helen is wondering how her life got to this sad point. Her family, made up of her husband, Martin, and her children, Kit and Emmet, thinks that all is well. One day she disappears, and the story has begun. It is a surprise to everyone in town that she had suicidal tendencies, as no one ever saw her act anything but cheerful. The consequences of her disappearance stay with her family and influence their lives from that day forward.We find out what happens to her family, and how they cope without this very important element. There are some major twists and turns along the way for her family, and indeed for other people close to them in the town of Lough Glass (the Glass Lake of the title), but suffice it to say that this is a book you do not want to miss! Maeve Binchy has done her absolute best work with this book, and it would be quite hard for any other author to top - it remains one of my favorite books of all time. And I know I'm not alone in rating it so highly.My summary does not really do the story justice, but I'm trying to give you enough information to want to read it without giving the whole story away. There is a lot more to the story, believe me, but you will have to read the book or other reviews to find out what happens. &quot;The Glass Lake&quot; is truly an excellent book!"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"There's not a whole lot to say without giving away some aspect of this novel, other than to say that it was absolutely amazing. I loved the book as I do all of Maeve Binchy's novels and I found it extremely hard to put down. All of the characters were so well developed and Lough Glass was so easy to picture - it seemed so familiar. I didn't want it to end. Onto my next Maeve Binchy book..."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I must've been really young when I read &quot;Circle of Friends&quot;, or I just can't tolerate this kind of writing anymore. Maeve Binchy does a decent job of describing people and their surroundings, but as soon as dialogue appears, and we enter the characters minds, I couldn't help thinking &quot;People just DON'T talk and act this!&quot; A little too un-believable, especially considering the seriousness of the main character's dilemma. Typical of 'romance novel' writing styles."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I have read \\"the Glass lake\\" by Maeve Binchy 3 times, and every time i have been angry that the book isen't longer.

Stick with it!"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"Early on, Maeve Binchy brings in the local priest's comments on predestination versus free will. I believe it is Ms. Binchy's central theme in a story that describes young Stevie Sullivan as a look-alike and act-alike to the amoral Louis Gray. Binchy also seemingly implies that both young Emmet McMahon and his sister Kit McMahon will be the willing victims to their lovers --as was their mother, Helen McMahon (Lena Gray)--the victim of Louis Gray. However, Maeve Binchy's real message is that in these cases, free will dominates: The Sullivan boy overcomes his earlier nature; Emmet is strong and confident and is able to win the love of beautiful Anna Kelly on his terms, and Kit McMahon does not &quot;accept&quot; what she believes to be unworthy behavior by Stevie.&quot;The Glass Lake&quot; is a tale of triumph over one's baser nature and is well-worth reading."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"Although a long book, I did not want it to end.

It was the first Maeve Binchy book I ever read. I just couldn't put this book down. I wanted to know more about what happens to Kit and her family.

This book led me to buy as many Binchy novels as I could."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"This is the third Maeve Binchy book that I have read. Her character development is so wonderful.

Thoroughly enjoyable (however, not without its heartaches)."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I love how Maeve Binchy writes and had a hard time to put this book down. I was captivated until the end then was totally disappointed and angry. I did not like the fast tie up, it felt like; Lets do this just to get the book finished. I would also have liked to know more about what Louis's pain was. What made him the way he was? I can understand Helen leaving all for love, and I can understand Kit forgiving, but I have a mixed sense of Louis. It was as if he were two people. I also like how she caught the moral essence and struggles of young men and women of that era. And how fast we can turn on someone, as in the case of Sister Madeleine."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"The storyline kept you guessing right through to the end.

This is my first go at one of her novels on Kindle or iPad and I like the system very much. I do find this particular story line dragging along slightly painfully. It doesn't turn me off enough to dislike it, still love the story."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"Okay I am a picky reader and I love novels.

The last third of the book I finished within a day.

Loved this story. Great read. Would recommend for a good beach read or curled up by the fire."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"There was tragedy and sadness from unrequited loves. A loves B. B loves C. C loves others. The first 400 pages were sad and a little tedious to get through. The last 350 pages were wonderful! One georgeous man was shallow and evil, always having short-term love affairs. Another gorgeous man was wild with women when young, but was faithful and good when he finally ended up with the right woman.CAUTION SPOILERS: It was a good reminder of how loving the wrong person can ruin one's life. Lena was a doormat for Louis. Doing everything for him including pretending not to be angry when he would go off with other women. Her only goal was that he would come back to her later. Then, her daughter Kit fell in love with Stevie, who appeared to be similar to Louis. He had many affairs before he ended up with Kit, but, he was not like Louis which made for an interesting comparison. I loved the why and how Kit first asked out Stevie. She did it as a favor to someone else. I enjoyed how she was trying to flirt with him, feeling that he would see through her phony attempts, yet she was surprised that he liked what she thought of as \\"fake flirting\\". I loved their relationship, which began after page 440.An interesting side story was Sister Madeleine, who lived in a hut as a hermit. Most of the local people would visit her for advice. Her guiding views of life were \\"to do the right thing\\" and that meant \\"to do what hurt nobody\\". People would tell her their secrets and she never revealed those secrets. She had an interesting way of talking so as to give good advice yet not reveal secrets from others.Even though Lena was a doormat to Louis, I loved seeing her competent, smart business woman side. I loved how she talked Jessie into hiring her and then grew the business into something much larger and very successful, all the while giving credit to others. She made everyone else look great. She never took any credit for things, but it was understood that she was the reason behind the company's success. It was a wonderful talent which I think many people could benefit from if they could do something similar in the \\"real world\\".As I mentioned, the first half of the book was a little hard to get through, but I'm definitely glad I read it. I know I will think of things from the book from time to time. I would have liked to have seen more from the point of view of Louis. Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: none. Setting: prior to 1995 in Lough Glass and Dublin, Ireland, and London, England. Copyright: 1995. Genre: human relationships fiction."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"This is still my favorite Binchy novel and I have read them all. The scope of these characters' stories, the decision moments that impact the rest of their lives and the lives of those around them is finely drawn. Weaving all the lives together with good pacing took real skill."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"Although this novel really struck a chord with me by dealing with the \\"woman leaves comfortable home for love her life\\" bit, I found it all too similar to Tara Road, the only other Binchy novel I have read as of yet. \\"Handsome man runs around on the woman who is madly in love with him and she either doesn't notice or pretends not to\\". However, I found it refreshing that this one at least had other characters and storylines running to distract from how similar the Lena/Louis relationship was to the Ria/Danny relationship in Tara Road. I still feel that Ms. Binchy is a good storyteller in that she makes you care about what happens to basically all of the characters (except, of course, for the wandering husband figure). She's kept me going, I will certainly read another of her books when I get the chance."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"This book is one of my favourite easy reads. I rarely re-read a book - but I have re-read this one many times. The characters are realistic and modern for their times. It is a good story line - maybe a little slow - but you can skip the bits that don't fit. Some reviewers have complained of the ending - I agree it was abrubt - but I liked it - it wasn't too sweet. I would recommend you try this book."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"This is one of the most intriguing stories that I have listened to in a long time.

Little did she realize, that her daughter would one day find her alive in England and their lives would be intertwined, though differently than before."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I obtained a copy of this book while I was at university. Let's just say that I did little else for a week but read this book. This is one of Maeve Binchy's best books. Another favourite is Light a Penny Candle."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I can't express how much I enjoyed this book. After I got into the story, I started scheduling time to get it read! The characters really came to life and I found myself in a love-hate relationship with the ever-complex mother the story centers around. I think Binchy really showed an understanding of how readers who react to her characters and she responds to our questions, unbelief, and heart-wrenching perfectly. It's worth your time!"},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"This was truly the best of Binchy that I have ever read.Kit McMahon knew her mother was desparately unhappy when she saw her at the kitchen table one day crying. Then suddenly one day, her mom Helen McMahon takes a walk by the lake; never to return again. When a body was found, she was presumed dead. But what no one really knew, was that the body they buried, was not that of Helen McMahon's, but someone else's. Helen was off leading another life, unbeknownst to her family.Later,Kit will discover the truth about her mother, but keeps it a deep secret."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"This is my third Maeve Binchy novel, and I believe I'llkeep on reading them. To me she is the Irish versionof Joanna Trollope or Rosamunde Pilcher, a woman whocan describe life in the British Isles to us Americanfans.The themes of family loyalty, judgement and friendshiprun through this fine novel about the effects upon thelives of others when one person decides to &quot;follow herbliss&quot; and abandon family and homeland for love.Do we recognize that Louis is a jerk? I admit I didn'tat first, I thought the author wanted to make him sympatheticas a symbol of Lena's bid for freedom and happiness. But wequickly see that although hard-working and loving, LouisGray just wasn't worth it; something Lena finds out thehard way. I was even a little suprised towards the endwhen he turned vicious and blackmailed the woman who's lifehe practically destroyed. And it was so depressing to seeLena pay for her foolish decisions with her own life. I hadhoped to see her start her life afresh and carry on as abusiness tycoon.So Lena is the doomed heroine, but Kit is destined forhappiness with her good guy Stevie. I'd have liked to haveseen more resolution with Emmett, or Sister Madeline.Though set in the 50's, the plot could have happenednowadays; the Catholic stricture against pre-marital intercoursewas only given lip service. Perhaps it was only the United States 1950's that held such a stronganti-fornication stance.I liked the way friendship love was showcased (Kit andCleo)family love (Kit and Martin, Kit and Emmett),step-parent love, estranged-parent love, but I didn't quiteget the feel of the romantic pairings; WHY did Kit fallfor Stevie, just because he wasn't a drunk like his father?WHY did Emmett fall for Anna, just because she visited himas he convalesced that time? WHY did Martin and Mauraget together, just because they were mutually friendlythrough the Kellys?It was easy to be sympathetic towards most characters,and I think the author wrote the male characters well.At least they sounded believable on the great audiobookI listened to, Kate Binchy does a wonderful array ofvoices and accents, making the story truly come alive.I would recommend The Glass Lake to Binchy fans and otherreaders of British Isles family-saga fiction."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"A beautiful story, and also full of suspense at the same time.

It captivated me from page one til the last page."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"I loved this book from the very first page. This is the first I've read of Maeve Binchy's work but will not be the last. The story was very realistic and very original."},{"Title":"The Glass Lake","review":"As an avid reader of Maeve Binchy's work, I would give the Glass Lake the top rating. However, its depth will not be apparent if it is read as a romance or mystery. The key is relationships, individuality, and the complexity of human nature.The plot has rather unlikely twists, and the premises don't always ring true. The key points that I mentioned, however, more than compensate.The characters of Helena and, to a great degree, Sister Madeleine, are at once puzzling, multi-dimensional, an interesting combination of worldly and naive, and refreshingly unconventional. Both are mystery women, in very different ways, but their parralel is in being able to live outside the norms.It's interesting that the elegant Helena, who delights in beauty and fashion and longs for travels, is perfectly willing to forego material wealth in order to be with the love of her life. Like Madeleine, she will not have possessions tie her down. But Helena, who presumably married Martin solely for security, confuses the need for a career and freedom with the far more pressing need to be with the man she truly loves.My humourous side cannot ignore another parallel between Helena and Madeleine - in fact, one that few readers might catch. Once both chose to embark on another way of life, the circumstances were a bit too perfect. Though it was not unheard of for lone rangers to fit into parish life (and be supported in their modest lives) forty years ago, Madeleine's being able to appear out of nowhere, her past extremely vague, and set herself up in a conveniently empty cottage, supported by those who come to her for advice ... is highly unlikely.Poor though Helena's accommodations are when she moves to London, her being able to find a place to live directly upon arrival seems remarkably providential.Lena's first encounter at Millar's is so fantastic that it is stranger than Sister Madeleine's situation! Scores of applicants, with far stronger skills and backgrounds, would have come through that door each week, and help would have been hired well before had there been the need. (Considering that we're told that business was poor, hiring another staff member seems beyond unlikely.) There never has been anyone in the history of the world who can transform any business just by bursts of intuition. Here, one totally inexperienced turns a second rate employment agency into a thriving showplace that receives media attention and makes her very wealthy. Her few suggestions about Louis's workplace transform the hotel, and this despite it's being a hot spot with extensive staff.Yes, our Lena is truly extraordinary, and always knows the right thing to do. A few sentences from her free Jessie of the burdens of caring for an elderly mother. Small doses of Lena's wisdom (aided by a few visits to a hairdresser) lead Jessie and Mr Millar to marry, since it's already turned a plain Jane into a smart lady, and also result in Ivy's marrying the man she's loved on the sly for years.It seems that, except in her choice of lover (and we don't know that until the end), Lena can do no wrong. She needs no training, no experience, no education - she magically always knows the formula. Equally incredible is that she manages to transform the employment agency, without anyone's being wary of her, resenting the presumed criticism of their ways, or seeking to get her fired out of fear.But, farfetched though the plot line becomes, the study of human longings, the need for changes in midlife, and how very true it is that even love for one's family cannot replace the need for going after one's dearest dreams and hopes, is intriguing. I could see all of the deficiencies in the plot - but the brilliance of the characerization left me enchanted."},{"Title":"Alex Toth: By Design","review":"Alex Toth created most if not all of the character designs for popular televised cartoons from the sixties through the nineties: Steve Canyon, Space Ghost, Sea Lab, Super Friends, etc - which have been shown recently on Adult Swim.

It also features Alex's journal showing the reader a different look of the animation industry back then - He worked for both Hanna-Barbera, Disney, and other independent companies.

I cannot begin to imagine how painful it was to bring back the memories of the war to recount them so powerfully for the benefit of others. Each and every word not only helps me to understand so much more about who is Phil, who is Miriam and of course who is your father Joseph, but it helps me to understand who I am too; where I 'fit in'.As you rightly point out, there has been the odd story here and the odd story there, but never a thorough explanation of the events that helped shaped our family history. As so many future generations will surely be, I am sincerely grateful that you have taken the time and effort to put down with such incredible attention to detail the events that unfolded around you. Just how you were able to recall so much of your childhood so vividly are among the questions I shall pose to you in person some time!Just as your children, I too did not grow up with both grandparents, but as a 'character' in your book my grandma Suzi is very much alive, whether it be on the beach in Blankenberg, exchanging letters with your parents or sending over packages with necessities.I will recommend this book to anyone as a story written by someone who led a truly incredible life and be proud to say \\"he is my uncle.\\""},{"Title":"They Are Still Alive","review":"I spend hours online exploring and I discovered this book about the hardships of my ancestors. My daughters have been trying to trace our family back to it's origin for over a decade and hit a stone wall. This book was an inspiration to keep trying."},{"Title":"They Are Still Alive","review":"Reading the dedication of the memoir They Are Still Alive by Philip Pressel, published by Dorrance Publishing, is a moving experience. He credits his parents with keeping them alive during World War II and the Holocaust. The book is also dedicated to relatives who perished in the concentration camps as well as to those who are unaccounted for. He writes that his grandfather was killed by Germans in Belgium in 1941. May 18, 1940 Philip and his parents arrived in France after fleeing the bombings close to their home in Brussels. Philip was not quite three years old. In France they lived with constant fear of being caught up in the Nazi sweeps of Jews. Air raid sirens led them to seek safety in shelters. Their housing was deplorable and they struggled to obtain the bare necessities for sustenance. In 1944, the authorities in Lyon mandated that if parents wanted their rations to continue their children would have to leave the city due to concern for their safety. A Catholic family agrees to care for seven year old Philip- they did not know he was Jewish. For that matter, Philip did not know he was Jewish at that time, either. The separation from his parents had long lasting effects on Philip. The family's desperate attempts to obtain exit visas failed. Despite all odds the family survives and eventually makes their way to America. Here again the family adapts to a new way of life and they thrive.Mr. Pressel's story is one of survival and he provides candid detail. Included are letters that both his parents wrote to relatives during and after the war that vividly describe their lives. They are a remarkable family whose devotion and dedication to each other makes them unforgettable.This is an eloquently written memoir and well worth reading.I received this book free of charge from Dorrance Publishing and I give this review of my own free will."},{"Title":"They Are Still Alive","review":"\\"They Are Still Alive\\" is one of the most heart wrenching stories I have ever read. It is just amazing how Philip can put his story into words considering he was just a small child living this nightmare of survival. From the very start of the book he gives a very detailed family tree, including back ground information for each person. Simply written yet each time they have to go into hidding your entire body tenses as if your living and on the run with them.

They survived with false identification papers, but were subjected to many frightening moments, escapes from being arrested, bombings and secret round-ups. Philip underwent forced separation from his parents in 1944. He was sheltered by a kind Catholic family in a small village in central France. Neither he nor his parents knew whether they would ever see each other again. Here, he saw, up close, many frightening and dangerous episodes.\\"From a childhood in Nazi-occupied France to retirement in San Diego - Phil Pressel is a man who has survived, and lived fully a life of the 20th century. A life worth telling about. In this wonderful readable memoir with its touching letters from wartime Europe, Pressel takes us along on his life's journey.\\" Roald Hoffman, Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry\\"A terrifyingly true story of the triumph of the human spirit, set against the atrocities of Nazi Germany. This book stunningly illustrates how one family's human kindness can overcome a nation filled with fear and hatred. They Are Still Alive is a compelling read from the early days of WWII to the overwhelming reunion of 2003.\\" Larry Himmel, Reporter Local 8 News, a CBS affiliate in San Diego"},{"Title":"Stray thoughts for girls","review":"This is an end of school year lecture/open letter to the senior class of an all girl school.

The number of cognates is extraordinary 264 double-columed pages and the organization by themes is very easy to follow through an alphabetical listing of topics. Entries are alphabetically listed, in English, under subtopics, so items can be found quickly.Nash's Introduction is excellent. The student-oriented orthographic and phonologic description of the Cyrillic alphabet is lucid and thorough. The sections on the nature of cognates and their use in translation are applicable to any language context.The book is available only in paerback. This keeps the cost down but magnifies wear and tear on books subject to a lot of handling.Dr. Eugene V. Mohr"},{"Title":"NTC's Dictionary of Russian Cognates Thematically Organized","review":"I am one of those people alluded to by another reviewer of this book, someone who lives amidst a large number of Russian speakers. My intention in buying the dictionary was not to help me learn Russian, but to aid in building the ENGLISH vocabulary of a Ukrainian man I tutor. The book is so impeccably organized (by theme groups subdivided by topics) that it has given my student and me a good foothold on the hardest part of mastering a language, namely getting to the point where you can express abstract thinking.With such topics as \\"Knowledge, Faith and the Paranormal,\\" and \\"The Inner Self,\\" it is possible to start from a ready-made vocabulary of cognates expressing the abstract and combine them with the vocabulary of concrete fact. We are thus arriving at the articulation of ideas that are part of adult thought but are nearly impossible to express in a new language or explain to someone new to English, due to a certain built-in circularity in the definitions of these concepts.In an immersion theory of teaching ESL, of course, it is not considered advisable to converse in anything but English. This allows me not to break with that doctrine, with the added bonus that I am now beginning to recognize words in Russian. If this doesn't stop soon, I may end up as a student of my student."},{"Title":"NTC's Dictionary of Russian Cognates Thematically Organized","review":"While I understand the fact that the point of this book is to quickly bolster a student's ability to speak and understand Russian vis-a-vis applying knowledge of English to Russian cognates, many of the choices listed in this book fall into the following categories:1) False cognates. There are numerous cases where an anglicised or latinate word is rendered into Russian incorrectly. This is confusing for Russians listening to the speaker, who do not understand exactly what the anglophone is trying to say.2) For many of these words, recent borrowings from English exist, but the new word is generally not immediately as usable as the native Russian word.

The author's definition of \\"cognate\\" stretches enough to include what general texts disregard, and includes cognates for words that are in use in the English language, but aren't English. It's thematic organization makes it easy to study/self-quiz (rather like those grade-school vocabulary tests we all had to take.) The organization also makes it easy to understand the context of a word, which a bi-lingual dictionary doesn't always do.

I have taught the full Aeneid often, and I am now teaching this abridged version in a very short summer course--we'll be doing the whole epic in one week! If you have to choose between reading some of the Aeneid or none of it, read some. If you have the time to read the whole thing, it will be a worthwhile investment of your time, and Lombardo offers a full text, which is good. This is a practical and efficient way to get students reading Virgil when time does not allow for longer reading assignments.Giving this useful and solid edition 1 star because it's incomplete is tantamount to giving any English edition one star because it's not in the original Latin, which is superior to any English version. The product page makes it clear that this text is an abridged version of the text, so don't be surprised at the slim volume, and the missing books. As for Lombardo's translation, it's very good.

The book is aimed for clinicians, researchers and sleep behavioral therapists. This beautiful hardcover edition begins with defining insomnia and explaining the conceptual framework of CBT treatment. Then, step by step, the author explains how to perform 8-sessions of behavioral therapy. Each concept is reinforced by a sample dialogue; it is like having a coach next to the reader. Troubleshooting frequently encountered problems such as non-adherence is also explained. Then a sample case, session by session. To finalize, the appendices have useful clinical tools. All of these qualities make this book a must for sleep medicine fellows, or clinicians interested in CBT for insomnia."},{"Title":"Cognitive Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia: A Session-by-Session Guide","review":"Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders in the 24/7 world we live in. It's estimated that about 30% of the industrialized population has occasional bouts of insomnia during any given time and that fully 10% of the population has chronic insomnia. Although hypnotics can be helpful - they appear to be most helpful in transient insomnias (usually caused by transient stresses) which occur from time to time in people who are generally good sleepers. Hypnotics are also helpful in those with chronic insomnia but when stopped the insomnia typically recurs. In other words the effect of hypnotics is not a durable effect after the hypnotics are stopped.Cognitive behavioral therapy of chronic insomnia, on the other hand, is every bit as effective as hypnotics (the effect sizes are similar) but cognitive behavioral therapy has durable effects which can be measured up to a year after therapy has been completed. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the foundation of therapy for chronic insomnia. Yet until recently, there haven't been many \\"good\\" references on how the non-sleep specialist actually provides this type of therapy. This book answers that need.This book, written by several of the world's experts on insomnia, is a practical guide for the practitioner that describes the various components of cognitive behavioral therapy of insomnia (CBTI). CBTI combines aspects of sleep hygiene, stimulous control, sleep restriction, and cognitive therapy into an integrated approach. The session by session guide will be helpful to all counsellors - the authors provide a very rational and \\"doable\\" integration. Each session builds on progress made in the previous section. And the book has sufficient background information in the beginning to give most practioners a reasonable exposure to some fundamental principles of sleep medicine.Practicing psychologists, psychiatrists, masters level counselors, primary care providers will find this book indespensible in their practices. The book is clearly written for practitioners and fills a very needed void in the practical literature on insomnia.As a practicing sleep specialist, I give this book my highest recommendation. In fact, I've purchased several copies to distribute to health care practioners where I live - this book is a MUST read."},{"Title":"Cognitive Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia: A Session-by-Session Guide","review":"good overview. however, you may still need peer supervision in order to practice this as a healthcare professional. informative, would buy again"},{"Title":"Cognitive Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia: A Session-by-Session Guide","review":"Great book.

What I felt was annoying was how the snippets would stop short, they never seemed to satisfy the juicy middles. It's a shame because the stories themselves were fab; each one was rich with intriguing plots, colourful personalities and believable wackiness. One chapter I skimmed was \\"close to you\\" I found it predictable and excruciating to finish so I skipped it and went on to the next chapter. What I found fun, exciting and a page turner, were the clues Sylvie gives the reader, to making the rock-star connections. What at first I thought were separate identities actually intertwined as the story progressed. Sylvie did such a great job building \\"pussy\\" that I sympathized and championed her character throughout the book. I can see this book being turned into a Hollywood Movie cast with well-known controversial celebs for a few quick EZ bucks but unless it was revised it would shortly after be sent to DVD. To the publishers, using the Sharon Osbourne blurb was a sly marketing device as it was what got me to check the book out from the library. All in all, I would recommend this book for a light summer read, it only took several days to finish which is good because I would have been highly upset if I spent more reading time on a book which I felt had quickly rushed endings."},{"Title":"Too Weird for Ziggy (Black Cat Series)","review":"Terrific stuff.

After reading the book, I was left wondering if anything would ever be Too Weird for Sylvie!"},{"Title":"Too Weird for Ziggy (Black Cat Series)","review":"There are just enough well known traits in each of these characters to make you think you know who the author is writing about. Anyone with more than a passing interest in music will be able to decipher the composites.

I sure hope she writes another book."},{"Title":"North Of Clever (Hannah Garvey Mysteries #3)","review":"Imagine getting ready to finally consummate your relationship with one of the sexiest men you have ever met that just happens to be seven years younger and the sheriff of the town. You've worked up to this moment, the time is finally here, you are ready for it, anticipation hums in the air, finally, finally it is going to happen, and then wham. . . his parents show up unexpectedly before you can do the deed! Welcome to North of Clever, the continuing saga of Hannah Garvey, Sheriff David Hendrickson, and the over the hill gang of the exclusive retirement community of Valhalla Springs.As luck would have it, Hannah and David are interrupted before the big moment. Some people have all the rotten luck. Now are you ready for a nice, quiet little story? Don't be, things are never what you expect when dealing with Susann Ledbetter's stories. Have no fear; things run amok in Hannah and David's relationship when the circus comes to town. Sheriff David is continuing to campaign for his bid to be reelected as sheriff of Sanity, Missouri. His opponent is a good for nothing good old boy who promises to deliver the moon and stars to the good citizens while making mountains out of molehills the little things that have happened lately in their town while David is in lust with Hannah. David, needing some goodwill from the townspeople, goes to see the visiting circus and takes Hannah along. It should be a day of fun and goodwill. Right? As usual, life isn't simple with our heroine and hero. Who does Hannah just happen to meet at the circus? Her long lost father who turns out to be none other than Reilly Boone, former star magician. He is now the husband-assistant of the lady illusionist AnnaLeigh who just happens to be built like a centerfold and isn't exactly what you call the faithful wife. During their performance the lovely, two-timing AnnaLeigh bites the dust as their bullet-catch trick turns out to be the real thing and she ends up dead. Reilly is charged with murder and Hannah and the over the hill gang race to prove his innocence.This is a fun book to read; however, it doesn't quite manage to hit all the high notes as the two previous books. I can't really put my finger on what isn't right in the story. While the over the hill gang played their part, it seems like they don't have much to do with the plot as they have in the two previous books until the end. There wasn't as much emphasis placed on Hannah and David's relationship throughout the story. Beginning and ending are pure Hannah and David, but in the middle they don't really work together as they have done in the past. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good book. I guess I was just a little disappointed it didn't have the same feel as the two previous books.However, hats off to Suzann Ledbetter for generating anticipation for the fourth book, West of Bliss in July 2002. Wouldn't you just know it, David finally pops the big question to Hannah and we are left with no answer until the next book. Like any other loyal fan, I will be waiting for it just to see what kind of trouble can follow our gang over a simple marriage proposal. With this gang, no telling what is in store for us!"},{"Title":"North Of Clever (Hannah Garvey Mysteries #3)","review":"This book is the third in the series involving Hannah Garvey, the manager of an exclusive adult community. This book picks up where the second left off. Hannah and David Hendrickson had been about to (finally!) consumate their relationship when his parents unexpectedly turned up, interrupting the moment. It had taken a while for Hannah to get to that point, since she has issues with the fact that David is seven years younger than she is (she's about age 43 at the time of this story).All that, however, becomes secondary to the main plot, which is the arrival of the circus in town, and its magician, a man who claims to be Hannah's father. Hannah's childhood had been a rocky one, and she isn't prepared to just welcome Daddy back with open arms. Of course, all isn't sweetness and light at the circus either, and needless to say, a murder occurs and the magician appears to be the culprit.I thought that by the third book I might begin to get tired of Sarah's cohorts, a band of intrepid yet busybody seniors, but I actually liked them more in this book. Their personalities are differentiated better, I guess, and it's obvious that their actions are motivated on a large part by affection for Hannah. The romance between Hannah and David continues to perk along, becoming more sexually charged as time passes. One of the best parts of the romance is that he is rock-sure of his feelings toward her, which is a nice change of pace for a male lead character.All in all, this is a great continuation of the series, and I'm looking forward to the next book."},{"Title":"North Of Clever (Hannah Garvey Mysteries #3)","review":"The geriatric residents and the staff of the Valhalla Springs Retirement Community in the Ozarks as well as the citizens of Sanity, Missouri are excited over the arrival of the circus. However, the community manager Hannah Garvey turns into numbing shock when circus magician Reilly Boone introduces himself claiming to be her long lost father. He knows a lot about Hannah, but her main squeeze Sheriff David Henrickson thinks Reilly is pulling a sleight of the hand con.The situation turns deadly when Reilly's wife and partner AnnaLeigh takes a bullet during a performance. Reilly has the motive (beneficiary of a large life insurance policy), the means (their joint act that included a gun prop), the opportunity (during a performance), and a history (two previously dead wives). Everyone except Hannah believes he killed his spouse. As Hannah sets out to prove her father could never commit murderer, her elderly charges don clown costumes to infiltrate the circus and keep their beloved manager safe.NORTH OF CLEVER, the third Hannah Garvey \\"sedate\\" Ozarks tale, retains the wonderful wackiness of the previous novels (see EAST OF PECULIAR and SOUTH OF SANITY) due to the endearing, but ultra-eccentric ensemble. Though the story line is a romantic amateur sleuth tale, the plot is much more humorous than it is a taut suspense thriller. The characters leave readers laughing from one incident to another so that fans will impatiently await West of whatever and hopefully other in-between \\"due\\" directions on the amusing compass of Sanity.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"North Of Clever (Hannah Garvey Mysteries #3)","review":"I had read Ms. Ledbetter's previous two books and enjoyed them both.

The report also had to be written in 1st person so this autobiography was perfect for her to use. It was a huge project in our school, due on \\"American History Day\\" when the children all dressed up as their characters. This book really helped my daughter \\"get to know\\" Jane Addams and play her part.And I loved being able to download this for free on my Kindle! Amazon...you saved the day!"},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-house,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"Along with Addams herself, \\"Twenty Years At Hull-House\\" inspired generations of US social and political activists. For decades a Hull House sojourn, or at least a visit, was virtually a pilgrimage for all kinds of progressive reformers. Jane Addams came from a conventional Middle American milieu, but was radicalized by seeing the ravages of the Industrial Revolution both in Britain and Chicago. This timeless memoir of the years 1889-1909 documents her wide-ranging concerns, embracing public health, pacifism and feminism as well as philanthropy, working-class education and poverty alleviation. Nationalist hysteria damaged Addams's reputation as a result of her antiwar stance during World War I, but it recovered enough for her to win the 1931 Nobel Peace Prize. Students had mixed views of book and author. To some she is a revelation, but others see her as rather sanctimonious (a fair criticism to some extent). Her prose is accessible but a little archaic now, sometimes appearing flowery or pompous, which deters some readers. While I respect and admire Addams, I waited in vain for the epiphany felt by thousands inspired by her life's work. People who find their own way to \\"Hull-House\\" will probably appreciate her more than those required to read her book---but such unsought exposure lies at the heart of liberal education, and brings many rewards."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-house,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"This is an inspiring book!

Her goal it seems was to bring high society upper middle class values to the poor. She rarely talks about others who had to be involved. If it did not include her she was not interested in reporting. She also failed to show that she actually helped anyone better thier lives. She just crows about how she brought literature and art to the poor masses."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-house,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"I had to read this for a history class. It jumped around so much to different time periods that I kept loosing my place. I ended up having to reread parts several times and then I still couldn't even finish the book. I ended up just giving up."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-house,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"This was a different kind of book for me, and I found it a challenge to finish it. It was heart breaking in many ways to see how some people might live, and for sure it woke me up to reality. I am glad I read this book. If you want to read another book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-house,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"You have to be insane to like this book... wait... You have to be insane to even READ this book."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-house,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"Most of the people who reviewed this book were forced to read it in college, admittedly. A couple of them openly confessed to having given up part-way through. My question: Why are you reviewing the book you haven't even read? Granted, it's not a Hollywood film, but it is perhaps one of the greatest works of the 20th century, written by an author who stands on par with Gandhi or Mother Teresa in her committment to social justice. Think about it this way: Addams' settlement house (or Hull House, as it was called) was like an ashram built in the middle of Chicago's dirtiest late 19th century slum. She was doing social work of a kind that had never been done before - working with immigrants, single mothers, orphins, troubled youth and the unemployed. The scope of her sociological experience has never been matched. Politically, Addams was an advocate for the abolition of war, and these views not only secured her the Nobel Prize, but also a black-listing with the House of Un-American Activities. I don't see what is not to like about this book. It is autobiographical in the strict sense of the term, but Addams was larger than life. If you are even vaguely interested in ethics, social work, sociology, social justice, or democracy, Addams' story will inspire and amaze you. Her life was a paradigmn of exellence. It was a life that will inspire you to achieve greatness yourself. I cannot over-recommend familiarizing yourself with this figure, and 20 Years at Hull House is the best place to start."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-house,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"Like many of her fellow &quot;Progressives,&quot; Jane Addams was born in the midwest and received an exceptional scholastic and religious education. She was strongly devoted to her father and shared with him a reverence for Abraham Lincoln not just as a man, but as a living ideal against which all men should measure their ideas and actions. Typical of many reformers of her era, Addams was not attracted to evangelical duty. Missionary work left her with a sense of futile detachment from the wretched social conditions she witnessed in East London. After visiting Toynbee Hall, Addams decided to establish a similar settlement house in the rapidly-growing city of Chicago, where &quot;the evil and vices of American life seemed to be exaggerated.&quot; Her experiences at this settlement house are the subject of this book.Although, on the one hand, Addams seemed the typical Progressive; on the other hand she did not follow many of the ideas of the more radical reformers. She was very practical and refused to be swayed by the claims of certain social movements and untried panaceas. she did not become a socialist. Although she greatly admired Tolstoy, she found his message &quot;confused and contradictory&quot; and doubted its suitability to the situation in Chicago. She deplored any violent tactics associated with socialist and anarchist groups despite their &quot;noble motives.&quot; Addams demostrated an understanding of the ways in which strikes had a detrimental effect on people outside the labor movement (her dying sister was unable to see her family because the transportation system was blocked due to the Pullman strike. Unlike most reformers, she also had respect for the immigrant cultures represented at Hull House. A labor museum put native sewing machines and other instruments and crafts on display for all to enjoy.One observation made by this reader was the animosity on the part of European reformers toward the work of the settlement residents. Tolstoy offered petty criticisms and one English visitor concluded that reformers in America were indifferent to the plight of the poor because they could not recite the &quot;cubic feet of air required for each occupant of a tenement bedroom.&quot; Such remarks smack of a &quot;caring competition.&quot; Addams, however, was well aware that the settlement house experiment was far from complete. Jane Addams' honest and humble account--albeit long and sometimes rambling (don't let the skinny paperback fool you)--demonstrated her unwavering commitment to achieving the improvement and unity of humanity."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-house,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"Though Addams' prose often gets mired in the florid and highly mannered style of her era, this is a surprisingly compelling book. Free of the ethnic racism and stereotyping that blight many similar works of the era, Addams' account of her groundbreaking community center in one of the worst parts of late 19th-century Chicago fairly overflows with compassion and almost unbelievable fairness. Addams's intelligence is evident, and many of her ideas and attitudes seem decades ahead of their time. It's not light reading by any stretch of the imagination, but &quot;Twenty Years at Hull House&quot; contains many gripping portraits of the desperation of immigrant life and the simple power of human decency."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-house,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"Twenty Years at Hull House is an outstanding example of the humanitarianism movement in America at the turn of the century. Jane Addams, the author and narrator of the book, was born in Illinois. Early in her life she began to see the effects of poverty on people. She recalls one incident early in her life of seeing a homeless man on the street. She asked her father why that was, and he replied that that was just the way things were. Her father was a Quaker and the most prominate role model in Jane's life. As a child she grew up wanting to be just like him. For a while, she aspired to be a mill owner just like him. Her mother is not mentioned in the book at all. Jane went to Rockford College and soon toured London. It was there that she came up with the idea of the Hull House. Hull House was a settlement house in Chicago. It offered day care and college level classes for women. Spawning from her work at the house, Jane joined many causes that she passionately fought for. These causes included working hours for women, child labor laws, and juivenile court. She could be considered an early feminist. Also from her work at Hull House, Jane started studing the causes of poverty and the effects it had on society. She was not satisfied with just the success of her house; she wanted to know why there was a need for it at all. Later in her life she joined the womens sufferage movement. Jane Addams was a wonderful reformist and feminist that sought to better the country. Twenty Years at Hull House offer insight into one of America' most interesting time periods."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-house,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"I am doing a History Fair project on the Hull House.

It was an inspiring book, showing what a group of dedicated ladies can do when they set their minds to something. Jane Addams is quite the heroine along with the many other ladies that helped her run Hull-House. A very inspiring story. We should all be as dedicated to doing good in the world."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-house,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"Two great books that discuss Addams huge contributions to society are the more general &quot;That Jazz!: An Idiosyncratic Social History of the American Twenties&quot; and the Chicago-specific (where she ran Hull House), &quot;Altgeld's America.&quot; Check these out as well as this source material by Addams herself (quite a good writer, actually, despite what the 20-year-old reviewer said!)."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-house,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"In 1911 Addams helped found the National Foundation of Settlements and Neighborhood Centers, and she was its first president. She was also a leader in women's suffrage and pacifist movements. In 1915 she helped found the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She received the 1931 Nobel Peace Prize (shared with American educator Nicholas Murray Butler).The Hull House could boast a group of about 2,000 people a week. It had facilities including: a night school for adults, kindergarten classes, clubs for older children, a public kitchen, an art gallery, a coffeehouse, a gymnasium, a girls club, a swimming pool, a book bindery, a music school, a drama group, a library, and labor related divisions.The Hull House also served as a women's institution of sociology and Addams was a friend and colleague to the early men of the Chicago School of Sociology influencing their social thought of the time through her work in applied sociology, which became defined as social work by academic sociologists of the time. Addams did not, however, consider herself a social worker. She co-authored the Hull-House Maps and Papers in 1893 that came to define the interests and methodologies of Chicago Sociology. She worked with George H. Mead on social reform issues including women's rights and the 1910 Garment Workers' Strike. Addams combined the central concepts of symbolic interactionism with the theories of cultural feminism and pragmatism to form her sociological ideas."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-house,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"I enjoy reading about strong women with great vision.

Unlike many popular works of fiction about the era, this book does not solely concentrate on the &quot;blood and guts&quot; either during the war or afterwards. It also explores the hero's complex relationships with his wife, family, and other Vietnam Vets. The men who actually served are not the only victims of this war - the wife suffers the effects of her husband's PTSD, and later, when he finally connects to other veterans, has to tolerate homeless or drug addicted or just plain strange &quot;brothers&quot; invading her home at all hours of the day and night, eating the food, drinking the beer, and throwing things at the TV set when the news stories displease them. Required reading for all vets, all vets families, and all vets friends"},{"Title":"Buffalo Afternoon","review":"This is another good book to add to your library chronicling the war in Vietnam. The more you read about this chapter in our history the more you understand the damage that occurred to the minds of the soldiers involved in that military action.

Pete Bravado, an Italian-American from Brooklyn, takes on the adventure of a lifetime only to face crushing realities both abroad and at home. Readers who have experienced the same or whose memories sit on the periphery of the Vietnam years will be drawn into the lives of a soldier, his family and culture, and a country imagined beautiful in times of peace.

This book will make you feel like you're there and &quot;back in the world&quot;. Of course, you must experience the entire scene, so here's some acid to trip on. That's exactly what reading this book is like. You could almost hear the Doors playing in the background while reading this hallucinatory tale of madness and schizophrenia. This book definately has a &quot;women's&quot; touch, mixed with the ethearal feel of Pynchon. For a far superior straight fiction of Vietnam, I'd highly recommend Michael Peterson's A Time of War"},{"Title":"The Bible: Faith's Family Album","review":"This book offers fresh insight into the often-puzzling text of the Bible. How can we reconcile the many conflicting messages to be found in Holy Scripture? The author extensively develops a convincing and illuminating metaphor, that the Bible is not a seamless, coherent transcription of the word of God. Rather, it is a document compiled through time by a community of faith, primarily concerned with ethical rules for preserving their communities. Admittedly, various mischief-makers, scoundrels. anti-feminists, and slave owners are portrayed, alongside those prophets whose eloquent insights into issues of peace, justice, love, right behavior, the meaning of suffering, and loyalty to kin have inspired humankind through the centuries. Thus, it acts as an album in which our origins, progress, triumphs and wrong turnings as a family of faith are candidly presented and explored. Good's book discsusses the Bible as a whole, with the books of both testaments presented in the sequence in which they were written. This approach provides an accurate historical context for each of the books, written by God-inspired authors, each one a product of his time and place. It also helps to clarify the evolutiohnary process under which our spiritual and ethical understandings have evolved. &quot;The entire Bible can be embraced. Even those parts with an unsavory ethic can be accepted as insight into the development of one's spiritual ancestry.&quot; (p. 17)Also highlighted in Dr. Good's approach is the family relationship that exists between Judaism and Christianty. One of the most healing aspects of Good's scholarship is to emphasize Christianity's &quot;debt to and its organic union with its parent Jewish faith. The rewards are great if we can reclaim our Jewish ancsestry.&quot; (p. 134) &quot;The New Testament acquires a different coloration when it is read as a continuation of and in the context of its Hebrew ancestry.&quot; (p.128) Use of this book in an adult Bible study class provokes stimulating discussions. An appendix includes a history of Biblical writings correlated with &quot;decisive events, &quot; known to have occurred concurrently with the writings. In addition, there is a Study Guide at the back of the book that includes summaries and a generous collection of discussion questions for each of the eleven chapters and suggestions for reading to prepare for the next class. This unique volume with its perspective on our relationship to and understanding of a book that has been held sacred for over 2000 years, guarantees strong reader responses. It moves away from a more traditional orientation of obedience toward one of comprehension. Two thumbs up for this book!"},{"Title":"The Bible: Faith's Family Album","review":"Jack Good's The Bible: Faith's Family Album is a systematic and thorough discussion of the Bible, and I found it very engaging. For someone like myself, who has been \\"churched\\" all my life, but for whom the an overall sense of the Bible remained somewhat vague, it was extremely educational. The author writes respectfully and with affection, but always with a surprising willingness to consider the deeper context for the \\"family arguments\\" that are contained within the Bible's pages, including the nature of God, the way in which God is to be served, and the roles of men and women within the faith family. I came away from this book with a much deeper understanding for the deeply rooted complexities of the Judeo-Christian faith family."},{"Title":"Perl: Your visual blueprint for building Perl scripts","review":"This whole series is great for Developers who learn from example.

The \\"Visual Blueprint\\" series has its purpose, however \\"Perl: Your visual blueprint for building Perl scripts\\" does not explain many important advanced tasks that Perl programmers often get into.I enjoy the aesthetic quality of the Maran Graphics' books, and have nothing against this book. However, serious programmers who want to learn much more of Perl and CGI should take a look at Perl How to Program by the Deitels. It is much more effective in teaching Perl theory as well as giving you a lot examples that are complex enough to use multiple ideas. The Complete Perl Training Coarse (also from the Deitels) is very effective as well.I am still a child, but I have explored many server-side programming technologies (Java Servlets, Applets, JSP, CGI, and Perl) and feel that I am expierenced enough to review this book."},{"Title":"Perl: Your visual blueprint for building Perl scripts","review":"I think that this is an excellent book for someone who already programs in Perl, but is looking to anchor and increase his/her knowledge via a different learning approach.I found the format of this book to be very intuitive.

Many of the players in the book have moved on or retired since 1990, when the book was written. but its stories are well-told, by turns dramatic and funny. A classic that deserves a cult.

Best of all, by the time the last page was reluctantly turned, I felt like I personally knew and could be concerned about the well being and success of almost every character; a feat which I consider a most desirable outcome of any writing venture.Although this was not the kind of book that would \\"normally\\" reach my shelves, it was worth taking a chance on it.Not knowing what to expect, it was to be my \\"company\\" while waiting to see a doctor. So there I was, reading this book in the waiting room, surrounded by a very senior group. I found myself shielding the words \\"Sex\\" and \\"Theft\\" on the cover with my left hand, and trying to hold onto the right side of my ribcage because it hurt to laugh. I couldn't help it though - the laughter kept trying to burst forth. So I read in (semi)silence, periodically wincing and gasping with the pain of suppressed laughter.No doubt the other patients felt sympathy for me, even if it was not for the correct reason.Soon it was my turn to shiver in the refrigerated examination room instead of the merely cold waiting area. I still couldn't put the book down, and not because my hands ceased to bend. Finally the doc showed up, and as usual the exam took a fraction of the time spent in waiting. Then off to a popular pharmacy the Book & I went to wait some more. At least it was warmer there.Waiting time was estimated to be 20 minutes but I think they must calculate time by a special clock from Jupiter, because I got halfway through the book and they still had not counted out my 6 pills.Again I found myself holding onto my ribs in order to chuckle at several points, but when reading the Julliard audition scene, it took 2 tissues to hide empathetic tears. (I tried to look merely allergic.) I might have sobbed aloud at that point but for the pain.

His humorous Cinderella story as a writer captured my attention so much that I hung around afterword to buy his book and have it signed. While waiting my turn, I scanned a few pages and was immedately captured by the humor. I indulged in a second copy as a birthday gift for a good friend. It's a cherished book for both of us now. I'll be purchasing another copy to loan to friends as I don't want my signed first edition to leave my possession.It's a quick read, more so because you find yourself saying \\"I'm going to finish this chapter and then go fold the laundry,\\" only to find that as the chapter ends you absolutely must move on to the next one to find out what happens. It's a wonderfully funny story. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"I read that Marc Acito is called The Gay Dave Barry, but I read Dave Barry's novels and How I Paid For College is much funnier. If this book isn't what high school was like for you, you'll wish it was. Reading this all the former quarterbacks and prom queens are going to be envying the former freaks and geeks and drama queens. It's the flip side of Ferris Bueller. I never understood the expression \\"bi now, gay later\\" until I got to know Edward Zanni, who loves the girls and loves the guys and we love this kid. His wildly creative antics as he fights for his chance to be the creative, talented person he was born to be are hilarious, touching and totally unpredictable. You will never be able to look at a Buddha statue again without laughing. Last year I gave all my friends my favorite CD for Christmas. This year I'm giving them all this book. For however long it takes them to read it, I know they're going to be happy."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"How I Paid for College is a light, entertaining read with a few laugh-out-loud moments. The author, syndicated columnist Marc Acito, tries hard to be funny, but sometimes he tries too hard. He uses broad stereotypes for much of his humor, targeting Italians, Jews, and gays most frequently. Acito is at his best when he's exploring Edward's confused feelings about life, family, and his burgeoning interest in his hunky friend Doug.Most of the characters are likeable enough, but they all seem to come from the stock characters' warehouse. We have the overweight drama queen best friend, the brilliant-but-nerdy Jewish neighbor, the sweet-but-dumb jock, the stoic lesbian, etc. We've even seen the charming, but somewhat feckless Edward before in characters like Ferris Bueller. Despite the familiarity with the types, Acito does manage to make them all come alive.Acito doesn't break any new ground here, but How I Paid for College is a quick, enjoyable read, perfect for a lazy summer day at the beach or by the pool."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"Edward is in trouble. His dad has remarried, and under the influence of his domineering new wife is refusing to pay for Edward to go to Julliard, where he wants to study acting. His girlfriend is attracted to his male best friend, a football star, to whom Edward is also attracted....then there's the beautiful Iranian emigre, who seems to be attracted to everyone....HOW I PAID is a funny, exuberant, novel of sexual confusion and beoming an adult in early 80s New Jersey....Edward and his friends must find a way to pay for Edward's education, leading to a series of farcical situations and law skirting situations....Acito really understands how nonconformist teens can find an alternative family in high school, and the bond between these misfits feels very real...I would have been moved more by the (...)straight conflict if almost every single person Edward comes in contact with didnt want him...even the straight football player is almost up for it during a school trip....still, a very enjoyable read if you remember how no one understood you in high school....."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"If you went to high school in the 80's, if you were in drama or choir or (God bless you) you're Gay, This might be your book.

Think lawn ornaments.We get to see what happens when a theater kid reaches total desperation and sexual and moral confusion.The chaos that ensues will leave you laughing to the point of gasping for breath."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"I do not read, well, let me rephrase that, before this book I did not read. I have an extensive background in theatre and this book was so entertaining I finished it in two days. For me that is a great feet. If you liked catcher in the rye, which till now was my favorite book, and you have an appreciation for the theatre, you will love this book. I was hysterical reading this book, it is sooooo funny. The characters are so rich and the story envelopes you. I heard they are making this into a major motion picture and I hope i am not disappointed. Read this book immediately, I guarantee you will love it."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"Not only was this book absolutely hysterical (I found myself laughing outloud at some very inopprotune moments, like someone else's solo during a rehearsal. Woops...), but it was incredibly moving. There were moments when I wanted to hurl the book across the room I was so angry with one of the characters, and others when I wish I had had as good friends in highschool. Wanting to make not just acting, but acting while singing music written at least a hundred years ago, (opera) my career, I know what it's like to face those odds to begin with, and this book made me appreciate how incredible my parents have been.It's quite simply the best book I've read all year, including others by some of my favorite authors. I look forward to Marc's next novel. Please please let it be soon.And Sally from New York, I think you're an idiot. How do you know that it's a publicity stunt? If you like the book, which you say you do, then give it the rating it deserves, not the rating you think you should give to even out the score. Perhaps it's simply people who haven't felt moved enough to write a review until now. That's my story. When I love something enough, I want the whole world to be able to partake in it. And if that means writing a rave, then that's what I'll do."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"There are very few books in life that make you laugh out loud, and I predict this will have that effect on many who read this book. Because I work for a newspaper I got an advance copy and read it in one night. It's the kind of book you don't want to put it down -- it's so funny, and the characters' problems are so pressing and poignant, you are driven to find out what creative and hilarious means they use to solve them. They never disappoint. I especially laughed over the teenagers' acts of 'creative delinquency,' which I interpreted as desperate ways to somehow control an environment in which the all-powerful adults utterly ignore them, squelch them, or condemn them. The way the young people wrest power from the not-so-observant adults is both heart-wrenching and very funny. Another important aspect of this book: what happens when parents try to 'find themselves,' and the kids are left behind. Coping with wicked stepparents or parents who've disappeared in search of themselves is not typically comic material, but here it's handled with wit as well as insight. If you've ever been a disaffected youth (and who hasn't?), a sensitive misunderstood jock, a high school Theater Person, the brilliant geek, or anyone who dreamed big and had parents determined to keep you small, you'll find something familiar and amusing in this book. Oh yeah -- and there's lots of sex.The laughter quotient and Marc Acito's writing, full of surprises and pleasures, are why I give this book five stars. In the week after I read the book, I recommended it to a number of friends and loaned it to two others; they loved it. Give this book to your confused kids, to your confused friends, to your confused parents, and to anyone who needs a good laugh."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"this is wonderful, well-written book! i am a huge \\"theater person\\" so it touched me even more! this author is wonderful and i highly recommend this book to anyone. i listened to it on cd, it was great!

I can read it over and over again, and it makes me laugh so hard I almost cry. I've lent it to everyone I know, and they also love it. I can't wait for Marc Acito's future novels!"},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"Marc Acito's book, How I Paid for College, is a fast-paced, thrilling, completely hilarious read full of everything the subtitle suggests (sex, theft, friendship, and musical theater).Follow the adventures of Edward Zanni as he struggles to find a way to pay for college after his father refuses to pay for acting school. This book is full of one zany adventure after the other, with each one topping the previous with laugh out loud moments.The cast of characters is really what makes the book, which includes a very well-endowed jock turned theater guy, a cheerleader/actress who enjoys a little cunninglingus action done in one of the most creative ways I've ever read, an evil \\"stepmonster,\\" a geeky jewish guy with a talent for breaking the law ... and on and on.In the midst of all the laughs, Edward discovers who he is and the value of real friendship. That's the most charming thing about this book - the amount of heart in it."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"Very funny book.

I am recommending it to everyone!"},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"I teach high school music and I found this book to by far, be the most hilarious work I have ever had the privilege to read. I felt the need to read passages to my friends with whom I was sharing a flight because I couldn't stop laughing out loud by the antics of Edward and his friends. Edward's narration was both witty and poignant, but most of all, it captured every nuance of the teenage mind and soul."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"I enjoyed this book quite a bit. It was funny though at times got a bit too humerous, like it was trying to be funny when it didn't have to be.Certain situations could have been done better with a bit more serious, but at the same time, that's not what this book is about so it's not fair to judge it like that. It was written to be funny and it succeeds.I find that one of the former reviewers is correct in a lot of the characters seem a bit too similar. And you never really get a good grip on the main character, he's always changing his mind or changing image. The only thing that really annoyed me was how he got in shape and all that jazz, because that seems just a bit cliche. walking and losing weight. But that might just be a pet peeve.This book has a unique ending and at the same time also seems just a bit too clean but at the same time it still keeps you guessing. So, four stars because it's not perfect, but it does hold your attention and is a great semi-light read."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"I had the pleasure of going to a lecture by the author and meeting him. He's great, very funny, and his personality stands out in the book.Edward is the narrator, taking us from the summer before senior year in high school to graduation. Don't be fooled by the title, there's little to do with paying for college. It's a funny coming-of-age that feels very real.Edward is a pudgy Italian kid with a MIA mother, a drugged out sister, a junk-bond loving father, and a penchant for being mistaken as a waiter in restaurants even when dressed as a priest. Edward's best friend is Paula, a year older and a very idiosyncratic friend he calls \\"sis\\". His girlfriend is Kelly, who should be a cheerleader but instead is a fellow \\"play person\\". His other friend Nate is sociopath computer geek. Edward is bi-sexual, or thinks he is, and is in love with Doug, the captain of the football team he cons into joining a play. Rounding out the group is Ziba, a Persian expatriate Doug wants to nail.They fight boredom with creative vandalism, calling themselves the CV, explore their sexuality, and learn to grow up. Towards the end Edwards father marries a Nazi and decides to not pay for him to go to Julliard. Horror of horrors!There are some hilariously creative attempts at a life of crime for which no one but Nate is eminently suited. Edward learns to be good slowly by accepting that life is hard and nothing can replace hard work. However, for you budding blackmailers out there, this is your Martha Stewart style-tutorial on how-to. Discrete photo developers: they're a good thing.Acito stated it took as long as two and a half years to complete this and that does affect the tone of this book, developing like M*A*S*H from a comedy with dramatic elements to a drama with comedic elements.Still, it's great, it's hilarious, thoroughly enjoyable for everyone from JD Salinger fans to Janet Evanovich fans. It's driving and the kind of book you must devour in one sitting.I know it's been optioned into a movie by Columbia, way to go! I hope they keep as much of this book into the screenplay because this rocks.I got a preview of his next work and it was great. Please don't miss this author or this book, you'll be sorely disappointed!"},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"I really enjoyed this...easy to read, entertaining and particularly meaningful to anyone involved in the performing arts. Marc Acito captures precisely what being a \\"play person\\" in a suburban high school in the mid 80's was like! Don't miss this one."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"Any person who watches the above named movie and thinks thats what real highschool musicals are like, you need help, and this book which shows what real play people are like. Despite the outragoeuos plot and the fact that it tskes place over two decades ago, it is still a true show of what teenagers are like and I defy anyone who contradicts it, read it, the title tells it all SEX, musical theatre, and mostly freindship, not for the prudish or immature, but everyone else in the world."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"This is a laugh-out-loud funny book about the life that every creative and semi-creative person will wish they had led. The characters are smart and witty as they hurdle through life attacking obstacles in front of them with often hilarious results. In addition to making me laugh, it is a clearly interesting and intelligent read. The ridiculousness of the human condition is beautifully portrayed and should remind us all not to take ourselves too seriously, at 18 or at 50."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"This is one of my favourite books ever.I bought it when it came out, loved the hero and his friends, laughed till I cried. And read it again. And again. And bought about a dozen volumes, to give as presents to my children, my friends, and my children's friends.I have become a fan of Marc Acito, go to his web page, post in his blog... And the same thing has happened to my children and friends.

The voice is original. The pace is delightful. Acito puts the fun in profundity. And the ditty, too. Musical theater geeks rejoice."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"No American author since Patrick Dennis has so brilliantly created screwball, madcap comic writing like Mr. Acito. Once begun, it will be difficult to put this book (and its sequel) down. Side-slittingly funny and also poignant, especially for those of us high school and college nerds who sang in the chorus and joined the Drama Club.Like the aforementioned Patrick Dennis (of Auntie Mame fame), Marc Acito begins with a simple premise (in this instance, a college-bound high school drama student needs to finance his education). He then layers the premise with chapter-after-chapter of completely unexpected hijinks that make your head spin and force you to laugh out loud. The author has a brilliant ability to plot his stories with such dexterity that the absurdist nature of it all never seems over-plotted. I cannot reommend this book enough for its sheer comic delight."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"This book is very clever and enjoyable. It never got too silly like some of Joe Keenan's novels.I would definitely recommend this for people who enjoy Carl Hiassen and Christopher Buckley's work.I'm glad to see there's a sequel!"},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"The only small negative comment I have: it made me feel so boring!

The funniest book I've read since Joe Keenan's MY BLUE HEAVEN. Maybe it's because I graduated high school around the same time or maybe it's because I grew up in the suburbs with musical theater and dreams of New York City as my only escape - whatever the case, I identified with this book from the first mention of the movie FAME and leg warmers. A thoroughly enjoyable read - I can't recommend it enough. Here's hoping a movie version happens - ASAP - (unlike the long-gestating film of MY BLUE HEAVEN).

You will find yourself laughing out loud and wanting more."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"I read an advance copy of this book, and couldn't get enough of it! Performers who read fiction on the performing arts are often disappointed by the lack of authentic detail and overall implausibility of the story line and characterization. This little gem manages to involve you in a compelling story, introduce you to sincerely likeable characters, present an ambience of cheesy 80's nostalgia, and give you a true taste of the musical theater experience - while making you laugh until cappuccino spurts out your nostrils. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"This is probably the best gay coming of age book I've ever read. The characters are real...a little over the top sometimes, but real. It takes some serious looks at coming out, but mainly it's a comedic farce about being who you are and getting what you want out of life. I loved that the characters weren't a bunch of hardbodied droids running around with throbbing manhoods like SO much gay fiction. Don't get me wrong, there's a place for that and this book has a bit of it, but it also has geeks and queens and dykey Persians and everything else. Very fun!"},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"This was one of the funniest novels I have ever read. Parts of it reminded me of M*A*S*H*, parts of it reminded me of A Confederacy of Dunces, and lots of it reminded me of how good it is to laugh. Eddie Zanni is the main character, and Marc Acito does a great job bringing Eddie to life. His quest to get money to attend Julliard once his father refuses to pay for anything but business school, is what drives the novel, but it's the little pieces that make this book hum. The supporting characters are described well, and the many sexual combinations and humorous criminal activities keep this book zinging along."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"If you're looking for a light-hearted, rollickingly good read...this is the book. I never laughed out loud reading a book, but this had me doing that on the subway. Marc Acito's writing is a breath of fresh air.

NOW !!!"},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"Acito's first novel tries so hard to be wacky that you can't help but want to cut the guy a break. But his break was getting the book published to positive (judging by the rhapsodic Amazon reviews and cover blurbs) acclaim, so it's not really my job to be a cheerleader if I'm not feeling it.\\"How I Paid for College\\" should have been edited more fiercely and whittled down to half its size. I put this book down on more than one occasion, debating whether to pick it back up due to a dawdling beginning. Instead of being able to jump right into the book, you wade through chapter after verbose chapter until the central conflict finally appears deep within the first quarter of the novel.My biggest problem with the book was how many cliches and formulaic dialogue Acito trots out. Yes, there actually is a scene when the characters try and prevent an authority figure from using the bathroom because, get this ... they're HIDING SOMEBODY IN THERE!!! Remember how this device was used quite a lot on 70's fare like \\"Three's Company\\"? Remember when it wasn't all that funny then either? And the less said about the really tiresome (sitcomish again) device of hijinks in priest and nun garb, the better. Add a distasteful blackmail tactic that really stretches the limits of taste (Acito seems to find this scenario of photographing people naked when they're out cold so funny that he uses it twice), and you're just stuck with a YA novel in disguise with a lot of tiresome (and gratuitous) sex.Characters are introduced, and then sidelined, then reemerge and then will curiously vanish altogether. While it's good that Acito doesn't overdo it with the cultural references, it can be argued that the 80s setting is therefore superfluous: the book could have easily been set in contemporary times. And despite the \\"edginess\\" of sexual ambiguity this book promises, it's a big tease and most of the sex is just status quo."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"I enjoyed the story and the characters. Even if some of the plot doesn't seem possible and the characters are older than their supposed 18 years. They were a hell of a lot more further along than I was at my graduation in 1983. But it is fiction. The message about friends sticking toghether is woven throughout the book and it is a great message if your afraid of sexuality in novels or not. However the ending was too simplistic. After having all these enjoyable loose ends it stinks to have the package all wrapped up in a short chapter at the end. Quick and easy to read and fun."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"Marco Acito has written a highly entertaining and sometimes clever novel (and yes, I was a play person in high school). It's one of those quick reads that makes you smile a lot (and sometimes wince, remembering your own behavior). I was disappointed, however, with shortcuts taken in wrapping up the plot (warning: spoiler coming). Edward's mother and her absence is prominent throughout the story, and we always know she will show up in the end and somehow save the day. When she does, it's flimsy and unsatisfying. There is no motivation for her arrival, and she disappears immediately after having delivered her save-the-day information. Worse yet, the emotional implications of her sudden presence (and disappearance) are largely ignored, and her character is used as nothing more than a plot device for resolving the Julliard issue, missing a real opportunity for Edward to grow in other ways. I believe Marc Acito is a talented writer who knows how to do better than this -- then again, you never know what some over-zealous editor got rid of. Regardless, an entertaining read that will make a funny movie."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"This book was well written but the content was nothing but trash.

I wish I'd known these people when I was going to HS in NJ. They are hysterical and very loyal friends. Despite some unethical moments, it is a sweet coming of age story.I read the hardcover book and found it very funny, but I am told the guy who does the audio version is very dramatic and makes the story even funnier, so you might want to get that version instead. But whatever form you get it in you should definitely get this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"I was browsing my friend's bookshelves when I found an ORANGE book spine and cover. Orange is my totem color (if you can have a totem animal, why not a power color?) and thus is always a positive sign. I took it as a portent and pulled the book off the shelf. (For you Kindle hardcores, that's a physical action like pulling a CD out of--er, I mean, pulling a DVD from a--er, make that taking a Blu-Ray disc off of--aw, the hell with explaining it!) After flipping a few pages to sample paragraphs at random, which I often do with an unknown quantity, I found myself completely charmed and drawn into the book's world by the chaotic-whimsical voice of the author.I wish I could meet him. He sounds like a fun person to watch (but I wouldn't want to DATE him, ha!)HOW I PAID turned out to be a good old-fashioned BOOK book like the ones I used to read years ago when only good writers wrote books (Bazinga!) Granted, it's full of sexual situations and dirty words but yet wasn't really ABOUT them, and is ABOUT far deeper issues. I always secretly planned to attend Juilliard from age eight to age fourteen, when it finally became obvious that I couldn't practice the piano three hours a day to maintain my audition pieces and that my piano couldn't even be brought up to concert pitch anyway AND my parents intended me to become an astronaut and quit allowing me to practice at all. So the quest for Juilliard tuition and all the references to the theater and acting really connected me to the characters, who seemed a bit less heathen than the average Adam Sandler type. If you were a Drama geek in high school, you know how life can be Really Dramatic and turn into High Camp at a moment's notice. I can't count the number of times that our Drama department did crazy things that made for exciting times, and this book captures some of that.Don't be put off by the short chapters and \\"dirty\\" stuff. This is a hilarious coming-of-age novel as it might be told by Neil Simon or the pre-\\"Annie Hall\\" Woody Allen. Or even the Saul Bellow of the \\"Augie March\\" and \\"Henderson the Rain King\\" years. It's not really for teens--it's more for someone who can look back on his or her teen years with fondness and nostalgia and identify with the universal struggle.An earlier reviewer said that it \\"could be a modern classic if it weren't so raunchy.\\" I'm not so sure that raunchiness rules out the \\"modern classic\\" status in our post-postmodern cynicism-by-age-three image-is-all world. Sure, parts of this are seedy, over-the-top, and so forth, but that's what makes it funny. Trust me on this.Give this a try instead of reading another of those vampire/werewolf things. You'll discover what a clever turn of phrase really is--and might realize how much you enjoy reading something that's truly funny. Then you can go read my LITTLE RITUALS, which is just as funny (in my humble opinion), and possibly Bellow's HENDERSON THE RAIN KING, which I mentioned earlier as a novel that is funny at its core.

The made up narrator is a very self centered melodramatic teen. His friends are the high school drama dorks. It is fiction. For the first half, I thought I was reading someone's actual account of the title. When the story got hard to believe, I learned that was because it was made up. I read it through to the end and I laughed out loud a couple times, but I struggled to get through. I didn't care what happened to the main character because his teen angst, self pity and self importance irritated me. The line \\"When they make a movie about my life....\\" appeared several times. I do not think he did anything in the book interesting enough to warrant a movie.The book is not terrible, just highly over rated."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"I was a senior at university in 1983, which is the same year this book starts out. Like the main character, I was deeply conflicted about my sexuality and had suffered financial repercussions from my family when they learned that I seemed to swing both ways. This fiction resonates with believabilty, reality and clarity, and even mirrors some of my real experiences. This is a serious book embellished with wit and camp and enough cultural references to fell a deer. It was impossible for me to put down. Should be required,reading for gay men over the age of 40, because so many of us can relate to this rag-tag group of misfits."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"Absolutely hilarious for anyone who has ever spent any time in a High School drama department, done theater, loves Glee ... should be a movie!"},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"I had great fun reading this comedy. Perhaps it's not quite suitable for high school libraries, but maybe I'm being a bit too prudish and perhaps it is. Acito does a fantastic job of keeping the comedy high, even as he uses some scenes to set up an even bigger payoff in a later scene. Forty-one short chapters means you don't need to set aside a couple of hours at a stretch to read it, but I'm sure you'll wind up reading more in one sitting than you intended. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"Just for the heck of it, I picked this book and its companion up from the Library on Saturday. Being one of the \\"Play People,\\" this looked really fun to read. Boy was I wrong. It was not just fun to read, but a fabulous tale of Theater, Blackmail and stealing Buddhas. I tore through this book and \\"Attack of the Theater People\\" in one sitting on Saturday. Such witty words have never been put to page. Mr. Acito rivals Christopher Moore in my book as one of the funniest authors out there. I felt myself really relating to Edward. Shy, insecure and aloof offstage, but a force onstage. Along with a few of the more personal moments.... Anyway, these two books were the perfect way to fight the boredom of a rainy Saturday. The fun and funny ways that Edward and his friends come up with ways to pay for Edward's first year at Julliard are unbelievable. His audition after getting drunk the night before was a hoot. His psudo-quasi romance with his well-endowed Best Friend was very heartwarming, but a little frustrating. The stand off with the evil Austrian Step-Mom from Hell... hilarious!

Just had to get that out there. ON WITH THE REVIEW!\\"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship, and Musical Theatre\\" is... well, just that. If that title makes you chuckle and intrigues you, then this book is for you. Not much else to say on that front. It's entertaining and light, but not Chic Lit light. It's just... intensely-readable-light. The writing here is extemely well crafted, laced with wordplay and more sexual puns than you can shake a phallus at.It's fun as hell and just as clever. There are even a bunch of sweet moments that make it worth investing the three or so hours it'll take to read the book. You'll care about these characters. It's honestly not a book that will stay with you long after you've read it, and I don't really feel the ferocious need to gobble the rest of Acito's catalogue up, but... it was fun while I read it. I like to think of this book as the literary equivalent of a popcorn flick for smart people.Enjoy, laugh your brains out, and smirk (a little self-consciously pretentiously) at the wordplay.

And since it is also tagged as a Gay Young Adult novel, I was really interested in reading it, since usually Gay YA novels are always sad and, let us say, depressing. How I Paid for College, A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater is all but depressing. Edward Zanni's attitude towards life is to full face front it, rather than being depressed by the odds in his path. But, truth be told, this is not even a gay novel; the fact that Edward is bisexual (because he is bisexual, maybe with a more enhanced interest in men, but not an exclusive interest) it's not the main pushing factor of the novel.Edward is at the end of his high school years and he has already planned all his future life: he will attend Julliard and he will be an actor. Lucky Edward comes from a middle class family, and even if his parents are divorced, he has not suffered much from that: he is living with his father, who sustains him in everything, and his estranged mother is traveling somewhere in the world, trying to find herself. Edward has a cheerleader type girlfriend, Kelly, and a one year older female best friend who is already enrolled to the Julliard; among his circle of friends, there is also a nerdy boy his age, the jock who Edward convinced to play the role of Danny Zucco in their high school drama class, and Ziba, the daughter of wealthy Persian refugee, who acts like a Jackie Onassis replica. The strange things of this bunch of friends is that they are not \\"ordinary\\", everyone of them is crazy on his own way, and the craziness is allowed since they haven't to worry for the day after: everyone of them is the son of the middle class environment where they live, going to college for them is to prolong the eternal game that is their life.When Edward's father remarries with an Austrian immigrate who is obviously looking for his money, for the first time Edward is faced with the reality of every ordinary teenager: his father will pay for tuition only if Edward will choose a \\"straight\\" (no pun intended) college. At first Edward tries to do the things as a normal teenager, working odd jobs to save for tuition, but 10.000 dollars is not an amount you can save in an year of afternoon job, above all since Edward seems unable to renounce to his hobbies and time with friends. And so the only other option his to steal the money from his father. Again, how they will do it is not the way of ordinary teenagers, but more a real life comedy played by rich kids.From the sentimental point of view, Edward is also developing his sexuality. He is more drawn from the aesthetic of his possible lovers than from their gender: Edward loves Kelly since she is glamour, he has a crush on Doug since he is the perfect dream date, he is drawn by his English teacher since he represents the forbidden fruit, another way to rebel to his father. Maybe it's a generalization, but I think that Edward is gay since he loves the gay world more than the gays... he loves the glitter and glamour of that world, he loves the freedom he has to go up a table and sing a musical and being cheered and not sneered at.Ab absurdo, if Edward and all his friends were more ordinary, the obvious solution to Edward's problem would have been simpler than expected... but if it was like that, there would have been this novel, and it would have been a shame, since it's, as expected, a funny and light read, and as I said, being not strictly connected to a gay teen experience, it has a wider breath."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"This book was so suprisingly good.

Including the families who damage them as only those who love you the most can. I would not recommend this for young readers, as it is quite bawdy and sometimes graphic.

Ed, the narrator-protagonist, is about to enter his senior year in high school and his main goal in life is to go to Julliard, but his business-oriented dad decides that Julliard won't get him anywhere in life, so he won't pay for it. Ed and his amusing friends set off on a quest to come up with the cash to pay for college. It's 1984, so college isn't quite the expensive proposition we now know it to be, but Ed still has got to come up with quite a chunk of change. The novel isn't really about with getting money for college, it is really about getting the courage to see who you truly are. Ed realizes his own sexuality, as do most of his friends. They also become comfortable in their roles in high school (as \\"Play People\\") and by the end of the novel are pretty well-adjusted 18-year olds. This is a charming novel for many reasons. Ed is a lovable narrator and his sarcastic, cynical and hilarious look at the New Jersey suburbs in the early 80s is priceless and hilarious. This novel will make you laugh out loud and will always keep you smiling. Enjoy."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"Being of reasonably sound mind and currently in my fourth year of college I rarely find the time to sit down and indulge in the finer things in life. You should know I mean a book that isn't on a professor's reading list. This book in particular was handed to me by a friend and I read the entire novel in one sitting on a Saturday. I did lunch sat down and couldn't put it down until it was time for a smashingly late dinner.This book almost made me miss high school which is saying something considering I've long since put those four years away on the glory days shelf and lived in the here and very now. The way Acito mixes his elements of humor, drama, classic high school angst and hijinks... this is one of the best books I've read all year. There were times I was laughing so hard I was crying and my friend would stop to ask which part I was on and giggle along with me, reminiscing about when they had read it too.I've already thrust the title on numerous people, indicating that it was a must read and if you're even so much as considering it, then yes! Buy this book, you will not regret it!-Julie, UGA - History Major"},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"This is one of the funniest books I've ever read. I can't even count how many times I laughed out loud. This novel is not for the prudish or for young children. Everyone else who likes to laugh: Read it immediately.It features a fast-paced plot and wonderfully interesting characters. The main character is a bisexual high school senior who loves to act and hates to work. His friends are a drama geek/football player, a guy who loves to break the law, and a beautiful, sweet girl who loves sex. And then there is the evil stepmonster, the handicapped gay drama teacher, Frank Sinatra's minions, and a bunch of other fun folks who make this book a lively, laugh-out-loud success."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"It is unfortunate that this book was allowed to be sold to the public without warnings.The first should concern shockable homophobics with heart disorders. They could be suckered into reading this by the way it starts out as an interesting coming of age romance - \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" (to which deliberate reference in made) set in suburban New Jersey in the 1980's with a few innocuous ethnic jibes (\\"I felt at home there. Jews are like Italians only smarter\\") and social satiric jabs (\\"You can tell that sophisticated people live here because all their photographs are black and white.\\"). Then they may need advanced cardiac life support soon after page 99 (where the sex is more or less hetero). A wise precaution might be to test them out with small doses of Augusten Burroughs and Sedaris.A second warning is for insomniacs like me who read themselves to sleep rather than take Ambien. I finished it at three this morning. Luckily it's Sunday.The third caveat is about reading it in any place where you might look odd laughing aloud. There's a high laugh aloud risk factor. Maybe the PATH from Christopher Street to Hoboken would be safe because everybody else will be reading it."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"What a joyful and hilarious romp this book is! Reading it is like watching a zany, screwball comedy- there were some bits that had me laughing so hard I had to take a moment and just revel in the wackiness. I mean, try to keep a straight face when the hero's evil Teutonic stepmonster confronts him on his girlfriend's front porch with charges of stealing. Or while the Creative Vandalism team is wreaking havoc on the neighborhood.The most gratifying quality of \`How I Paid for College' isn't, however, the book's comedy but its great sense of the general goodness of mankind. Marc Acito loves and respects his characters very much, even when they are in trouble, and the reader finishes the book with the sense of high good humor usually reserved for the best kind of \`feel good' movie. In fact, in order to accurately describe the book to friends, and you will find yourself talking about it with your friends, it's easiest to rely on theatrical or cinematic vocabulary. Part of the reason is the racing, hilarious quality of the story, but mostly it's because the story has a \`here and now' quality to them. For example, the scene (see?) of the school's opening night of Godspell perfectly conveys the quiet, awesome roar you feel yourself part of when something really extraordinary is happening on stage or on the screen. Being able to make the reader a part of that is a gift. How I Paid For College is a superb coming-of-age story and it would make a great movie, but it's perfectly fine to read it for the belly laughs, too. In fact, I hope you do buy this madcap book. You're going to love it, and you're going to be glad you did."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"Hmmmm... Despite the fact that this story follows a fellow through his senior year of high school, I'm not at all sure if this book is even meant for teens: at any rate, I would only recommend this one for older teens and adults, due to a fair amount of strong language and plenty of sexual situations. Oh, the sexuality is often written for comic effect and isn't terribly graphic or anything, but there is a fair amount of it! And quite frankly, a few of these scenes had me thinking \\"Ewwwwwww----gross!\\" Heh---without subjecting you to any details, I am quite certain I would never attempt one or two of these things myself---ugh.The main character considers himself bisexual, but man---to me he reads as totally, totally gay; I didn't really buy into the whole subplot of him having a girlfriend for a portion of the story.On the positive side, some of the family drama did draw me into the story on a visceral, emotional level. And the book was funny--- I suppose I enjoyed it enough that I'll go ahead and read the sequel which is titledAttack of the Theater People. Still, I would have to say that the novel was simply a bit too seedy for my taste; I wasn't really crazy about any of the characters, none of whom seemed particularly admirable. Plus, I'm not sure how true to life they were for people of a high school age; seemed more like college kids. For a taste of high school life in similarly-themed novel, I much preferred the very funny and warm-heartedA Really Nice Prom Mess."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"I loved this book.

For whatever reason, I've often felt Amazon ratings to be overinflated - but this is a pan of Marc Acito's book, not Amazon reviews.Apart from the graphic sex scenes, this book could be aimed at a youth audience. It's level seems about equal to that of \\"An Abundance of Katherines,\\" which I began reading on accident because it wasn't clearly marked as youth lit. The characters are high schoolers, and it seems to me that high school readers would feel more in tune with this book's predominant moods of sarcasm, horniness, and low-stakes shenanigans.Style wise, it's exhaustingly sardonic, punctuated by groaners, and not even original ones. Acito refers to the film Yentl, for example, as \\"Tootsie on the Roof,\\" which is not an original line. Acito seems to take his mid-80s setting as an excuse to fall back quite often onto tired turns of phrase.I would have dropped the book after chapter 3, but decided to read reviews to see if I was missing something or if there was some aspect that would redeeem the triteness of this book. Even major reviewers credited the book as worthwhile, though not quite saying why as if homosexual themes alone make it pan proof. Living as I do in culture where homosexuality is so commonplace and accepted that it does not constitute its own value, I have to disagree.Sophomoric - that sums up me feeling toward this book. Where the plot isn't overly convenient, it's clumsy. In addition, I struggle to find anything likable about the characters. The sex scenes are titillating, and maybe that's a clue to who the audience is."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"How I Paid for College is an absolutely riveting, hilarious and brilliant read. I felt that I couldn't turn the pages fast enough, but then immediately would force myself to slow down -- not wanting to end my immersion in the world of Mark Acito's characters.No matter what your age, you will instantly relate to the story of an adolescent's struggle for his own identity in a world that sometimes outwardly and unashamedly conspires to keep him from reaching his dreams. Mark Acito writes with a passion, and I read How I Paid for College in the same spirit.If you have been in search of a dynamic novel that will stay with you for years to come, and would like to read something so hilarious and touching that you will find yourself constantly quoting to friends as you read -- you absolutely must read Mark Acito's book.Brilliant!"},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"Marc Acito's book How I paid for College starts off fine. However after reading half of it I simply get fed up. Marc's problem is that many characters \\"share the same voice\\"; many of the lines could have been said by almost anyone of the characters. My guess is that this is the author's own voice and that he lacks the skill to create individual plausable characters. This makes the book more boring than fun. The cover makes a reference to David Sedaris. I don't see the connection at all."},{"Title":"How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship & Musical Theater","review":"This book is absolutely terrible.

This book reviews the history of the Twin Otter, and it's younger sibling, the Otter, with an exciting presentation and polished style that makes it hard to put down. Sean Rossiter did his homework when he compiled the information for &quot;Otter &amp; Twin Otter (The Universal Airplanes)&quot;. Any aircraft enthusiast who reads this book will immediately encounter the heartfelt adoration and respect of these awesome STOL (short take-off/landing) classics that Rossiter delivers to the reader. Go the the Pacific Northwest, and you'll still see these planes everywhere, heading out to the fishing camps and private lodges that dot the islands of Washington State and British Columbia. Rossiter captures the unique history of these workhorses with a keen and accurate style. Fellow bush plane enthusiasts, enjoy!"},{"Title":"Otter & Twin Otter: The Universal Airplanes","review":"I wanted to read up on the history of the DHC-4 Twin Otter as I have flown on one here in the Sinai and am doing some historical research in their use with the Multinational Force and Observers.However, this book is not simply about Otters and Twin Otters but seemingly about every airplane in the DHC line. Only one short chapter really discussed the Twin Otter in the role I am interested in (although there is an interesting angle on the Otter I was not aware of and will now conduct additional research).The book goes into excruciating details about test pilots and engineers involved in the development of the Otter, the Beaver, the Caribou, etc. and not so much about the aircraft and which airlines and companies operate them.On the plus side, the book has a wealth of photos and the author clearly knows is subject. On the downside, however, the author would clearly rather be flying an Otter than writing about one."},{"Title":"Otter & Twin Otter: The Universal Airplanes","review":"I am an aviation artist and aircraft enthusiast and I found this book to be not only helpful in a project that I had recently worked but also found it very informative and exciting reading."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"Director Sally Potter's fondly embraceable, slightly over-elaborate big screen version of Virginia Woolf's famously psychedelic tale is a moving study in the power of understatement, and a testimony to how even the most justified taking of print-to-screen liberties may sometimes come back to nip its creator. In giving the androgynous-looking Tilda Swinton (probably best known to US audiences as the White Witch in the recent Narnia adaptation) the starring role as a striking young Elizabethan lad who literally carries out his venerable Queen's command that he not age or wither, and thusly lives through the next four centuries first as a man, later after a metamorphosis as a woman, the makers of this motion picture chose well. As Orlando travels through the decades and centuries, he experiences many things. He falls in love with a fickle Russian noblewoman who is visiting the court of King James I during a winter of deadly cold; he tries his hand at poetry-writing under the guidance of a seventeenth-century con-man; the one-time male makes his entrance in the decadent eighteenth-century as a female, and reaps the consequences of this bodily change. She, Orlando, goes on to spill unexpectedly in love again in Victorian times, endures pregnant during the chaos of World War One, and finally faces a tragically unfair legal confrontation in modern times that undermines even the era-spanning authority of England's greatest queen. The film Orlando is as I said fantasy for thinkers. It sketches its story on the canvas of British history, distant and modern, and if to be dubbed unique is the high praise, then it warrants the highest praise that can be given."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"This film has a few things going for it. 1)Tilda Swinton-She manages to be believable as a man as well as a women and I love her direct glances into the camera. 2)The story-It may not have enough plot for some but I love the story- a person goes through 400 years of English history and changes sexes. 3)The Music- I love the last song by Jimmie Sommerville and the piano pieces are wonderful. This is not a film for everyone. Only watch it if you have a sese of humor that looks for subtlety or you have a sense of adventure."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"I have seen this film at least 5 times and although I agree it does not rival the book, I find Orlando takes my breath away every time I see it.Sally Potter has created a masterpiece of perfectly blended interpretation, music and cinematography. She has also managed to make a wonderful story all the more accessible.Orlando is what dramatic film making is all about - to be able to feel the period as well as simply view it."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"Woolf's Orlando is the story of a young nobleman of the Elizabethan Age, who by a mysterious quirk of Fate is allowed to experience the pains and privileges of both genders. The fascinating story is at times poetic, at times verbose, but always fascinating. The reader witnesses Orlando's transformation from a sixteenth-century man to a twentieth-century woman; by employing the stream-of-consciousness technique, the androgynous protagonist's secret dilemmas and longings are clearly enunciated. By the conclusion of the novel, Woolf's stance on the matter of gender is obvious: whether the trappings of Orlando be taffeta or leather, the personality is the same.Woolf wrote during a period which did much to shun the traditional sex-barriers; rather than joining the hoardes of suffragettes or their opposing army of conservatives, she crafted a philosophy which effortlessly combined the two. Women are not superior to men, nor are they weaker; both sexes are inherently equal; more than that, one cannot differentiate between the two. We are the same. We are all members of humanity, and that bond is enough to surpass the role played by gender. Woolf is begging us not to label our neighbor as a &quot;man&quot; (complete with all that word connotes), for to do so would be to divide mankind with an imaginary line. Look to yourself and your friends merely as a person, for the soul can never change."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"A very moving and tastefully filmed production. Glorious,rich color film. For some reason I only watch this movie when I am alone. To glean some understanding about what this film unfolds, the novel \\"Orlando\\", by Viginia Woolf, will not sufice. Read \\"Vita\\" by Victoria Glendinning (1983)to understand the film better. Of course, Vita Sakcville-West was enormously pleased with the novel \\"Orlando\\", but really didn\\"t understand it!! As a writer she was very popular, as compared to Viginia and her Bloomsbury set (at that time). \\"Orlando\\" is Virginia Woolf's ode to Vita (the child of aristocrats, who could not inherit her family's estate, since she was female, but who so adored the family homestead). Vita and Virginia were intimate friends, but Virgina's acute whimsy, or malice does poke fun at Orlando (the aristocracy).

I have watched this movie more than any other movie and it never gets old. I saw it 15+ times in the theater and watched it many more times on DVD. Saying that, it is still hard to describe this movie. Visually STUNNING, from start to finish each scene is a visual masterpiece, a work of art. The soundtrack and music compliments the visuals perfectly, and the song of the closing scene is moving and inspirational. There are amazing observations on the human condition, romance, love, death and POETRY, and it still leaves a sense of mystery. This movie has made me a lifelong die-hard fan of Tilda Swinton. Did I mention I Love this movie?"},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"In her most playful and exuberant novel, Virginia Woolf writes the \\"historical biography\\" of Orlando, a young boy of nobility during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. A wild ride through four centuries, the novel shows Orlando aging, magically, only thirty-six years between 1588 and 1928. Even more magically, he also changes from a man to a woman. As she explores Orlando's life, Woolf also explores the differing roles of men and women in society during various periods, ultimately concluding that one's role as a man or woman is determined by society, rather than by birth.From the Elizabethan period, during which Orlando works as a steward for the queen and also serves as her lover, he progresses to the reign of James I, experiencing a profound love for a Russian princess, Sasha, who is herself exploring the role of a man. An interlude in which he is wooed by the Archduchess Harriet/Archduke Harry leads to his ambassadorship to Constantinople, a period spent with the gypsies, and his eventual return to England--as a woman. New experiences and observations await her there.Throughout the novel, Woolf matches her prose style to the literary style of the period in which Orlando lives, creating always-changing moods and sheer delight for the reader. Some constants continue throughout the four centuries of Orlando's life. Orlando is always a writer, always recording his thoughts, and always adding to a poem he has begun as a child entitled \\"The Oak Tree.\\" He is always returning to his 365-room house whenever he needs to recuperate from his experiences, and some characters repeat through time.Literary historians make much of the fact that Woolf modeled Orlando on Vita Sackville-West, Woolf's lover, and that this study of gender roles was an early exploration of lesbianism, bisexuality, cross-dressing, and transgender identities. The novel is pure fun to read, however, and though it raises serious and thoughtful questions about sexuality and the ways that it controls our lives, there is no sense that Woolf wrote the novel specifically to make a public statement or prove a point. Her themes of gender and its relation to social expectations, of imagination and its relation to reality, of the importance of history in our lives, and of the unlimited potential of all humans, regardless of their sex, transcend the specific circumstances under which Woolf may have written the book. A playful and delightful novel, which broke new ground with its publication.

I haven't read the book, but I understand that some major changes in plot, theme and tone have been made by the director of Orlando. So if you want the movie to be just like the book, just give up. It ain't gonna happen.But if you are willing to take the movie on its own terms - directed by Sally Potter, not by Virginia Woolf - then you might enjoy this film.Let me note some of the major attractions of Orlando:1. It is a beautiful film to look at. Orlando is about a person who lives over four hundred years - from the reign of Elizabeth I to 1990. Each period gets full and proper attention. the 19th century is dark and foggy, the 20th sharp and bright and 17th rich and royal reds. The visuals enhance the theme rather than drown the characters.2. Tild Swinton. A lot of people criticized her acting as being dull or understated. I tended to think she hit things on the mark. In order to get the feeling that the movie is about Orlando - and not about scenery - she wisely chooses to be detached. I got the feeling that Orlando was observing things, which heightens the feeling of not quite fitting in, even as Orlando tries to grapple with the world he/she inhabits. This is important to capture if the character lives through different time periods.3. Lot of neat details and in-jokes. Potter does not try to say too much about the nature of gender or other heavy duty topics. She let's the viewer think for himself. This means that there is lots of room for clever in jokes. Example: the same actor plays an impoverished poet in 1700 and a greedy publisher in 1990.Taken together, you get a great movie. One person compared it to 2001: A Space Oddysey. I think it is a good comparison. Lush visuals, loose plot that still sticks to some simple good ideas, leisurely understated acting, etc. Overall, just great. It all comes together in what I think is a unique movie."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"The mind wants what the mind wants and when you're watching a movie it is usually to know what is going on. Orlando defies all logic spanning a couple centuries without really explaining why or how but it is beautiful to watch; the costumes, the scenery and of course Tilda Swinton. At points it does seem a bit long with no end in site but if you can lift yourself above storyline, lack of plot and the usual things that carry a movie you may find enjoyment in getting to know the struggle of one man who becomes a woman and the times they live in as they learn about love, deception, jealousy, devotion, admiration, honor and the rights of the sexes. This movie is not completely true to the book as the director added on a world war in an attempt to update the movie had Woolf written the story later. I have seen this movie a few times and still enjoy it. It is worth watching at least twice to wrap your mind around it. Orlando made me fall in love with Tilda. If you're a fan of Billy Zane you get to see him ride in on a horse, sweep Orlando off her feet and depart as quickly as he came.

Tilda Swinton has the right combination of androgyny and intelligence to perfectly embody Orlando, and director Sally Potter gilds and perfumes every set and costume.Orlando (Swinton) was born a young aristocratic man in the time of Queen Elizabeth I, and when the dying monarch visited his home she became his new court favorite. She also bid him, \\"Do not fade, do not wither, do not grow old.\\"And Orlando did as she said. With the death of the queen and his father, Orlando's passionate, curious personality attracted many women -- and during the Great Freeze he fell in love with Sasha, a mercurial Russian princess (Charlotte Valandrey) who enthralled him, but left him as he ice began to thaw. Bereft of true love, he devoted himself to poetry and entertainment.But then he's assigned to be an ambassador to Constantinople, and something strange happens -- while a bloody revolution rages, he sleeps for a full week... and wakes newly metamorphosed into a woman. With the same mind and soul but a female body, Orlando sets out on a new life of poetry (befriending Pope!), sex and legality, stretching all the way to the twentieth century -- when she finally finds peace.\\"Orlando\\" is a treat for the senses, filled with showers of gold dust, luxuriant flowers, pale sunlight, golden sands, cities veiled in ice, dark rivers, snowy forests and mist-filled hedge mazes. It feels like Sally Potter took Woolf's beautiful book and sprinkled it with roses, gold and crystals -- and it just adds a suitably magical atmosphere to a already unreal story.The center of all this is Swinton, who plays Orlando in both incarnations, and she's utterly brilliant. Her androgynous features and slim body mean she can pass for both a man and a woman, and she manages to carry both genders off beautifully -- she captures gangly boyish grace, sleek femininity, and a sort of chummy male attitude with equal skill.And she captures Orlando's elusive personality. Her Orlando is all puckish charm, sweetness and unleashed passion -- even to the audience. While watching a street performance of \\"Othello,\\" he glances at the camera and whispers, \\"Terrific play!\\", as if we're trailing after him over the centuries.And as I mentioned, Potter does a brilliant job with a very difficult book, sticking faithfully to most of Woolf's novel and adding a shimmering, silken atmosphere to it. There are lots of beautiful scenes that could have stepped out of a Pre-Raphaelite painting, and she deftly handles the passing centuries by having Orlando sprint through walls of mist. The ending is slightly different from Woolf's novel, but it has the same pleasantly timeless, thoughtful quality -- the only downside is that weird freaky angel thing.

This film left a lasting impression. I fell in love with the character with the aid of a fantastic storyline, amazingly beautiful countryside and wonderful musical score. I highly recommend this film"},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"Talk about a film I wanted to love but couldn't even like, \`Orlando' fails at doing practically anything. This had all the potential in the world. Tilda Swinton has become that godlike creature I adore and consider incapable of fault thanks to her string of tremendous performances over the past few years and so seeking out her earlier work, this was one I was most excited for. The androgynous creature known as Tilda Swinton is always alluring in her ability to effortlessly evoke both sexes even when not attempting to, and so the idea of her portraying an ageless person who lives lives as both a man and a woman was intriguing and stimulating to me. The concept of the film itself, adapted or inspired or \`I'm not really sure' from a classic Virginia Woolf story, should have been golden.Sadly, this feels utterly devoid of purpose or point.Swinton's performance is devoid of all emotion and so the film winds up dragging out based on sheer boredom alone. It doesn't say anything of note, and it had all the prospect of doing just that. Sally Potter's take on this tale is so skeletal and meaningless that I literally got a headache trying to make heads and tales of it. There are no explanations made for the gender swap midway through and even Orlando's ageless state is never really given a specific meaning or even a conclusive reason. I was also rather displeased with the way in which Swinton played her character because she never once evoked the feeling of being a man. I never questioned her sexuality or gender because she was also undoubtedly a woman, which made the first half rather awkward and unbelievable. The character her/himself was also aloof and without any compelling characteristics.By the end of the film I was dumbfounded that anyone could find this fascinating in the least, since it was stripped of all fascinations thanks to the thankless direction the film took.It is a pretty picture, with great costumes and sets (stunning) and the cinematography is enriching, but overall this is just stupid."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. A wonderful philosophical journey through a life filled with discovery."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"I read the book first as part of a literature class. I thoroughly enjoyed the book. The movie (maybe as always) leaves you wanting more. Cinematography, music were very good. Why can't the director include someone reading the excellent Woolfian interior narrative during the scenes where the protagonist is just staring at the camera? Is it money? Is this a new idea? Has the director read the book? So, it is OK, but the stares at the camera seemed like dead space."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"ORLANDO is not the best movie I have seen, but it does have a small spice to it. Spectacular backgrounds, and sets lighten this semi-period piece up. This movie has some dull moments, and also goofy moments with Tilda Swinton looking at the camera, talking to the audience. The transformation from a man to a woman is un-discussed, making it alittle hard for the viewer to know why he or she did it. This movie was different, I will tell you that. Billy Zane's character (even though getting second most attention in advertising, and in the credits) is only on the screen for about ten minutes, has probably about 8 lines. I do not recomend this movie to be purchased, though if your a fan of such film noir -- DIG IN."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"If there's one thing that's clear from watching \\"Orlando\\", it's that director Sally Potter has a keen sense of beauty. This is evident not only in the cinematography, but also in the soundtrack, which is often unusual, but always effective. At times, the sheer aesthetic artistry of the film seemed to take precedence over the actual plot. Many of the scenes move at an unnaturally slow pace, drawing the viewer's attention to the visual and emotional nuances of each individual shot rather than to the broader sequence of events.Potter's directing style is especially effective at depicting the ridiculous excesses and hypocrisy of the British aristocracy. It is fascinating to see Orlando as both a beneficiary and a victim of the social institutions of his time (or rather, times).I was initially somewhat surprised to learn that a single actress was chosen to portray Orlando both as a male and as a female. Although there is no doubt some symbolic significance to this choice, Tilda Swanson's unmistakably feminine appearance and voice leave her absolutely unconvincing as a man. This only serves to downplay the intensity of the moment when his/her transformation actually takes place.That having been said, Swanson's performance is remarkable in almost every other aspect. Her response to each turn of events in the film is always marked by a vague sense of detachment, which seemed entirely appropriate for a character who transcends so many natural boundaries throughout the course of the story. Rather than being bored by this reserved performance, I found myself drawn in by the mysterious nature of her character.For all of the film's positive aspects, Potter's storytelling was a little disappointing. After touching on an array of mostly unresolved problems, the film just ends with virtually no closure, save for a not-so-subtle statement that some important life-affirming transformation had taken place in the main character. This rather forced resolution seemed to refer to a conflict that I was not even aware of in the first place. Also, while I don't want to be guilty of any spoilers, I have to comment that the last thirty seconds or so of the film contained what has be one of the most ludicrous plot devices I have ever seen on film.These flaws weren't enough to make me want to trash the film entirely. In deciding on a rating, I'm inclined to award it bonus points simply for its sheer uniqueness. Certain individual parts of the movie were fascinating, but the it didn't hold together well taken as a whole. More than anything, it served to make me more curious about the book."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"Whether it was a mystical experience to watch because it pulled me out of the boredom of a dreary Sunday morning when it appeared on IFC, or whether it really is one of the most fascinating and hauntingly photographed films ever made...well, the jury is still out, and in fact it's probably both reasons. But I quickly obtained my own copy and have waited to watch it again because I so badly want to share this movie with someone. But it's a rare breed that will appreciate the story of a man who over time turns into a woman---a human being who tells a story of pain and obsession, heartache, war, and finally fulfillment in the truest love possible, across five centuries of different lives/same soul.

I saw &quot;Orlando&quot; in the cinema when it first came out and it was one of the few films around that made me feel glad to be alive.Negative criticism of Tilda Swinton's cool performance is beside the point. Her calm and control is perfect; Orlando has to go from being a naive boy to a mature woman, and by the end of the film, even though Swinton has hardly broken a sweat, her long stare into the camera makes her seem truly iconic. It's one of the best film performances of the 90s. But Swinton has been too striking and unnerving an actor to ever be a big star, even if she wants to be, which seems unlikely.Woolf's &quot;Orlando&quot; strikes me as overwritten and silly. Potter's &quot;Orlando&quot; is glorious, with some hilariously exaggerated costume design (from Sandy Powell, who cut her teeth with the even more left-field Derek Jarman), gorgeous music and striking performances from, amongst others, Billy Zane as Orlando's dashing lover and Heathcote Williams as a snide, money-hungry poet. It's an essay in contemporary sexuality, which almost makes me appreciate the music of Jimmy Somerville.I can't think of many more haunting moments than the last five minutes; essays could be written on Orlando's Gaze. Swinton spends much of the film looking at people, searching for clues, trying to take it all in; by the end she seems to found it, and made it her own, and this is why her impassive stare and slight smile are so moving.

Joy because I adore Orlando and think it worth a Blu-ray release. Annoyance because I quite wish Sony Pictures Classics had released it simultaneously with the DVD and so spared me the expense. My guess is that perhaps the Blu-ray release hinged on the sales of the DVD, and that the sales must have been decent enough to warrant the Blu-ray. In spite of my annoyance, however, I bought the Blu-ray.My greatest concern was for the quality of the video transfer: Orlando was made 18 years ago, and on a low budget even then. So bringing it over to high definition might seem like a lost cause. But, thankfully, it isn't. In terms of file size the Blu-ray is extremely generous. Whereas the DVD played consistently between 2-7 Mbps, the Blu-ray maintains a remarkable range of 25-30 Mbps. Does this show in the transfer? Mostly. The greatest advantage of the file size is color reproduction: richer, deeper and, coupled with the resolution of the HD-remastering, greater distinction and detail. The transfer stills manages to betray its age with residual film grain and artifacts, but this is not unusual for an older live-action film on high-def transfer. So, yes, this is as good as it gets. And it is quite good.As for the audio, the Blu-ray upgrades from the DVD's Dolby Digital 2.0 to a DTS-HD 2.0. [shrugs]Lastly, the Blu-ray includes a special feature not previously on the DVD: an audio commentary with director Sally Potter and actress Tilda Swinton. For this I am very grateful. Orlando was apparently a massive chore to get produced, and it's a sort of miracle that the director and principal actor are still around and willing to talk about it 18 years later.Well! Orlando being the gem that it is, I am so *so* delighted that Sony Pictures Classics invested a DVD re-release and Blu-ray release in what still remains an obscure yet remarkable film.

The special features are an enlightened treat onto itself."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"ORLANDO is not one of Virginia Woolf's better known novels, and with good reason. In its gender-bending themes, one is never quite sure what to make of it. Director Sally Potter took this amorphous quality and transferred it to the screen by re-writing both script and plot until the film and the book have long since parted company. What remains is a cinematic masterpiece that either dares the viewer to comprehend it or defies him. In the real world, one might think that anyone who was publically immortal might have world reknown or anyone who changed genders in an age bereft of transgender surgery might be equally famed. And certainly one who did both would be a superstar in any age. But in Potter's view of England that spans four centuries from 1600 to 2000 the general public seems to take such astonishing news in stride, and that may be the point. We are not supposed to take ORLANDO under any prism of realism nor are we meant to endure a willing suspension of belief. Rather, Potter intends us to view the panorama of English history in much the same dream like manner that we excercise as we accompany Alice down the rabbit hole.Tilda Swinton as the androgynous Orlando appears as a feminine-looking male in the court of Queen Elizabeth, herself played by the cross dressing Quentin Crisp. It calls for some blunting of the imagination for the viewer to accept Orlando as a male since he truly looks like a female in male drag. One day, the Queen commands Orlando, as her boy toy favorite, never to age. And magically his biological clock ceases ticking. No explanation other than her royal prerogative is given and none is needed. Orlando has normal sexual desires for a man. He falls heavily for the lovely daughter of a Russian ambassador who jilts him, thereby repeating Orlando's similar rejection of an English woman chosen to be his betrothed. The decades and centuries pass and no one seems to notice the miracle in their midst. There are many splendid scenes of architecture that captivate the eye, but these are distractions from the real business at hand--to present a multi-gender view of English history. After two centuries, Orlando transforms into a woman, again magically, again illogically. From this vantage she can expatiate on a view of a male-dominant society symbolized by Pope, Addison, and Swift, all of whom come across as male chauvinistic piggies of the worst sort. More decades pass, but the only changes seem to be in technology and architecture. Other characters enter and exit with little impact on Orlando. Billy Zane is the exception as he comes THIS close to convincing her to accompany him on his travels to America.While all this time spanning action occurs, Swinton as Orlando has the difficult task of remaining gender neutral in her capacity as the film's center. Her Orlando shows very little emotion. Instead she reveals her inner thoughts in direct asides to the camera, thus intensifying in the viewer that what is being seen is a fiction. We never know what drives Orlando to wish to live so long. She wants a child and she has one but that adds no dimension to her part. ORLANDO ultimately emerges as a film that entertains even as it makes no pretense as to how or why."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"If you see this for the first time on video, you'll probably wish you'd seen it when it was still in theatres (or at least you'll want to see it in widescreen). The cinematograpy is both unusual in its makeup and breathtaking besides, and well-suited to a larger screen.The movie chronicles several _centuries_ of her life; Orlando's character changes not only from male to female, but from immature to mature in a number of ways. It's a journey which is strange, sensual, and extraordinary all at the same time, and leaves you wondering what happens next... &quot;next&quot; being after the movie ends as &quot;her life is just beginning.&quot;The soundtrack is also very well thought out... and if you're invested enough, the ending song brings tears to your eyes. Great movie for all lovers of art films...but although not a &quot;chick flick&quot; per se, Orlando probably will appeal more to the female sex simply for its themes. The sentiments expressed by Orlando as he/she changes and matures, however, will doubtless be universally appreciated!"},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"This is one really odd movie, I've never seen anything quite like it. I found the story interesting but strange at the same time. I'm not sure how historically accurate it is but the movie seems very well researched and loaded with tiny details that could so easily have been over looked or even left out, much better done than so many modern day setting movies. The plot mostly made sense to me although the passage of time seems dreamlike in later stages. I really liked the locations and costumes, weird as they were I think the clothing was probably exactly right for the times, remarkable achievement for what I think was actually a low budget movie."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"While Virginia Woolf's 'Orlando' was found, by some readers, to be both long-winded and unbelievable, the movie version is, as a whole, a satire of the novel. The director has taken liberties galore with the original tale (Jimmy Sommerville as a disco queen obviously never figured in the original draft) but despite that, 'Orlando' turns out to be one of the better book-to-film adaptations I have seen, and as much as I hate to say it, I found it to be even better than the book. The novel lacked a certain life, and though Woolf did her best to enliven things up (the latter half of the work was dreary and pointless), Sally Potter, the director, strings things in such a fashion, that the end of the film is a) nothing like the book and b) lifts the movie to higher heights. We owe the way this film works to Tilda Swinton of course, the English actress who made a stunning impression with this film and then left us high and dry by shunning mainstream production altogether.Other reviews will tell you what 'Orlando' is all about. What I wanted to dwell on are the qualities of the film that make it outstanding. There are noticeable flaws, of course, because the movie doesnt flow together as a consolidated piece. It is broken and jarring in places - a collection of amusing vignettes strung together - but at the end of two hours, 'Orlando' comes together unlike many a film of its genre. For a film of this sort to make an impact on the audience, it must first goad the audience into leaving their sense of probability behind. Orlando's most defining moment comes when he lies himself down and arises a woman - breasts and all. I know not of any person in modern history who has altered their sex simply by will, and hence could not accept this shift in gender totally, yet this is one of the most gripping sequences in the film. Its also relieving because Tilda Swinton can finally play herself and get rid of that phony masculine accent.Orlando still lives, according to the movie, so that would make him/her about 420 years old at the moment. The focus of the film is not so much the years that Orlando lives through, but rather the lessons she learns along the way. Why, for instance, did the Lord Orlando decide to 'become' a woman? Was this of his own choosing? Orlando's bitter experiences with war and death make him question his own masculinity, or one would suppose, as it is just after this that he changes his sex. But both as a man and as a woman, Orlando faces rejection. As a man, he is spurned by a Russian ambassodress, and as a woman, she involves herself in a torrid affair (with some of the most thoughtful dialogue) with Billy Zane, and he leaves her for America almost immediately. Pregnant, and doomed to be a 'spinster', Orlando survives World War I and II and is left with child when the film ends. This is all grossly improbable, but it works.Tilda Swinton's direct camera glances are at first amusing, but I suppose they do add a sort of artistic touch to the proceedings. The final moments of the film benefit hugely from Tilda's beatific gaze, assuring the film of instant classic status, and making 'Orlando' one of the most thoughtful transgender films ever made. This is art."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"Originally distributed in 1992, Sally Potter's film Orlando was re-released last summer. Ms. Potter adapted the screenplay from Virginia Woolf's 1928 novel Orlando: A Biography about an individual who changes genders halfway through her over four-hundred year long life. The movie is divided into seven sections: Death, Love, Poetry, Politics, Society, Sex, and Birth.Excruciatingly slow and cryptic, Orlando is nonetheless a gorgeous work of art. Its enthralling music, mostly composed by Ms. Potter and David Motion, contributes to the film's dreamlike ambiance. Orlando's color palette is also extraordinary. Cinematographer Aleksei Rodionov shoots the Rococo period's pastel blues and pinks in muted light. Candles illuminate the Renaissance's bold outfits and elaborate rituals.Tilda Swinton looks the part of the androgynous Orlando, but the movie's acting and writing are stilted and bizarre. Amongst the film's many unsubtle messages, its most powerful theme is that of identity. Though difficult to get through, Orlando has an entrancing originality."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"No lover in the world ever wrote a valentine more exquisite than Virginia Woolf's tribute to her lover Vita Sackville-West, \\"Orlando.\\"And few movie adaptations are as coyly, exquisitely lovely as the 1992 movie adapted from that book, a magical-realism tale about a perpetually youthful, charming hero/ine who traverses three centuries and both genders. Tilda Swinton has the right combination of androgyny and intelligence to perfectly embody Orlando, and director Sally Potter gilds and perfumes every set and costume.Orlando (Swinton) was born a young aristocratic man in the time of Queen Elizabeth I, and when the dying monarch visited his home she became his new court favorite. She also bid him, \\"Do not fade, do not wither, do not grow old.\\"And Orlando did as she said. With the death of the queen and his father, Orlando's passionate, curious personality attracted many women -- and during the Great Freeze he fell in love with Sasha, a mercurial Russian princess (Charlotte Valandrey) who enthralled him, but left him as he ice began to thaw. Bereft of true love, he devoted himself to poetry and entertainment.But then he's assigned to be an ambassador to Constantinople, and something strange happens -- while a bloody revolution rages, he sleeps for a full week... and wakes newly metamorphosed into a woman. With the same mind and soul but a female body, Orlando sets out on a new life of poetry (befriending Pope!), sex and legality, stretching all the way to the twentieth century -- when she finally finds peace.\\"Orlando\\" is a treat for the senses, filled with showers of gold dust, luxuriant flowers, pale sunlight, golden sands, cities veiled in ice, dark rivers, snowy forests and mist-filled hedge mazes. It feels like Sally Potter took Woolf's beautiful book and sprinkled it with roses, gold and crystals -- and it just adds a suitably magical atmosphere to a already unreal story.The center of all this is Swinton, who plays Orlando in both incarnations, and she's utterly brilliant. Her androgynous features and slim body mean she can pass for both a man and a woman, and she manages to carry both genders off beautifully -- she captures gangly boyish grace, sleek femininity, and a sort of chummy male attitude with equal skill.And she captures Orlando's elusive personality. Her Orlando is all puckish charm, sweetness and unleashed passion -- even to the audience. While watching a street performance of \\"Othello,\\" he glances at the camera and whispers, \\"Terrific play!\\", as if we're trailing after him over the centuries.And as I mentioned, Potter does a brilliant job with a very difficult book, sticking faithfully to most of Woolf's novel and adding a shimmering, silken atmosphere to it. There are lots of beautiful scenes that could have stepped out of a Pre-Raphaelite painting, and she deftly handles the passing centuries by having Orlando sprint through walls of mist. The ending is slightly different from Woolf's novel, but it has the same pleasantly timeless, thoughtful quality -- the only downside is that weird freaky angel thing. WHAT was that about?Fortunately, the freaky angel thing is the one downside in \\"Orlando,\\" a timelessly sensual movie that perfectly highlights Tilda Swinton. Absolutely stunning."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"I watched the DVD of Orlando recently. I must say I was somewhat disappointed. The acting and the cinematography was breathtaking and excellent. But, with all of the unnarrated gazes directly into the camera, I thought that the film could have been enhanced greatly if some of the very rich interior narrative in the book could have been heard there (in those spots). Even if they needed to get a different voice to read it (Lynn Redgrave comes to mind), there were some paragraphs and sentences that we all noted (in my recent class on this) that could have gone well during these silences!"},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"I want back the two hours I spent watching this garabage... She did not even resemble a man nor did her acting. Billy Zane was also pretty wretched. Overall the movie was too light, never giving any of he characters depth. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"This film was kind of disappointing, especially since my expectations were high: an adaptation of a Woolf novel, a costume movie, gender issues...Not everything about this film was bad. Tilda Swinton was quite good, the images were often beautiful, and the narrative was (on the surface) not too difficult to follow.But my problem is that the film leaves so much unsaid you very quickly have no idea any more what it is about, and worse: it loses its dramatic tension. This probably has everything to do with it being an adaptation of a novel. I have not read Orlando but I know Virginia Woolf's style of writing with the long introspective passages. Maybe if you have read the novel the film makes much more sense, but now I felt like the 'knowing' glances Swinton every so often throws at the camera served to replace pages of inner monologue.I can give much more examples of scenes so minimalistic that it becomes ridiculous (the moment Orlando finds out he has become a woman; the moment when Orlando is pregnant and walking on the battle fields of WW1), but I think my main point is clear: please directors, when you really want to adapt a difficult and literary novel to the screen, remember the people in the audience that don't know the book. There are already too many films that are barely more than a meagre summary of an incredibly good novel."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"I was unable to watch the movie because the dvd didn't have the right region.

What surprised me when I first saw it is how dry, boring and pompous it isn't; the film has a nice lightness and dry humor that make it digestible. The photography is beautiful and the film never drags, and the performances, which a lot of critics have suggested are somewhat two-dimensional, are that way for a reason: Orlando's adventure is too awesome to be rendered realistically; the people and adventures she experiences are meant, I think, to be represented symbolically---each character is actually a rough composite of perhaps hundreds of such types she meets in her journey from 1600 to 2000. Billy Zane, who is seen in the movie's poster, plays an American adventurer who romances the female Orlando, but to all of his &quot;Titanic&quot; fans, a word of caution: he's in the film for roughly twenty-five minutes, if that much. The real star of the show is the ethereally lovely, brilliant, and mysterious Tilda Swinton, whose male Orlando is unnervingly convincing; so much so that &quot;he&quot; almost seems to be doing a drag bit once the sex change happens---and because Swinton is so eye-pleasing and delightful, this is not a bad thing. Her intelligence and talent radiate from her face, which is so expressive that many shots consist simply of gigantic closeups of it---she can say more with a gaze than many lesser performers do with a page of dialogue. I first saw this film in 1993, as an exchange student living in London, and it gave me an appreciation for British history and for Woolf's books that I had never had before. It's really quite a smart, funny, cool, hip movie, but with no explosions, car chases, or hot-button themes, it's by no means a populist-type entertainment. If you like period films, or anything English, you'll dig this a lot: Orlando isn't just English, he/she *is* England, and the country should be so lucky as to be compared with Tilda Swinton's long-suffering (centuries of it, in fact, what a burden) poetry-spouting nobleman/woman. Very cool."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"Finally got this one on DVD after nearly wearing out my VHS copy. Sally Potter is one of the best directors and of course Tilda Swinton in the title role is mesmerizing in every way. Although a sharp departure from Virginia Woolf's source material, it retains the spirit and scope of the novel. Orlando's tranformation from man to woman half way through is a beautiful moment. Swinton proudly naked and observing herself in the mirror looks directly into the camera and says \\"no difference really, just a different sex\\" it brilliantly blurs the line between what it means to be a man and woman. And when I say blur, I mean it in a good way. The gender, sexual orientation and race lines all need to be blurred until they disappear. Orland is a good salvo in that war."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"First let it be said that while I love the film Orlando it is simply impossible to get all the themes and events of the novel into one movie, so I strongly urge all viewers, whether they loved or hated this movie, to read the book, Virginia Woolf's unique love letter to Vita Sackville-West.The inevitable failings involved in translating a book into a film aside, 'Orlando' is visually exsquisite, the costumes and locations sumptuous and splendid, fully evoking the decadance and contrasting squalor of the centuries in which Orlando lives his/her life. The score perfectly compliments the surroundings, the atmosphere and the themes of each scene, and is beautifully composed and performed.Though some have expressed doubts over Tilda Swinton's ability to play Orlando, the aristocrat born as man who turns into a woman half way through his/her life, I thought she was the perfect choice. I believe knowing she is a woman initially taints people's ability to find her convincing as a man; to me she played the part with great charm, amiability and empathy, and became even more charming as a woman - the character of Orlando at this stage in 'her' life becoming more rounded, more sympathetic, more knowledgable and Swinton captures that well.This film does not follow the 'rules' of the 'real' world - besides changing genders, Orlando lives for 400 years and does not age a day. It is the story of a pursuit for life, for meaning, by one individual determined to discover what that means. Accept it, and enjoy.In its attempt to capture the most important of the book's events the film does have a slight recurring bump in continuity, it seems, and will no doubt be pretentious and boring to some, if not many. Nonetheless, Orlando is a sometimes humorous, sometimes haunting movie, thought provoking and richly realised."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"The movie starts with Tilda Swinton playing Orlando, a male role (so far), and Quentin Crisp playing Queen Elizabeth. Already, physical sex and social gender have been neatly divided. Later on, Orlando abruptly transforms from man to woman with no reason or mechanism given. S/he takes it in stride, but her place in her social world changes around her. Given the magical premise, it's an effective way to comment on the attitudes of men and women towards each other, based on complete and mutual ignorance.There was only one small problem with the casting. Swinton is just too lovely a woman to play even an androgynous male convincingly. It took some effort to go along with Tilda the man, but it was worth it for the sake of the plot.And, if nothing else, I could always watch the incredible costuming and scenery. Architecture and landscaping seemed to have quiet lives of their own, tolerating the people that moved among them. Many scenes were chosen for strong, almost confrontational symmetries, something that definitely attracted my attention. Another scene near the end actually costumed the landscape, Christo-like, for reasons I never worked out. There were a number of night scenes, too, and many seemed to be filmed using natural light. Those scenes often had a grainy look, but not enough to be distracting.This is an odd movie, but I like it. Swinton's little asides to the camera, sometimes just a glance, added a quirky note. It's a thoughtful movie, about tone and appearance rather than action, and delivers well in those areas. However much I like it, though, I come away a bit unsure what to make of it. Maybe that's why I keep coming back to it.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"Sally Potter is one of the few directors to achieve the near impossible - to create a movie that actually surpasses the original novel.Not wishing to take anything away from Virginia Woolf, whose The Waves is one of the most brilliant and defining novels of all time, Potter's film version is nothing less than a work of art.As other reviewers have indicated, when the Orlando character, who was based on Woolf's friend and lover, Victoria (Vita) Sackville-West, crosses gender to become a woman, she automatically loses the right to own the very same property that, as a man, she/he had owned for eons. Even as a socio-political commentary, (see also Woolf's A Room Of One's Own) this speaks volumes about a patriarchal society in which the lowliest, most moronic male had infinitely more rights than the most brilliant and gifted female.Our society is still dealing with the legacy of the tyranny of gender and the legacy of the Inquisition, in which nine million women were murdered for being women.Yet despite the dark insanities that underly the film's pivotal transition, Potter's modern classic is a rich and joyful romp, filled with love, hope and transcendence, with a simply breathtakingly beautiful closing section.A rare and inspired work of genius, in which the production direction and casting cannot be faulted."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"I have watched this film three times - yet each time I have watched it I have been intrigued by it - one of the rare films to explore the COMMON rather than the differences between men and women. There is a lushness and &quot;an eternity&quot; to the film - Ms. Potter did an excellent job from the site locations to the music. The landscapes varied from the bitter cold, to desert heat, to World War I, to foggy English countryside to modern day London - these enhanced the feeling that the essence of men and women are the same - not only now but in the past. I have a feeling that people will either love or hate this film. If you are looking for direct action this is not the film for you. However, if you are looking for a more dreamy, meditative film that is memorable than you should definitely check this one."},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"Original, gorgeous, eternal.

Ms. Woolf is not an &quot;easy read&quot;, as her style tends to ramble a bit, and from what I understand, one could not literally translate &quot;Orlando&quot; to the screen. I commend Sally Potter for her adaptation of Woolf's novel. &quot;Orlando&quot;, to me, is about a person's journey of self-discovery. As the lead character says, &quot;The same person-just a different sex.&quot; There is a wonderfully sly mixing-up and playing with gender here. Orlando, an effeminate male poet who later becomes a woman, is beautifully underplayed by Tilda Swinton. I admire her performance, as it is played with a very subtle wit. Queen Elizabeth I is portrayed by that grand unwilling champion of gay rights Quentin Crisp, and the beautiful Billy Zane is treated as the &quot;love object&quot; in two scenes of lush sensuality. &quot;Bronsky Beat&quot;'s Jimmy Somerville, with his famous falsetto voice is here too, as a singing angel at the film's finale. His song, &quot;Coming&quot;, is wonderful, stating that gender doesn't really matter here-&quot;I am coming, I am coming, here I am, neither a woman nor a man.&quot; The art direction is breathtakingly beautiful, and Sandy Powell's costumes are remarkably accurate, spanning the centuries from Elizabethan thru Jacobean thru Rococo thru Victorian to present-day. Some may find the pace of this gorgeous film a little ponderous, but I found it to be an intriguing 90 minutes. We are all humans, individuals-why all this fuss about what a &quot;woman's&quot; role in society is, or what a &quot;man's&quot; role in society is? Virginia Woolf, I understand, based &quot;Orlando&quot; on a meeting she had with an Italian noblewoman who bemoaned the fact that she was denied her inheritance due to the fact that she was born a woman.

This made me feel uncomfortable in an insightful way. Just as you get comfortable with her persona and the era, it changes. I have watched this movie at least 20 times and each time I notice that everything about the story means something if you are truely listening and observing. No time for daydreaming or nodding off. If you are interested in what it is to be a male, a female and variants of these, how this is expressed or suppressed through sexuality, dress, mannerisms, social expectations, this movie will intrigue you. Even make you question your own ideas of yourself and societal expectations. A wonderful experience for reflecting on your way of being in the world.'Orlando' could be used as a tool for opening discussions with any person or group who is questioning or wondering about thoughts and feelings they have had about feeling different and find out it may be perfectly normal to have these thoughts and ideas.

Though very artsy in many ways, the film does drag at times (like many art pieces) with periods of great silence or reflection on a particular scene or theme. The cinematography is fantastic, clearly embellished by the many foreign locations, but also the attempts to create scenes and costumes of the differing periods. The costumes, are bizarre and wildly colorful at times, but I believe probably true to the times and climes they propose to represent. The actors on the whole do their parts well, offer quite a range of colorful personality types. As long as you are not expected a fast-paced modern techno drama, with all sorts of special effects, you will likely quite enjoy Orlando, with it's multilayered plot and story of a human living through many time periods changing personalities and sex, as easily as we change into a new set of clothes each day!"},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","review":"I was very happy to finally get a DVD copy of this movie!

As she was looking around, she saw a young girl standing in the dark.The girl was looking at Janine with shimmering eyes,like she had no love,no freedom. But as Janine got closer she saw it was her twin sister,Lenore.As Janie was going to say something, a voice came out. It was her grandfather,telling her to go back. Janine was convinced to go back home. As Janine left, so did her sister. Now, Lenore wants Janine to feel how death and having no family is like,so Lenore is making Janine go simply crazy.My opinion of this book is that I think that only mature childern should read this book because of all the horror. I think this book is very good because of all the details. This book taught me a good lesson, to never skip school with a boy that can get me killed. It also taught the importance of having love for my brother's and sister's."},{"Title":"Haunted Sister","review":"Have you ever been in a car accident, died, and then came back to life again? Have you ever known something wasn't right with your life? Well that is what Janine Palmer faces in the awesome, 217 page book, Haunted Sister by Lael Littke. This is a fiction book and Lael Littke did an amazing job on it. Janine faces many challenges in trying to get a hold of her life and take back control. The main characters in this novel are Janine, Lenore, William, Janine and William's parents, Scott, Rafe, and Anna Mae.Janine Palmer was in a car accident when she and her boyfriend Scott were ditching school and going to the beach. They came to an intersection and went through it because there was a green light. But a car ran a red light and crashed into them from the side. Janine died and then came back to life and was in a hospital when she woke up. Her twin sister, who had died when they were 4, had come back with her from the place she had gone, when she had died, that had crystal mountains and stayed in her body. Later on, Lenore started taking control of Janine's body, by what she did and what she said. William, Janine's little brother, started to notice her acting strange when he overheard Janine talking aloud to Lenore who had been talking to Janine inside her head. Lenore had been saying from day 1 that it was Janine's fault Lenore had died. Janine couldn't remember how and why it could've been her fault. So Janine started trying to put pieces of information of her life back together. Will it turn out well?My favorite part of the book would have to be when Lenore wanted to go out with the school's football star, Rafe Belmont, and Janine let Lenore take control of Janine's body. Janine had to control the legs because Lenore was not strong enough to control them yet. On their first date they went to a fair and rode half of the rides there.The most important thing I learned from reading this book is that when life gets tough you just have to hold on for the ride and get through whatever it throws at you.Some other books by Lael Littke are The Watcher, Thirteen, and Lake of Secrets. These are all books by Lael Littke.I would totally recommend this book to anyone who likes ghost stories that aren't scary."},{"Title":"Haunted Sister","review":"I loved this book and finished it in one day.

Please dear author of this book, before you attempt writing another book, finish what you started! The ending was rushed and did not explain good.

One mind fighting against the other for control over it? If you think that's interesting, then you'd love the book Haunted Sister by Lael Littke. Janine is an ordinary high school girl, until she gets into a terrible car accident with her boyfriend, Scott. Now she struggles against her twin sister's mind that has invaded her body. Janine, the normal, nice girl, lives in an everyday, common town. She goes to a regular high school, and lives in the average family-house. Ordinary girl she may be, but not until that day of the accident. Throughout the story, Janine is trying to recover from her accident physically as well as mentally. The cuts and bruises go away, but she has this haunting voice in her head that claims to be her twin sister, Lenore, who had drowned when they were young girls. Janine finds herself doing things she would have normally never done, for instance she begins to lie and steal. Janine's personality changes all throughout the book with the help of Lenore. She wants to be the goody-two-shoes she once was, but now that her sister has invaded her body, she has an unusual bad side to her. I enjoyed this book because the author didn't jump around at all. The story was one track and easy to follow. I also loved the tension between the two characters, Janine and Lenore. They sounded a lot like real sisters that bicker and fight over everything. One wants to be good, and the other is more of a mischievous type looking for adventure. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes conflicts within one person and enjoys a surprise ending!"},{"Title":"Haunted Sister","review":"If you like to read books with misleading titles, this book is for you!

Leal Littke is an awsome author"},{"Title":"Haunted Sister","review":"The novel Haunted Sister is a wonderful book by Leal Littke. Haunted Sister is a novel about a girl named Janine and her boyfriend Scott getting in a car wreck. Janine goes to this misty place and sees her sister that had died in a drowning accident (she is in a coma when she goes to the misty place). When she wakes up she figures out that Lenore her sister that had died is in her body and can control her body parts, and speak to her. After the coma the doctor says that she can go home. So Janine does, and tell's William and William's friend Anna May about Lenore and how whenever she did something bad she would call herself Lenore. After Janine looks back through time about her sister and her together she finally finds out who she is.In Haunted Sister Janine and Lenore are very interesting characters. Janine is very wise and is known as the \\"good,\\" child. Lenore is very out going and is known as the \\"bad,\\" child. Both Janine and Lenore are twins. But I like Janine when Lenore is in her body. The message that the author is giving out is that treat your sister, as you would want to be treated. What I liked most about the book was when it tells what Janine is seeing after the accident? What I liked least was when Janine was in the hospital and I just think that it was very boring, and it didn't really catch my attention. I was really satisfied with the ending because it's not what you expected.I really liked the author's style because it was very interesting how she wrote it. The author tells what the reader needs to know with the details to make it very interesting. The vocabulary is very easy. And I really don't like how Leal Littke wrote what Lenore was saying because I couldn't really tell the difference if Lenore or Janine was saying it. I think that ages 10- 14 would enjoy this book, but any higher or lower they might not enjoy it. I really recommend this book because it is very suspenseful and you don't know what will happen next.CEJ"},{"Title":"Haunted Sister","review":"This is an awesome book.At first it seemed boring, then really confusing/weird.

They try to speak to her and tell her to wake up and go back to her family. Janine then wakes up, but she realizes that she is not alone. Her twin's voice is haunting her. Is Janine having hallucinations from the accident, or is her twin really living in her body?I really liked the characters in this book. Janine really had a lot of personality to her. The way she was described really made her interesting to read about. There wasn't a whole lot of action in this book, but it was suspenseful. I was constantly impatient to find out what was going to happen next. It's really hard to put this book down after you get really into it. The conflicts that Janine and Lenore kept having made it seem so real. They would argue and fight like real sisters do. The descriptions of what made Janine so mad helped you to feel like you were in the character's place. It also made it seem like Lenore was life-like.I would recommend this book to middle school children and older. It might get confusing to kids who are younger than that.

Today in the universities the rhetoric of Ernesto Grassi goes for the most, but it is on this writing of Vico that Grassi relied in his theory of rhetoric!"},{"Title":"The Two Faces of Silenus","review":"With &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot;, Alan Garner popularised a kind of fantasy novel in which an ancient myth comes alive in modern times. Many writers have subsequently exploited this genre, including Penelope Lively, William Mayne, Penelope Farmer, Susan Cooper, William Rayner, Diana Wynne Jones, and William Corlett. (Of course Garner was not the first to create such a genre, but those who used it before him are not so well known, good though their work often is -- but this is not the place to raise such things).Pauline Clarke has written many kinds of children's novels -- fantasies, historical novels, family comedies, dolls' stories -- and is best known for her Carnegie Medal winner &quot;Return of the Twelve&quot; (or The Twelve and the Genii&quot;), in which the toy soldiers of the Bronte children are brought to life, again, by a twentieth century boy. (Written in 1962, this is 18 years before Lynne reid banks discovered an Indian in the cupboard!)Although &quot;Return of the Twelve&quot; resembles aspects of Garner's genre, it is &quot;The Two Faces of Silenus&quot; which takes as its central motif the mythical struggle between the life-forces of Silenus, a nature god, and the death-forces of Medusa, a moon goddess. (Comparisons may be made between Susan Cooper's &quot;Seaward&quot;, which provides a Celtic-based version of this conflict, or Patricia Miles &quot;The Gods in Winter&quot; which brings the capture and rape of Persephone into the modern world.)A modern English family go to a small Italian city. The father is attending a conference of academics. The mother is holidaying, and the two children, in their early teens, are left to enjoy themselves in the sunbaked streets and forested hills. One day they see a strange carved mask-face on a well or water-tank in the street: a huge beaming smile, surrounded by shaggy hair, with two protruding tusks. A local street boy urges them to throw a coin into the gaping mouth, and make a secret wish. Dangerous!Nearby they also see two huge carved stone lions. Unwittingly their innocent tourist actions bring the carvings to life, and suddenly they find themselves romping with Silenus. (Surely Silenus has not featured in any story, let alone a children's story, since C.S. Lewis's &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, part of the Chronicles of Narnia, where a god-lion also romps, celebrating life and challenging the forces of death and winter.)Just as unwittingly, they have unleashed the cruel owl-like Medusa, sworn enemy of Silenus. They have also become entangled in the present-day problems of the boy, and his mother and father. The whole landscape becomes involved, as the children are hunted through woods, down narrow streets, around Roman ruins, and an old Roman theatre. Their parents, also, become involved, and each has a significant encounter with Silenus. It would spoil the power of the book to say much more about the narrative events.Few writers attempt such complex issues -- life versus death, morality versus sensuality, belief and disbelief -- and of those who do, few avoid moralising, at times, or simplifying. Clarke succeeds in shaping a rich story which does not moralise, does not offer simple explanations, and leaves room for readers to work out what seems to be happening, and why.Why is the book not better known? Perhaps the non-English setting, and the use of Greco-Roman gods lacks the feeling that &quot;this belongs to us&quot; which writers such as Garner and Cooper exploit when they draw on Norse and Celtic mythology and set their adventures in the British countryside. Readers should not be so insular.Incidentally, the illustrations by Anthony Maitland (perhaps best known for his illustrations of some of Leon Garfield's children's books, and Penelope Lively's &quot;The Ghost of Thomas Kempe&quot;) are excellent.This is a book to savour, especially as the myths it draws on are so well known, yet so poorly understood, except at the level of adventure. Clarke's book shows some of the religious depth of these myths, and deep myth is always worth experiencing!"},{"Title":"One wonderful night: A Romance of New York,","review":"Did not care for it.

You can also download questions that help you understand the basic ideas of each chapter from the publisher's website.

You can also purchase \\"In the Buddha's words\\" from Bikkhu Bodhi, \\"Sayings of the Buddha\\" from Rupert Gethin, \\"Dhammapada\\" from Gil Fronsdal or \\"Dhammapada\\" from the Oxford Classics as complements to this book."},{"Title":"Early Buddhist Discourses","review":"I like this book a lot.

This is a great book if you're new to Buddhism, just starting to read suttas, or if like me, you want a translator other than Bhikku Bodi.John does a great job of introducing each sutta, and then translating the sutta's themselves. The book is concise, and shares Buddha's most important teachings.I recommend this book for everyone, no matter what your experience is with Buddhism."},{"Title":"Early Buddhist Discourses","review":"These sixteen discourses from the Pali canon are a great introduction to Theravada Buddhism, one of the great creations of the human mind. The discourses cover basic Buddhist metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and ethics. I can't judge the accuracy of the translations from Pali, but the English is quite clear. Beginners looking to read primary Buddhist texts should start here. That said, I gave the book four stars instead of five because the editorial apparatus is a bit light. The editor, John Holder, introduces each discourse with a helpful summary of the key points, but many obscure or nuanced points within the texts are not explained."},{"Title":"Early Buddhist Discourses","review":"This is an extremely well-edited text. The introductions are lucid and penetrating. And the edior eliminated the painfully repetitive parts of the primary source texts, which is very much appreciated. One comes away with a better understanding of Buddhism than one could ever get from a secondary source like, say, Hagen's &#34;Buddhism Is not What You Think&#34; or even Penguin Classic's &#34;Buddhist Scriptures.&#34; This is one source I'm sure to consult many times."},{"Title":"Early Buddhist Discourses","review":"I bought the book for my son Quentin.

He's now 7 1/2 and still enjoys reading the book, and his 2-year-old brother also loves to have it read to him. Very imaginative pictures. In my opinion, the text is appropriate and funny. Doesn't hurt that it's colloquial and has some \\"difficult\\" terminology (even for adults)- a more-curious kid can always ask, and \\"we\\" can look it up. I'm sure some kids will find it boring, but I bet most will like it."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"Great read for any child and enjoyable for adults to read along.

It's read to him many times a Day! What a wonderful, and creative mind these authors have."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"The book starts out with a dedication to the NYC sanitation department. How often does that happen?The whole length of the book is a garbage truck describing his day (our night, of course). Hence the line \\"Did I wake you? Well, TOO BAD.\\" (I love that line. It's so true to life! Our garbage trucks always wake us here.)This truck roars, burps, and is proud of his recipe for Alphabet Soup (including such delicacies as Dirty Diapers and Puppy Poo, not to mention Zipped up Ziti with Zucchini). And I love the pride with which our narrator declares that he stinks - but he's got an important job. Without him, as he ways, we're on \\"Mount Trash-o-rama, baby\\".I can't say enough good things about this book. Definitely check it out."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"This is a terrific read-aloud for little boys, who will giggle through the \\"alphabet soup\\". It's a workout to read out loud, though, because of the zany typography and myriad exclamation points expressing the truck's attitude with a capital A. (This book is the reason my boys know what an exclamation point is for!) If you're looking for a gift for a 3-6 year old boy, you will absolutely not go wrong with _I Stink_ or the other McMullan books, especially _I'm Dirty_."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"\\"I Stink\\" is a great, fun way for kindergarteners or pre-k kids to learn their letters.

You can't wrong with this one."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"All the better for my trash truck enthused 3 yr old to enjoy! The story is short and just fine. Its a sing- song poetic flow about a trash truck-- who knew? There is a well thought up alphabet soup made up of an A to z garbage list that is not leaving much to the imagination. My son loves this part of the book! With great Illustrations...\\"Stinky sneakers, rotten bananas, and poopy diapers.\\" Well, that is what is actually in the trash."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"It's hard to read to kids but my son just loves to see the garbage truck and play with the alpabet."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"My nephew is obsessed with &#34;trash trucks&#34; so this book was absolutely perfect for him.

They especially love for me to use a grumbly \\"Garbage Truck\\" voice. Excellent book to read aloud to a First Grade classroom: it's informative but gross - the perfect combination for 6-year olds. For practice with the alphabet and memorization, you can't beat the recipe for Alphabet Soup!"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"The story is about one night in the \\"life\\" of a New York City garbage truck. It is told with sound effects kids love. It is an excellent vocabulary builder with an alliterative list of all the things in the trash from a to z. My son received this book when he was 3 and ended up memorizing it because he begged to \\"read\\" it over and over. If your child loves to watch the street sweepers and garbage trucks go by, then this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"...this is our book! My son has always had a strange obession with trash and trash cans so he has me read this over and over again. And he can even recite certain parts back which is pretty good considering he's only two. We'll get to a certain page and he'll say \\"Rev me to the MAX!\\" And, yes, while it does mention \\"puppy poo\\" I think there are worse things for my son to read about. We have animals so for him to learn that their poo has to go somewhere is not objectionable to me at all."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"What a wonderful story for our two little boys (ages 3 and 2) who are completely facinated by the world of trash and garbage trucks. They love this story and we read it often."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"I am currently interning in a Prekindergarten classroom. I cannot say enough good things about this book! The kids in my class LOVED this book from first read and I had to read it almost every day during our \\"transportation\\" unit. If you have or work with children, I recommend this book. I am buying my own copy for my own future classroom. It's also a lot of fun to read aloud, with tons of sound effects (even burping!)"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"I have a son w/special needs and he absolutely LOVES this book!!! In the past, I have had trouble w/getting him to take an interest in reading, but he will actually go get this book and sit down with it and \\"read\\" it himself or ask me to read \\"the stinky book\\" to him. This is absolutely a great book and the way it is written is very fun to read."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"This is my son's favorite book, we read it every night! He loves to make the roaring sound. It has an innovative approach to the ABCs. He loved it so much the pages are all bent and we are buying another copy."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"And mine, too. You can't beat the art and typography or the story and text. That the authors have done research and write with verisimilitude only adds to the relief and joy that you feel after having read so many boring children's books."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"My 3 year old LOVES this book. Also I'm Dirty and I'm Mighty by the same authors. He sits and reads them over and over, even though he can't read yet. :) He has me read them to him, and he \\"reads\\" them to me telling me what's in the pictures. My son is one of those who will Not sit still unless it's REALLY worth it. i definately recommend it."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"You need to have some energy to read this book. My son loves it, and even though it is exciting, in the end the garbage truck goes to bed, so it is still appropriate at bed time."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"I Stink is a wonderful book. My son is 3 1/2 and he chuckles through the alphabet section. Very creative!"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"I haven been a library teacher, as well as a Kdg. teacher, and mother, and children ages 1-6 adore this book! My toddler can't get enough of it!

He giggles and cracks up every time when I say puppy poo eew!This book has very rythmic wording and is very much a read aloud book. What little boy doesn't enjoy yucky stuff.

Kids want to hear this book over and over!"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"My four children (three girls and a boy) all loved I Stink. This is the perfect book for toddlers who can recognize the sound of a trash truck three blocks over and then run to the window in eager anticipation. I got this book for my son and was surprised that my girls liked it as much as he did (maybe we can finally take a break from all the Fairy Tale books and focus on Kate McMullan's other works!) Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"I used this during my student teaching in a kindergarten class, and the kids just couldn't get enough. We all loved it! They wanted to read it every day."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"In addition to all the other reasons why this book is fantastic (which my son and I totally agree with, btw), we love this because it is a wonderful read-aloud book. What makes it particularly good for that is the way that the authors use different typefaces, positioning and text formatting to let you know exactly how to read a particular word or phrase (it's too bad that more children's books don't do this). And even the most rhythm-challenged parent should be able to come up with a respectable flow for the truck's \\"back-up rap\\". Lots of fun for both child and parent."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"This book is fun for kid's and adults both will love this book fun abd colorfull boof easy to read smnd as I said adults will love it. My Grandson sure dose he thinks it cool."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"Gritty drawings, and a whole lot of fun, especially for boys. We must have read this book a thousand times aloud (a lot more fun if you are willing to make all the sounds). A little off the beaten path, but full of action and emotion, it makes a great bedtime story (the truck goes to sleep too!)."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"This book is so cute. The illustrations are great with bold colors and interesting text placement. We don't live in a big city like the setting is in the book, but we enjoyed the story just the same. Lots of fun, especially if you enjoy making all the sound-effect noises as they are prompted in the book. We both got a hoot out of the A-Z things that that can be found in the trash. (You can even make a game out of it and make up your own zany A-Z list.) We got the paperback version and the pages appear to be thick enough to endure many, many more readings. Great fun to read!!"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"My son said that this is his favorite from the three books we have by the same author -- I am Mighty! I am Dirty! and I Stink! Because it is about garbage truck and because it is a cool book:). Nevertheless, he likes the other books very much as well. I would not say that I liked it that much at start. It is quite difficult to translate all the noises and one word text. However, upon many times of reading I have started to like it...besides, my son loves it, so it is fun to read this to him. He even likes the funny faces of the Garbage truck on insides of the covers. These books are fun and easy to read. The book brings our attention to trash...and hopefully teaches about being thoughtful about what we throw out in garbage."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"My 4 year old received this book as a gift and absolutely loves it! It is well written description of the daily life of a garbage truck and why they are important to our community. My little one gets a kick out of some of the garbage described, such as ugly underwear and moldy meatballs. Great book and fun to read!"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"Great book.My son can read this in kindergarten. He loves the exaggerated font. Stinky stuff is so fun for kids either way."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"I credit this book with getting my three-year-old interested in books. Before he didn't seem to care to be read to, then I got this from the library and he would bring it to me right after breakfast every day. Soon he was saying the phrases along with me and looking at it by himself during the day. I guess I wasn't choosing subject matter that was interesting before, but tapping into his garbage man mania did the trick."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"Love the way this book is written. It is a really great read aloud book and very funny!

He especially enjoyed the section describing trash types in alphabetical order. Now he is able to read the whole book back to me word by word. Sometimes, he would sit on the front porch just to see garbage trucks coming by.I strongly recommend this book to any beginning reader who is eager to know the world."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"Author/Illustrator team Kate and Jim McMullan have concocted an energetic tribute to trash trucks, those objects of veneration to toddlers everywhere. The trash truck delivers an upbeat monologue about himself and then, with dramatic sound effects, backs up to a pile of bags to chomp his way through an \\"alphabet soup\\" made of Apple cores, Banana peels, Candy wrappers, Dirty diapers -- you get the idea. Although he makes no bones about the grossness of his role, you can't deny his necessity: \\"Without me, you're on Mount Trash-o-rama, baby!\\"Illustrated in a lively, cartoon-style drawings with lots of movement, this book delivers plenty of attitude and macho style, and the dramatic text requires performance rather than a sedate read-aloud pace. For those adults who don't wish to perform the story as often as the audience will desire (and oh, they will), there is also an appealing CD and DVD."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"The most testosterone laden picture book ever conceived and executed. You thought \\"Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel\\" was a tad bit too masculine for your kids? Then forgo the wonders of \\"I Stink\\". A rip roaring celebration of the joys of sanitation (THERE's a new word for your kids to learn!) this book follows the daily work of a garbage truck as it makes its daily rounds in the wee hours of the day. The book is so good natured in its exclamations you just can't help but love it either. And trust me, the kids will.Here's how the book begins. No namby-pamby openers for this morning vehicle. \\"Who am I? I've got lights. Ten WIDE tires. No A.C., not me. I've got doubles: Steering wheels, gas pedals, brakes. I am totally DUAL OP\\". You half expect this truck to disintegrate into a series of well-chosen cuss words, it's so certain of its own glory. Acting more like an Oscar the Grouch in garbage truck form, the dirty monstrosity exhibits its own forms of belching before launching into the ABC's of its morning diet. A word of warning: don't read this book too early in the morning. You may find yourself growing nauseous (even as your kids howl for more) reading about fish heads, ugly (stained) underpants, and year-old yams. The authors aren't squeamish about defecation either. Here we can clearly see dirty diapers, kitty litter, and puppy poo (not to put too fine a point on it). The truck then explains how indispensable he (I'm only assuming it's male, but it's a pretty clear guess) is summarizing the predicament we'd be in. Without the Sanitation Department, \\"You're on Mount Trash-o-rama, baby\\". Never thought you'd ever hear a garbage truck call you \\"baby\\"? You obviously could not have predicted this book.The authors are careful to thank not only garbage men Earl Harrington and Billy King in their opening, but also \\"everyone at the New York City Department of Sanitation\\". It is a fitting tribute, and an excellent book to offer unto them. Capped off by beautiful endpapers (displaying our friend the Garbage Truck in mesmerizing shades of deep blue and turquoise) this disgusting, smelly, filthy book is a class act through and through. Kids love it, grown-ups (that aren't prone to sickness) really get into it, and the world is a better place for it. Garbage workers rarely get their due. Now, they're not only commended for their work, but lauded as well."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"It's hard to believe that anyone could write an entertaining story about the ins and outs of garbage collection, but that's exactly what husband and wife team, Kate and Jim McMullan, have done. Meet a New York City garbage truck. He's bold, brash, confident, and he's more than happy to explain how he gets this dirty job done while the rest of the city sleeps. From apple cores, banana peels, candy wrappers, and dirty diapers to watermelon rings, XL T-shirts, year old yams, and zipped-up ziti with zucchini, he eats it all and never complains. &quot;What's that? You think I stink? WHOOOOO-WHEE! Do I ever! No skunk ever stunk this bad! Go, hold your nose, but think about it - Without Me? You're on Mount Trash-o-rama, baby.&quot; The McMullan's have filled their picture book with engaging illustrations, creative text sizes, fonts, and colors, marvelous sound effects, lots of energy and humor. A feast for both the ears and eyes, I Stink shows a big, happy, boisterous machine at work, doing an important community job, and makes a perfect read aloud, youngsters 3-7 will beg to hear again and again."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"After reading Kate and Jim McMullan's delightful, I STINK, my children and I can't pass a garbage truck without smiling. This totally original book takes us into a whole new world of trash. Readers will relish every word uttered by the tough-talking garbage truck while falling in love with his adorable face. My children begged me to read and re-read the alphabet soup pages--a look at what every garbage truck slurps up in an average day. This is the perfect gift for children of all ages. My family anxiously awaits the next book by this very talented husband and wife (illustrator/author) team."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"My almost 2 year old son has had a fascination with garbage trucks since he was a little over a year old. Recently our children's librarian recommended this book. At first, I didn't think the language would work for a 2 year old. It is a bit slangy and somewhat adult (though not inappropriately so). However, it turns out that he understands it just fine and the gruff New York City garbage truck has really grown on us. I also thought the pictures would be too abstract for my son, but again he can handle them. He has a few favorite parts. First, the part where the garbage has to be compacted. Second, the \\"alphabet soup\\" that the garbage truck eats. He appreciates the things he can identify with (banana peels, dirty diapers, kitty litter, orange peels) and has also learned some new words. On the back cover is a great picture of the garbage truck sleeping with a sweet sleep smile on his face. He turns out to be a big teddy bear after all!This book is a huge favorite with my son and one that we do not tire of reading. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"... \\"I Stink\\" by Kate and Jim McMullan is the book for you. This is a really fun book that follows a trash truck as he makes his rounds. The artwork is really unique and the trash truck is pretty funny. You also get a chance to run down the alphabet by naming some of the yucky stuff in the trash truck. It's a unique and funky book, but kids really enjoy it. I thought the artwork was particularly unique and well done."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"I really wanted to like this book. We live in the city and my daughter loves to watch the trucks collect garbage and recyclables. But this trash truck character has a bad attitude. I'm not the goody-goody that sounds like. I just didn't like how the truck made comments like, \\"Did I wake you? Too bad!\\" or used \\"Baby\\" to refer to the reader, like some kind of swinger. It shifted the focus onto the attitude of the truck, and not the appreciation of an important city service. It tried to be too cool and in doing so makes it not such a great children's book.I did like the ABC portion where a trash was listed for each letter of the alphabet."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"I recently purchased this book for my 3 1/2 year old daughter as she is fascinated with big trucks and construction equipment.

A fun read!Evelyn Horan - teacher/counselor/authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Books One - Three"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"We can't decide what about the book we like the most: the story or the illustrations. The dialogue of the trash truck is so entertaining especially if you put a lot of drama and fun into the way you read each of the pages. The pictures are colorful and whimsical. We review the book at least twice in each sitting and find something new in the illustrations each time. You will love the alphabet soup! This book is fabulous fun each time we read it."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"I liked the pictures, I liked the way the author puts in the 'alphabet of trash' and I liked the subject matter. It's great to teach kids to appreciate the hard work that the department of sanitation does.However, I REALLY disliked the attitude of the trash truck. The 'Did I wake you?? Too bad.' or the 'Outta my way!' My son is at an age where he definitely picks up and remember lines from books. I hear him repeating lines he's heard in books that we've read to him. The authors could have made the trash truck just as stinky and hard-working, but more likeable. No reason why he has to be so rude and inconsiderate.Also, the writing seemed too choppy. We read tons of children's books at our house, and this one is tough to read at times.I would have given it 3 stars if my son liked it more, but even he doesn't seem to gravitate to it as much as some of his other books."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"Got it from the library. Ordered some as presents and had to get a copy for ourselves. My 5 year old son (and I) love it. First read it probably when he was 3 or so.

I am glad you had them in stock as it would have been months waiting for the book store to get them in otherwise."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"My kids love this book! They love the stinky alphabet with the puppy poo and dirty diaper in the trash truck. They love the sounds that the truck makes and the pictures.

I am going to look into buying a copy to keep and am looking into the other books like it."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"This is my four-year-old son's favorite book of all time. We've read it so often that he has it memorized. He's a garbage truck fanatic all the way around, but this book seems to have a special place in his heart.

It's a bit tiring to read aloud with all the exclamation points, but the \\"alphabet soup\\" recipe guarantees lots of giggles. This truck has attitude to spare and then some. The art is terrific. Highly recommended!(...)"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"This book leaves a lot to be desired. The story is poorly written, has very little substance and the sentences are very choppy. The author skips around and leaves a lot to be desired with what little story line there is. I thought the book would be great for my little boys - who love big trucks! But it doesn't really capture their attention."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"We think that the book I Stink is an awesome book. It's about a garbage truck, and he says he stinks. It has great illustrations and they are detailed enough that the book is awesome, but not so detailed that you can't read it out loud. Also the garbage truck tells everything that is in his truck in ABCs. This book is colorful, funny, and educational. Little kids would love it. While they would like it, they are also learning their ABCs. The ABCs are things in a garbage truck. Also, the garbage truck talks."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"My son is 5 and loves cars, trucks, trains, tractors, you name it. He brought this book home from the library at school. This is definitely the most god-awful children's book I've ever read ~ and we read a lot. It's horribly written, does not flow well, and the illustration is dark and rather scary. I would never recommend this book to anyone. Honestly I'm shocked to find that this book has been so highly rated, because I truly fail to see why."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"This has to be one of the worst board books ever. The garbage truck is so rude, here is a line from the book, \\"Did I wake you? Too bad!\\" This type of behavior and attitude is not something I want to teach my son."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"This book really rubs me the wrong way. The main issues are that the garbage truck is very rude and arrogant, and that it is glorifying trash. I think we should be showing our children examples of people treating each other with respect, and similarly treating the environment with respect. We should be talking about reducing or eliminating waste, recycling, etc. rather than eating trash. In reality the trash is going to a landfill. This linear system is not sustainable."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"This is a non preachy entertaining yet educational book that explains what goes into the garbage and where the garbage goes. De-stigmatizes trash collection. Makes us think about our consumption of goods and keeping a city clean. Our toddler loves yelling, \\"I stink!\\" I don't think there's any competitor."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"Do not buy this book if you are teaching your child about composting and recycling or he/she will be very confused.Many of the things that go into this garbage truck go somewhere else in our house: apple cores, banana peels, egg shells, orange peels, rotten radishes, watermelon rinds, yams and jam jars to name a few ...I understand the authors were looking for items from A - Z but with a bit more effort I think they could have found other examples.The other confusing thing is that the garbage truck takes all the trash to the river to dump it on a barge and we are not told where it goes from there.Maybe this is how it's done in New York but still - let kids know where the trash really ends up and don't leave us with an image of trash on a barge."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"The pictures in this book are reasonably good, but the text is lacking - and often times confusing."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"My room mate played this for her four year old son, and I was appalled at the attitude of the truck. It had a very \\"if I'm bothering you, TOUGH! Get over it!\\" attitude. This is NOT the kind of lesson I want imparted to my children. The character is too direct, and needs to develop some manners!"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"This has been one of my son's favorite books for years.Combining learning with big working trucks is obviously a formula for success (as evidenced by the sequelsI'm Dirty!andI'm Mighty!). I Stink! teaches not only the alphabet--through colorful and grotesque association--but also technical and operational details about the truck itself.The artwork is dark and gritty in a graphic novel sort of way. To be fair, it takes place in the early morning hours. Our tour guide is a garbage truck who is loud and proud: \\"What's that? You think I Stink? WHOOOOO-WHEE! Do I ever! No skunk ever stunk THIS BAD!\\" Yeah, he's got attitude. He's a New York City garbage truck for cryin' out loud!In researching this review, I learned the New York City Department of Sanitation has over two *thousand* garbage collection trucks. (see link in Comment section below)"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"My son loves this story, along with I'm Mighty and I'm Dirty that were also written by the same authors.It's a fun read!"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"For the past year, my son (who just turned four) has been obsessed with garbage trucks. He knows the different types and has a fleet ranging from Matchbox to the larger, battery-operated Tonkas. He is also silly in the way that only 4-year old boys can be. Naturally he was thrilled with Kate and Jim McMullen's I Stink.I Stink is a completely gross, completely fun look at a day in the life of a New York City garbage truck. The truck narrates the tale, describing his various parts and features and giving a delightfully disgusting alphabetical rundown of the garbage he loves to consume (examples include Dirty Diapers, Ugly Underpants and Moldy Meatballs). The truck has plenty of attitude, which translates really well when reading the book aloud. I mean, what other children's book would include the line \\"without me, you're on Mount Trash-o-Rama, baby\\"? I have a blast reading this, and my son cracks up every time. I suppose the humor and illustrations may be a bit over the top for some kids and parents, but I can't remember the last book my son and I enjoyed so much together.In the short time since we bought it, I Stink has been in the top spot on my son's \\"read to me\\" list. If there's a little guy (I know, gender roles and all that) in your life who loves garbage trucks, and you're willing to expose him to some mildly gross humor, I Stink is an absolute winner."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"We first had the authors' other book, \\"I'm Dirty.\\" Our son loved it so much I decided to buy \\"I Stink.\\" This one is just as good. Our son loves the pictures, the rhymes, the whole subject. If your child is into the construction vehicles, fire trucks, etc., then I recommend both \\"I'm Dirty\\" and \\"I Stink.\\" Dirty teaches about numbers and Stink teaches about letters."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"I picked up this book in our local library and my son wouldn't let me put it down!We bought it for him for his birthday and he really does think its brilliant. His favourite page is the Garbage Lorry burping...when my husband reads it to him he adds in an \\"Excuse Me\\" which makes our boy giggle. Not sure about some of the choices for the alphabet section...X is an XL T-shirt...but hey nothing is perfect!All children will enjoy this book, its really vivid and easy to read EVERY night too!"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"Another good book from the couple who did I'm Dirty (which is a winner!). This one, while not my favorite, is enjoyed thoroughly by my daughter (3) who is fascinated by trucks and tractors of all kinds. This one deals with the garbage truck (trash trucks) and its job, and also goes through the alphabet (A-Z) with regards to what's been picked up. I know our trash isn't put on a barge, nor is our trash collected overnight, as in this book, but all in all, still one we have enjoyed with our little one. I don't like that it's so easy to dispose of things but that's the current state of our society. It's been a good way to start to talk about recycling and other reduce/reuse options with her, too."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"A three year old introduced me to I Stink. Even though he couldn't read, he knew almost every descriptive word. He \\"read\\" the book with such enthusiasm and energy. I bought the book for my grandkids, and they enjoy it just as much. They enjoy the DVD version, and the CD version, so they can look at the book while listening or viewing the story as well. The illustrations are great too! For me it is the sound of the words, they make the story exciting every time you read it."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"This book is my sons FAVORITE! He is 2 years old and has memorized every word of this book! If you have a little boy, this book is a must have! Just ordered \\"I'm Dirty\\" Can't wait to read it to him!"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"This book is informative and funny. It has alphabetical items that are found in the trash (which are gross and the kids love them). I always get laughs in the middle when he burps."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"with his current obsession with the garbage trucks, my son is really into this book. It has excellent rhymes and it even does the alphabet! Something I didnt expect until I was turning the pages. Great read great illustrations!"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"I had to read this book to my two year old son five times so far... and we only checked it out of the library last night. He laughs hysterically at every page and asks for \\"garbage truck book\\" at every opportunity."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"My daughter (20 months) LOVES this book. We read it numerous times a day, and she can fill in many of the words. She is also recognizing many of the letters from the \\"alphabet soup\\" pages. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that there are a few rude parts(\\"outta my way!\\" \\"Did I wake you? Too bad!). Since toddlers repeat everything, I just skip those parts-no big deal. I also wish it came in a board book format. Otherwise, I highly recommend this for any child obsessed with watching the garbage truck!"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"My son absolutely adores this book, and since he is only 3 he can't read it, but he has it nearly memorized. The visuals are very bright and inviting. The words are easy to follow. I found I Stink on one of our normal trips to the library, and every visit thereafter he wanted to check out I Stink, so I bought it. I also bought other books by the McMullans, and he's enjoyed those as well."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"We read this to our 2 year old son and a couple days later he repeated it back to us! In the stroller, in the car, when the garbage truck would come on Monday mornings.....i think you get the picture! He would say the Alphabet part too! Not only a GREAT book, but also teaches something (whitout seaming to!) at the same time! We love it and the illustrations are equal to the story! GREAT BOOK - a must have for any children's library!"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"We checked this out from our local library. My six-year-old son loved it so much, he wants to get it for his cousin. Throw in a toy trash truck and you have an awesome present.The book is best when read with emotion. Make the noises the truck makes and you are in for an evening of laughs. What a great way to end the day.Your boys and girls are sure to love this one."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"I do not know which one of my daughters loves this book more, my four year old or my two year old. Great book!"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves this book! She can recite all the words, and just loves the \\"garbage alphabet.\\" Whenever she sees a garbage truck, she screams, \\"I stink better get that garbage!\\" We discovered this book in the library and, after paying numerous late fees, had to buy a copy of our own. I highly recommed this book"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"This is a fun book. Our favorite part is the alphabet list of rotten trash. Our kids died laughing the first couple of times they heard, \\"ugly underpants\\" and \\"puppy poo.\\" The read itself is a tad disjointed in my opinion, but easy to get over. If your kids like garbage trucks or have a slight fascination with the gross and stinky, get this book!"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"Thank you for the book, this is one of my daughters favorite books, the book was in great condition and she loves it."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"Gross but fun! Perfect for toddler boys! We checked it out of the library so many times, I just decided to buy a copy."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"This is a great book. I enjoyed reading it myself. It was a great story that taught a lesson that children can understand. The illustrations are great and colorful and it is written with a sense of humor. I'm sending it to my nephew who loves garbage trucks and garbage men and I can't wait for him to get it."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"I was sceptical at first and bit grossed out by this book...that is until my then 2 year old began memorizing this book. It was an every night must read and he loved every gross minute of it. It's a fun book, with some gross trash, but lots of fun - especially for little boys who love stinky stuff! Got it as a gift, now buy it as a gift for others :)"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"My niece loved it when she was one, then two years old when all she wanted to read were the elmo books (I hid to avoid) and tiny sesame street board books with very few words, she loved this book. It was so easy to enjoy because it just flowed. I still can't get some of it out of my head years later. It's so much fun because of all the noises you make reading it, the truck's attitude is really funny, the rhyming, and the rhythm make the pages just fly by. But be ready to read it again when you're done."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"My 2 year old grandson loves this book. We checked it out from the library but he enjoyed it so much I purchased the book for him. We talk and laugh about this book all the time."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"Yeah, yeah, you naysayers in the 1-star categories, you need to get over yourselves. This is a kid's book--and dare I say, a boy's book, since I have two of them, and they love any garbage truck. \\"I Stink!\\" has a great voice, funky beat, and images even I--a total environmentalist!--can enjoy. Teach the kids about mother nature and recycling, sure. But c'mon, for boys who love garbage trucks? Get this one. I practically have it memorized from reading it so much."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"My favorite part is the surprise ABC section in the middle. I love its ability to include all sorts of ABC junk yet the book isn't devoted entirely to the ABC theme, but rather a cute story about the garbage collection process."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"Pre-schoolers love this nitty-gritty story of a big-city garbage truck and the work he does for us all night long while we sleep. The trash our truck collects forms a very grungy and hilarious alphabet--apple cores, banana peels, all the way down to ziti with zucchini shown in an old plastic bag. In between can be found dirty diapers, puppy poo and stinky sneakers. Brightly colored child-friendly illustrations predominate, and the well-chosen words make children laugh out loud: when the truck shows what life would be like without him, we see a mountain of trash with the words, \\"It's trash-o-rama, baby!\\" I have read this book to many pre-school boys, all of whom adored it. I can't speak for girls, but I suspect it might present a welcome break from all those princesses."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"This book is cute for boys. I got it to go along with Stinky the Garbage Truck. The story includes lots of great sounds for kids to learn!"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"We first heard I Stink read at the Brooklyn Library on 9th Avenue last year during the children's hour. All the children there that day loved it. We checked out the book and brought it home and read it again that afternoon to the the other family in our building with pre-preschoolers. During the time we had it checked out we read it over and over. Soon my 3 year old grandson was reading the many of the words and saying the sounds having memorized the story. He wrote \\"I Stink\\" with stick on letters in the bathtub.We ordered the book for him through Amazon for Christmas and it is a favorite with him and his brother who is now 20 months old. If your boys (and girls, too)like watching the garbage trucks come by and pick up the trash and garbage, they will love this story with so many \\"sounds,\\" etc. It also helps children to build an understanding of how services work in the city and elsewhere and how important those services are to all of us no matter where we live, but especially in the city."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"Funny and a bit on the stinky side. I recommend this book for young readers because it really gets them involved. If your little one is anything like mine - well they are a bit obsessed with stinky things and they find disgustingly gross topics very interesting. So, I Stink! is basically right up a young child's alley.Anya's favorite part is when they go into what the garbage truck eats...and it is alphabetical with alliteration, which puts a little bit of \\"learning\\" into a silly little book. The illustrations are also adorable, in a dirty kind of way.The McMullans also have a few other books that are just as enjoyable, and while they look like they are just for boys, my little princess likes to get dirty also!"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"This book is one that we had checked out at the library and we had to buy it! It is funny, original and educational all at the same time! A must for a little boy's library! Entertaining for parents, too!"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"I actually lost my voice after a few days of reading this fun read aloud. Toddlers and truck-loving, machine crazed toddlers will love this intimate look at a garbage truck, how he spends his days and nights. It even includes a disgustingly fun alphabet as we discover all of the gross things found in the garbage dump. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"My 2-year old absolutely adores this book! We've borrowed it from the library so many times that I have bought our own copy. It provides a humorous look at garbage trucks and even touches on the alphabet utilizing an ABC list of gross items that the garbage truck eats. We've read the book so many times that my son \\"reads\\" it to me at his young age. I highly recommend it for any other garbage truck-loving kids."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"Lately, the preschoolers have gotten into the habit of saying things stink, so they loved this book. We've been telling them not to use \\"bad\\" words like stink and this book is one way to get it out of their system. They're absolutely enchanted with the idea of a stinky truck that eats stinky garbage and that talks! They find it hysterical when I pretend to be repulsed by the \\"stinky\\" pictures of garbage. Very entertaining book. Excellent text and pictures"},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"My 3 year old loves this book and we love reading it to him. It was read aloud to him at a YMCA class and he asked me to get it for him so we could read it at home. We borrowed it from the library and read it every night. The language is fun and contemporary, and the alphabet section is great ... 'D' for Dirty Diapers; 'P' for Puppy Poo. My son laughs hysterically and it makes us smile too. Great for kids and enjoyable for grown-ups. I'm planning on buying several as Christmas gifts for little boy relatives and friends. This book is right up there with our other favorite, 'Maxi the Taxi Dog'."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"This has been my 19-month-old son's favorite book over summer. We had to buy one to replace the library's formerly new copy, which he demolished as he ROARed, PLOPped and BUURRPed along. It also taught him to recognize STOP signs, and there were plenty of letter O's for him to point out. Only the four pages of alphabet soup were a bit slow for him.It's also cute to hear him repeat, \\"I stink!\\" as he brings the book to be read."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"I got this book for our 19-month-old, who is obsessed with trucks of any kind. And he loved it. Loved it! But 3 days after I had gotten it for him, I had to \\"disappear\\" it. The book is so rude. I mean, I get that the truck is a garbage truck, and it's rough-and-tumble, but it has so much attitude that I think is hard to explain to a kid who's learning manners. It's all, get out of my way, and Did I wake you? Too bad! I think there's no reason to introduce such rudeness to your children just to get some truck love. If you're trying to instill manners in your child, do yourself a favor and skip this book. Try any of the Amazing Machines books about trucks, My Truck is Stuck! or the millions of others. Then you won't have to try to break your child of bad habits that s/he learns from this book."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"Awesome book that speaks to kids at their level. It doesn't preach at them, it talks about something cool - a garbage truck - and somehow manages to sneak in a lesson on ABCs. The summary is a little incorrect - it's appropriate for younger than 4. Ours enjoyed at 1 1/2 or 2."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"I have read this to many struggling readers after their cold read and they ALL love it. It is a pretty good hi-lo book as the humor can catch the interest of older children (7-9). I read a review where someone was trying to read this to a toddler. My suggestion to anyone is to read not just the reader reviews but also the target age(s)/grade(s) for a book prior to purchase. This will cut down on waste, waste of money and waste of paper.My son, now 13, read this book over and over again. People who are worried this book will teach children to be rude are very mistaken. He has always used his manners, he treats people with great kindness and tolerates others rudeness without returning the favor. If you are concerned this book is going to teach your child to be rude you are selling your child short. Children follow your example far more than that of a cartoony book. Even 4 year old children know trucks don't talk and this is not real.Overall it is very engaging, has great art work and is appropriate for the ages listed (4-8)."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"My son is four and got this book for a \\"Big Brother\\" gift when my daughter was born. He LOVES garbage trucks! He has memorized this book, and will \\"read\\" it to us at bed time....or anytime he has an audience."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"I wish I had read more of the reviews before I purchased. What a waste of money. This book tries to be clever but basically tells our kids that everything is garbage and that all the trash goes bye-bye out to sea. Really?? Is that the image we want our children growing up with?I thought I would teach my daughter that all jobs, even the gross stinky ones, are helpful to society... not through this book."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"This one does nothing for me. Children emulate the narrative voices they hear in books. Who wants their child speaking like this? Stupid book, stupid subject, poorly written."},{"Title":"I Stink!","review":"I really don't care for this book at all. I don't like the sarcastic tone and the way that it reads. It's not interesting to my son at all."},{"Title":"The Age of Insanity: Modernity and Mental Health","review":"I call attention to John F. Schumaker's work at every available opportunity. Amazon has a standing order to notify me any time he releases a new work. In my view, he is one of the world's most gifted explainers of the human condition. In the preface to &quot;The Age of Insanity,&quot; Schumaker expresses a love affair with the &quot;big picture.&quot; This affection comes through on every page. That this book was published in September 2001, amounts to a prophetic explanation point at the ending of one era and the beginning of another. If you have concerns over the state of mental health in the world today, then I highly recommend &quot;The Age of Insanity.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Age of Insanity: Modernity and Mental Health","review":"Schumaker writes terse, short, fact-filled sentences which require sometimes two readings. I was amazed how well-read the author is. He moves from psychology to economics to political philosophy to sociology. In my opinion the mental problems are mainly cultural and reading this book reinforces my view. There is a lot of perceptive critique of globalization, Western myths and American life. Perhaps he is sometimes a bit pessimistic, but there are data which supports this view. The more we can control material things the more alienated we are going to be. One of the best books I have read lately."},{"Title":"The Age of Insanity: Modernity and Mental Health","review":"This book deals with an issue that is largely overlooked in our society, but much to our detriment. I found it fascinating and recommend it to anyone interested in such areas."},{"Title":"Annulment, the Wedding That Was: How the Church Can Declare a Marriage Null","review":"This book is a user-friendly one. The question and answer format is used to its highest possiblity. It deals with all of those questions we never bothered to ask our high school religion nun or college theologian, and now wish we had. As both a civil and a canon lawyer dealing in divorce and annulments, I cannot think of one question not asked asked and answered here. The index makes it even easier to navigate the concepts explored. The result is a book that explains the concepts but also tells you how to deal practically with them in the context of the Church's laws and canons. This book takes the whole package of married life and puts it into Catholic perspective. This start to finish result, especially starting at the time of the marriage, is the crux of what so many do not understand about the Catholic Church and marriage. Foster's approach is totally successful just because of its simplicity. The book should be read by those thinking of marriage and not just those far down the road. It's assistance to both is what makes this book so important."},{"Title":"Annulment, the Wedding That Was: How the Church Can Declare a Marriage Null","review":"Annulling a marriage is one of the thorniest practices of the Roman Catholic Church. People who are granted annulments are given a whole new lease on life, but for those who are denied an annulment, the news can be devastating. For Catholics, an annulment means that a sacramental marriage never took place. The most common reaction to this is \\"I went to the wedding, what do you mean a marriage never took place?\\" People begin to wonder if an annulment means that children from such unions are illegitimate (no). Others wonder what right the Church has to declare a marriage null, and see the process as judgmental and vindictive. Others believe that annulments are only granted to those willing to pay a hefty price tag. With so much negative press, it is no wonder why so many people find the annulment process intimidating and decide not to pursue having a marriage annulled.Michael Smith Foster, a Catholic priest and canon lawyer who works at the Marriage Tribunal for the Archdiocese of Boston has written a clear, easy to understand book answering the many questions of what an annulment is, and what an annulment is not. The book is published by Paulist Press, and is set up in a question and answer format, like many book released by this publisher. In discussing the annulment process, the author also explains what a Catholic marriage is supposed to be. His style is pastoral and non-threatening. The book is compassionate and hopeful for people who have been hurt by a marriage coming apart.While this book will be most helpful to people going through the annulment process and those who are ministering to them, it will be of interest to any Catholics who want to understand more about this procedure and what the Church truly teaches about marriage."},{"Title":"Annulment, the Wedding That Was: How the Church Can Declare a Marriage Null","review":"I have worked in the field of church law for over 20 years. I have met with over 1000 petitioners who really don't understand the annulment process. All they understand is that they would like to enter into a new marriage and they want to be able to \\"make it right with the church.\\" And, on the other side is their ex-spouse who doesn't understand as well, what is going on when they receive their letter from the tribunal informing them of their ex-spouse's application. What I have begun to do is to send them a copy of this book, in advance of my meeting with them. When that happens, their defenses are down, they understand so much better what is happening and their questions are no longer harassing or attacking. They have such a clearer picture of the process and they are much more able to handle the situation because they have had it explained to them in language that they understand.I would encourage any tribunal to have a number of these books on their shelves, so that when someone appears at their door who is beleaguered, and bewildered, just hand them the book, give them a chance to read it and your worries will be over- they now have a clearer picture of what the process is all about."},{"Title":"Annulment, the Wedding That Was: How the Church Can Declare a Marriage Null","review":"There are so many myths and misunderstandings about annulments that it's great to have a ready resource that is so easy to understand. It answers basic questions on how divorce is viewed by the Church, the issue of a child's legitimacy after an annulment and how an annulment application is processed. It also guides you on what to expect which for me personally has made the process so much less intimidating.I was also reassured that the book had a \\"Nihil Obstat\\" from the Church something that I found lacking in other books on the topic. This means that the Catholic Church confirms and approves that there is nothing incorrect or objectionable in the book. This was important to me as a devout Catholic. I wanted a \\"good seal of approval\\" from the Church to the book's accuracy for my own peace of mind.I highly recommend this book to anyone thinking about getting an annulment and an essential purchase for those who have decided to undertake the process!"},{"Title":"Annulment, the Wedding That Was: How the Church Can Declare a Marriage Null","review":"This is a very well written book with serious information for those who are considering an annulment through the Catholic Church. Fr. Foster is learned and knowledgable about Canon Law, and his website offers you the ability to have his expertise guide you through the annulment process. We were more than pleased with the results. I'm very glad I bought this book and had his help in preparing our annulment. It made things very easy and it became a healing process, not an anxiety ridden one. It was wonderful."},{"Title":"Annulment, the Wedding That Was: How the Church Can Declare a Marriage Null","review":"Father Foster is an expert in the Catholic legal field of annulment. My fiance and I used his consulting services to help with the annulment process and were amazed at his ability to put the legal issues in terms we could understand. He takes this same approach in the book. For both Catholics and non-Catholics alike, Father Foster offers clear, commonsense, and compassionate explanations to help anyone seeking an annulment understand the history and legal basis of the process."},{"Title":"Annulment, the Wedding That Was: How the Church Can Declare a Marriage Null","review":"I was a legally divorced woman looking to begin the process of an annulment in the Catholic Church and found myself scouring the internet for the real \\"truth\\" of what an annulment is and entails. This book opened my eyes to the sacrament of marriage itself, and the Catholic belief and teachings pertaining to declaring a marriage null. This book answered the questions I was afraid to ask, the questions I didn't know I had, and gave me the knowledge I required to begin my annulment process, and continued to give me reassurance during my petition.I would recommend this book to anyone exploring or beginning the annulment process, anyone who wishes to know more about the sacrament of marriage in a Catholic Church, or anyone marrying in the Catholic Church. I wish this was in my pre-Cana courses!Michael Foster's experience with the Church's teaching is ever-present. The question/answer style was particularly helpful and easy to reference. I have to thank the author for arming me with the knowledge I needed to get through this process!"},{"Title":"Annulment, the Wedding That Was: How the Church Can Declare a Marriage Null","review":"And I thought I knew the law. As a recent convert to the Catholic faith, I suddenly realized that my first marriage would have to be annulled. As a lawyer, I thought that a couple of Google searches and a few web sites would supply everything required. Nothing could be further from the truth. Michael Foster's book proved to be the compass that guided me through the process. Working through each chapter, there were times that I thought I was back in law school or at least studying at a bar review course. That's how thorough the author is with each topic and each example.Throughout the entire process I was blessed with a great study guide. The chapters are organized in a logical fashion and I particularly liked the Q & A approach. This is a book for both the novice and the more experienced reader."},{"Title":"Annulment, the Wedding That Was: How the Church Can Declare a Marriage Null","review":"Whose idea was it to take an arcane subject like canon law and turn it into a well written Q&A book? There is so much mystery in the church and this book is a wonderful guide to a subject that is so misunderstood. While I am sure some readers will just want to expand their knowledge, most are going through a very painful process of divorce and now annulment. Kindness and understanding are the subtexts. You will also find yourself saying, \\"Ahhh, now I get it.\\". A must read for any Catholic who has questions about the process...while in the midst of it or just as a way to dip the proverbial toe into the annulment pool. Well done."},{"Title":"Annulment, the Wedding That Was: How the Church Can Declare a Marriage Null","review":"Very well written. A clear concise and no nonsense outline of all the material issues and foundations of the annulment process. I enjoyed it immensely. A must read for all contemplating the process."},{"Title":"Annulment, the Wedding That Was: How the Church Can Declare a Marriage Null","review":"This book was published by the Paulist Press and has a Nihil Obstat, so in theory it should be an accurate presentation of the issues.However, on pages 185-186, on Q. 97, Do declarations of nullity render children illegitimate (not, by the way, included in the index, which refers only to p. 97 for legitimacy and has no entry for illegitimacy at all), it reads:\\"Second, the misappropriation of the term _illegitimate_ indicates a misunderstanding of legitimacy. _Legitimacy_ is a term used by many legal systems throughout the world. The term indicates knowledge of a child's paternity . . . The term _legitimacy_ connotes that a child's father is the husband of the child's mother at the time of conception or birth. In no way could a declaration of nullity deny a child's paternity. At the time of birth, the legally presumed relationship between the child's father and mother was indeed that of husband and wife. A declaration of nullity does not deny this, so the legitimacy of the child cannot be affected.\\"There are major problems here. First of all, \\"legitimacy\\" and \\"known paternity\\" are not the same thing at all. There have, historically, been \\"acknowledged illegitimate children\\" in which a man voluntarily claimed responsibility for a child born out of wedlock. There have been \\"bastardy bonds\\" in which, in the days before blood testing and DNA testing, a court assigned responsibility for the begetting and support of a child to a man. There are, today, numerous paternity suits brought my mothers, social service agencies, and other entities for numerous purposes, ranging from support to obtaining a relinquishing of parental rights for adoption. Paternity is _not_ dependent upon the parents' being married to one another at the time of conception or birth.On p. 185, the author points out that, \\"In Church law a marriage that is declared null is thereafter referred to as a 'putative,' or 'supposed,' marriage. It was a marriage contracted inviolation of an impediment, or with a condition or defective consent, but entered into in good faith on the part of one or both of the contracting parties.\\"Actually, that isn't true either, since elsewhere in the book he points out that it's possible for both parties to a subsequently-annulled marriage to have entered into it in bad faith, but that's a different question. See page 176: \\"The Church is really declaring, in hindsight, that on the day of the wedding specific factors, such as defective consent, problems regarding its legitimate manifestation or the ineligibility of the bride or groom, prevented the two individuals from bringing about a valid marriage--as had been presumed. . . . The tribunal can only declare whether or not it has been proven that the marriage was invalid from the start.\\"The whole point of the above is that a \\"declaration of nullity\\" (a term which the author prefers to \\"annulment\\") declares that in fact the marriage never existed. Some people, possibly including one or both of the \\"putative\\" or \\"supposed\\" spouses, just thought that it did -- but they were mistaken.If the marriage never existed, then the children cannot have been conceived or born in wedlock. The inevitable logical conclusion is that some people, possibly including one or both of their parents, just \\"supposed\\" that they were.The declaration doesn't affect the status of the children under secular law. That's true enough. If there was a valid civil marriage, followed by a valid civil divorce, the children are legitimate for purposes of inheritance, etc. However, the canon law statement that they are \\"legitimate\\" is a purely arbitrary declaration (aimed at outcome, the result that the system wants to achieve, rather than input, the nature of the procedure being carried out).If these two pages are so inaccurate, I become suspicious about the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Adventure Racing, Guide to Survival","review":"This book is written from a mainly Kiwi (New Zealand) perspective, and focusses on the Souther Traverse. It does a pretty good job of explaining the origins of adventure racing, but lacks the bigger, more global reach of today's races. This book is informative, but is still lacking. Like &quot;The Toughest Race on Earth&quot;, this book also lacks in explaining the true training and lifestyle of today's racers."},{"Title":"Adventure Racing, Guide to Survival","review":"This is just the sort of book I was looking for. There is plenty of information for racers at all levels. Newcomers to adventure racing will benefit the most I guess, but the interviews with top racers do give away a few secrets that will help established racers. Steve Gurney's section on skills and techniques will prove very useful and it was fascinating to learn more of the history of the sport.All the advice, whether on training, equipment, medical preparation or nutrition was easy to read, simple, practical and very useful. The full colour pictures are also very good, painting pictures that words can't convey.This is a book that belongs in every adventure racer's library."},{"Title":"Adventure Racing, Guide to Survival","review":"This book would be an excellent choice for those just getting started in adventure racing (AR) or contemplating trying it and intending to do multi-day events. Experienced racers will also find some good tips, but might want to look for a more technical book if they want detailed information. It is a fast read and is well-written."},{"Title":"Buy Your Own Business With Other People's Money","review":"I would recommend a different book. So far, the best one I have read is actually the e-book, \\"How to Buy A Good Business at a Great Price\\".This book lays out basic information for you, but I did not learn anything new.The main premise in this book, is that you need to get the seller financing to pay for 1/3 to 2/3 of the business, then you can finance the balance using business assets as collatoral.Great concept, but nothing new. The second half of this book is forms copied directly from the Internet, mostly SBA 7(a) loan document requirements. Nothing a 2 second google search wouldn't find.I read all the substance of this book in about 45 minutes. Again, NOT recommended, unless you have absolutely no clue at ALL about business finance."},{"Title":"Buy Your Own Business With Other People's Money","review":"I agree with the first reviewer. This book is of value only to someone with absolutely no business experience. It makes its point early, and doesn't bring much else to the table. The basic points are worthwhile, i.e. get professional advice, do your homework, etc. Beyond that, not much."},{"Title":"Mythologies","review":"In this volume you get The Celtic Twilight (1893), 34 Irish stories about the supernatural, where little people, faeries, ghosts (some of them headless) abound; most of them have been collected from the people who remember this old lore, but a few of them, like A Voice, and The Old Town, are from Yeats' own experience.The second part is The Secret Rose (1897), 9 legends that are perhaps my favorite section of this book, with stories like The Wisdom of the King, of a lonely hero who as a baby was given a \\"grey as the mist\\" drop of hawk crone blood, and whose hair was mixed with feathers.Stories of Red Hanrahan (1897 and rewritten in 1907), is the life and death of a wandering poet, \\"the learned man and the great songmaker\\", which includes a number of poems.Rosa Alchemica, Tables of the Law, and The Adoration of the Magi (1897) are on esoteric mysticism; glimpses into heaven and hell.The final part is Per Amica Silentia Lunae (1917), essays on spiritualism, Christianity, poetry and its writers, and more.Written with much beauty by the man many consider to be Ireland's greatest poet (and Nobel Prize for Literature in 1923), this unique collection of tales will enchant anyone interested in Irish history and its legends; legends which will, like the little creatures, last \\"until God shall burn up the world with a kiss\\"."},{"Title":"Mythologies","review":"_Mythologies_ by Irish national poet, William Butler Yeats, is a fascinating collection from the writings of Yeats featuring various stories and legends which reveal Ireland's mythical and spiritual tradition. W. B. Yeats was regarded as Ireland's greatest poet and won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1923. But, Yeats was also an occultist who belonged to the secret society, the Golden Dawn, as well as an Irish nationalist and promoter of the Celtic renaissance. This book is a very interesting collection from his writings featuring tales of Gaelic magic, fairies, demons, curses, banshees, ghosts, and mysticism. It represents an excellent introduction to the writings of Yeats and to his mystical thought.The first section of this book contains extracts from _The Celtic Twilight_, first published in 1893. There are in total forty separate tales presented from _The Celtic Twilight_. These include stories featuring fairies and ghosts and various elements of Irish folklore. Yeats states that most of the tales in this book were told to him by Paddy Flynn, an old Irishman. In particular, Yeats is influenced by the poetry of Dante, as he traces out the role of the afterlife in heaven, hell, and purgatory for souls trapped between the two. Yeats also emphasizes the roles of the Sidhe, fairies, and banshees.The second section of this book contains extracts from _The Secret Rose_ published in 1897 along with _The Stories of Red Hanrahan_ and _Rosa Alchemica_. _The Secret Rose_ contains nine separate chapters, many of them featuring bizarre tales including a tale of crucifixion. _The Stories of Red Hanrahan_, emphasizing a schoolmaster and a mysterious game of cards, rewritten with the help of Lady Gregory in 1907, contains six tales.The next section of the book contains the following parts: _Rosa Alchemica_, _The Tables of the Law_, and _The Adoration of the Magi_, published in 1897. These include discussions of alchemy and the occult as well as Yeats' discussion of Christianity. Finally, the book ends with extracts from _Per Amica Silentia Lunae_, published in 1917. This section includes five chapters. Mention is made of various alchemical and occult traditions including mention of the medieval mystic Joachim of Fiore who proposed three world ages, an Age of the Father, an Age of the Son, and an Age of the Holy Ghost. Throughout these sections the occult development of Yeats can be seen as he deals with various occult figures who further his spiritual understanding.This book provides an excellent introduction to the writings of W. B. Yeats, Irish national poet and occultist. The book contains important extracts from his beautiful writings which serve to illuminate various components of the Irish/Celtic tradition."},{"Title":"Mythologies","review":"W.B Yeats while known best for his poetry wrote Mythologies a wonderfully subtle and atmospheric collection ofshort stories set in Ireland featuring ghost, faeries, and the like. While not graphically horrific by modernstandards, Mythologies captures the soft unexplainable moments that hover over rational human existence...the door down the hall that closes itself, the stranger on the road that never existed, the premonition thatleads to surreal encounter, the power of love to transcend mortality. This is the stuff of Mythologies.

If you're sick and tired of reading about geisha, or if you like geisha but are interested in expanding your horizons and reading about the lives and struggles of other Japanese women who haven't been given a story, you owe it to yourself to read this book.Ayako Ishigaki gives voice in her memoir to post war Japanese women, fighting against the stereotypes and mixed messages sent to them via eastern vs western ideals. What's most intriguing about this is that I can still see this struggle played out today in the way female characters are portrayed in certain manga and anime; it gives a lot of context to modern day stories, and shows just how far Japanese women still have to go to be portrayed as humans and not mere objects of desire/ fetish.Lest you think this story sounds too high brow, never fear: its easy to understand and read on the subway or after a hard day of work. The writing is simple, clean, and flows well. If nothing else, the tidbits of Japanese culture and traditions (post and pre war) and the personal ancedotes of the author interjected in the story will stay with you long after the last page.Enjoy *(^_^)*"},{"Title":"Restless Wave: My Life in Two Worlds","review":"Ayako Ishigaki's wonderful fictionalized memoir is revealing for it's sometimes subtle, sometimes angry, and sometimes tender treatment of the both the culture she was born into and the culture she experienced in the U.S. It's also a remarkable historical document that presents views of Japanese women that may startle the reader. The writing is fluid and engaging. You can read it easily in a day or two."},{"Title":"Brazil Red","review":"If you approach this book expecting high literature, you're going to be disappointed. It is not cerebral and the writing is at time clumsy. But if you enjoy a historical novel full of derring-do and exotic locales, with good guys and bad guys and a forest full of sixteenth-century proto-Brazilians, go ahead. As in all good adventure yarns, the love scenes (except with the treacherous betrayer) provide nothing but a slowing down of the action. I was driven to research the history of \\"la France Antarctique\\" and was introduced to a bit of French history I had never even heard of. I've already passed my copy on to a friend who has reported he's as gripped as I was. And he's a professor of French literature!"},{"Title":"Brazil Red","review":"Rufin's story is great adventure told by a subtlety humorous narrator-no small achievement given the seriousness of Brazil Red's themes.

Because of its child protagonists, Just and Colombe, Brazil Red favorably reminded me of Philip Pullman's The Golden Compass."},{"Title":"Just Above a Whisper (Tucker Mills Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"If you liked the first book, you'll love this one too! There is nothing like sitting down to a good book and simply enjoying the characters and the story the author brings to life. You will find yourself cheering on Reece and Connor as they face the challenges set before them. There is a lot of talk about God and how to find Him and what to do after you do; some might want more story, but if you look at the whole, you see that the town is stuggling with finding it's way to the true light. So many people back then thought you only had to \\"do good and pay your tithe's\\", but it's so much more than that and that is what these characters are finding out.

I had to make myself finish it. There were way too many unnecessary conversations and characters. I'm glad the people are concerned about their spiritual state, but I got extremely bogged down with all the sub characters' Bible studies,thoughts,etc. Is this book about the town people or Reece and Conner? The main couple in the book hardly had any story time for them. Characters who weren't even particular friends/relatives with the main couple had way too much page time. Also, more could have been said about Reece and Conner's personalities. I didn't think they even had a chance to get to know one another very well.

I recently found this book on library loan and researched her at length discovering that she has almost 40 books in print. Although I prefer mystery suspense & intrigue this book is a refreshing break from my norm and I am happy to say that it is a surprisingly enjoyable book filled with Christian idealism, salvation, compassion, good will, romance and of course a story like this would have to have one component of discord. In true form the author gives us a glossary naming the characters in the front of the book. The title of the book is somewhat of a mystery teasing us to believe that it is the injured voice of a love interest or the whisper of GOD.The main plot of the story is the situation of the \\"indentured servant contract\\" initiated on February 29, 1834 ending in February of 1841 with Mr. Thackery having to work to pay off a debt owed to Mr. Zantow a local carpenter & furniture maker. We have to assume that Mr. Thacker & his daughter came to reside in the same house with Mr. Zantow due to their poverty stricken condition since it wasn't made clear in the story. Upon Mr. Thacker's death his beloved daughter Shereese (Reese) V. Thackery assumes the contract & continues to reside & work for Mr. Zantow cleaning, canning, cooking, tending the garden & running errands for him. Mr. Zantow had a drinking problem that scares Reese & she sometimes has to barricade herself in her room for safety. Reese is loved adored among the town's people and everyone is concerned over her plight. Reese is 6 feet tall, red headed, gentle, unassuming, intelligent, compassionate, honorable, trustworthy & diligent at her work. When Mr. Zantow dies suddenly at his work bench Reese's orderly world starts to spin. The inconsiderate condescending bank manager Mr. Victor Jeness doesn't release her contract - he assumes it for the bank and begins to work her like his own personal slave. The townspeople are appalled at the bank manager's behavior and the Pastor Muldoon writes a letter to the founders & owners of the bank for assistance. Soon Conner Kingsley along with his business partner Troy Thaddon show up to inspect the situation. Troy immediately releases Reese's contract and is too appalled at Mr. Jeness' decision to not only retain the contract but only pay her a measly $4.00 a month to live on. Soon, Mr. Jeness disappears. Troy is filled with compassion and good will and hires Reese to cook & clean while he and Conner reside at the Kingsley Mansion. Reese wants to share with the town that GOD has answered her prayers and released her from her contract. Now she boards with the widow Mrs. Greenlow and is happy to have employment in the beautiful Kingsley Mansion. All is well until she actually is introduced to Conner Kingsley. Reese is 6 feet tall red headed, very thin which gives her confidence to stay safe but Conner is 6 feet 6 inches and large in frame mysterious with a raspy whispery voice. Reese is terrified of Conner and not sure that she can maintain her employment. Just when things are starting to settle into some kind of normalcy Mr. Jeness shows up contemplating murder.Find a comfortable spot on the sofa and nestle into the slow moving story of Reese and Conner and the good willed people of Tucker Mills. I however will utilize my Kindle and buy the Trilogy. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Just Above a Whisper (Tucker Mills Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I am a great fan of Lori Wicks novels, this was another great contribution to my collection.Just above a whisper reminds us how God can be seen through all our lives, through all lives circumstances and how his plan is best. I really enjoyed this read and can't wait for the final book!"},{"Title":"Just Above a Whisper (Tucker Mills Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"The book seemed somewhat unrealistic because of the overly exaggerated fear that the main character hads. She seems very weak and scared. I thought it could have been a much shorter book, because it was somewhat slow paced. I usually like Lori Wick books, but this was definitely not one of my favorites. It wasn't a bad book, but I suggest getting a library copy or a used copy from Amazon."},{"Title":"Just Above a Whisper (Tucker Mills Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"While I didn't utterly loathe this novel, I found little to recommend in it. I read the occasional Romance Novel for diversion, and they almost always disappoint on several levels. Since this one is in the \\"inspirational\\" genre, I was hoping for a nice romance with the entertainment value of a historical drama, some romantic tension, and no sleazy sex scenes. What I got was 1) no drama, 2) no tension, and no \\"sex\\" at all... not even a stolen kiss. Somebody please buy this author a copy of \\"What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew...\\", and then perhaps her ensuing endeavors will have even a smidgen of historical flavour. The characters walk around slinging 20th century slang like \\"hi\\", \\"hello\\", and \\"OK\\" (well, the last one appeared in 1838 in reference to Pres. Van Buren, \\"Old Knickerbocker\\", but it wasn't in common usage as an affirmative until WW1). The female lead is referred to as having her hair \\"down her back\\": what?! Is she five years old?! Is she a prostitute?! Believe it or not, this is supposed to be 1839, but I wouldn't have known without reading the blurb on the back of the book. At one point another female character, who is only a few months pregnant, asks her husband, \\"Am I starting to show?\\" Excuse me? This is '39, waistlines are only just starting to come down from just under the bustline and are still very high, surmounting voluminous skirts. Think Little Bo Peep: very Dickens. Unless she's a \\"loose woman\\", she should be wearing stays (a corset), too. She's not going to \\"show\\" until about month eight, at which point she just won't go out in public. But enough on the historical gaffes.Did I mention no sexual tension? Sorry, but I call \\"no way\\". I'm a Christian, Bible thumping believer myself, but I still have hormones. I don't care how chaste a person is, he or she is still going to have some serious \\"feelings\\" when meeting the significant other of their dreams. I'm glad the leads didn't jump on each other ten minutes after meeting, but does it have to be such a yawn festival? Does the author think nobody had \\"the hots\\" in the 19th century?The leads are so tortuously boring that there isn't even a kiss of any kind until after the wedding! Look, people \\"made out\\" in the 19th century, ok? It was done in private (unlike today), but people is people.Perhaps the author thinks that it's \\"Christians\\" or \\"Believers\\" (as she terms us) who are free from sexual temptation. You'd think so, judging from the pompous, stuffed-shirt goody-two-shoes Christians populating this story. We can't go more than a page or so without the entire transcript of somebody's heartfelt prayer or sermonizing to either a fellow believer or seeker. Only a few pages into the first chapter, I was already irritated with the over preachyness of the writing. It's like reading a novelization of a Chick tract, complete with 20th century \\"Church speak\\" guaranteed to befuddle or exasperate anybody outside the \\"Christian ghetto\\". Which begs the question of the target audience for this book. If it's for believers, why all the preaching and salvation messages? If it's for a wider audience, with the hope of presenting the gospel to random readers, the Evangelistic jargon needs to be revised and explained. When somebody says \\"I'm saved by the blood!\\" it probably sounds like a Vampire moment to the uninitiated.A few years ago I read an outstanding \\"Christian\\" romance (sort of) named \\"Pascal's Wager\\". I highly recommend it and would read anything by that author.

Although \\"print books\\" these days have many errors in proofreading, punctuation, spelling, etc., the Kindle versions of ALL of these books is DEPLORABLE. Missing words, misspelled words, terrible punctuation, missing paragraph indicators--the list goes on and on. The wretched result is a product which is virtually unreadable unless you are already familiar with the book and know what it is SUPPOSED to say.I have seen some of the same issues creeping into Kindle books that are brand new on the market as well. I don't want to get free books, or cheap books if they are unreadable, and I don't want to purchase new books for a Kindle (for a price higher than I can buy that book at Costco) that are so badly reproduced.That said, enjoy the story (if you can figure out what it is SUPPOSED to say)."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I am 76 years old and reading is a passion. Since the Kindle I have enjoyed numerous books for free. i grew up on Little Women. Have loved that story in print and in movies for as long as I can remember. June Allyson will always be Jo in my mind and heart. It dawned on me as i was looking through titles that I do not remember Little Men. In fact, for one who grew up reading, and loving it, i do not remember ever reading Little Men. So since it cost me nothing, i decided to download it and give it a try. I was transported back in time to a kinder, gentler, era where characters became family once again and stories became new and at the same time familiar.

But, in a way that is refreshing.I still think that the sacrifice of the toys was slightly funny and I'm still very much impressed by the unique parenting/leadership skills of the now adult Jo and her husband.Without giving away the entire plot, I'll say that it's about a school they run out of their house and it doesn't have a nice neat plotline.Now may I add: This version is amazing, the discussion questions in the back enhanced my reading immensely and I got so much more from the story then I would have. Also the illustartions are lovely. This book (compared to other's from it's era) is very revolutionary, and full of love for all humanity, even if their are: ethnical differences, age differences, wealth differences, and gender differences"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Well, this book always will remain among my favorites, one that touches me and makes me feel. I think that when I was little, I saw a cartoon series about it. At that time, I didnt know that it was based on the novel by Louisa May Alcott. The success of this stories is the wide ranges of characters shown in this book, the spirit, moral conduct, inner strength, and most of all, the splash of fun and careless boyish pranks. THe setting is great, and I like to see how the old characters are developed, as well as the new. Strangely, my favorite character out of all the interesting ones was Dan, Jo's favorite firebrand. I liked how behind his rough nature and blazing dark eyes, and careless attitude, there is gentlenes, courage, and inner strength which Jo gradually brings out of him. And needless to say, Dan is a black sheep that Jo continues to cling on to. Yet, I liked the others as well, including rascal TOmmy, music loving Nat (especially how loyal Dan is to him), tomboy Nan, thoughtful Demi, little and big Teddy, (and Amy, who I am one of those rare people that wanted her to get with Laurie,) and adorable little Bess. All these heartwarming characters create a fire in the story which really warms me up. I've read Jo's Boys, and I like Little Men better because I can feel the spirit of things. Jo's Boys made me feel depressed. SO, this is a great book and surprizingly, the tone was very different from LIttle Women (which I liked greatly) and I just think that the firebrand is the most dashing character in it. He kind of reminds me of Laurie, except in a different, stronger way. Jo's Boys made me sad that all was to an end."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"This book is very heartwarming, and, at times, funny. The characters seem real, and Louisa May Alcott portrayed the girls, Nan and Daisy, very realistically-one a tomboy, one a \\"girl\\". They boys have funny jokes, and we feel Jo's pain after one boy, Dan, runs away. This is an excellent book...get it!"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I read this book 14 years ago and I can still remember how I felt while I was reading it. It was a book that touched my life and changed it in a certain way. I hope my kids will read it someday (when I have some) and that yours do it too because, when you are young, it teaches you kindness, compasion, respect, courage and many other things that we should all have in our lives."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"This is for the Kindle Edition.While I deeply love this story, and recommend it to every child, I suggest you find a different copy. This one is riddled with misspellings, confusingly incorrect pronouns and other typos. Every time there is an italicized passage of song or verse, the preceding paragraph is also italicized. It pains me to give such a wonderful piece of American literature such a bad rating, but I really wanted to warn people away from this copy."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"This sequel toLittle Women (Unabridged Classics)is a favorite classic, and second in the series that ends withJo's Boys. I read all of these books as a child, and the additional Alcott books as well.To satisfy a reading challenge, I have decided to reread some of these old favorites.Little Menwas delightful, highlighting the wonderfully compassionate nature of Jo and her husband, Professor Bhaer, whom she met in Little Women. At the end of that book, Jo's Great-aunt March, the cranky old woman who seemed too demanding at times has left her house (Plumfield) to Jo. Now Jo and Fritz (Professor Bhaer) have opened a school for boys. Most of the boys appear to be troubled or challenged in some way. The story tells us various antics and behaviors exhibited by the boys, and displays how Jo and Fritz deal with these issues.After reading the biographyLouisa May Alcott: The Woman Behind Little Women (John MacRae Books), I could see the parallels between LMA's father's ideals and their methods in dealing with the recalcitrant boys.The book was colorfully illustrated in the edition I reread, and was reminiscent of the book I read as a child.While I would always recommend any Alcott book, I must admit thatLittle Mendid not resonate with me the wayLittle Women (Unabridged Classics)did. Therefore, I must award four stars, while restating that the story was wonderful and brought back those childhood moments."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"If you are worried about the assault on sentimental values and self-reliance by badly churned out crap-4-a-buck, give your sons (and daughters) this book.

Thank you Alcott, I know this family speaks for many."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I read this book to do a critical analysis of it. I enjoyed the stories of the boys and all that went on in their lives. I would recommend this book to any child or young adult that is looking for an interesting and easy read."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"As an old reader, occasionally I wish to reread one of the favorites from years ago. The ancient beloved illustrated classics enjoyed as a child seem to have &quot;stuck with me,&quot; to the to the extent that even now I think of &quot;firebrand Nan&quot; from Little Men, and &quot;grasp the nettle,&quot; as she did. One reviewer mentioned Jo's &quot;maturation;&quot; part of such growth may be the ability to somehow nurture such &quot;firebrands,&quot; without changing their personal character. Jo herself seemed to prefer the un-dependent, untrammelled free spirits among the 'children.'"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"The IndyPublish hardcover edition of this book is very badly typeset--I found several errors within the first chapter alone. There are letters and punctuation missing. Don't get this edition of the book if you don't want to pay $20 for missing letters!"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"There is not that much to say about this brilliantly crafted book, for it is almost too good to describe. I decided to give this book four stars because in some cases she didn't write as enthusiaticly as in her other books. Don't get me wrong though, as a book, it deserves ten stars! As a Louisa May book, only four (out of five that is!) I cannot write to you, reader, too much about the sumery because every chapter was a new scrape or story. But don't worry, everything is connected. Jo March from Little Women now is married and has two boys of her own, plus a few orphans and sons of busy fathers. In Plumfield, boys are every where, including the musical Nat, book worm Demi Brooke, indestructable Tommy, Dan, adorable Teddy, and deticated Rob! But don't forget the three girls: timid Daisy Brooke, Giddy-Gaddy Nan, and the loveable Bess. All share scrapes and adventures that will leave you scandalized. Jo and her husband have a lot in store for them! Plus, a hint of romance at the end. Look for the sequal, Jo's Boys!

It's a great book to read to and discuss with your children.I would have given this review 5 stars instead of 4, except for one flaw. The Kindle version of this book is full of spelling and punctuation errors. Not a big deal for some, but it's just one of those things that bugs me.Then again, at a cost of $.86, I guess I don't really have room to complain. :)"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Little Men was a quick read and a lovely way to continue Jo's story. I didn't think it was nearly as good as Little Women, perhaps because there are more characters and it takes place within a shorter period of time... so there is less development in each character and even more moralizing as each short story within the book has a lesson to be learned!"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I love this book almost as much as Little Women. They just don't write good wholesome books like these classics anymore. Read it and you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"i got this book because i had fallen in love with little women when i read it. I had no expectations for this book, but i enjoyed it sooo much! Its nice to read a wholesome, family orientated book. Its just as awesome as little women, i would say. im looking forward to reading Jo's Boys and finding out what happens to these wonderful children when they grow up!!!! Great read!!!"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I bought this book for my mother and I knew it was good when she could hardly put it down. I asked her to give me her opinion of the story and she told me that it was a wonderful story! The children are so funny and amusing that it was impossible not to get attached to the characters in the book. She would recommend it to anyone, and if I don't read it before hand that after I have children of my own she will give me the book and tell me to read it.She wished she had read it many years ago when I was younger because the examples of how to help little boys to become young men where amazing."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Mention the name Louisa May Alcott, and most people will instantly think of \\"Little Women.\\" But in my mind, the less often discussed \\"Little Men\\" is just as great, if not better.The story picks up shortly after the conclusion of \\"Little Women,\\" with Jo and Frederick Bhaer running a school at Plumfield. Along with their own little Rob and Teddy, they are busy raising the neglected children of rich folks alongside the orphans they have taken in.While the boys exist in a virtual haven for good ol' fashioned fun upon the farmlike Plumfield, Mother and Father Bhaer still manage to teach them moral life lessons along with their classroom exercises.If you enjoy this book, be sure to pick up \\"Jo's Boys,\\" which takes place ten years after \\"Little Men\\" and concludes the boys' stories."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I really enjoyed this book. i don't like to re-read books because i know what will happen, but i did re-read Little Men. Little Women was too boring and not up beat enough for me. Little Men made me laugh and cry. Although Plumfield is almost too perfect, it is a great book for young readers. It's funny for me as a girl to be able to see how boys act sometimes. When I am a mother, i will deinitely read this book to my children."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Little Men is (for those who do not know) a sequel to Little Women. Little Men is a wonderful and enticing book about the main character in the previous book, Jo. Jo and her husband are running a school for boys although there are few exceptions. Most of the book is a about their adventures, and Jo picks up many more people to live and learn at her school, for she is running a boarding school. The book will warm your heart right from the begining and you will read on not stopping even a moment. : )"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"This has been one of the best books I ever read! I have read lots of books by Louisa May Alcott, and this is by far one of the best yet. Old Fashioned Girl and Little Women are also among my favorites.

If you like books of adventure and excitement, then you'll really enjoy this book :)"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Having read it as a child, I would have told you then that it was a good book, but having re-read it now, I'd say it's just &#34;okay&#34;. Reading it, I feel like I'm talking to a mother whose children can do no wrong, though they often do. Sometimes the style of it is annoying and at times the characters unrealistic, and I find myself longing for the more natural tone of Little Women. I honestly think the author had a much greater understanding of women then men, for how she wrote the boys. Even so, I do like the book and would recommend it to anyone who had read Little Women, but not as a standalone piece."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I've been wanting to read this book for quite a while now. Let me say, that it was well worth the wait! Thank you for such a great deal on a really good book."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"If Little Men weren't an entertaining novel, it could serve as a timeless reminder of how adults can help children direct their energies in helpful ways and develop better habits. The philosophy is to provide lots of love, understanding, forgiveness, slack and carefully chosen incentives and guidance while encouraging friendships among youngsters who will balance one another out if they spend time together. You'll recognize lots of Marmee's loving approach in Jo's more rough and tumble perspective. It's a nice combination.For those who loved the child-centered world of Little Women, you'll be entranced by what Jo does to educate and raise her own boys, her nephew and niece, a troublesome neighbor girl, male boarders and some unfortunate orphans.Much of the novel focuses on the character development of two poor orphans, Nat and Dan, who find Jo's Plumfield (which she inherited near the end of Little Women) to be an unfamiliar paradise of a home and school that requires some adjusting to.Although the title is Little Men, there's plenty of focus on Daisy, twin sister to Demi, Nan, an independent girl with lots of energy, and Bess, Amy and Laurie's daughter. There are pretend balls, teas, and dramatic performances that echo those in Little Women.But the male slant that is subdued in Little Women bursts forth in Little Men as the book recounts pranks, brawls, collections of disgusting items, pillow fights, taming a colt and doing heavy chores.Like Little Women, the chapters are really short stories involving the same characters as they progress from month to month.If you haven't read Little Women, by all means start there. An important part of the fun of Little Men is finding out what happened next to Meg, Jo, Amy and Laurie."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I have read Little Men a dozen times over and each time I either find something new...or just love the parts I already read!

I am not 1, but I don't want to share my age"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I read Little Men; the sequel to the classic tale of Little Women. Louisa May Alcott, the author of Little Men, Little Women, Country Cousins, Eight Cousins or the Aunt Hill, and Jo's Boys was born and raised in Concord, Massachusetts, where she did all her writing. As she got older she suffered the loss of her two sisters, both at a young age. In her books she basis her characters on herself and on people she knew, including her three sisters, her mother, and her father. Overall, she had a happy life of writing, though she never got married. Little Men was first published in 1871 by the Nelson Doubleday, Inc. This book is about life at Plumfield; the school Jo Bhaer and her husband Fritz founded. Their school allows boys (and some select girls) from all locks of life into it. Because of this reason it has become well known by many people for its kindness to all. The Bhaers show great love to every child who comes through, including boys from the street, Jo's own nieces and nephews, and her own children. They treat each boy the same and give them their own jobs to do around the farm. In turn, each child learns responsibility, respect, patients, and love at Plumfield, unlike any other school.Plumfield has many residents, but only some are characters in this book Jo Bhaer was the hero in Little Women, who ends up marries the German professor, Fritz Bhaer. She is lively as ever caring for the boys and girls of Plumfield including her own sons Teddy and Rob. Mrs. Bhaer is a gentle, caring woman who loves each child as her own. In turn the boys and girls teach her that not all lessons are learned in the classroom, in fact some are learned and she doesn't even realize it. Fritz Bhaer is a kind German professor who has a very heavy accent. He teaches the children all the regular subjects like math, science, arithmetic, and history. Father Bhaer also teaches lessons on growing crops and cultivating them, taking care of animals, and helps each child on their mishaps. For all these reasons, the boys and girls love Father Bhaer, and help him in any way they can.Nathaniel (Nat) Blake, one of the boys taken off the street and given a second chance at Plumfield. In the beginning he is a weak and sickly boy who is sent to Plumfield by Mr. Laurie, a dear friend of Jo's. When he gets their he does not now how to read or write. Gradually, kindness and determination help Nat to get stronger, less sickly, become a great reader, and an unusually good writer.Tommy Bangs, one of the boys who goes to Plumfield. He is the biggest troublemaker there, but has a kind heart so everyone can't help but love him. Overtime, he becomes less troublesome, and helps out more than anyone expected. Daisy and Demi, Jo's sister's kids also go to Plumfiled. They are very kind to each other and to everyone else. Daisy loves to play with dolls and cook for the residents of the school. Demi is a very smart boy, who listened to every one of his grandfather's stories, as a small boy. He learned a lot of his knowledge from those stories. He does have a downfall though. He loves to read, but he reads action books when he should be reading and studying for school. Father Bhaer breaks this habit quite easily when he finds out.On the street Nat met many people, including a sluggish boy Dan who was nice to him. Dan ends up coming to the school also. He is not the best boy to make friends with, because he makes a lot of trouble. As the book goes on Dan gets cured from these bad ways by Father Bhaer and becomes a very nice, gentle boy. The second female resident of Plumfield is named Nan. She is nothing like Daisy or like most girls. Nan will take dares from anyone and do them, no matter how dangerous they may be! Daisy would love another girl who would play dolls and cook with her. By the end of the book, Daisy persuades Nan to play dolls with her. Nan agrees. After they play dolls Nan starts to be more girlish, but in the end she still does dangerous things.Little Men takes place in the late 1800s in Concord, Massachusetts. At this time slavery was still in the south. The children of Plumfield had all been sent there to board, for one reason or another. Nat and Dan were sent there because they were on the streets. Nan's mother had just died and her father couldn't afford to take proper care of her anymore. Tommy's parents did not want to deal with his pranks. Daisy and Demi wanted to go to the school where their aunt and uncle taught. A boy named Jack Ford was sent there because it was cheap, and there were other reasons for the boys that come later in the book.Little Men starts out when Mr. Laurie (one of Jo's old friends) sees Nat on the streets and sends him to Plumfield, the school run by Jo and Fritz Baher. When the door to Plumfield is answered by Asia the house maid, Nat can't help but stare at all the boys playing on the staircase, floor, and sliding down the banisters. One boy slides down the banister and lands hard on his rear. Nat rushes over to make sure he is all right. The boy says he's fine and introduces himself as Tommy Bangs. Then Mrs. Jo appears. She asks to see Nat by himself. They go into a side room and Mrs. Jo then tells Nat she will be happy to have him at their school.Nat rests the first day and night he is there. The next day is Monday, the first day of school. Fritz Bhaer teaches the boys at school and he treats Nat with special care since Nat can't read or write. Nat does fine his first day. He then knows that he must work hard to please his new family, and he will do it willingly in between chores and play. All the boys were taught but Daisy would not be permitted. As a result, she was not allowed to play football, or other games the boys played. Mrs. Jo felt sorry for the little girl, so, her and Mr. Laurie go and buy a whole kitchen set for her. She adores it, and will cook anything for anyone. The boys get jealous and eventually allow her to play with them, if she cooks special treats for them. Daisy agrees, and once again Plumfield was at peace.In the middle of the book, Nat's \\"dear friend\\" Dan comes for a visit. Nat pleads with Mrs. Bhaer that Dan can stay. She isn't quite sure she trusts Dan, but she agrees that he can stay. Dan ends up bringing trouble to the school by fighting the other boys, smoking tobacco, (which was strictly prohibited by the school), and setting the Plumfield on fire by not putting out his cigarette. Dan is sent to live with another boarding school for bad children like him. Meanwhile, since Dan was sent away, they have an extra bed to spare. Mrs. Jo meets a man in town whose wife has just died and doesn't want to take care of his daughter named Nan anymore. She comes to Plumfield and she fits right in with the boys better than Daisy. Daisy is heartbroken that there is finally another girl at the school, but doesn't want to play dolls and cook. She pleads and pleads with Nan and finally Nan plays with her. Nan finds out that dolls and cooking aren't that bad and she decides to do it with Daisy more often.Nan and Daisy were cooking one day and they had an idea to have a ball. They invited Nat, Tommy, and Demi. The boys agreed to come if there would be food, and of course there would be. The boys get to the ball and everyone starts dancing. Then they sit down to have tea and pastries. When they all sat down Daisy realized that the pastries were missing! Tommy had hidden them and would not tell where he had hidden them. Nan and Daisy became furious, and ran to get Mrs. Jo. When they told her what happened she did not punish the boys. Instead, she, and the girls would not talk to the boys until they said they were sorry. They finally apologized and the girls forgave them. The night after Mrs. Jo had just came back from town and saw a straw hat and a hand sticking out from a hay bale. She gently pushed the hay aside and saw that it was Dan! He had come back! She awoke him softly and he said, \\"Mother Bhaer, I have come home.\\" Those words touched her heart and carried him into Plumfield where he made a full recovery of his broken foot and tiredness.Towards the end of the book, the children of Plumfield go huckleberry picking. Mrs. Jo doesn't want five-year-old Rob to go but Nan pleads that she'll take care of him. Mrs. Jo gives in. All the children are picking berries peacefully, until Nan and Rob say they are going to a secret spot. They go into the woods and loose their way back. Nan starts to panic, for night is coming soon, and Rob starts to cry because he is scared. Thankfully, they are found before a bear found them. Little Bess, Jo's niece comes for a visit and is treated like a little princess by all the boys. There was some peace between them all. While she is there, they put on an end of school year play. This year it is Cinderella. All the children dress up like the characters in the book and put on a magnificent play. Everyone claps and awards flowers to Mrs. Jo. They finish off the book by having a gigantic feast.In the beginning of the book Father Bhaer tells each boy he is a crop that is growing in his garden. At the end of the year, if they are all good and whole Father did a good job furnishing them. As in all plants, the boys had weeds growing that tried to stop the way, and some of them did for a time. Nat told a lie, Jack stole Tommy's money, Tommy hid Daisy's pastries, and Demi read the wrong books at the wrong time. In the end, though there were some weeds, Father Bhaer had a very successful cultivation, and looked forward to new plants next year."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"This is an amazing book that I think everyone should read!if only we were this kind and thoughtful to the people in this life!!"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"This is such a fun book to read.

I recnetly purchased the book so I could find out what happens to the March family. The story begins slowly (even for 19th century literature) and I found myself wondering if Louisa May Alcott actually wrote it-the style seemed so different.

This book was wonderful. It was nearly as good as Little Women (I like Little Women better), and it touched my heart just as deeply as Little Women did. It's so cute! Hehe, well, in my opinion anyway. If you liked Little Women, you should read Little Men. If you thought that Little Women was too girly or feminine, read Little Men. There's not too much femininism (if that is a word) in this book, and it's good to boot, hehe."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Who else would have liked to see the \\"hoyden\\" (read: assertive girl) Nan punch that simpering, girly-girly little twit Bess right in her lisping mouth?"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Little Men, is an average book. The whole story is about all these little orphans. There was Nat, Demi, Tommy, Dan, Franz, Emil, Ted, and little Rob. There was more but the girls are all stupid.

I really think this book is so boring I fell a sleep every 5 minutes. Don't buy this book! If you don't like action and you like all that cute [stuff] read the counterpart, Little Women. Out of a 5 star review system, I'd give this book a 2.definetly not a must read. The only part I liked was the ending.

Now I still get the same joy reading them as I did then."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"It is truly a shame that the highest number of stars you can rate a book is five, because I would give this book a million stars if I could.It is truly one of the two best books I have ever read. (The other off course is Little Women).Little men is a book that can make you both laugh and cry. The morals inside are more useful than any of the ten commandments. Louisa May Alcott has definetly done it again.Without giving away everything, these are some of the reasons why you will enjoy the book:1) You see Jo grow up. She is no longer the wild child who's impetuous and androgynous character often lead her to trouble. She inherits maternal qualities that you never expected Jo to have.2) You will get more insight on the professor. Although I truly wanted Teddy and Jo to get together, this book made me think otherwise. Professor Bhaer, with Jo's help, makes a delightful father to the boys. He is the one you will get most of the life morals from.3) The boys in Plumfield are definetly the key figures in the book. They create both the mischievious and melancholy stories. As I said, 'you'll laugh and cry'. Reading about these boys will make everyone reflect on their own lives.4) Teddy grows up too. If you enjoyed the young scandulous Teddy, you'll enjoy the new one even more. In little men, Teddy (like Jo) has grown into a real mature father.There are plenty more exciting things in the book. It is truly a classic masterpiece recommended to anyone who needs a lift in their spirit."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"While Little Men is not up to the literary achievement of Little Women, it is a wonderful tale for kids. It is JUST perfect for reading chapter by chapter to kids as part of an evening family night. It is as jolly as a house full of rambunctious boys could be.Jo Bhaer, nee March, has boys of her own now and boys to spare. She and the Professor take in students based on charity and kindness. Some boys are neglected, some are badly brought up, all need love, laughter and a caring environment. Plumfield is all that and more.The jolly goings-on make you wish you could have gone to school and lived at Plumfield. The book is prevented from being saccharine by the all-too-familiar themes of neglected kids, growing pains and the sad and much too early death of a favorite character from Little Women.There is lots of fun, and lots to discuss in this sequel to Alcott's marvelous Little Women. Lest you think boys won't like Alcott, I know more than one man who loves Little Women even as an adult."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Little Men is (for those who do not know) a sequel to Little Women. Little Men is a wonderful and enticing book about the main character in the previous book, Jo. Jo and her husband are running a school for boys although there are few exceptions. Most of the book is a about their adventures, and Jo picks up many more people to live and learn at her school, for she is running a boarding school. The book will warm your heart right from the begining and you will read on not stopping even a moment. : )"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Please note, this is and has always been, one of my favorite stories. I am not reviewing the story Little Men, but the way it was published by IndiePublish. I would give the story 5 stars, but this presentation only two.On the bright side, the cloth binding appears very well done and should last quite a while.Unfortunately, the publisher chose to reformat all the paragraphs in the text so that like this review all margins are left justified and a blank line separates the paragraphs. If it were done well, it might have worked ok, but it was done very clumsily with the completion of a sentence often being separated from the rest of the paragraph. (I have a suspicion that the reformatting of an original text was done by using a Find-Replace function of a word processor and not checked by an editor.) This makes for some awkward readings, and probably not something I would want to put into the hands of a child.Also the text was not proofed for typos or other simple errors in punctuation, and there are some places where I could not tell what the original sentence was intended to say. Again, I expect that the only proofing done on this version was by a spellchecker and a lot of simple mistakes entered into the publication.I wish to repeat, that I love this story and have since I was a boy, and would recommend the story to any child, but would not recomment this particular volume."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I really loved this book! I got so caught up in the lives of Nan, Daisy, Nat, Dan, Demi and all the other wonderful characters in this book. I found myself wishing that Plumfield existed, such a wonderful school. If Plumflied did exist I would go there in a heart beat. This is a must read for anyone, especially if you are feeling that most books these days don't satisfy you. I highly recomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Little Men was a very well written book. It had many fun adventures, great characters, great dialog, and all in all it was an awesome book.I loved the way the author wrote the little children's voices just right!! It just made me have to stop and laugh!When you read this book it is not like reading, it is like watching a movie!! That is how well written this book really is!! You could even see the house and the rooms!! I know what every room looks like and how to get there!I could see the boy's foot when he hurt it and I could see his face when the doctor had to fix it.I love this book!! It is not a girly book like I thought it would be. In fact it is quite a boy book!! A boy or a girl could read this book and really enjoy it!!I would recommend this book for ages 12 and up.By Seth Courtney Age 13 Grade 7"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"&quot;Little Men&quot; was one of my childhood favorites (I found &quot;Little Women&quot; too sad), and I was pleased to find on rereading it that it's almost as much fun for me now as it was when I was ten. Loosely plotted, it's a good bedtime book, because each chapter or couple of chapters presents a complete vignette. After all, you don't always want to be reading a book that keeps you up till all hours! Life at Plumfield is almost idyllic, with just enough conflict to keep things moving along. When I was a child, I longed for a museum like theirs, and a miniature cast-iron stove, and all kinds of things--the book was wonderful for my imagination. N.B.: I tried reading it to my boys, and even though it's about boys, they were bored, so it may be a girl book."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"This is the continuation of Little Women, and Jo's Boys will be the cont. of this book. Little Men is a book about the boys and girls of all ages, and if you thought little women was much about women, READ THIS BOOK. The boys are all different ages. There is musical Nat, bookworm Demi, troublesome Tommy, fireband Dan(my fav't character), resonsible Franz, commodore Emil, Little Ted, Rob...and dont forget girls, Lovely Daisy, ms.giddy gaddy Nan, and pretty Bess....and so many other characters. They just will not be friends, but a great big FAMILY. They will be happy, sad, confused, angry...at each other, but will not be a problem for Mr.&amp;Mrs. Bhaer(Jo), Mr.&amp;Mrs. Brooke(Meg), and Mr.and Mrs. Laurence(laurie&amp;Amy). These young men and women will be so different, yet so together and close!"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"This sequel to \\"Little Women\\" continues the heart warming saga of the March family girls. It follows events in their lives as married women, and the lives of their children. This book seems to be more popular with boy readers than \\"Little Women\\", which often appeals to girls between the ages of 11-15 (depending on their individual reading level). Perhaps this is linked to the fact that there are more main characters who are boys in \\"Little Men\\". The innocent quality of romance and adventure in this plot, as well as the emphasis on morality and family relationships, make this a good gift for those concerned about the types of literature their children are reading. Adults buying this for children should note that the moral aspects of the story generally reinforce 19th century Protestant Christian values (its your choice whether that impacts your purchase or not!).This is another book that has continued to be my favorite 20 years after reading it for the first time."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I really liked this book because it was really exciting and fun all at the same time! I mean, the characters in the book were just so fun to be with and when you are reading the book, it almost seems like you are there with them.

I had to read it for a class project and this book was a snooze. Now I know everyone who did enjoy this book is probably wanting to rip my eyeballs out of my head, but I wanted to give my opinion. I hated this book so much I never wanted to reopen it, I couldn't help put it down. It took me weeks to read this book when it usually only takes me 2 days to read a book. The book had really no plot, it rambled on and it felt like a huge run on sentence. There was a few good parts and when I started to get excited and then it made me want to throw it across the room."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I really liked this book.

However, there are twelve boys and two girls. The author takes you through six months of the year with the children. People will laugh at their antics and in the same token will be touched by the love and respect with which they treat each other. Each child has his or her obsticals to overcome and each has their own good points. The author makes you feel as if you are in the school with them the entire time. The reader will be drawn into their world and wish he or she were really there. This is an overall great book and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"The magic of youth is captured here in all its transitory and fleeting beauty and turmoil. An idyllic home in the country side is the setting for this classic that you have to read if you're between the ages of 8 and 14."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"When a self-assured young tomboy grows up in a male-dominated society during the 1800s, she then makes up for it by becoming a cheery but eccentric &quot;Mother Goose&quot; running a broading school for young male heirs. There are many really wonderful sequences in this story, though it doesn't really have much of a plotline. In fact, there are even some very creative and uncannily modern methods of parenting to drill the boys (yes, there are a few girls present, too) into well-meaning gentlemen one day. A do-gooder's fantasy that really gushes with sappy maternal cooing and fussing at times, but overall it's a very remarkable book ever written by a proper lady of the Victorian era."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Mostly I got this book because I never owned it and do own Little Women and Jo's Boys.I want my daughter to have the trilogy.I thought it was terrible.A mere series of goody-goody character sketches with very little holding it all together. If anything, it just underscored how Jo should have accepted Teddy! They were a great pair.I did not care about these boys much and even had trouble distinguishing them from one another.Jo's Boys was much better--at least a novel, so read Little Men only to fill in the blanks."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Little Men is the funniest of all the three books. I like this book, but not as much as the Jo's Boys or Little Women. Little Men begins with 'Nat as the 1st ch. If you have seen the movie and think it is great, wait till you read the book. The novel is much more sophisticated and very touching. The movie basically concentrates on Nat and Dan, but the novel is about every single boy and girl. If you've seen the movie and didnt like it, guess what, try the novel! My fav't characters are everybody. Old Chirper(Nat), Dan, Demi, Daisy, Tommy, Franz, Commodore(Emil), Nan, Princess(Bess), little Ted, Rob, Jack..too many people. If you like the story of boys and girls, this is one of the books to read. If this is the Alcott's 1st book you've read, TRY ALL! ALCOTT IS THE BEST! My fav't part is the LITTLE COOKSTOVE(iron). Its so neat, and how Daisy, Nat, Demi, Dan, Emil, Tommy, and dont forget our Teddy, and Rob, standing up for each others."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"This book is a follow up on the wonderful book (that I love) Little women.

This novel is simple with its man against himself conflict, yet sweet, and a reminder of the trials and tribulations of growing up. You have no choice but to feel compassion for the boys and girls of Jo's house, and the innocent that they maintain throughout the book. After having read three books by the above authour, I am eagerly about to devour another as Alcott continually supplies the reader with innovative, and intriguing emotions, faces, and experiences."},{"Title":"Kentucky's Last Cavalier: General William Preston, 1816-1887","review":"I enjoyed it immensely. Beautiful cover picture on this, nice sized text, elaborate notes, full bibliography and index. All in all, a great read, thoroughly researched.One place that the author should have researched is in the court records in the Archives in Frankfort. Sehlinger mentions Preston's participation in protecting minorities during the Bloody Monday riots, but he makes no mention of Preston's being cornered by a mob, of him pulling a gun and looking around as if wondering which thug to shoot first and saying, &quot;Have I no friends here?&quot;&quot;Yes, you have,&quot; said a voice from behind him, and Joshua Speed, Abraham Lincoln's great friend, came forward with a pistol. Together they faced down the mob, but Preston was afterwards arrested and tried for having an illegal firearm at the polls. The account of this trial, too, is interesting.Also there were other court cases and duels, fights, etc., which Preston participated in which are not mentioned in the biography. His testimony, and his everyday record as a lawyer, can be had by going through these Circuit and Criminal court cases, and would have made an interesting facet of the man's biography.But the author uncovered much that I have not seen in print elsewhere, and he has organized and written it up here in a professional way. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Union Cavalry in the Civil War, Volumes I, II & III","review":"Excerpt from the inside flap of dust jacket:Starr covers in three volumes the dramatic story of the Union Cavalry from its prewar roots through four years of growing stature and effectiveness.In the first volume Starr presents briefly the story of the United States cavalry prior to the Civil War. In succeeding chapters he describes how the Union cavalry was raised, organized, equipped, and trained. The first years of the war proved the Union Calvary was, at first no match for its Confederate counterpart. Northerners joined the cavalry mainly because the glamor surrounding the dashing soldier on horseback. The main highlights of the volume is the battles Peninsula, Shenandoah Valley/Second Bull Run, Lee's invasion and Gettysburg to name a few.Volume II - The War in the East From Gettysburg to Appomattox (1863-1865)This volume follows the role of the cavalry in the early Sheridan engagements in Shenandoah Valley and the cavalry march from Winchester, Virginia, to rejoin the army of Potomac in March 1865.Volume III - The war in the West (1861-1865) This volume provides accounts of the Calvary's role in Vicksburg Campaign, the conquest of central Tennessee, Sherman Atlanta Campaign, the March to the Sea, and the campaign in the Carolinas."},{"Title":"Tyranny on trial;: The evidence at Nuremberg","review":"Excellent condition for used book.

The story of his and his wife's (Ava Astaire McKenzie's) move from Beverly Hills to rural Ireland is told so entertainingly the book became my noontime treat. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Turn Left at the Black Cow: One Family's Journey from Beverly Hills to Ireland","review":"I have read this book several times and recently got on Amazon to order several copies for Christmas presents. This book, while it discusses Fred Astaire, is actually the love story of his daughter and her husband, their journey to leave Hollywood behind by buying a cottage in Ireland and the many joyous and wonderful stories that come from that move. This is not a Fred Astaire biography by any means--but rather a touching, often hilarious story of one family, their adventures in setting up house in a culture different from their own and their personal journey with each other. It remains one of our family favorites and I would highly recommend it to anyone with their own sense of adventure."},{"Title":"Turn Left at the Black Cow: One Family's Journey from Beverly Hills to Ireland","review":"I stumbled upon this book searching for books about Fred Astaire and was so glad that I found it. Richard McKenzie has such a good eye for people. I loved the stories about his neighbors in Ireland as well as the unique insight into Fred Astaire. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Turn Left at the Black Cow: One Family's Journey from Beverly Hills to Ireland","review":"There are many remarkable qualities to this book, chief among them the wonderful people that inhabit it. With an engaging, almost poetic style, we are invited into a world of personal impressions and happenings that are both deft and trenchant. This is a universe that contains the likes of David Niven, Barbara Stanwyck, Hermes Pan along with the likes of Kevin O'Mahoney and countless neighbors and un-famous friends--all remembered with a discerning wit and a loving appreciation. You have to love a book that shares insights about Hollywood royalty AND the personalities of cats and cows and other assorted creatures dear to the author and his family. It is full of grace, as you might imagine, humor that might not, and a heart that will always envelope you. For my money, it's a family I'd love to be a part of--if only to meet a woman who dries her garden-fresh lettuce in the spin-cycle of her washing machine! There are many such gifts along this singular journey."},{"Title":"Turn Left at the Black Cow: One Family's Journey from Beverly Hills to Ireland","review":"Turn Left at the Black Cow offers Fred Astaire fans some wonderful anecdotes, as the legendary dancer visits his daughter and her husband in Ireland. However, author McKenzie's constant name dropping and continuous negative comments about Fred's second wife wear thin. Worth a look, but feel free to skim."},{"Title":"Turn Left at the Black Cow: One Family's Journey from Beverly Hills to Ireland","review":"If you read this for tidbits about Fred Astaire, that's all you get are tidbits. If you read it seeking the feeling of Ireland, there are some nice descriptive moments in the book. Mostly it focuses on the author whose life and celebrity contacts did not make up for my disappointment in the skimpiness on Astaire and Ireland.I recommend instead titles by Niall Williams or reread Frank McCourt."},{"Title":"Hawking God: A Young Jewish Woman's Ordeal in Jews for Jesus","review":"This very personal account of nice-Jewish-girl Ellen's years as a missionary in Jews for Jesus reveals the power, control, and decpetion that can be found in such groups, and the difficulty in breaking away. Kamentsky's writing is balanced while remaining honest and self-revealing. For anyone who deals with cults, cult-like groups, and invasive religious missioniaries &quot;saving&quot; Jewish souls, this quick read is well-worth seeking out in a used copy or at a library and then sharing with parents, teenagers, clergy, and friends. Ultimately, her story is an inspiring one of her family's love and the finding of a faith."},{"Title":"Hawking God: A Young Jewish Woman's Ordeal in Jews for Jesus","review":"As a Jewish person active in Zionism and Anti Missionary efforts, I quite enjoyed this book.

Six years ago I prayed to receive Jesus as my Lord and savior. Today I would not make that decision. As a Jew, I do not believe in Jesus and have no desire to be part of Jews for Jesus. This is the story of how despite those feelings I accepted Christ. The good news is that today I am free from Jews for Jesus and have a satisfying life. The tragedy is that many talented, young people remain trapped in destructive religious organizations and cults.\\"Here are some quotations from the book:\\"Months later my friend Stacy was severely disciplined for a minor misdemeanor... Already brainwashed, I did not even question Stacy's treatment. I had lost my capacity for reflective thought and critical thinking. We had to be reliable soldiers...\\" (Pg. 58)\\"We thought God was using our foolishness to win souls for Christ. We envisioned the walls of Hell crashing down about us and believed we were winning L.A. for the Lord.\\" (Pg. 83)\\"Explaining and understanding how I believed in Jesus and still called myself a Jew is impossible.

They were not interested; they were angry.\\" (Pg. 123)\\"Beneath my Jewish face and cartoonish tracts, beneath my desire to convert Jews was the message that it's not O.K. to be Jewish.

It is surprising to me that anyone would get involved in such an idiotic cult, but I think it takes a certain kind of person to be so deprived personally as to join any sort of cult.Her story would only be interesting to anyone who has been approached by a cult, and having volunteered at an Outreach Center for people who were involved in such religious cults, I can tell you it does go on and damages a lot of people. Some come out in need of psychiatric treatment, because of the threats of their future trip into hell. Like any cult, they are indoctrinated, watched, their schedules made up for them. No rest, decisions made for them, no independence from dawn till dusk. If they are there for a while, they get paid to be leaders. These cults are not religious, they are businesses. No question about it.There is, on the Internet many more stories about such events at a website called Ex-Jews for Jesus.

The review on the home page gives you the outline of this story, but it doesn't let you in on the secret of Victoria Holt's writing. It is superb. I love all of her books. She is so 'easy' to read. Her characters are 'real'. I loved the relationship portrayed between Rosetta & Kate. And, Victoria Holt doesn't scoop to writing romantic 'dribble' like a lot of other romance/gothic romance writers.If you haven't tried her before this is as good as any of her books to start with.Please give it a try.

And once that end of the story is over, it never gets brought up again. I'm not sure I expected somebody to follow her, but I did feel there would be some point to that part of the story. It just seems as if the main plot on it's own just wasn't good enough. Well funnily enough in the end the whole story just isn't good enough either."},{"Title":"Relativity For The Layman","review":"The author does a respectable job of providing an overview of Einstein's theories of Special and General Relativity for lay people with minimal background (say, high school regents level) in math, physics and astronomy.The author also provides some of the historical theories and experiments that led to Einstein's breakthrough, and some of the subsequent tests that were done to verify them.Some of the material touched on:* Experiments by Roemer, Bradley, Fizeau and Michelson to measure the speed of light with ever increasing accuracy.* The rise of the Theory of Lumeniferous Ether, and how it was eventually disproved.* Einstein's Special theory of Relativity, and some of the predictive deductions & consequences that resulted from it (contraction of observed length, increase in mass and dilation of time with large relative velocities, the equivalence between mass and energy, etc.)* Einstein's General theory of Relativity, and some of the predictive deductions & consequences that resulted from it: such as a more profound theory of gravitation that surpassed Newton's (by identifying how rotation/precession of elliptical orbits is explained by relativistic changes in mass with velocity); the postulation that gravity affects both light (re: gravitational lensing) and time (re: Einsteinian relativistic shift, separate and apart from Doppler shifting), and the possibility that our universe might be a finite and unbound one.The author also included some amusing hand-drawn diagrams to illustrate some of the more salient aspects of relativistic distortion on bodies moving in space.NITS:1) Through no fault of the author, the passage of time has left this book a bit dated. Astronomy, astrophysics and quantum physics, have proceeded apace since this book was written in the Mid-late 1950's.2) This is a small nit, but the author's drawing skills are comparable to a 5 yr old. I followed his discussions ok, but I couldn't help but roll my eyes at his hand-drawn figures. He could, and should, have had someone draw them better.3) It would have been nice of the book included an index of equations - he repeatedly referred to equations by number, without providing a page reference or a convenient consolidated reference page ... that's something an editor should have caught and resolved.4) When listing equations, he routinely omitted the units of measure for each component, which was mildly irritating.Bottom line: I liked the book. Covering such material, and its historical evolution, in a mere 124 pages, was no mean feat, but at times the author aimed a little too low, with both the level of detail of his mathematical examples and especially with the quality of his drawings, and time has left the book a bit dated. Other authors (such as Brian Greene) have since covered the same material with a bit more depth, finesse, and panache, and include more recent scientific advances). If you see a used copy, it's definitely worth a read, but otherwise I'd suggest something by Greene."},{"Title":"The Solitary Horseman","review":"This is one of my favorite of Emilie Loring's books. Written during the first half of the twentieth century, her books charmingly and authentically capture the flavor of their periods. This story tells of Anthony, a young man who in the excess of drink, crashes into and kills another young man who was his mother's main support. Anthony offers to take his place, which also means becoming a brother to the little girl, and managing the family's commercial orchard. The romance that develops years later is enhanced by the courage and dedication to his promise that he has shown. The romantic episodes are delightful and poetic, and never vulgar. Emilie's books (the ones SHE wrote before she died in 1950), are always clean, and include a mystery along with the romance, with interesting characters and lively dialogue."},{"Title":"The Solitary Horseman","review":"When reading an Emilie Loring book, one thing will always stand out: virtue. Lots of it. And that overflows from one of her better romance/suspense works, \\"The Solitary Horseman\\" -- tight plot and likable characters, although the romantic interest gets a bit squirmy at times.Ten years ago, a drunk Anthony Hamilton accidently killed David Grahame in a car accident; when he meets David's widowed mother, he pledges to help and support her family, as if he were her own son. Now their orchard business is flourishing, and Tony's trust fund has let his \\"sister\\" Rose tour the world. Now she's back, newly sophisticated and ready to spend time with her beloved mom and \\"brother.\\"But her homecoming isn't exactly idyllic. Tony's rich family is trying to draw him back to them, and someone is sabotaging the orchards -- or are they trying to get revenge for Tony's methods? Things come to a head when Rose takes a part in local politics, which places her right in the middle of danger.Emilie Loring was known for many years for fluffy, squeaky-clean romance novels, usually with a bit of suspense or crime thrown in. This one is a bit different, because of the romantic attraction between Tony and Rose. Okay, they're not related. But they act in all other ways like Claire's children, which makes their involvement seem rather odd.Otherwise, the idea of a young man trying to atone for a drunken driving accident by \\"filling the gap\\" is an intriguing one. And Loring handles this in a surprisingly delicate way. As the plot unfolds, we also get a look at the wealthy, emotionally cold Hamiltons and the warm, friendly Grahames, and understand why Tony was miserable and drunk before. She's especially good in the more suspenseful moments, whether it's kidnapping or vandalism.This being a romantic story, there's also some rivalry going on -- more than one guy is interested in Rose, including Tony's brother. And Tony has a creepy fiancee whom he's trying to dump. But there's never any doubt how things are going to turn out in this story -- while the finale is predictable from page ten, it's intriguing to see it in action.Though the relationship between Rose and Tony is a bit odd, but \\"Solitary Horseman\\" is otherwise a charming, sometimes suspenseful story."},{"Title":"A Woman's Heart","review":"Very good book enjoyed reading it. The whole series was a fun relaxing read. Loved the people and the places. So far i have not found even one book of Ms Ross I have not enjoyed."},{"Title":"A Woman's Heart","review":"Nora Fitzpatrick worries about the future of her family. She is the widowed mother of one child while raising her three siblings. Her widowed father is a noted storyteller gifted with a touch of the blarney, but he is useless when it comes to helping with the four children. Nora hopes that renting rooms to tourists will supplement her income so that the family can continue to live in the Castleough, Ireland, the home of the legendary Lady of the Lake.American Horror writer Quinn Gallagher is the first paying guest of the Fitzpatrick family. He is visiting Ireland for the first time, a screen writer insuring that a horror film based on his current bestseller is properly adapted to the screen. When Quinn meets Nora, the attraction is felt throughout the Emerald Isle, but neither one wants to encourage it. However, with her family and the Lady in the Lake pushing it, love blossoms between the pair. Now, if both of them can overcome their past, a longtime relationship is theirs for the taking.A WOMAN'S HEART is an exciting romance that blends elements from legends within a contemporary story line to produce a brilliant novel. The lead protagonists are charming and the support cast adds much depth to a moving and interesting book. Jo Ann Ross presents her readers with a bouquet of four leaf clovers.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Woman's Heart","review":"I truly liked the story. Romance, humor and Irish ambiance in quite a balanced mix. However, I could not help noticing the similarities of the plot to Nora Robert's &quot;Born in Ice&quot;: a bestselling American novelist with a histoy of abuse as a child rents a room on a farm in rural Ireland, near Galway. The landlady is shy at the beginning but manages to secure the skeptic novelist's heart by the time he is supposed to leave for home. I repeat, I liked Ross's story fine, but would have appreciated a more &quot;original&quot; storyline better. By the way, Robert's books is superb."},{"Title":"A Woman's Heart","review":"Joann Ross brings the reader to the Ireland countryside in this story of magic and love. Bringing together a jaded author and a woman who has known too much loss in her life, Ross will hold the reader enthralled in this tale of love.Quinn Gallager has come to Ireland where he hopes to bring his book about an ancient Ireland legend, The Lady, to the big screen. He never expects to meet a character he created in the flesh. Ever since writing about the widowed mother, he has not been able to forget her, even though he knows she is pure fantasy. When he meets Nora Fitzpatrick, he realizes that she is his fantasy come to life. As Quinn finds himself falling for Nora, he reminds himself of his roots, which include an alcholic mother and a drunk and violent father. He convinces himself that he is not good enough for Nora and her family and nor will he ever be. What he doesn't count on is the goodness and magic of Nora and her family.Nora Fitzpatrick is a widow who has convinced herself in the five years since her husband was killed that she had a picture perfect marriage. Meeting Quinn Gallager makes her take a second look at her life and her marriage and what she finds is less than perfect. Always the caretaker of her family, Nora decides that it is time to take care of herself and gives herself up to the love she feels for Quinn.The story of Quinn and Nora is truly magical, reminding the reader of Nora Roberts Irish trilogy. I truly enjoyed this book and believe that if you like love stories, this one is a definite book to pick up."},{"Title":"A Woman's Heart","review":"This prequel to Ross' best book, Legends Lake, explores the wonderful relationship between novelist/filmmaker Quinn Gallagher and shy, winsome widow Nora Fitzpatrick. We met these people in Legends Lake, so we already know the ending, but finding out how they got there is a real summer treat.Back to the west coast of Ireland we go, back to the rural Castlebrough, where Nora, having lost her young husband years before in a racing accident, is raising not only their young son Rory, but her own siblings and, in a manner of speaking, her father, who is loveable but who has never grown up.Nora has her hands full, and finances are extremely shaky. That's what prompts her to reluctantly rent a room in her house to one of the &quot;movie people&quot; who have arrived en masse from Hollywood to make one of Quinn's books into a film. It is Quinn who rents the room. Enough said?In the dog days of August, when the leaves are already looking melancholy and the heat is oppressive, this is the quintessential lie-down-in-a-hammock soother. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"A Woman's Heart","review":"This is probably a 4 star rating. It was difficult for me to decide if it deserved four or five stars. For some reason, about halfway through the book, I put A Woman's Heart down for about a month. I don't usually do this - if I don't like it, I skim it to the end. However, once I began reading this again, within a few pages, I was in love with the hero and thought the heroine was pretty terrific as well. It did have a couple of overused romance plot lines appear but they disappeared fairly quickly. I can only presume that the story had become a little repetitive and slow as I neared the middle of the book and felt I needed a break. That is the reason I am not giving this a five star rating although the romantic leads had what it took for a top rated relationship.Quinn Gallagher, an American with Irish roots, is a famous author and has come to Ireland with a motion picture cast and crew to assist in making a movie based on one of his renowned novels. Quinn is a hero we love with his wit, good looks, totally cool personality and fame. Accommodations are hard to find in this part of Ireland and Quinn ends up taking a room at the home of an extended Irish family who has family values and love as Quinn has never seen before. A young widow and mother of a very dear six-year-old son heads the family that also includes the widow's father, her grandmother, two of her sisters and her brother. Quinn is quite a cynical guy and can hardly believe the family interaction he sees and can scarcely bear the intimacy these people share. In fact, he avoids the domestic gatherings (he was supposed to eat his meals with the family) after first experiencing this eye-opening, honestly true-life family. You see, Quinn is a very intelligent man and has a deep understanding about life until it comes to truly knowing himself and the possibility of his involvement in a real family.Nora Fitzpatrick, the young Irish widow, is very likable as the heroine. She is self-sacrificing as we so often see in romance writing but she is not depicted as overly sweet which is the usual tendency in writing heroines in this role. Nora is hard working and even does chores on their farm such as milk the cows. On top of all this, she is a real lady, kind, and compassionate. The contrast between Nora's constant manual farm and cooking chores and her depiction as an ever present beauty seems a stretch at times but we can only assume that this is beauty as seen in the eye of the beholder, that being Quinn, as he sees much more in Nora than her beauty.Quinn and Nora are instantly drawn to each other. They refuse to acknowledge this although Quinn is a lot more determined to resist the attraction than Nora is. Gradually, Quinn can no longer resist the allure of Nora and her precious family and becomes involved in all of their lives. He showers them with gifts (he is a rich hero as well) and begins to believe in the prospect of a more fulfilling life than he had ever imagined. But this is romance reading, and never is anything as easy as that and Quinn and Nora have some mountains to climb. But the journeys they must take make the story that much better and leave you with a smile as you experience a sense of well-being and peacefulness.The chemistry between Quinn and Nora jumps off the page from the very beginning. The sensual scenes are very tender and rate about a 3.5 out of 5.0 (see More About Me for rating guidelines). I think one of the most remarkable things about this book is the tenderness of Quinn and Nora's relationship further blessed by Quinn's bond with her family.I highly recommend A Woman's Heart. Although it is primarily a sweet and sexy romance, it is also a strong story of family values and bonding. Since this is my first JoAnn Ross book, I have done some research and have discovered that she has many more delightful books for me to read."},{"Title":"A Woman's Heart","review":"Copyright 1998 All Rights reserved CompuServe Romance Reviews ( 75150,1665)A WOMAN'S HEART by JoAnn Ross MIRA July 98 releaseTake a trip to fascinating Ireland, courtesy of JoAnn Ross. See this beautiful country with its rolling green hills and sparkling blue lakes. Smell the fresh sea air and peat bogs. Meet the charming people, feel their pride and anguish, and hear their lilting brogues as they recount exciting myths and adventures passed on for generations. Writer Quinn Gallagher rents a room from Nora Fitzpatrick to be near the shooting location of a film from his book about the local sea creature. He moves into her home, her family and especially, her heart. But Quinn is a man who embraces the monsters that are as much a part of him as The Lady of The Lake is a part of Castlelough - alcoholic, abusive parents - and fears it's too dangerous for him to get close to any woman. Just as the legendary _lough beastie_ hides beneath the dark waters of Castle Lough, Quinn hides his emotions in the dark depths of his heart. But Nora, having grown up with the lake serpent as a part of her life, has learned to look inside all monsters without fear and see them for what they really are. If only she can convince Quinn to live with his demons and not fear them, they can embrace the future together. JoAnn Ross's writing is as fresh as sea mist. Whether she is the voice of a lonely five year old boy, an ancient sea creature, a selfless, independent heroine, a troubled, haunted hero, or a charming leprechaun-like storyteller, she speaks directly to our hearts. A WOMAN'S HEART is a story of miracles, monsters, and magic that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and long to be held.

The JST provides quick development solutions to get your EJBs, Servlets, Web Services, etc developed quickly and deployed to the application server of your choice. I thought the book did a great job of walking through the wizards for creating the different types of J2EE projects.If you are looking for a book to provide in depth discussions on what EJBs, Servlets, Web Services, Entity Beans, JSPs, etc. are, then this is not for you. But if you already have a J2EE background and would like use the Eclipse IDE to develop your components, then I would recommend this book. My only complaint about the book is that it did not provide any discussion on how to version control your components. For example, if you create a WAR File for a web application that you want to package inside an EAR file, do you version control both the WAR and the EAR as separate projects? It seems that projects under version control would get messy if you have to version control every EJB and Web Application as a separate project."},{"Title":"Pro Eclipse JST: Plug-ins for J2EE Development","review":"The authors address both J2EE 1.4 and the Eclipse toolkits and plugins, focusing on the capabilities the IDE provides J2EE developers.

While the author suggests that his text is just as applicable to stocks, his entire focus is on currency (forex) trading. He spends a great deal of the book explaining the software of his favorite forex game platform (which turns out to be irrelevant during the remainder of the text). I can only assume that Oanda subsidized his book. I would not have purchased this book had I known that.While I am glad to know a bit more about forex trading, some of the \\"logic\\" behind doing so is faulty in my opinion. One of the premises behind trading currency is the much smaller set of investment vehicles to analyze as opposed to the thousands of stocks available. The trouble with this premise is that one currency in and of itself takes an entire economy to create its value as opposed to a stock which is a microcosm of one sector of an economy. What you end up trading with forex is not just one economy but TWO! To trade the currencies effectively, one should know what's driving the value of both entire economies. The scope of your fundamental analysis is therefore not more limited, but dynamically multiplied.However, that being said, this book only covers the most basic concepts of trading, and in very broad generalities. He gives practical \\"homework\\" assignments, such as track market reactions to economic releases, keep a journal, write down your goals, define your strategy, stick to your strategy, don't drink and trade.Where this book falls grossly short, for me, is in the details of his \\"methods\\". The subtitle is \\"From the Basics to Building a Winning Strategy\\". This should be interpreted as reaching only to the upper resistance area of the Basics. The window left between the Basics and the theoretical Winning Strategy is quite large. There is NO bullish breakout into the Winning Strategy trading area.He basically says, \\"go create a strategy\\", then \\"test your strategy\\". Then says, \\"choose a strategy\\" without a single word of advice as to how to do that with any reasonable or practical sensibility. There is no discussion of the multitude of components that might make up a strategy other than \\"there's other books written on the subject\\". His homework assignment in this one area would leave the book on the shelf for years while you figure it all out yourself.He provides a few basic testing examples, but emphasizes that they were created for the purpose of walking through a fictitious test and are not intended to provide any usable results. There's no list of things that might be testable, what indicators are available, or what variables to use, what formulas to use or how to apply any of his suggestions to the wide expanse of reality. Speaking of formulas, he throws out a great deal of quantitative results, but doesn't provide the math used to back it up. This is akin to saying, \\"X=10, please go test for X, and make your choices based on the results.\\" I'm just supposed to grab these formulas out of thin air I suppose?The few formulas that he does provide are either basic math (sell price minus purchase price equals profit), or include variables that aren't explained at all (i.e. R sub f = risk free rate of return). If you don't know what Risk Free Rate of Return is, don't worry neither do I and I've read the book.He doesn't point you in any direction whatsoever! There's a big world out there, go invent your tests and your formulas yourself, then test all the possibilities before using real money to trade. While at the same time says that it's unreasonable for a novice to understand more than one trend indicator at a time. I'm sorry, that's just not practical advice. If I can only understand one indicator, at least point me in a somewhat limited direction and explain it to me.He also does not give any advice as to how to find a broker, just says \\"find one that suits your goals\\". What?! Mind telling me how to do that? Never once mentions how to research their credentials, or what scams might await. How are they regulated (or not)? What should you look for as a reasonable spread? Are there hidden fees to consider? What about those bogus interest rate rules some brokers have? And absolutely nothing he suggested actually related to stocks or stock brokers at all as far as I'm concerned.Many of his charts are illegible, or incomprehensible due to lack of explanation as to what he's charted. There are many grammatical and sentence structure errors which make portions of this text difficult to get through. His overview of the technical indicators is slack at best. He merely suggests that \\"there are many books that already cover that topic in great detail\\". In fact he makes similar statements on various topics throughout the book.The most amazing thing is that he spends the entirety of the book explaining trading via forex. But then the trading system he shares with you in the appendix is for stocks! And not only that, the system presented completely digresses from his proposal to pick one or two trading vehicles and thoroughly back test them to develop the optimum system for that vehicle. It is the ultimate in inconsistency! Due to the number of errors in the book, there's no way I'd trust his \\"sample system\\" at the end of the book without confirming it against several other sources.If you need someone to tell you that you need to do your homework, apply yourself to ongoing research, and plan properly prior to trading then I've just done that. No need to buy the book.However, if you're looking for practical advice on how to find workable tools, strategy evaluation methods, or any caveats to watch out for which are prevalent in the industry, I suggest that you seek to purchase one of those other books that he alluded to.The subtitle really should be \\"From the Basics and up to (but not including) Building a Winning Strategy\\"."},{"Title":"The Essentials of Trading : From the Basics to Building a Winning Strategy (Wiley Trading)","review":"Rarely does a week go by in which someone in the trading world does not ask me to endorse their website, product, or publication. I politely decline 90% or more of the time. The sad truth is that many trading texts are written by individuals who are not truly experts in their domains. When I had the opportunity to review John Forman's book \\"The Essentials of Trading\\" prior to its release, I not only gave it my endorsement, but consented to write its Foreword. I would only do that for an author who knows his stuff and for a work that I am proud to be associated with.What John has accomplished is, to my mind, the best general-purpose introduction to trading I have yet encountered. Having run a training program for aspiring professional traders at a proprietary trading firm, I know the questions that new traders ask and the lessons they need to learn. John has clearly addressed these in \\"The Essentials of Trading\\". He begins with trading mechanics: the nuts and bolts of executing and managing a trade. His discussion is accompanied by real examples, with screen shots of order tickets and trading screens. This is no academic, theoretical treatise, but a hands-on introduction to trading basics.Later chapters take up the important topics of trading plans and risk management, followed by methods for analyzing markets and designing, testing, and optimizing trading systems. Once again, practical examples abound, with clear illustrations of actual markets, positions, and systems. A nice touch are the text boxes throughout the book highlighting key concepts. Many of these are comments from traders and the lessons they've learned.Overall, I found John's writing to be clear and concise. He has served as content editor for the Trade2Win community site, and his writing experience shows. When I endorsed the book, I said that it was the text I wished I had when I started my training program. I stand by that comment: this is a great introduction to the trading world.Are there weaknesses to the book? Those will depend on readers' interests. Two full chapters are devoted to trading systems, but only part of a chapter to technical analysis. Valuable insights regarding trading psychology are scattered through the text, but there is no dedicated chapter to the topic. Conversely, the bonus sample trading system included in the appendix is worth the price of the text alone, providing an illuminating example of a trading methodology.In sum, I highly recommend \\"The Essentials of Trading\\" for new and developing traders.

Just what is jazz? Maybe it really is a question that can only be answered by the famous Louis Armstrong quote, \\"If you've gotta ask, you'll never know.\\"But give Axelrod credit. He gives the subject expert treatment. Whether you know absolutely nothing about jazz (or any music, for that matter), or whether you have a degree in music, you'll learn plenty in this well-formatted book.The author wisely gives readers a general overview of what constitutes jazz, what some of the major trends were, and a who's who of famous musicians. Axelrod does NOT immediately launch into a chronological history of jazz and that's a plus. Jazz does not have cut-and-dried periods. It's style changes intertwine and sometimes reemerge after years (and decades) of inactivity. After the first few chapters when Axelrod DOES get into more of a chronological look at jazz, it makes more sense. The foundation he has built can withstand a look at the various subgenres at that point. This makes for a much clearer reading and understanding of jazz.Axelrod gives brief bios of the major players and band leaders. If you want to know more, he tells you where you can continue your search. Also very helpful is a listing of 25 \\"must have\\" recordings for the beginner, and an expanded list for those ready to branch out. Also provided are glossaries of musicians and jazz terms.Some critics have knocked the book for not providing a sampler CD. Let me point out that the outstanding Ken Burns 5 CD boxed set covering the history of jazz barely scratches the surface. A &quot;sampler&quot; CD just won't do.A great book for the beginning, intermediate, or veteran jazz fan.approx. 300 pages"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Jazz","review":"This is a good overview of jazz history told more or less chronologically with overviews of the major players. Although it would have been nice to have a CD with samples of the music like the Dummies book, this is the better book of the two."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Jazz","review":"A must-have for anyone who never understood jazz, containing: 1) basic musical concepts; 2) jazz history; 3) major schools (styles), musicians and albums; 4) who's who in jazz; 5) essential jazz albums list; 6) complete idiot's reference card (styles and albums checklist).Read it and you will learn about all the different jazz styles and get tips to find the music that better suits your taste and build a jazz collection.P.S.: Despite the author's affirmation on page 225, Carmen Miranda was not actually brazilian. She was born in Portugal and moved to Brazil very young."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Jazz","review":"Ever wonder why Miles Davis is so revered among Jazz fans?Was Charlie Parker one of the guys who lasted decades or died too young?What was Louis Armstrong's major contribution to jazz development?How should I start my jazz collection and do it economically?Which instruments can be used to play jazz and which cannot?What is really the difference between jazz and popular anyway?Where is jazz headed and what's happening with it now?If you ask questions like these, then this Idiot's Guide to Jazz is for you (and me). There is also good historical depth/anecdotes that may interest more experienced jazz fans, but the book's primary purpose is to help those of us who find jazz mostly bewildering but have heard enough we like to be somewhat interested.The first 20% of the book doesn't just jump straight into history but provides a gentle introduction for a present day audience who may just be wondering what jazz is (high level), where to go to hear it, what instruments are popular (or possible - basically anything goes). Describes the general shape of the spirit of jazz, why it is unique and worthy of further investigation.The remaining 250 pages really make an easy reading, accessible chronological history of jazz starting all the way back, not just too New Orleans but Africa and Europe. From those roots it gradually builds up the story of jazz and its major artists/style/hotbeds, etc. Jazz before and after Armstrong, New York, Kansas City, Miles Davis. How each artist and location affected the sound, how swing, bebop, cool, hard bop, fusion, avant-garde came about, etc. it's all here. I have a much better picture now of what era and phase of development I am hearing when I listen to any major artist, from any era. There are still some fine points, especially on someone like Miles Davis since he morphed through three or four different phases, but at least I know that much now. The book is a good reference to learn from after the first reading as well.The author has a background as a historian apart from jazz so he is skilled at getting below the popular jazz critic understanding of events like WWII to some interesting analysis that really makes sense. Jazz really is a reflection of the American experience both good and bad. He does a terrific job of showing this. The author is very open to all sorts of jazz. Not a high brow, jazz clique type, he really wants more people to learn how to enjoy jazz. But he's not just mush either. He offers enough informed opinion to help guide you through what you might like and might not.As you can see I like the book and have found it very helpful. My only criticisms are minor. I wish there was a listening guide CD to go with the book. The problem is, the story is so comprehensive that one CD would really not be enough (two or three minimum) so the price would be much higher. Just a wishful thought, but it would really help. I thought the early part of the history dragged just a bit, maybe because I was anxious to get into the mid-twentieth century where I could relate a little better. There is a lot of early jazz history, but there's a lot of history here for all jazz eras as well. As I mentioned, you can use this book as an informal reference on all major jazz artists/phases so if you read it straight through it is a little long. Can't have it both ways - short and detailed - so I think the author has done a fine job striking the balance to deliver a book of lasting value.I really like the book. The copy I read was checked out of the library (another good source for jazz the author briefly mentions) and I am thinking of buying my own copy to use as reference. This book really has really helped me get started and probably will help more in the future."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Jazz","review":"I would like to thank Dr. Axelrod for such an initiative.

As a novel it can be read by non-christian and enjoyed. Teaches and causes a thinking process. Shows what bondage can be about, a truth not easily seen. I loved it. And look forward to sequels."},{"Title":"Life's Vagabondage: A Novel","review":"I was blown away by this book. It flies. There's so much there. This is what Christian lit was supposed to be - great story that never lags - great characters (Grief and Pain are a trip!) Leonard Lamb is cool. He's the main man. When he goes backwards in time, it's weird, but makes sense. More real than just about anything I've ever read or seen. I loved Chapter 19, when they were fighting the wolves. Davoid and Dugless reminded me of how my brothers fight. Henry, the old farmer angel was absolutely awesome, and I want to be like Rodger.It would take all night to tell you how much I loved this book. It's got too much to write about. Really. If you like science fiction or fantasy fiction, this one is great. If you want a story that really moves, get this one. It's still totally Christian, no cliches. Refreshingly original. Heavy in some places. Funny in others. I really loved it."},{"Title":"Evil's Return, Vol. 1","review":"When I finished reading this book, I had to stop and think about what I just read. Not because the book was confusing, but because there was hardly any talking. From the dialoge that was said you or at least I got that feeling that something important is about to happen. The book just cuts off in the end with out explaining what just took place the precending pages. If you want to find out what happen I would suggest you pick up volumes 1 and 2 at the same time, but since 2 has not come out as of today 8-2-04) you might have to wait awhile. The art work is great. And yes you well be looking a a half naked female most the time."},{"Title":"Evil's Return, Vol. 1","review":"I'm surprised at the negative comments on this manga. It's not that bad, just different. I have been reading manga for a while now and I think that if you are new to reading manga, \\"Evil's Return\\" shouldn't be one of your firsts.Here's why: There isn't much dialogue compared to others and that because the manga relies on the beautiful art and your imagination. The art is really good and has a lot of feeling and the feeling of the art explains more than words.Secondly, this is a rather mature book.... the storyline is anyway. There isn't any pure nudity, just scantily clad girls (and rather busty for their age) and one too many panty shots. But this is nothing new, you get the same thing in any shojou/magical girl manga.The manga also revolves around the concept of \\"good vs. evil\\" or heaven and hell and this may upset someone who are very religious. You find the same thing in other anime/manga: the author/artist isn't exactly a Christian but their story is based on Christian themes.... there is bound to be some misunderstandings.To sum things up in a nutshell, the art is excellent and so good that dialogue is not need to explain a certain scene because the art does so. And finally this is a mature manga with mature scenes and characters (16 and up).I recommend this manga to anyone who is open-minded and is possibly an anime/manga fan. Any anime fan knows that there is more to just \\"Reading\\" manga and I feel that some titles are for the veterans. \\"Evil's Return\\" is one of them. So far there are only 3 volumes and I've enjoyed the first one enough to buy the others."},{"Title":"Evil's Return, Vol. 1","review":"Jong-Kyu Lee, Evil's Return, vol. 1 (Tokyopop, 2001)This one turned out to be quite a ride; a great deal more than I expected. Probably the goriest manga I've run across since Reiko the Zombie Shop, but it looks like there's going to be deeper characters and a stronger storyline here than we got there. What we know so far: a high school girl has been chosen to be the vessel for the coming of some sort of evil being into our world (no idea what yet), and that the choosing disturbed the forces so much that a lot of major world religions noticed. A monk has been dispatched to keep her safe, while the school bad boy's fallen for her. So, yeah, mostly setup, but it's certainly likable setup, and you can't go wrong with too much mayhem. Looking forward to the next few books in the series. ***"},{"Title":"Evil's Return, Vol. 1","review":"This manga is so ultimately bad that I had a hard time deciding whether it or Battle Vixens was worse.But Evil's Return definitley takes the Most-Pathetic-and-Stupidly-laughoutloud-story-I-have-ever-heard award.When Yumi gets her period (all over the place) it signals to all the demons out there that she's ripe for impregnation so they come to track her down and PLANT THE SEED OF SATAN IN HER WOMB! Geez, no matter HOW many times I say or write that, I still crack up laughing. I am completely at a loss as to how this even got published. I'm guessing it was only licensed as Tokyopop wanted to license as much korean titles as possible.It's not just the story that is woefully bad, it's also very poorly written and half the time makes no sense. Without the cover art, the reader probably couldnt even register who was the main character. I only know that Yumi is because she's ON the cover. Apart from that, all I know about her is that she's a empty husk with no personality or character whatsoever. On top of that, the whole book took me ten or less minutes to read. Considering most manga takes me around 40 minutes to an hour to get through, that's really pathetic. This is due to the fact that even though the page count is the same of any other manga, the text is limited, there are minimum panels on each page and there is frequent need to take up whole pages with pointless full body shots. Simply a technique to heighten the page count.The only reason I read Evil's Return was that I had heard how hilariously bad it was and just HAD to see how it was.Do not buy this. If you feel the urge to see just how bad it is, read it in a bookstore or library if you get the chance.You can really tell how bad a manga is when it's laugh-out-loud hilarious...when the humour isnt intentional."},{"Title":"Evil's Return, Vol. 1","review":"Evil's return is really awesome and I'm 11 so you can't use age on this anymore cause even though it lacks words the artwork is awesome I agree with the person at the top if you new to manga you probably shouldn't get this book cause you need a strong imagination and if you're a beginner you probably don't know how to comprehend all this awesome work so of course your gonna say it sucked but if you could see the sweat, blood, and tears put into this you would see the story's soul and only then can you see how awesome this manga is (sorry I just got don't watching the whole first season of comic party) but trust me as you get more into manga then come back to this book you'll see that the more experience you have with manga the better it is(I've been reading manga for 3 whole years and watching anime for 5 so I know my stuff) so next time try to read up on your manga before you start throwing flames at them k?Signed,Your,Bishojo Shoujo Sempi"},{"Title":"Evil's Return, Vol. 1","review":"I have just started to read manga, and Evils Return really dissapointed me. The artwork was good, but not a lot happend in the story. It was boring, there were to many pictures and not enough talking, and i don't like any of the characters. There was mild language and i found myself often looking at an almost naked girl. Don't waist your money on this manga. Although this is only my opinion, i'm a teen after all."},{"Title":"The Pilots","review":"I read this book at the recommendation of a friend, and I must say, I have never been endowed with such a clear perception of what it was like to actually be in WWII. The gritty characters, intricate settings, and detailed descriptions made the book seem very, very real... I would recommend this book to anyone who would like a thrilling glimpse at what it was like to actually BE THERE. An enjoyable and gripping novel overall."},{"Title":"The Pilots","review":"I also salute the author's contribution in WWII. However, \\"The Pilots\\" is just too disjointed and -- quite frankly -- predictable to recommend. Apparently much of the book was written as short stories, which is fine. But there should have been some effort to edit these into a seamless whole, rather than just slap them together between covers. As a result, we often hear the same bits of information over and over. Trust me, Mr. Spencer, by page 228 we KNOW that \\"Blake Hurlingame was Steve's boyhood friend who now flies B-24s!\\" And too many of the incidents were telegraphed far in advance. When Addie finds the .45 automatic in her nightstand drawer, we KNOW she's going to need it in just a few pages! On the plus side, some of the flying sequences were quite enjoyable. There just weren't enough of them. It seems to me that if you're writing a novel about combat flying in WWII, you pretty much know who your audience will be. And it's not women. Therefore, I would suggest cutting down on the \\"romance\\" and jacking up the action. Just one guy's opinion. Still, it's a quick, painless read and flying novels are hard to find.(By the way, one positive: The new trade paperback edition has the appropriate P-38 on the cover.)"},{"Title":"The Pilots","review":"This is just a super book. Well written, warm, and yet frightening in its description of combat flying. Jim Spencer has a wonderful way of getting into the stories and making them real for us. Having lived just a bit of that life (USMC pilot)I felt in the cockpit and in the ready room with Jim. The out of combat R&amp;R in Australia was just the right tone, and the craziness that permeates everything was right on.All the guys I know would love this book. There is hardly a pilot alive or that has lived that has not dreamed of air-to-air combat. This is a piece of that dream."},{"Title":"The Pilots","review":"Some of the other reviewers of this book are apparently unfamiliar with the literary style of the vignette. This book is an excellent example of it in use. the book consists of a series of short stories, mostly about American pilots in the Pacific Theater in World War II. The stories are all related to one another but any one of them is also a stand-alone story on its own (in fact, the author notes in the back note that 5 of the stories were previously published independent of one another in magazines). The dust jacket liner notes call it a novel-in-stories.Many are complaining that the stories are disjointed. Yes, that's the intention. It is similar to the difference between a movie about an event and a few snapshots of that same event. The movie is smooth, a series of photographs is disjointed - but each picture can stand on its own.Anyway, Spencer's book consists of 15 vignettes about the lives of two pilots. The first one is about their childhood. It is by far the weakest of the stories. It has the least to do with the war, but it is a decent little story about the Great Depression. The rest of them give us a little taste of the action in the air over the Pacific but also a sense of life back on base and on leave.The book is a breeze to read and quite enjoyable. As a memoir in fiction, one can assume that some of it really happened to Spencer, some of it is based on things he heard about and some of it he just made up. Either way, I enjoyed it.I give this one a grade of A-"},{"Title":"The Pilots","review":"I read this book this year. I picked it up because my Grandpa was a B-24 pilot in the war and said it was a good fictionalised account of 'his war'. I started reading and was sucked in.The way he describes dogfights and bomb runs is in great detail. The book is based on two characters, Lieutenants Stevie Larkin and Blake Hurlingame. Both are childhood friends who both join the Army Air Forces during WWII. One is a fighter pilot and the other a bomber pilot. The book bounces between different characters but the stories are intertwined. If you want a well written, tragic WWII novel, \\"The Pilots\\" is a great choice."},{"Title":"The Pilots","review":"I thought I would enjoy &quot;The Pilots&quot; because I am a fighter pilot myself (albeit of the modern era) and I enjoy first-hand accounts of WWII. The glowing accolades on the back cover from some aviation/military authors seemed to indicate a good read. I was rather disappointed. Although I read the whole thing, and it was mildly entertaining, it was far from what I expected. It was a very amateurish piece of work. The author himself tells us in the forward that he wrote down these &quot;stories&quot; to record the world of WWII pilots, their experiences and feelings, for his own sons. He then collected the stories into a book.It could have been much better if he had put a little more effort into consolidating the stories, but he didn't even bother to clean up the individual stories and mesh them neatly together - sometimes they left you hanging and sometimes they seemed to go nowhere. Some were obviously left out entirely. And he bounces back and forth between a B-24 pilot (which he portrays OK since he was one) and a P-38 fighter pilot (which is most of the amateurish stuff) that he tries (unsuccessfully) to tie together at the beginning with a too-long account of their childhood as neighbors. And probably because the author later became a Psychotherapist (as reported in the &quot;about the author&quot; on the cover flap) the whole book is laced with a lot of people with childhood issues, who &quot;need to talk to someone&quot;. Reading this you would think that half the pilots (and flight docs) in the Pacific theater were loony. And the author seems to have the characters, rather than dwelling on bonds of friendship and camaraderie, mostly be antagonistic towards each other.The author's credibility dropped even more when he mentioned that WWI fighter pilots didn't fly with parachutes because they hadn't been invented yet (which is blatantly false). A last minor, irritating point is that the cover of the hardback that I read shows a P-51 which never (to my knowledge) served in the Pacific theater (where the book is based) and which, more to the point, is never a part of the stories.Overall, if you've got nothing to do for a weekend, and the book is sitting there on the table, you might want to read it. But I wouldn't buy it."},{"Title":"The Pilots","review":"From the book jacket, I know that James Spencer is a writer and has been for a long, long time. I also know that for a brief period in his life he was a B-24 pilot in the southwest Pacific during World War Two. By his own admission he flew 44 missions, some of them very long range, over trackless ocean that would have provided little if any chance for rescue had he and his crew gone down. Such combat flying is unarguably valorous, particularly in retrospect, but at the time was just the flyers' &quot;job.&quot; I know a naval aviator who flew similar solo strikes in a PB4Y-1 (the Navy version of the B-24)during the same time period of 1943 and '44 and am familiar with what such missions entailed.That said, this book falls short in a number of areas, beginning with the opening section about the protagonists' early years, which is full of both unbelievable incidents and characters. From there it goes from combat flying in both bombers and fighters, life at the bases, R&amp;R in Australia and various other ruminations about &quot;what it all means.&quot; Combat flying memoirs are beginning to appear again after a long dry spell as veterans want to commit their experiences to print while they still can. Some are good but those tend to be the non-fiction ones. This book is called a &quot;memoir as a novel,&quot; which I assume means that there is at least some basis of actual related experience in a fictional context. In this case, I suppose the experience is that of serving in the 13th Air Force in the Pacific and then projecting a young aviator's now mature viewpoints into a few fictional characters? Hey, I'm reaching here, but the author admits that he thinks he should have been a fighter pilot, fantasized about P-38's and one of the characters in this book is a fighter pilot. Of course, there's bomber flying too by another character. So is this Walter Mitty stuff or real stuff that happened to others but not to the author? So this is a novel. It's really not a memoir at all any more than James Jones' FROM HERE TO ETERNITY was a memoir of his life in the pre-war Army at Schofield Barracks.The truth is less elegant than the alleged new art form. This is a novel and not a very good one. A truly good memoir of South Pacific combat flying is Edwards Park's NANETTE. A truly good novel of South Pacific combat flying is Gordon Forbes' GOODBYE TO SOME. Both of these books, written by men who did the deeds, are well worth the time it might take to find them.With full appreciation for Mr. Spencer's wartime service and his demonstrated writing skills, presumably non-fiction, evidenced by his having been published for years, I feel that this particular effort was substandard for war fiction... or memoir.And a minor note to the publisher: the book jacket shows P-51's. While P-51's are mentioned in the author's foreward, the US aircraft in the book are B-24's and P-38's. Pictures exist for both these aircraft -- even shots of them in the Pacific theater, even shots of them together -- so look around if this book goes to paperback."},{"Title":"Sometimes You Get the Bear","review":"Dan Holly has embarked on a new career. Sometimes You Get The Bear, is a thought provoking novel of one's triumph over drugs, sex, and murder. Dealing with an interracial relationship, drugs and murder is why Chris Holland now understands why The Bear was so important to get. This novel touches upon so many things that are happening in todays society. It makes you stop and think about who we might have placed in the political arena. I believe Dan Holly has it right were he wants it. Writing is Dan's forte and he is on his way to being one of the best writer's out there. Dan, we wish you the best with your next novel."},{"Title":"Sometimes You Get the Bear","review":"&quot;Sometimes You Get The Bear&quot; is a compelling read that throws open the blinds on relations within a family and race, as well as between the races. It has the throw-my-life-into-this-book openness of a first novel; and indeed it is a debut, and is loosely semi-autobiographical. The liberalness of the author in integrating personal experiences make this work gripping. In fact, what drives and brings to life the book is detail and authoritativeness that spring from his career experience as a journalist and congressional press secretary. An episode involving one subject's telephone interview with a news reporter is not skated across with novelesque generalities, but rather the reader is thrown into the cauldron of the media accuracy/fairness issue and learns how controversies play out in newsrooms and have repercussions in living rooms. The book's biggest hook, however, is what prompts the interview. The fugitive flight of another subject following the accidental killing of his ex-girlfriend's lover. That he is black and his victim, like the girl, is white, is the matrix of this cascading tale that insightfully prompts the reader to question his or her own principles as those of the subjects evolve. If you're the good son and want to better understand your mischievous brother, and your own self-righteousness, read this book!. If you are the other, read this book and see clarity rise from confusion and hope out of self-pity. More than about right and wrong, &quot;Sometimes You Get The Bear&quot; is about race and skin-color consciousness within a family, within a race, and within America. It's about the changes that race takes us through, and even those we voluntarily accept or come to blindly expect. Another big plus: The book reads more true-to-life than most novels, and readers who favor the reality of nonfiction are not confronted with hokey imagery or a pretentious exploit at literacism."},{"Title":"Sometimes You Get the Bear","review":"I also wondered why Chris chose the streets over the comfort of his mom's home, but I guess that's what made the story line.

His story line and real life characters kept the reading flowing for me. Steve and Chris made me think of men of who went through hard life situations and wasn't so lucky to turn it around. Mr. Holly kept you cheering for the underdog, even though their behavior or actions were not always &quot;acceptable.&quot; I was pleased to read how Mr. Holly allowed Steve to face up to his mistake and proceed to jail and not end up as a user. I was a little thrown off by his &quot;thinking out loud&quot; writing style. To me it seemed he was trying to tell two stories at one time. I would highly recommend this book to be added to a high school &quot;must&quot; read list. The novel shows people that you can turn your life around.

You really get the feeling you know the characters or someone just like them.Yes, racism in America is stated and shown in this novel but it is skillfully woven into the story and not used as a club to beat the reader. The actions and characters in this book are totally believable. The people are not too beautiful and they do not jump buildings in a single bound. A wonderful story of the triumph of the human spirit and the steadfastness of family. A must read."},{"Title":"Sometimes You Get the Bear","review":"Mr.Holly has the gift for combining good believable characters,an interesting suspenseful story, and a powerful social commentary regarding how our politicians and the media shape our perceptions and keep us stuck in racial divide.There was an absolute build in this book and I found myself living with and routing for the characters. The author wrote this book with a non-evasive intelligence. I did not feel robbed of the choice as to whether I wished to like the heroes of the story. In fact, I did not particurly like the personality of one of the brothers. Yet I found myself routing for him in the name of justice. I appreciate the author allowing me, the reader to enter the intimate inner thought processes and insecurities of the characters without invading my space by insulting my intelligence.I particuarly enjoyed Chris's ability to outwit the FBI, and found the details and tracking strategies to be quite realistic. Mostly, I didn't want the book to end because I was so rapped up in the lives of the characters.

The wonderful Kriya gentleman I met sent me this book and I devoured it in two days--despite all the foreign words and names, which I wanted to ingest fully and not skim-over. This gentleman also strongly recommended &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi,&quot; by Paramahansa Yogananda--which I have ordered from Amazon.com.I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of &quot;Autobiography.....&quot; because this story Captivated me! I felt very in-tune with the young &quot;Mejda&quot; who evolved into a great Yogi, who spread the Light of Yoga teachings to the West.I know, from studying occult works, that Yoga &amp; Eastern Philosophy was not always well-accepted in America. However, &quot;Mejda&quot; did a wonderful job of Educating Americans and set-up 70 Yoga centers in the world. He must have been an Amazing man.I am very-much looking forward to my journey in Yoga &amp; I strongly recommend these books to anyone involved with Yoga &amp; Eastern thought. I am beginning to understand Hinduism.This book is very well-written and you will find yourself glued to it. My eyes were riveted to the pages, until I finished reading the last page.I am ever-indebted to the gentleman who sent me this book, for opening my eyes to the Wisdom of Yoga. I recently discovered that the West's early antagonism against Yoga came strictly from personal animosity against people like Mdme. Blavatsky, by other organizations. I have concluded that the Negative attitudes toward Yoga and Eastern thought, by Westeners is due to Ignorance of the truth--not any valid argument against the system of thought.Make sure you buy the Autobiography, because this story is one you will not want to end !"},{"Title":"Mejda: The Family and the Early Life of Paramahansa Yogananda","review":"&quot;MEJDA&quot; is a most fascinating study of the early life and experiences of one of the world's great modern prophets. We are so often at a loss to know the many intimate and amazing details about these sacred lives. This unique biography not only gives us inspirational insights on Yogananda's formative years, but also serves as a major study of how this great yogi so intently, lovingly, and single-mindedly sought Self-Realization as a youth. It clearly demonstrates the subtle influence of the divine in our lives. Leaving little doubt as to the authenticity and timeliness of His divine mission, which is being substantiated by it's great success and influence in the spirirtual lives of so many persons.The author, a sibling of Yogananda, stands as one of many witnessess to the many miraculous happenings through the Masters outstanding life's work. This testimony should be read by anyone who may find the amazing encounters and stories in the classic &quot;AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A YOGI&quot; difficult to believe. Paramahansa Yogananda established the Self-Realization Fellowship to be the Authorized publisher of His writings and the teacher of Babaji's sacred Kriya Yoga.Contents: Father's Humble Beginnings......Mejda's Birth and Boyhood in Gorakpur......Mejda at Lahore.......Our Mother.......Family Life after Mothers Death......Our Days in Bareilly......Early Years in Calcutta......Mejda Explores the Realms of Mind and Spirit.......Mejda's Guru and College Years......Sannyas and a Worldwide Mission......Return to India........The Last Years and an Ongoing Mission.......Biographical Notes....Also Recommended: In The Sanctary of the Soul.......Only Love...........Finding the Joy Within You......The Divine Romance.......Man's Eternal Quest.....The Scienc of religion....Journey to Self-Realization..etc."},{"Title":"Mejda: The Family and the Early Life of Paramahansa Yogananda","review":"Although this is not the book with which to *begin* your exposure to Yogananda's life and teachings (that would be Autobiography of a Yogi, ISBN 0876120834 ), it is one of the very few places where you can appreciate the yoga master's life from youth. The author, younger brother Sananda, vividly relates the powerful effect on the entire family of having a child saint in its midst. Stories demonstrating young Yogananda's rare combination of devotion, will, and divine atunement will remind you of how the child Jesus impressed adult relatives. And yet he certainly was a boy during those early years - playing pranks, gradually learning lessons, and steadily expanding the spiritual burden he was to shoulder as an adult teacher in Europe and the Americas.If you have ready his Autobiography and crave further connection with Yogananda's spirit, pick up &quot;Mejda&quot; - you'll not be disappointed. Sananda brings alive many astounding experiences he and his saintly brother shared - stories not available anywhere else in print.Don't neglect the appended Q&amp;A and Discourses sections. Even if you've been taking Yogananda's Self-Realization Lessons in meditation, you'll find some unique points pertaining to the Bhagavad Gita, how reincarnation happens, the role of life force in yoga, etc. in these appendices."},{"Title":"Mejda: The Family and the Early Life of Paramahansa Yogananda","review":"This is a biography of Yogananda by one of his youngest brothers. Don't expect Yogananda to be like he was in his autobiography. I would advise you to please read the autobiography first. Mukunda (Yogananda) could be trying, to say the least. All this energy would culminate in his Worldwide Mission to bring yoga to the entire world. But let us face facts. He did have a temper in the early days. He would spend time in graveyards practicing tantric yoga! This brought a lot of dismay to his father who had to take a firm but gentle hand with him. He would frequently hypnotize the author until his father finally put a stop to it. Yes, he was a tiger. But a benevolent one. He was determined to find God as described in his classic autobiography. But I don't think he was ever secure until he found his Guru, Sri Yukteswar. This work also corresponds with the biography. In that work, a chapter is written on how Yogananda simply insisted on going to the Himalayas despite hisGuru's admonitions. So this biography simply highlights this man's life from an outsider's view. It is a very wonderful book about a simply wonderful man. But read the autobiography first in order not to get any false notions."},{"Title":"Mejda: The Family and the Early Life of Paramahansa Yogananda","review":"For anyone who has ever read, loved, and been profoundly impacted by a reading of Paramahansa Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi - Mejda is an indispensable companion to this classic work.Mejda is a term of endearment given to the second eldest brother in a Hindu family. This book presents a very intimate portrait of Yogananda by Sananda Lal Ghosh - who was not only Yogananda's brother, but also his companion, friend, and ultimately devotee. The book fills in many gaps about Yogananda's childhood and documents amazing events about his life that are both supernatural, heart-warming and inspirational. I came away with a greater sense of respect and awe and a deeper appreciation for Yogananda - whose life, work, and priceless gift of Kriya Yoga to lay men and women in the West are simply beyond measure.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the life and work of this great Master!"},{"Title":"Mejda: The Family and the Early Life of Paramahansa Yogananda","review":"The book is okay for Yogananda Devotees and as one can well imagine stories are kept in line with AYB but they are muted by comparrison. A good read for those who are SRF affiliated but the best part was the back of the book where the author was more original in his own writings."},{"Title":"Mejda: The Family and the Early Life of Paramahansa Yogananda","review":"This is such a beautiful book about Paramahansa Yoganandaji written by his brother. Read \\"Autobiography of a Yogi\\" before."},{"Title":"Mejda: The Family and the Early Life of Paramahansa Yogananda","review":"I've known of Yogananda for almost twelve years. My introduction to him was his autobiography. Since then I've read much of his literature, and the writings of some of his disciples. Of them all, this book has been the most inspiring and informative. I feel any open hearted seeker will find some good in it, and any lover of Yogananda would deeply enjoy and cherish it."},{"Title":"Mejda: The Family and the Early Life of Paramahansa Yogananda","review":"I received this in the mail and was immediately engrossed in the reading, feeling like I was reading about a beloved friend. I felt like I'd known Yogananda thru all his other books (Autobiography, Self-Realization Volumes, and Scientific Healing Affirmations), so \\"Mejda\\" proved to offer valuable insight to his background and life.What I learned in this book:Yogananda has always had deep love and affection for all animals since a young child.He had difficulty containing his anger and would express his feelings passionately and vocally. In his other books he talked about eliminating his anger as he got older.He was a yogi since he was conscious as a baby, but then, he was always conscious inbetween incarnations.He had a powerful relationship with God in that God would manifest to him even when he was a young child.He was so curious that he started dabbling in various supernatural practices. (I can relate to this!)He yearned for God terribly and felt very ostracized (was bullied) as he was so different from other boys.He was a sensitive and passionate young boy, yet he began his guru-ship early as other boys interested in the same thing would follow him.Thank you, Sananda, brother of Yogananda, for giving us your precious insight into a beloved Yogi."},{"Title":"Firefly Episode Guide: An Unofficial, Independent Guide to Joss Whedon's Firefly","review":"Perhaps I should have been warned by the 'Unofficial, Independent Guide' in the title, or even the dreadful artwork on the book cover. However, considering how many 'unofficial' books and websites that offer a plethora of insight and information you might not otherwise know about; I ordered it. Thanks, Amazon, for suggesting it.The best thing that I can say about this book is that despite it being listed as available in 2-4 weeks, I received it almost immediately. Unpacking it and holding it in my hands, the first warning bell began clanging in my head - this was a self-published book. I didn't even have to open it, you could just feel the cheap, \\"I wasn't paid to publish this, I paid somebody to publish it\\" quality of the book's printing.Nonetheless, I pushed forward. First the author correctly suggests that you watch the series, preferably the boxed DVD set of the series. Then she goes forth and word for word steals entire episode summaries from various popular Firefly/Serenity websites that she acknowledges. She then lists like a giant revelation facts that are contained in the episode commentaries.The only original material in here is what her impressions are: by this she says she means not only her mental reaction to each episode, but also any mistakes, continuity issues (which she gathers entirely from the commentaries), and questionable actions made by the characters. As I read these, I began noticing a trend wherein the author has a pre-adolescent boy's understanding of personal relationships. I know this for a fact as she at times phrases things exactly like my 12-year-old son, or rather like he did when he was 11-years-old. It's at this point I visit the 'about the author page' to discover that this woman is a self-styled movie 'web goddess', whose qualifications are working part time at what she refers to as the best DVD rental store ever. Oh, and she watches all those DVDs and a lot of TV.The retarded emotional evaluation of the series relationships explained, I continued on my quest to find something worth the money I paid for the book and the time I invested in reading it so far. Sadly, it ended up being amusing only in its blatant errors and pathetic misunderstandings. There are times you snigger, such as when she mistakenly lists the name of a guest character's name with a series character's name. There are times when you feel like Wash as he says in one episode, \\"Yeah, a lot of people don't get me and Zoe at first.\\" This author not only doesn't get it at first, she doesn't get it ever. Then there are the truly pathetic moments like when she states the main beginning theme of \\"Objects in Space\\" as River walking through the boat and hearing the thoughts of the people around her. A paragraph later, back in her \\"I have never been in a relationship mode\\", the author then painstakingly tries to work out why the Captain and Inara would just stand there talking for the whole ship to hear about their underlying romantic issues and how they are disjointed and pointless. You want to find the author's telephone number and refer her back to the fact that River is hearing their mental thoughts, they aren't actually having a conversations, they just happen to be next to each other sulking internally about the seemingly doomed feelings. Then you want to sit her down and tell her about the birds and the bees, take away her TV, and send her to some sort of rehab to raise her emotional age to at least young adult level.Actually, upon reflection, in a lot of ways the author is like River. She observes, but doesn't understand. Sometimes what she says makes sense, but most of the time it's disjointed and random. In the end, however, at least River is intelligent, has interests outside of watching a glowing box, and has an extremely valid reason for her non-sequetors and juvenile misunderstanding of emotions.The most painfully ironic thing about this book is its publishing date; October 2005 - Serenity, the movie continuation of the TV series was released at the end of September 2005. I believe the author meant to reap benefits of the movie's impossible release, monopolyzing not only on the pre-existing Browncoat fan-base but also on any new fans brought into Whedon's Firefly 'Verse by the fabulous movie. Instead of riding the wave of interest, the author ends up looking even more inane with the additional facts given in the movie, conflicting with her theories and misunderstanding of characters and their relationships as a whole."},{"Title":"Firefly Episode Guide: An Unofficial, Independent Guide to Joss Whedon's Firefly","review":"I wish I had paid attention to the first reviewer rather than the two who gave this a decent rating, or read the excerpt at the other reviewer did and discovered bad errors.There is nothing in this book that hasn't been said before, it's a cheaply made book, and the author's personal remarks are often dramatically off the mark.Don't buy it. Whedon has already had an excellent guide of the first half of the episodes of Firefly published, with the second guide for the rest of the series run to be released soon."},{"Title":"Firefly Episode Guide: An Unofficial, Independent Guide to Joss Whedon's Firefly","review":"i haven't bought this, but by looking through the excerpt here i noticed not only did the author mess up on zoe's last name but book's first name(both totally incorrect, not just mispelled), and i believe also misspelled kaylee's, but i could be mistaken on that last one. the fact that there are two glaring errors right in the beginning tell me that this is not worth your time because obviously the author did not do her research. all you browncoats out there, and just people curious in firefly, go buy the official companions, they are accurate and have cast and crew commentary(a far better buy)."},{"Title":"Firefly Episode Guide: An Unofficial, Independent Guide to Joss Whedon's Firefly","review":"I almost didn't buy this because of the extremely negative review from TigWolf. Well, I'm glad I did. While not approaching the quality of \\"The Official Companion\\" or the focus of the essays in \\"Finding Serenity\\" this is a very good read and it shows that at least one Firefly fan can write and get published their thoughts on the best show to ever be on TV.

It's for readers who enjoy a true love story between two grown-ups. Surpisingly, the romance between the two lead characters stayed with me long after I put the book down. If you like a lot of physical intimacy in your romance novels, this book is not for you. But you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not reading it. The interaction between the two lead characters keeps you captivated. Stef Ann's storytelling abilities shine in this book. She makes you feel like you've lived in Harmony all your life. I normally don't save my books, let alone read them a second time around, but this one is staying on my bookshelf!"},{"Title":"Harmony (Brides for All Seasons)","review":"This has been one of my favorite books.

She had her flaws, he had his and they worked with it. She weren't no virgin, no pure as white lady but a simple girl who liked to dance, to drink beer, to have fun. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Harmony (Brides for All Seasons)","review":"After spending some time as a joyful and liberated woman, Edwinna Huntington returns to her home town of Harmony to open up a finishing school for young girls in order to pay off her parents&iacute;s medical bills. Because of her good time in Chicago, Edwinna believes herself to be a fallen woman, never destined to marry. Due to a deceased con man, she is forced to share her storefront with Tom Wolcott, owner of a hunting and sporting goods store.Though they start off poorly, Tom proves to be kind and handsome, tempting Edwinna, who is trying to act with discretion and above board in front of the town's matrons, beyond reason. Their business closeness leads to intimacy and a secret affair. Marriage enters both their minds, but Tom does not want his spouse to work and Edwinna refuses to be dependent on any person. It appears that this couple is at an impasse unless somehow one or both of them can compromise their deep rooted convictions.When Stef Ann Holm is on, no one has a more lyrical, beautiful and unique voice than she does. Ms. Holm is one the best at writing an emotional intense historical romance that leaves nary a dry readers's eye anywhere. However, HARMONY is a comedic novel that is fun to read because of the antics of Edwinna and Tom, but fails to achieve the level of fervor and passion normally associated with a Ms. Holm novel. Still, this is a very good Americana romance that fans of the sub-genre, especially that of Ms. Holm, will enjoy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Harmony (Brides for All Seasons)","review":"Opinion:The overall plot was simple and ok. A dishonest man sells a building twice and then dies. The two new owners are forced to share the space. As they get to know each other they fall in love. I did not like the methods used to create conflict. Edwina claimed she would never marry for several reasons which I found unreasonable. Then after she fell in love, those reasons didn't apply anymore, she just changed her mind. Another conflict was created due to inaccurate assumptions which bothered me. The first time Tom told Edwina he loved her, she convinced herself that it was nothing more than love of a sibling. She then took action based on her \\"incorrect belief\\" that he didn't love her. I like to see a developing relationship, and I need to be able to buy it. But there were too many times that the actions of this couple had me shaking my head, thinking reasonable people wouldn't do that. There were a few times I thought the author was trying to be clever or entertaining, but it didn't work for me. For example, Edwina liked to dance in her underwear. When Tom arrived at her home she continued to stay in her underwear and dance with him instead of excusing herself for a moment to put on some more clothes. There was a scene where Edwina thought a jock strap was an elbow supporter and sold several of them to local men who laughed about her afterwards. It wasn't done in a funny way for me. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy the story, and I wanted it to be over.Data:Story length: 417 pages. Swearing language: mild, including religious words. Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: 3.

Clear, concise, and direct, this is the one book about theatre I wish I'd had when I was in school. Targeted mainly toward actors, this is a wise and lucid compendium for ANY theatre artist, or for any patron who wants to understand more about how a play works onstage.Jory covers all the major themes and topics in pithy one-page descriptions, and clearly relates them to one another. Although he obviously has definite ideas about how to approach a play, he also emphasizes that the actor (playwright, director, etc.) as artist is responsible for making the work organic. He's also very strong on discipline and professional behavior.This book is for anyone who loves the theatre, and can be heartily recommended for beginners and seasoned professionals alike. Appropriate especially for actors and playwrights, it's full of insights for directors and the rest of the technical team as well. Should be required reading for all university-level theatre programs. Keep it in your script bag when you go to rehearsal, just in case you need a little reminder of why you do this."},{"Title":"Tips : Ideas for Actors","review":"In my opinion, this is a book every serious actor needs to have.

He's got a lot of down-to-earth, nuts &amp; bolts type advice in very straightforward language. While many theatre people are want to use flowery language and get caught up in the lofty ideal of being an &quot;artist&quot;, Jon is much more interested in helping actors serve the STORY they are helping to tell, in a way that a PAYING AUDIENCE will be glad they saw. Jon has a lifetime of experience with the theatre; &quot;Tips&quot; gives you a pretty darn good distillation of that experience."},{"Title":"Tips : Ideas for Actors","review":"I had to get this book for class and it's a great to have around and just flip-through.

I suggest many books to my cients, this being one of the top three.Written so the average dog owner can clearly understand what owning/caring for and training a dog is all about,not only makes Labrador Retrievers for Dummies an enjoyable read, but makes training your dog EASY, POSITIVE AND SO REWARDING.

If you believe in punishment training you may not enjoy the book quite as much. If you are considering getting a lab or have a puppy we found this book to be a great foundation. After reading this book, we wanted one of Joel's labs."},{"Title":"Labrador Retrievers For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"This is a well-written book that would be a good starting point for new labrador retriever owners who are getting their dogs as family pets and are not familiar with basic training techniques. I'd recommend it for anyone who has never trained a dog before, or for one who is not familiar with the more gentle training methods that have become popular over the last several years (because they work!). It serves that purpose very well, even though some readers might find that their &quot;warm and fuzzy&quot; approach goes a bit far. Suggesting that you give your dog a body massage, for example, may seem a bit much for some ... or a great idea for others.In fact, probably the biggest strength of this book is that it is a solid pet training resource for all breeds. It could easily remove any mention of labrador retrievers and still hold up well.Perhaps because one (both?) of the authors is a professional dog trainer, the authors are quick to advocate hiring a professional trainer for your dog. They also suggest that busy working people obtain the services of &quot;dog sitters&quot; to take care of the pup during the day. While this may end up being very good advice in some cases, perhaps a better approach is to not buy a labrador retriever in the first place--unless you have the time and open space to train and maintain that sort of dog. Unless you are in the financial position of being able to employ a nanny for your puppy, having to hire an obedience trainer and/or daytime dog sitter is usually the desperate outcome of making a bad decision in selecting your pet. These dogs need to spend time outdoors and time with people.This is not the best book to buy if you have any intention of hunting with your dog or training it for field trials. There are a couple of very good books on the market that focus particularly on that sort of training. Check around for those.Although it is a relatively small gripe, the biggest fault that I found with this book is that the resource lists are not very robust. They seem to have been tossed in by the authors (perhaps to fulfill the &quot;formula&quot; of the publisher) as an afterthought. It gives the impression that the authors imparted their own expertise freely, but only grudgingly tossed in a few scraps of information from other sources."},{"Title":"Labrador Retrievers For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"As a person who has had the distinct pleasure of sharing my house and my life with as many as six Labrador retrievers at a time over the last 20 years (I now have four), I am acutely aware of the wonder and awe associated with getting such a wonderful companion can be. yet, sadly, I am also aware of the profound ignorance many would-be labrador-people are regarding how to select, introduce, and socialize this new member of the family.

Of what sort of proof the principle of utility is susceptibleChapter 5. Of the connexion between justice and utilityWhile much of his writing can be lengthy and occasionally difficult to understand, I find his written arguments contribute greatly to the development of logical thought. Perhaps my favorite quote from John Stuart Mill is \\"In the golden rule of Jesus of Nazareth, we read the complete spirit of the ethics of utility. To do as you would be done by, and to love your neighbor as yourself, constitute the ideal perfection of utilitarian morality.\\"And that ...\\"Happiness which forms the utilitarian standard of what is right in conduct, is not the agent's own happiness, but that of all concerned.\\"This is a great introduction to utilitarianism and use of logic."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism (The Great Books Foundation)","review":"This is my first reading of anything by Mill.

There is no answer to questions such as whether a terrorist can legitimately be tortured to reveal the location of a bomb or whether an innocent life can be sacrificed to save many lives. What the book does have, however, is Mill's revised version of utilitarianism that is important because it plays a major role in his other works such as \\"Liberty\\" and \\"Representative Government\\".Most of the book explains and agrees with Bentham's version of utilitarianism that has no place for rights and replaces the concept of good/evil with pleasure/pain, but Mill's version of utilitarianism has an important difference - the claim that some pleasures are of higher quality than others, and if this is so then utilitarianism should strive to enable everybody to enjoy the superior pleasures.Mill defines utilitarianism as the \\"Greatest Happiness Principle\\" that judges \\"that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.\\" In this he is following Bentham's definition, but Bentham had devised a \\"felicific calculus\\" to determine the amount of pleasure (and hence moral worth) arising from any given action. It depended on things such as the intensity, duration and number of people affected. Bentham did not believe that one pleasure is in any way better than another except in terms of quantity. He wrote, for example, that \\"Prejudice apart, the game of push-pin is of equal value with the arts and sciences of music and poetry.\\"Mill disagrees with this relativism, arguing that \\"some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others.\\" In other words, quality is more important than quantity. Here we see the elitism that we find in all Mill's works. He asks how one can judge between the pleasure derived by two people from different actions and an answers that the person of what he calls \\"higher faculties\\" is the one to judge, if he can understand the relative merits of both actions and the other person cannot. Translating to a modern context we might ask why Mill would believe a Shakespeare play to be \\"better\\" than a TV reality show. Mill would claim that the person of \\"higher faculties\\" who fully appreciated Shakespeare would be able to see the merits of both and hence judge, whilst the other person could only appreciate the reality show and be unable to judge.Mill seems to ditch the pleasure principle almost entirely at one point when suggesting that those with higher faculties are likely to find it more difficult to be happy because they realize the world is imperfect. But that realization does not make them envy the happiness of those with lower capabilities. In Mill's famous words\\"It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question. The other party to the comparison knows both sides.\\"It follows for Mill that if some pleasures are superior to others then it would be a good thing if more people could enjoy the higher pleasures rather than the base pleasures.

Mill's Utilitarianism as a statement of the fundamental tenets of his school is indisputable. Equally unquestionable is the great influence utilitarianism has exerted upon the development of Anglo-American moral philosophy. These facts underscore the necessity of carefully considering whether utilitarianism, as articulated by Mill, offers a sensible or persuasive account of morality.In utilitarianism, \\"utility\\" is synonymous with \\"happiness\\"; both denote \\"pleasure itself, together with exemption from pain.\\" Hence utilitarianism is also referred to as the \\"greatest happiness principle.\\" However, the latter slogan is misleading insofar as \\"greatest\\" is taken to refer merely to quantity. Mill holds that pleasures can be compared not only quantitatively but also qualitatively; \\"some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others.\\" There is an hierarchy of pleasures, and the happy life will be the life that contains the \\"greatest\\" pleasures both in the sense of the \\"best\\" or \\"highest\\" as well as the \\"most.\\"Indeed, Mill argues that the higher pleasures are such that no one who has experienced them would be willing to trade them in for \\"any quantity\\" of lower pleasures. \\"A being of higher faculties requires more to make him happy, is capable probably of more acute suffering, and certainly accessible to it at more points,\\" Mill says, \\"but in spite of these liabilities, he can never really wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence.\\" Note that this is an empirical argument which implicitly postulates that the pain and suffering caused by heightened sensitivities is outweighed by the pleasures brought on by the higher faculties. At the back of this postulate is the idea, not articulated by Mill but informing his thought, that the supreme pleasure is the pleasure associated with knowing (cf. Mill's statement that \\"[n]ext to selfishness, the principal cause which makes life unsatisfactory is want of mental cultivation\\"). Philosophers prior to Mill had taught that the different capacities for enjoyment derive from different capacities for knowing. Partly on that basis, those philosophers concluded that philosophy was the best (happiest) way of life for man.But not everyone exhibits a burning desire to be a philosopher, to put it mildly. This observation points to a fallacy in Mill's argument. From the fact (assuming it to be a fact) that no one could \\"really wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence,\\" it does not follow that no one could prefer a lower grade of existence to a higher grade of existence. Even if no one wishes to fall to a lower level of existence, it does not follow that everyone wishes to rise to a higher level of existence. For the higher faculties are not developed \\"by nature,\\" but \\"by art,\\" ie, through human effort, and most people, as Nietzsche observed, are lazy. What most people seem to want is to retain the \\"grade of existence\\" they currently enjoy, but in better conditions (better house, better car, better spouse, bigger bank account, etc.). It will not do to advert to Mill's quip about the pig and the human being and the fool and Socrates as a rejoinder. For in Chapter IV Mill explicitly holds that there are different conceptions/objects of happiness, and it is all too clear that he has no way of rank ordering those different conceptions. That account implicitly undermines the hierarchy of pleasures that he set out to establish in Chapter II. Indeed, the three objects of happiness he lists in Chapter IV (money, power and fame) would seem to be in considerable tension with utilitarian ethics altogether.That tension has its roots in Mill's incoherent attempt to derive ethics from psychology. This is a Humean criticism. Mill says that all men desire their own happiness. Happiness being the end of human action, it is also the standard of morality, which regulates human action for the benefit of all mankind. Hence the utilitarian standard, qua moral standard, \\"is not the agent's own greatest happiness, but the greatest amount [sic!] of happiness altogether.\\" But Mill does not explain how he gets from men desiring their own happiness to men acting to make other men happy. He fails to explain how a concern with being ethical can be located within his account of human beings as desiring happiness conceived as pleasure. That is, how does being concerned with living a pleasant life for myself generate a concern for acting morally? Mill attempts to ground morality in the sentiments of sympathy and sociality, but there are severe limits on the sort of ethics that can be generated by those sentiments. What this means is that Mill's doctrine fails to explain why we would take his doctrine seriously. Bluntly stated, the fact that we take Mill's ethical writings seriously is already a proof of the false foundations of Mill's ethics."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism (The Great Books Foundation)","review":"One of the Classical School economists explains and defends a system of ethics that counted among its adherents Ludwig von Mises, one of the great Austrian School economists and philosophers.Utilitarianism, in John Stuart Mill's day and our own, periodically comes under attack from the spokesmen of organized religion. But Mill holds that his philosophy is completely compatible with religious morals. Mill even writes that the founder of Christianity was a utilitarian. Makes sense when we realize that one of the main features of the early Christians was jettisoning Judaism commandments that seem to have no obvious utility (usefulness). That attitude lead them to eventually discard the entire Torah.Mill imbibed Utilitarianism from his father -- British East India Co. executive and writer James Mill -- and their friend Jeremy Bentham. The two tablets of Utilitarianism are pleasure (acquisition of) and pain (avoidance of). Reduced to one it is the \\"greatest happiness principle.\\" Mill argues persuasively that these things are more hard-wired into humans than almost everything else. The pursuit of virtue, which some in organized religion see as being at odds with Utilitarianism, is actually a form of the pursuit of happiness for the virtue-seeker, those around him/her, and/or future generations. This adds to the \\"public good,\\" which is at the peak of Mill's values pyramid.Utilitarian concepts are all over America's founding documents, especially the Constitution. Interestingly, and ironically, Mill's essay was published at the time of the Constitution's greatest crisis -- the Civil War (1863). Mill makes no mention of the crisis or America's earlier successful marriage of Utilitarianism and federalism/limited government.Mill's \\"public good\\" and the U.S. Constitution's \\"general welfare\\" clauses helped open the gates to big government, Ayn Rand and other individual rights advocates point out. Sad but true. Although his ideas contain seeds for the modern welfare state, Mill meant his public good to be best achieved by free-acting individuals getting little or no prompting from government.How does the individualized commandment of \\"love thy neighbor as thyself\\" get turned into the collectivist Social Security Administration? Perhaps the psychiatric profession can explain it. I can't."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism (The Great Books Foundation)","review":"If it was not for the fact that this book was assigned for the course, I would have thrown it onto the wall in utter frustration for the periodic-style prose in which it was written. Yet in those moments of painful reading I never let my intellect be neglectful of the realization that what lay before me belongs to the highest canon of ethical philosophizing. Mill's ornate style of writing was appropriate for his time, but to the modern reader it sometimes takes several readings to understand a difficult passage.I agree with the reviewer who noted that Chapter IV, unlike the rest of the book, is singularly almost unintelligible, not only for its long paragraphs, but also for its rambling diversions. Nevertheless, Mill's Utilitarianism should be a required reading for anyone with pretension for interests in issues of morality and social policy."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism (The Great Books Foundation)","review":"'Utilitarianism' by 19th Century English social philosopher, John Stuart Mill is the classic statement of a theory of ethics which is bases its argument primarily on the question of 'What is Good' instead of questions of obligation on which many other classic theories are based.Today, Mill's theory and Utilitarianism in general fall under the shadow of an equally famous work by English philosopher, G. E. Moore, the great analytical work 'Principia Ethica'.Utilitarianism is based on determining what is good by what provides the greatest pleasure for the greatest number of people. All by itself, this theory leaves itself open to all sorts of difficult questions about whether great good for a large number of people is worth the suffering of a single individual and all sorts of variations on this theme.Moore's argument is simply that these problems simply point up the fact that what is moral cannot be reduced to statements of fact, such as the amount of pleasure received by a number of people.Oddly enough, Moore did not kill Utilitarianism. That is why Mill's work is still studied today. Unlike scientific theories, philosophical theories, being different ways of looking at the world, never entirely loose their insights, even some of the most absurd sounding notions such as Bishop Berkeley's solipsism.Like Kant's short 'Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals', the greatest virtue of this book is that it is a classic statement of an important position by it's most famous proponent in a relatively short work.It is not easy reading, but it's length means one can read and analyze it within the course of a week, which is why professors still assign it.A very important work."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism (The Great Books Foundation)","review":"1. OverviewJohn Stuart Mill's Utilitarianism sets out a moral system that bases the good of any decision on the degree to which it promotes pleasure for the greatest number of people. By pleasure, Mill means not only those lower pleasures associated with the appetites, but also, the higher pleasures of \\"superior beings\\" that are associated with the enjoyment of understanding. The smallest amount of higher pleasure is greater than any amount of lower pleasure, for \\"It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.\\"For Mill, then, there is no inherent good in any particular object; goodness is based on each object's utility in creating pleasure. All values are thus based on feelings and sensations. There are no normative principles in human nature that we can explore as we seek to discover what creates human happiness. Rather, in determining the good, we are to determine the sums of pleasure and pain for the aggregate of society and thereby discover which of the array of options before any one decision-maker is the one that promotes the greatest amount of pleasure. The moral decision-maker will choose that course of action that leads to the greatest amount pleasure for the greatest number of people.2. Critique of MillMill's theory on ethics is riddled with problems. One of them is the inherent difficulty involved in calculating the aggregate pleasures and pains of all of the people that will be affected by a particular decision. It is a burdensome and impractical way of coming to make decisions. Even if one could come up with general rules of conduct, the calculation as to when exceptions should be applied is similarly impractical. Similarly, it is nearly impossible to ascertain the degree of pleasure to be assigned to other individuals when determining whether a particular decision should be undertaken. Individuals who appreciate the \\"superior pleasures\\" will assign many more points to a chamber orchestra concert than will those who appreciate only the base pleasures. How can one determine with certainty the degree of pain and pleasure that third parties will experience, especially when the author of a particular decision does not personally know some of these third parties?3. The \\"Utilitarian\\" Golden Rule?Mill writes that \\"a utilitarian who believes in the perfect goodness and wisdom of God, necessarily believes that whatever God has thought fit to reveal on the subject of morals, must fulfill the requirements of utility in a supreme degree.\\" He even suggests that utilitarianism is line with Christianity when he writes that \\"In the golden rule of Jesus of Nazareth, we read the complete spirit of the ethics of utility. To do as you would be done by, and to love your neighbour as yourself, constitute the ideal perfection of utilitarian morality.\\" However, Mill's generalization is problematic. Although it is often true that the pain of one's sacrifice is outweighed by the aggregate pleasure of all of those who benefit from the sacrifice (as the case of the eternal happiness of all who are saved in Christ outweighing the pain that Christ suffered on the cross), it is not always the case. For example, there would be no incentive for a utilitarian to take a bullet for another person, since the pain of the utilitarian would equal the pleasure of the person being saved. Thus, whereas the golden rule of Jesus is a rule of unconditional love, Mill's utilitarian principle allows for self-sacrifice only in those circumstances where the aggregate of the pleasure outweighs the aggregate of the pain of all those affected by a particular decision."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism (The Great Books Foundation)","review":"Utilitarianism is a moral theory based on the principle that \\"Actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.\\"Mill sees happiness as humans' primary desire; hence, it is the basis for morality and justice. In defense of utilitarianism, Mill defines and tries to validate his position by relating justice and utility and arguing that happiness is the foundation of justice. While the whole argument can be presented in many ways, Mill tried to vindicate Utilitarianism from accusations such as: not protecting individual rights, measuring every thing in life with the same standard, and over simplifying happiness.From the man who once said: \\"Whatever crushes individuality is despotism, by whatever name it may be called\\", it seems that Mill ignored the absence of individuals' appreciation in utilitarianism. Knowing that Mill was raised in a strict utilitarian environment, and the mental struggle he went through to validate his theory is key to understanding this work. Instead of judging this work as a reasonable philosophical work, the reader should approach it as Mill's introspection through which he tried to justify his belief in utilitarianism."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism (The Great Books Foundation)","review":"I have to read this along with Kant's Metaphysics as part of an ethics class and I like this translation the best."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism (The Great Books Foundation)","review":"This book was for a class I dropped, so I never read it, but I assume it's good since she's used it every semester."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism (The Great Books Foundation)","review":"Very pleased with the quality of the book and it came just in time for my class.

The theory itself is borne out of Industrial Revolution principles and comes out of modern day principles of efficiency and what is best for humanity as a whole rather than the individual (i.e. the Romantic-self vs. the Victorian society). He is trying to defend his position and from the get-go is apprehensive of what people have been saying about the theory behind happiness and its flaws. Even though this book is extremely light and small physically, it is a 71 pg. essay. This means that the language is rather complex and that the ideas are philosophical rather than plot-driven.

However, utilitarianism's many critics will find little to convince them; however ideally attractive, many practical problems arise when issues such as relative happiness and harm turn up, as well as the thorny problem of how to enforce utilitarianism and punish transgressions. Mill makes some headway, covering nearly all conceivable ground in general principles but leaving much practical application unaddressed. It may be the most spirited utilitarianism defense ever but unfortunately is not complete, however admirable in many ways. That said, it is essential for anyone interested in Mill or utilitarianism."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism (The Great Books Foundation)","review":"\\"Utilitarianism\\" gets assigned in freshman philosophy classes because it's short, well-written, and hugely influential. What else does one need to say? Perhaps only this:For sure, Mill's argument has holes. (Basically, he argues that maximizing the sum of happiness in the world must be the first principle of morals since all human actions aim at happiness. Yet even if we accept Mill's premise, his conclusion is a real leap.) And, sure, when utilitarianism is pressed to its limits, it gives rise to paradoxes beloved by philosophy profs. (Is it good for sadists to torture masochists? Can one person be killed to harvest organs for five persons? Should a judge put an innocent man in jail to defuse a lynch mob? And so forth.) But I'd still take Mill, with all his faults, over cautious, hairsplitting philosophy any day. His vision of a utilitarian society of high culture and universal benevolence was revolutionary in the Victorian Era. It still inspires today. And in the end, Mill got a lot right. Impartiality IS a key characteristic of the moral point of view. And we DO resolve many moral dilemmas by appealing to utility. It's easy to get hung up on the logical gaps in Mill's argument and ignore the core of truth. Any moral theory that doesn't give a big place to utility is seriously other-worldly.Bottomline: \\"Utilitarianism\\" is a great introduction to basic concepts of moral philosophy. Every educated person should read it. Six stars!"},{"Title":"Utilitarianism (The Great Books Foundation)","review":"Now that Amazon has changed the product description and recognized that it is soft cover, I can, perhaps, give a decent review.The text is, as are all Mill's writings, quite good. Regardless as to your agreement or disagreement, it cannot be argued that Mill does not present his points clearly, logically, and understandably. The editor's introduction is nice, though short. It is also nice that Mill's speech regarding capitial punishment was included as an appendix.The actual binding is rather flimsy, but for this low price, I'll not complain too loudly."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism (The Great Books Foundation)","review":"_Utilitarianism_ is, despite the train-wreck of the fourth chapter, one of the clearest expositions of ethical theory ever written. Anyone interested in ethics in general, or utilitarianism in particular, should be familiar with it. But then, you already knew that.As far as specifics regarding this edition: It is offered without introduction, conclusion, analytical remarks, historical context, or any of the other chaff that tends to build up around great texts. I find this refreshing; some may find it disappointing. Unfortunately, like all the books I've ever bought from the Prometheus press, it is very poorly bound. On the other hand, because this little volume is so slim (&lt;100 pages), it is at lesser risk of falling apart, or loosing pages.If you want to read Mill in a solid, cheap edition, this copy is perfect. If you want an edition that will not crumble to powder within the next 60 years, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism (The Great Books Foundation)","review":"If someone would like to know what Utilitarianism is, this is the book.But if someone thinks to find in the Utilitarianism a moral standard to follow, this is just one of the books.According to the Mill' theory, we should always act in a manner that will maximize overal happines and in this essay John Stuart Mill wrote which are the effects of each possible action we may perform.The Speech on Capital Punishment tells one of this possible action."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism (The Great Books Foundation)","review":"The foundation of consequentialist ethical theory, John Stuart Mill's Utilitarianism is a must read for anybody who wants to understand ethical theory. While we may debate what makes action right or wrong, Mill's take is one that must be acknowledged."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism (The Great Books Foundation)","review":"It was written in a lot which they didnt really mention... but its alright I only need it for one class luckily.."},{"Title":"U2: The Ultimate Encyclopedia","review":"with out a doubt a really highly informative book on every aspect of U2 from venues of tour to individual songs as well. there's nothing missed in this book what so ever a must have for any collector of U2 that really wants the full scoop along w/ a concert documentry"},{"Title":"20 Marvelous Math Tales (Grades 2-4)","review":"I use this book with my 3-5 grade resource kids. It is WONDERFUL!! The stories are cute and they are divided up according to strategies used. The students enjoy doing the problems after reading the stories because the word problems come from the story and don't just come from nowhere. This book is a must have for any teacher preparing reluctant math and/or reading students for the end of grade math tests."},{"Title":"The white woman and her valley","review":"I recently re-read this Arch Merrill classic. His use of language has a flair that is rarely experienced in modern novels. He paints a picture of the Western New York locales that I, as a native, find to be accurate yet remindful of a time when these hills, valleys, and the gorge of the Genesee River must have been so pristine and even more beautiful than today. Merrill tells of the raw truth of savage times without the gore that modern stories find necessary to include. He leaves much to the imagination while describing a multitude of detail. I love the book and the authors quaint style."}]`),L={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:R,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],x={key:0},E={key:1};function j(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",B,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),b(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",E,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",x,"See more"))],8,M)):p("",!0)])}const H=u(L,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-7eac958d"]]),C=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/51.md","filePath":"drive/51.md"}'),P={name:"drive/51.md"},J=Object.assign(P,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{C as __pageData,J as default};
