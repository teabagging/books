If you turned your head or missed a comment, you could miss vital information. It took me awhile to read and I'm usually a quick reader, but this is a great thing. There was obviously so much research done to complete this book, specifically Chapter 11 with random information on how animal parts are used in everyday items. It was almost depressing to find out that things that I would never even think of involving animals are used (ex. coffins and tennis rackets). I actually put that random fact on a message board about sports. The chapter on slaughterhouses turned my stomach so much that I had trouble not gagging on my way to work (when I was reading it). If I wasn't a vegetarian already, I sure would've been one now. I also understand where the vegetarians are coming from who won't eat food that is a little too much like meat. I used to eat food such as this to ease my way into vegetarianism, but now it makes me slightly uncomfortable. Information on dieting, animal cruelty, healthy living, the real definition of omnivore, and every single rebuttal you can think of for someone who attacks a vegetarian/vegan is covered in this book. Speaking of comebacks, while I was sitting under the hair dryer at my beauty salon, my beautician made the mistake of saying \\"God created animals for a reason.\\" My brain started churning ready to hit her with every single fact that I've basically memorized in this book about animal cruelty. I dare somebody to challenge my diet now. Outstanding! I'm recommending it to everybody I know."},{"Title":"Byzantium","review":"This book is John Haldon's approach to a short Byzantine history for the general reader, and he does a good job of it. It is a scholarly book void of sensationalism, but without a lot of scholarly apparatus; for example, there are only seven brief footnotes. The book has a nice selection of maps delineating the the territorial vacilations of the empire over time, plus some additional maps showing things like trade routes. The book is printed on slick paper and so is able to include a large section of color plates. There are eight chapters in the book, two of which are narrative, while the remaining six are devoted to Byzantine institutions, culture, and society. The narrative chapters divide at 741, and give a fairly complete overview of Byzantine history. I did notice a few places in the book where better copy editing would have helped--at the bottom of p45 an emperor seems to be deposing himself, and there were a few sentences that appeared to be missing verbs, though their meaning was clear. Among recent books, this book most closely compares to Treadgold's &quot;Concise History&quot;. The major difference betwen the two is that Treadgold is 75% narrative and 25% society, whereas Haldon reverses these percentages. I prefer narrative history, but found Haldon's book very readable and quite useful on its own terms. I'm glad I have both books in my library."},{"Title":"The Anglo-Norman Nobility in the Reign of Henry I: The Second Generation (Middle Ages Series)","review":"Newman, a noted scholar of the Norman period, came to history by way of a childhood fascination with her own family's history, and her work combines a deep interest in the lives of individuals with a profound understanding of the need for sociopolitical context. This book grew out of her dissertation, fostered by such luminaries as Warren Hollister and Joel Rosenthal, and it's an excellent social-biographical overview of the people who built the 12th century in Britain, using Helihy's \\"generational\\" methods. Successive chapters discuss the nature of the Anglo-Norman family unit and the world in which it existed, the mechanics of royal service and the royal patronage which was its reward, and the strategies which successful nobles adopted in furthering their careers and family status. An interesting appendix also discusses at length \\"The Problem of the Bastard\\" -- not a small subject under Henry I!"},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"I bought this book for a children's reading group.

First published in 1678, this 330 year old allegory written by John Bunyan while incarcerated for preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ without a license is as pertinent today as it was when it was written.Quick ReviewThis book is an essential read because of its simplicity and its depth. The Christian reader will identify quickly with the main character and many (if not all depending on the readers disciplined walk) of the people, places, and themes encountered.

(soon to be posted on my website) He spells out very clearly how to do this. This is information that is not really spelled out in other books.

He teaches you all kinds of strange things to do to improve your painting technique, from what kind of pets to keep in your studio (spiders) to how deal with not having the crutch of a grid system when drawing from the model (use actual crutches).I'm not sure whether he's totally serious about all of this or if his tongue is in cheek, but all of it is highly entertaining. Many of the colors and materials that he writes about are no longer made or difficult to find, but it's still worth reading just for entertainment purposes. His drawing and much of the painting advice is solid, and there is truth in all 50 of his secrets, no matter how outlandish they may seem. His drawing and much of the painting advice is solid.

The show was an eye-opener to someone who basically knew Dali for his significance as a surrealist as described in art history courses, and for his limp watches depicted on tourist shop posters in Greenwich Village.I did not know Dali the genius, the intellectual, and the wit who wrote this book. This is a brilliant book, which I am not qualified on any level to describe. But if you enjoy clever, original writing, or being allowed into the head of a genius, or are a serious artist who wants confirmation of the colors never to invite to &#34;the ballroom&#34; of your palette, this book is a joy.

And I was pleasantly surprised - it's a wonderful read AND aims at the utmost historical correctness possible without letting that dry up its author's imagination. Straightforward style, absolutely credible characters and strong feelings without kitsch make this book the perfect start for, say, people who saw Verdi's &quot;Don Carlos&quot; at the opera and want to know more about the people featuring in it. Given that research on Philip II is still sometimes recurring to legends and prejudices because the truth simply can't be found out anymore, Kate O'Brien's approach to this period in Spanish history and to Philip's character is as true as any and probably fairer than a professional historian's.

However, I'm not going to dwell on his writings on Canada (nothing against Canadians) instead I am going to focus more on his anti-slavery and reform essays.The first Thoreau essay following Canada is Slavery in Massachusetts, which is a really fascinating essay that captures the essence of Thoreau's stance on the particular institution within the state. Thoreau touches upon a lot of interesting subjects such as law, justice, Anthony Burns, etc., that people really should look into for their incredible insight. He seemed to become disillusioned with state politics [Massachusetts], expressing his disdain for the governor and the incidents surrounding the treatment of slaves and free blacks. He also goes on to describe what seemed to be the detachment of the people to the issues of slavery facing Massachusetts. More people became enthralled with the politics of Nebraska, etc. a fact Thoreau found troubling as they went about their business ignoring issues like the impact of the Fugitive Slave Laws, etc.Probably his most famous essay, Civil Disobedience, which had considerable influence over people like Martin Luther King to Mahatma Gandhi is contained in this book and should be read. Also, contained in this volume are two essays on John Brown entitled, \\"The Last Days of John Brown\\" and \\"A Plea for Captain John Brown\\" which he describes as a man who \\"has earned immortality.\\"Time constraints keep me from writing a detailed review, that being said the essays contained in this book were an interesting read and people should really check them out.More to come later."},{"Title":"NASA's Voyager Missions: Exploring the Outer Solar System and Beyond (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"The book is an excellent overview of the Voyager missions sent to explore the largest planets of our solar system: Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune and Uranus. The book gives a complete account of the spacecrafts' respective journeys and their discoveries but most important the author also brings up-to-date information that has been gathered since the Voyagers executed their fly-bys of those distant moons (information gathered via ground-based telescopes, Hubble and other spacecraft like Galileo). Although the Cassini spacecraft now orbiting planet Saturn will certainly add more information about the planet and its moons than the book contains, this work will remain as a true reference for a long time.The books is solid account of what we know of our solar system."},{"Title":"NASA's Voyager Missions: Exploring the Outer Solar System and Beyond (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"In the last decade Springer-Praxis has published a significant number of new titles on the history of space exploration. Some are better than others, of course, and unfortunately this is not one of the more notable entries in the series. Written for the non-specialist, \\"NASA's Voyager Missions\\" offers a general introduction to what turned out to be a stunning \\"grand tour\\" of the outer gas giants of the solar system in the latter 1970s and 1980s. The basics of the story are present including the mission's origins in the 1960s, its launch in 1977, encounters with the outer planets, and the scientific windfall that resulted from the mission. This work also discusses the individuals who devoted their entire working lives to them, from the planetary work of the 1970s and 1980s to the recent Voyager Interstellar Mission.These missions, launched from Kennedy Space Center in 1977 were intended only to image Jupiter and Saturn as they flew by, essentially a windshield tour. As the mission progressed, with the successful achievement of all its early objectives, additional flybys of the two outermost giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, proved possible--and irresistible--to mission scientists. Eventually, between them, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 explored all the giant outer planets, 48 of their moons, and the unique systems of rings and magnetic fields those planets possess. The two Voyagers took well over 100,000 images of the outer planets, rings, and satellites, as well as millions of magnetic, chemical spectra, and radiation measurements. Without question, they returned information to Earth that revolutionized the science of planetary astronomy.This work is suited for introductory history and science classes, but it is too unsophisticated for the serious student. It leaves unanswered a myriad of questions, and fails to explore issues of interest to historians. Unfortunately, the full history of this mission still awaits its historian. There are some other good works on the subject but those also fail to tell the story fully. Among those other books are Henry C. Dethloff and Ronald A. Schorn, \\"Voyager's Grand Tour: To the Outer Planets and Beyond\\" (Smithsonian Institution Press, 2003); Robert S. Kraemer, \\"Beyond the Moon: Golden Age of Planetary Exploration 1971-1978\\" (Smithsonian Institution Press, 2001); and David W. Swift, \\"Voyager Tales: Personal Views of the Grand Tour\\" (American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 1997). These other works should be read along with \\"NASA's Voyager Missions\\" to gain a more rounded portrait of the Voyagers missions and their accomplishments."},{"Title":"NASA's Voyager Missions: Exploring the Outer Solar System and Beyond (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"This book, as was to be expected from a volume in the excellent Springer-Praxis series in astronomy and space sciences, is absolute quality. Although I haven't read its American \`competitor' Voyager's Grand Tour by Henry C. Dethloff, I cannot believe that it could be done better than this. Especially if you're interested in the scientific aspects (planetary science, that is) of the Voyager missions, you won't be disappointed. It's all very well covered, extensively, with lots of interesting details and totally up-to-date (Galileo results are included in the discussions and there's a preview of the Cassini and JIMO (to Jupiter's moons) missions). The author may not be a planetary scientist himself, he is definitely an excellent science writer, offering an approach that's technical and detailed (and \`problem-conscious') enough to satisfy even professional astronomers while he's writing in such a way so as to convey the sheer excitement of solar system exploration in every sentence. Very readable also, nowhere dry or dull.The book is more heavily focused on the scientific results of the voyager missions than it is on the technical, engineering parts of it, but that is really not a problem. Most of the on-board instrumentation of the Voyager probes is explained well enough. The book has a lot of stunning black-and-white photographs and many illustrations and diagrams, and it even features a middle section with 13 colour plates. There's a bibliography and also a huge list of useful internet resources. All in all a great book. Very, very much recommended! Don't let yourself be scared off by its considerable price. It's worth every penny."},{"Title":"NASA's Voyager Missions: Exploring the Outer Solar System and Beyond (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"The Voyager 1 & 2 missions launched in 1977 revolutionised our knowledge of the outer solar system. This book summarises the missions, how they were planned and executed, what when wrong and what worked better than expected.Most of all it explains what we learnt about the planets that we never knew before. Except for Galileo's recent sojourn at Jupiter, and Cassini's introduction to Saturn, the Voyagers have provided practically all our knowledge of the giant planets of the outer Solar System and their moons. What the Voyagers provided just cannot be measured from Earth based telescopes, even telescopes like the HST in Earth orbit. There is just no substitute for getting in close with an array of instruments.The book starts with a bit of history about mankind's discovery of the nature of the solar system with a specially good section on the discovery of the new planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The historical encounters of John Adams (who was one of two who predicted the position of the as yet undiscovered Neptune) with George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who couldn't be bothered looking, were particularly of interest.The exploration program was initially planned as a 'Grand Tour' with two launches to Jupiter, Saturn then Pluto followed by two launches to Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune. However funding these missions was competing with the development of the Space Shuttle, and the inevitable happened, budget cuts. Even with the reduction in funds, the opportunity could still not be missed, as the optimal alignment of the planets for taking advantage of such a progressive gravitational slingshot would not reoccur until the twenty second century, the 'chance of three lifetimes' for sure. A reduced budget mission was eventually given approval.Of surprise to this reader was that the final Voyager missions (the name was not chosen until shortly before launch) were initially planned as Jupiter plus Saturn missions only, due of course to funding restrictions. The final configuration of the space craft was very different from those of the earlier 'Grand Tour' plans which had included the drop off of a probe into the atmosphere of Jupiter, finally executed by Galileo decades later. The final Voyagers were closely related to the successful Mariner series.While some interesting background detail is provided on the spacecraft themselves, their power, computer and instrumentation systems, and the intensity of the mission planning debates at the time of each encounter, the planets of course are the stars of the book. Evans & Harland spend over 50 pages discussing the discoveries at Jupiter, 40 pages on Saturn and its rings, and almost 30 pages each on Uranus and Neptune and their unusual collection of moons.With Jupiter, both the Voyager's discoveries and the more recent additions to our knowledge from Galileo are covered. Cassini of course is in the process of re-writing the history of our knowledge of Saturn and its environs. But don't let that disturb you. Cassini will take at least four years to make its discoveries, and this book is such a thoroughly good read, you should read it now. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Down Weavers Lane (Windsor Selection)","review":"This author knows how to write a great book, in the times that we did not know and take us to that time and live it.

You may have seen puzzles with some of these unusual formats in the pages of Games Magazine, and now you can tackle a complete book of them. The collection contains a generous variety of different puzzle types, each with its unique word placement rules and challenges. Many of them have unconventional, visually pleasing grids that include honeycombs, triangles, weaves, three dimensional cubes, and spirals. Words might be entered diagonally, in a circle, snaking through the grid, or wrapping around the edges. In some puzzles, two or more letters may be entered in every square. In others, there are identical grids with multiple clue sets, and it is up to you to determine which grid the words go into. Words weave, overlap, and intersect with each other in novel ways. Give these puzzles a try!Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"Twisted Crosswords","review":"If you've been a reader of Games Magazine, you'll recognize the format of many of these crosswords. Instead of marching left to right and top to bottom as a normal crossword does, you'll find all sorts of variations: answers arranged in circles, multiple letters in a box and some where you don't even know where to start the answer.The puzzles themselves are well done, although the introduction and explanation for some of the puzzles leaves a little room for improvement. Once you see how a particular kind of puzzle is intended to be filled in it's fairly straightforward, but with some of them the instructions are quite vague and almost seem to assume you already know how to do the puzzle and the instructions are simply pro-forma.If you're intrigued by unusual word puzzles, this book is definitely for you. Due to the way that the puzzles are organized, although the clues are not always too difficult, not knowing a few of them can make a puzzle very tricky to solve. These are definitely not for someone who gets easily frustrated."},{"Title":"Sally Goes Traveling Alone","review":"The book \\"Sally Goes Traveling Alone\\" was my daughter's favorite book when she was pre-school age.

Unlike most modern page-turners, this one is based on ancient stories that include elements of magic and mysticism that go beyond even that found in today's fantasy and science fiction genres. Yet there is an unmistakable moral to each story that inspires the reader to look within and take his own measure. It's both inspiring and really fun to read, so much so that my older children loved it. Mystical Stories from the Mahabharata brought us a lot of joy; we highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Mystical Stories from the Mahabharata","review":"The main story of the Mahabharata is of the Pandava princes and their eventual victory over evil with the help of Krishna. But the Mahabharata is full of many smaller stories, generally told by various characters to illustrate a moral, spiritual, or philosophical point. This book tells some of those stories in a delightful and exciting way, so that modern readers can easily relish this ancient classic of India. It's great for both children and adults."},{"Title":"Mystical Stories from the Mahabharata","review":"&quot;Mystical Stories from the Mahabharata&quot; is Amala Bhakta's latest hot set of tales from ancient India. He's chosen 20 gripping tales of adventure with purpose: to convey the long lost morality, heroism, wisdom and virtue that only the spiritual yogis and great kings of ancient India can deliver- and with a punch, because instead of telling us how to live, the characters in these stories live lives so noble and meaningful we have only to enjoy the story and our minds are automatically pushed into transcendence. This book a must for persons who are pursuing yoga and want to know what is it's background. This book is imperative to read for those who are exploring human sexuality and want to understand the divine characteristics and pastimes of the angels and devas of the higher planets. A warrior gains yogic powers to be invincible in battle. A spiritually-empowered woman curses a rapist to die. An old yogi renews his body through mystic power. A conversation between two queens about the secrets powers of womanhood. The stories in this new collection awaken our eternal inner search for the divine."},{"Title":"Mystical Stories from the Mahabharata","review":"Imagine a book of short stories that combine the wonders of Science fiction and fantasy genres and yet whose core is a very clear and moral message similar to the best of fables?

These stories are bound to inspire them to be heroes and warriors dedicated to good and honorable actions.

It gives a review of the discovery and dating of the dead sea scrolls, then moves on into an analysis of the sect of the scrolls (essenes) and later on into possible influence of Christian movement. The volume is very readable and should hold the interest of any who choose to read it.

For those seeking spiritual enlightenment and a reconciliation of the scrolls with their faith, this book will give them a scholarly interpretation of the scrolls relationship to the Holy Scriptures and the origins of Christianity.The book includes a few drawings, maps and photos for clarification as well as a bibliography.The author, A Powell Davies, was a pastor in Washington DC and has written several other books based on the Christian religion."},{"Title":"The character, claims, and practical workings of Freemasonry","review":"Charles Finney makes and excellent argument against the teachings of Freemasonry. He gives a clear warning that the teachings of Freemasonry, and their practices and principles are not compatible with Biblical Christianity. Freemasonry has their own plan of salvation apart from God's Son, as can be clearly seen in the rituals of the 3rd degree (master mason), as well as in their burial ceremony: these teach that all \\"good masons\\" can attain the \\"great lodge in the sky\\" through their good works. This is an old scheme of the enemy to confuse people, and is clearly not taught in the Bible. Salvation is only by God's grace and forgiveness, not by following the example of a legendary mythical man (Hiram Abif). Much can be said on this topic,,,just read the book and it is a good start in your quest for truth regarding Freemasonry's teachings."},{"Title":"The character, claims, and practical workings of Freemasonry","review":"I am just now finishing up this book, and I have been fairly pleased with it. I have been trying to understand more about the mason organization especially since my great grandfather was a high ranking mason, most of the preachers in my hometown are masons, and I have many friends who are masons or who have been asked to become masons. The first book that I read on the subject was a book by the name of Mysterious Monuments written by Texe Marrs and the second book was The New World Order by Epperson. Out of all of these books, I would probably recommend Finney's book the least. I believe if I had to do it over I would have started with Epperson's book even though the timeline that the cult leaders were presenting at that time failed it is still a very informative book, I believe I would follow it up with this book, and I would finish with Texe Marrs book (just because this book gives you signs to recognize the cultish beliefs that the other two books establish). This book focuses mainly on the so-called Christian freemasonry. Once you read this book though, you will find out that there is no such thing as Christian freemasonry because masons take oaths to cover up the crimes of other masonic brothers. We can all agree that this is a sin therefore unchristian. In addition to this, Finney brings up the fact that Christians are not supposed to take oaths especially oaths upon the penalty of death. This is a fact not emphasized in church much anymore but it used to be very important to the early christians in this nation. He focuses on this point for quite a while; however if you can get through this point repeated over and over, he will get to the universalist nature of the masonic cult. He will also cover how some of the higher ranks of freemasonry consider the church as the enemy. Marrs and Epperson take this point a little further to their belief that masons are actually a satanistic cult when you get to the higher levels. They really make a good point with solid evidence. I think it is good to read this book because Finney was a mason at one time. Also Finney was one of the leading preachers in the great awakening here in the United States. It is good to have a source with such credibility. This is not to knock the credibility of the other books because Texe Marrs is an author who has one of the highest registered I.Q. scores in our nation. Therefore, he is not an idiot. Finney and Marrs differ on a point of whether george washington was an active mason. George Washington denied this accusation in a personal letter that Finney reproduces in his book; however, George did admit that he had attended a few meetings throughout his lifetime. The influx of the illuminati (which George Washington feared) into freemasonry has really warped masonry over the past two centuries; however, they are a very big part of freemasonry. They are some of the main leaders of freemasonry currently so I say that the illuminati and freemasonry should now be considered one and the same. Well, I think this lets you get the point of the book. I think it is an important read in a Christian's searching of what exactly is the true nature of freemasonry."},{"Title":"Islamic Fatawa regarding Women","review":"\\"Shari'ah rulings given by the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia Sheikh Ibn Baz, Sheikh Ibn Uthaimin, Sheikh Ibn Jibreen and others: (First edition: 1996C.E./1417H, 391 pages, Darussalem Pub., Saudi Arabia; Compiled by: Muhammad bin Abdul-Aziz Al-Musnad; Translated by: Jamaal Al-Din Zarabozo) Contents: 1-Questions related to Aqidah (Faith) [23 topics], 2-Questions related to Knowledge [2 topics], 3-Questions related to Physical Purification [20 topics], 4-Questions related to Menstruation & Post-partum Bleeding [21 topics],5-Questions related to Prayer [35 topics], 6-Questions related to Funerals [6 topics], 7-Questions related to Zakat [16 topics], 8-Questions related to Fasting [3 topics], 9-Questions regarding Hajj and Umrah [16 topics], 10-Questions related to the Sacrifice [3 topics], 11-Questions related to Marriage [40 topics], 12-Questions related to relations between the spouses [12 topics], 13-Questions related to Breast-feeding [2 topics], 14-Questions related to Divorce [4 topics] 15-Questions related to the Waiting Period (Iddah) and Mourning [10 topics], 16-Questions related to Oaths and Vows [8 topics], 17-Questions related to expiation for a Broken oath [4 topics], 18-Questions related to injurious crimes [2 topics], 19-Questions related to Hijab Dress and adornment [50 topics], 20-Questions related to being dutiful to one's parents [3 topics], 21-Questions related to supplications [3 topics], and 22-Questions of a Miscellaneous Nature [80 topics]-including: women driving cards, alcoholism, removing hairs, aurah, dogs, plastic surgery, henna, gold containing etchings, buying new gold, suicide, birth control, and much more.

All the students have internships, and we meet once a week to discuss their experiences. This is the perfect textbook-they already know how to translate; what they need to know is how to do so as a career. They won't learn that from introductory translation books (which are very good at what they do); no introductory textbook is going to tell you to join the American Translators Association and buy a CAT program!If you're looking for a book to teach you to translate, this isn't it. This book is geared towards people who have already started working in the field: it deals with where and how to get work, what fields need translators, where to find T&I; classes, useful dictionaries, professional organizations, and so on. If you've been working as a translator for awhile, you'll probably know everything in the first half of the book (though it will still be useful for the appendices). The people who will benefit most from this book are those who have started translating professionally or are seriously considering doing so and want something to show what the experience of being a translator is actually about.Unfortunately this book isn't as \\"updated\\" as it could be.

Blackmail, intrigue, political shenanigans and many a twist in the tale follow, resulting in a book that's impossible to put down after the first couple of pages. Sexual encounters over the Internet, by telephone and in person(s); this is erotic fiction at its finest.

The attention to detail is outstanding, even down to the description of the settings, and the emotions that drive the lust leap out from every page.Published under Virgin Publishing's Black Lace series, A Scandalous Affair is ostensibly written and marketed for women.

Without too much soul searching Olivia decides 'whats good for the goose is .... ' well you now, and she strikes out revenge herself and ultimaelty make him pay.

The author had an incredible bias against Adolf Hitler and it gushes out in every chapter. According to this book, anything that Hitler did was the most evil, demented or terrible thing in all of history. When Hitler did ordinary things, or showed kindness, the author criticizes these as well.Unless you want to read a book that is dedicated to Hitler bashing, I would stay away from this one. You will learn absolutely nothing, except disproven lies, from it. I am not quite sure how people can get away with publishing such discredited information and call it history."},{"Title":"A Concise Biography of Adolf Hitler","review":"Besides the Bible this is my favorite book. Though I wish there was a little more about his childhood,it still focused on main categories of his life.It not only focused on Hitler but his main associates.This Biography shows how truly vile,distgusting,and sickly funny,or entertaining the subject on Hitler really is.I mean he led people to commit suicide,video taped his victims getting murdered(watched it repeatedly),refrained from having sex,and supposedly liked women to use him as a toilet. I honestly find the story of Hitler fascinating,although I think they could have had illustrations throughout the book.This did exactly what a books job is,wich is to transport you to another time and place.I honestly think Adolf Hitler was the AntiChrist,because he fits the description better than anyone in History.It is said that the antichrist would refrain from having sex,or be a homosexual,would be a malicious dictater(a slaughterer),and would be more of a political man,rather than do it out of religeous purposes ( like Osama bin Laden).I think the first AntiChrist was Napolean,the second Hitler,and the third Saddam Hussein.It is even said that Hitler was the only other person in history besides Frederick the Great that had the exact same head shape,and size as Napolean.And just look at the three i mentioned as the antichrist's,there all short,stubby and evil dictators.I wonder who he will be next.The reason Osama's not the Antichrist is because he is very religeous,believes in God,is not a homosexual,and hasn't refrained from having sex,I know this because he has many children.And isn't doing this out of political reason's but religeous.So as u see he doesn't fit the description very well.Anybody who says the things in these books are false,need to prove it,or else your just defending Hitler's rep,and therefore a Nazi.Don't take what i said to seriously,and try not to be offended as a result of me typing this in my review.Anyway's,anyone who reads this needs to read my review on 23 Minutes In Hell(wich i would not recommend reading because it's the worst book i've ever read,and anyone who believes Bill Wiese's account on his supposed trip to Hell is much too gullible,and needs to come to terms with the real world).Just remmember,in order to defeat your enemy u have to know your enemy."},{"Title":"A Concise Biography of Adolf Hitler","review":"This book was great it is a good way to get the German perspective on the war.

There was actually a Jew that he spared and appreciated and he loved animals.

The book finishes with very short biographies of some of the leader's friends. The one true stenghth of this book is it causes the reader to want to know more about the subject.Even with this said there are some weaknesses with the book. The first is the fact that each chapter is a separate section within itself, which means there is not a unity that flows from chapter to chapter. This in turn, leads to a difficult readability and almost encourages the reader to stop after each chapter instead of wanting to read the whole book. This is compounded even more by the author's need to insert the phrase &quot;See Chapter 3&quot; or &quot;See Chapter 8&quot;, which might have seemed helpful at the beginning but after the tenth repetition it became an unwanted and dreaded statement. Secondly, there is a complete absence of pictures, or maps. This forces the reader to count on the author to illustrate images through the use of words. A practice that Mr. Fuchs fails to complete. For example, the author only attempts to describe Heinrich Himmler as the &quot;one with pince-nez glasses&quot; and yet he than tries to give a 4 page biography about the complex German SS captain.Even with these weaknesses the book is still an informative piece of historical data. It must also be noted that the source index stretches out over 80 plus pages. The author justifies this by saying he wishes for the readers to use his book as a &quot;stepping stone&quot; for further research. This leads this reviewer to wonder what Thomas Fuchs could have done if he had expanded his research and maybe had not so hastily rushed to the publisher.Pro: 1) Stepping stone for Hitler researchCons: 1) Fragmented chapters, lack of unity 2) Lack of maps and illustrations 3) Research could have been expanded throughout the book"},{"Title":"A Concise Biography of Adolf Hitler","review":"The life Of Adolph Hitler is a facinating journey which has become riddled with myths by our popular culture. While adjectives such as evil and maniacal accurately describe Hitler, he was also a very intelligent man. Thomas Fuchs attemtps to dispell many of the myths, and bring out the truth with this book.Hitler seems to have be obsessed with creating poltical change since his career in art failed. Hitler also had other fascinations aside from anti-semitism (which was not his original idea). The book suggests Hitler to be a hypochondriac, which is somewhat beleiveable whether or not you believe that he had syphillis and bad teeth. Also, Fuchs discusses Hitler's obsession with wolfs, often seeing himself as sort of a lone wolf.My only objetion with this book is that it tends to be redundant at times. However, this is mostly due to the encyclopedia-like format of the book.For a reader that desires to learn more about perhaps the most hypnotically potent speaker in the history of humankind, this book is an excellent place to start. Many of the other Hitler biographies carry on far to long."},{"Title":"A Concise Biography of Adolf Hitler","review":"This is unquestionably the ultimate resourse on a very complex individual. Formatted in a user-freindly encyclopedic style, this book details everything that was but never should-have-been concerning Hitler's entire life. Author Fuchs digs up some amazingly obscure facts about the much-chronicled Hitler. Most impressive are the chapters concerning his family life. I have personally used this volume numerous times for historical research, and insist this book used by all those interested in learning the truth behind Adolf Hitler."},{"Title":"A Concise Biography of Adolf Hitler","review":"This is a review of A CONCISE BIOGRAPHY OF ADOLF HITLER by Thomas Fuchs. I have the paperback edition published in New York by Berkley Books in 2000. It's a new edition with a new PREFACE and introduction. The original was published in 1990 by Fountain under the title THE HITLER FACT BOOK.The author seems to value his privacy. All I could learn about him is that he's a German journalist and pretty well informed about the Fuhrer. We learn, for example, that Hitler had an armored hat and serious problems with flatulence.I enjoy insights like that, but found myself wondering why so little had been included about Hitler's childhood, his reported homosexuality and his views on religion. Was he a neo-paganist like Himmler or a \\"materialist\\" like Alan Bullock described?Mr. Fuchs attempted a very difficult task. His CONCISE BIOGRAPHY OF ADOLF HITLER is designed to be a reference tool, but he's run into the same problem other authors encounter with this format.Should his entries be longer and more comprehensive or shorter and more numerous? There's no right answer to this question. It all depends on what the reader likes. I like shorter entries with lots of collateral references. Mr. Fuchs doesn't oblige me, but I did find the book useful anyway and it has a very handy chronology as well as end notes, bibliography and index. It's also interesting to see a biography of Hitler by a German. Joachim Fest's landmark biography of Hitler came out in 1973 and is the only other postwar biography by a German that I've read other than Lothar Machtan's HIDDEN HITLER which came out in 2001.I believe the index could have been more complete and this book would be a better reference tool if the author had included a lot more collateral references. I liked it, though, and gave it four stars for its usefulness."},{"Title":"A Concise Biography of Adolf Hitler","review":"I don't think you could come up with any question about Hitler -- no matter how silly, serious or obscure -- which isn't answered in this book. You can try, but you probably won't succeed. My young nephew was assigned this book in a college level history course. When I was in college, none of the history books we were forced to read were anywhere near as entertaining (if I can use that word about Hitler) and down-right fascinating as this one. It is carefully researched and documented, scholarly, without ever being the least pedantic. Even if you think you already know enough about Hitler, I highly recommend you read this book."},{"Title":"A Concise Biography of Adolf Hitler","review":"\\"A Concise Biography of Adolf Hitler\\" is a short and inexpensive 276 page book dealing with varous aspects of the life of the subject. We learn some obscure facts on the Fuhrer as well as many well known aspects about the life of the World War I corporal who became one of the worst dictators in human history.Hitler (1889-1945) ruled Germany though terror fromn 1933 to his suicide on April 30, 1945 in his bunker deep under Berlin. Among fascinating facts about Hitler reported in Fuch's book are:a. Hitler was a rabid Anti-Semite. In came from an area of Austria where hatred of the Jews was part of the culture.b. Hitler was a failed landscape artist who enjoyed making architectural plans for the new Germany he wanted to create.c. Hitler was not a homosexual; he had a large collection of pornography. He was in love with his niece Geli Raubel who committed suicide in 1931. Hitler wed Eva Braun only 36 hours before their joint suicide in Berlin. The young woman had been his mistress for several years. She was apolitical and a simple minded person.d. Hitler was a passionate speaker though he spoke with a raspy voice due to the gas he had inhaled during World War I.e.Hitler won the Iron Cross First Class for service as a messenger in the Great War.f. Hitler suffered from stomach ailments, flatulence and tremors. His health worsened as World War II turned against Germany.g. Hilter worshipped Richard Wagner as a musical god but did not care much for Mozart, Beethoven and Brahms. He also liked light operatic music by the likes of Franz Lehar. He was an excellent whistler. Hitler enjoyed the theatre and had a large library. He was the author of \\"Mein Kampf\\" from which he made millions. This autobiography was a bestseller,h. Though he nevere learned to drive, Hitler loved to ride in fast cards and promoted the development of the Volkswagen car.i. Hilter loved dogs more than people. He trained his dog Blondi to do amazing tricks. He had Blondi poisoned to test out the poison he would use in his own suicide on April 30, 1945 in his Berlin Bunker.j. HItler had a fierce temper though he did not chew carpeting! He distrusted his generals. There were many assassination attempts on his life; the most notable was the July 30, 1944.k.This little book also contains chapters on the infamous life and career of Hitler's chief paladins in crime: Joseph Goebbels who headed the Propaganda Ministry; Heinrich Himmler head of the S.S. and death camps and Herman Goering who led the Luftwaffe.The book is written in simple English on a high school comprehension level.. As an old Hitler buff who has read the works of authors such as John Toland, Ian Kershaw; Allan Bullock and many others I knew most of the material contained within Fuch's work. It would be valuable, however, for someone new to the study of the horrible Hitler. The book has a good bibligraphy of useful books on Hitler as well as extensive footnotes. It lacks any photos or maps. This little work is a good place to start in your study of the Fuhrer."},{"Title":"A Concise Biography of Adolf Hitler","review":"Any book with the name of Adolph Hitler in the title is bound to catch the eye of all Germanophiles - serious and semi-serious - and those people will grab this book off the shelf, automatically. It is only 195 pages, and so, is not really a serious biography of Hitler - but it is, nevertheless, a very readable book , especially for those who are already somewhat familiar with Hitler and German history - which means, I guess, sadly, mainly for just those people over 60.Nevertheless, there are many people with a sense of history who will remember that Hitler was an Austrian-born megalomaniac with mesmerizing oratorical skills, who after fighting in the trenches in World War I gravitated to politics and eventually - in 1933 - rose to become the leader (eventually the dictator) - the \\"Fuehrer\\" - of Germany. Hitler was determined to right all the wrongs he thought Germany had been subjected to following the Treaty of Versailles, to restore the German economy, to establish Germany as the leading country of the world, to establish the German Third Reich (Empire)which was to endure one thousand years (it lasted 12) and to purify the German Aryan race - which, for various reasons, required the elimination of the Jewish population - wherever and whenever the opportunity permitted. While this book contains bits and pieces of that unbelievable saga, it deals with none of those issues in any great detail.What author Fuchs does focus upon in his little book is certain trivia, personal ideosyncracies and eccentricities of Hitler that he judges will be of interest to fans of Hitlerand German history. Fuchs divides his book into 35 short chapters (5-10 pages per), which makes for easy reading. A sample of some of the chapter headings will illustrate the variety of subjects that Fuchs deals with: Hitler's mustache, his dog, his book (\\"Mein Kampf\\" (\\"My Struggle\\"), Nazi party stuff ( songs, flags, uniforms, greetings, titles, etc.), the \\"People's Car\\" (Volkswagen), Hitler, the orator, Hitler's women friends, Hitler, the hypochondriac, Hitler's diet, his dentist, his wardrobe, his reading habits, his tastes in movies, his artistic passions, his money, his anti-Semitism, his relationships with Goering, Goebbles, and Himmler - and more.The book also contains some 38 pages of notes (but no foot notes), 8 pages of bibliography (containing titles of some more serious biographies of Hitler) and a 26-page chronology of the major events that transpired during Hitler's life - private andpolitical. The book is in its way entertaining - and reading this book might prompt the reader to move on to other, more serious, more comprehensive books on these matters."},{"Title":"A Concise Biography of Adolf Hitler","review":"Very different, not really about the war so much but more about the personality traits& daily habits of Hitler told by those that were employed by him.Easy read, short chapters about the Fuher's weirdness."},{"Title":"A Concise Biography of Adolf Hitler","review":"Just a concise book about Hitler,You don't have to like him or hate him, but the book is so great because it just tells you all about his likes and dislikes.

He participated in India's struggle for independence, courting imprisonment. In the fifties heled a movement warning against the growing danger international communism presented to the newly won freedom of thecountry. Around 1957, Mr. Swarup took to a life of meditation and spiritual reflection and since then he has made a deepstudy of the scriptures of different religious traditions.Mr. Swarup lives in Delhi. He is a noted writer in many fields. His previous books and brochures include &quot;Communism andPeasantry: Implications of Collective Agriculture for Asian Countries&quot;, &quot;Foundations of Maoism&quot; and &quot;Buddhism vis a visHinduism&quot;. His &quot;Gandhism and Communism&quot; shows how to defend freedom without jeopardizing peace; it stresses the needto raise the struggle against communism from a military to a moral and ideological level. The brochure caught the attention ofmany congressmen, and some of its ideas were adopted by the Eisenhower administration in its agenda for the GenevaConference in 1955. *****************************************************************************In the language of Moslem theologians, Islam is a 'complete' and 'completed' religion, dealing not merely with theologicalmatters but with all aspects of the believer's life, and superseding all previously revealed religions, such as Judaism andChristianity. Islam has two primary sources: the Koran, comprising the revelations vouchsafed to the Prophet Mohammed byAllah and the &quot;Hadis&quot;, an extensive body of authentic traditions focusing on Mohammed's personal life and practice andtransmitted by people who actually knew him.Both the Koran and the Hadis are regarded as works of revelation or divine inspiration; only the mode of expression differs.The Hadisis the Koran in action, revelation made concrete in the life of the Prophet. In the early centuries of Islam, manythousands of hadis or traditions, were collected and sifted, and those considered reliable were written down, forming sixcollections (sahis) considered orthodox by Moslems even today. Ram Swarup quotes extensively from them, particularlyfrom Sahih Muslim, one of the top &quot;two authentics&quot;, now available in English translation. He also quotes from othertraditional sources, including the Koran and the orthodox biographies of the Prophet (siras), in order to provide a uniqueglimpse of Islam's teachings and practices.The new fundamentalism that is sweeping the Moslem world is little understood by the rest of the world. Prophetic Islam isbased on an intolerant idea, and it has its own version of the &quot;white man's burden&quot; of rooting out polytheism and unbelief.The 'infidel' world will do well to understand this mind. This, Mr. Swarup says, can best be done through studying theHadis and by learning what kind of man Mohammed really was, for the Hadis literature &quot;gives a living picture of Islam at itssource and of Islam in the making, providing an intimate view of the elements that constitute orthodox Islam in their pristinepurity...the very elements of Islam the Moslems find most fascinating,&quot; repeatedly, motivated by a compulsive atavism,appealing to them and reverting to them.Thoroughly researched and documented, &quot;Understanding islam through Hadis&quot; is a valuable reference book and source ofscholarly insight for theologian and layperson alike."},{"Title":"Understanding Islam Through Hadis","review":"Islam is unique in the sense that if the Holy Quran serves as its theory, the practice is contained in the Hadith. The Hadith contain thousands of reports on how Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) dealt with day-to-day matters. These include extremely detailed information on even very small events, which are of immense interest to his followers, who try to emulate him in every way, from the length of their beard down to the length of the pyjamas. They also emulate him in other, more important matters, related to worship, charity, love, hate and war. If one wishes to understand Islam, and how it affects the world today, then it is of utmost importance that one understands the Hadith.Ram Swarup is a fairly well-known writer in select circles and is often quoted by right-wing intellectuals in India. He wrote extensively on Communism, Islam and Christianity, which he saw as three main challenges for Hindu India. Although his perspective and selection of topics is influenced by his beliefs, he does try and make an effort to remain neutral to the topic itself. Therefore, his writings come across as insightful and analytical, rather than polemical.The present book is a fairly good example of his writings. When it was first published in India in 1984, he was arrested and the book was banned by Delhi Government. The matter went to court. Finally, the Delhi High court approved the book for publication in 2001, after removal of two or three excerpts to which the Muslims had taken particularly strong exception. In India, the book has been published by Voice of India, New Delhi (Understanding Islam through Hadis; ISBN 81-85990-73-5)This book analyses select hadith to explain Islamic practices ranging from marriage, through zakat (charity) onwards to jihad. Ram Swarup has selected only those hadith which are relevant to his topics, and he can not be faulted for that. However, his style is somewhat irreverent and this causes irritation to the faithful, who see this as another attack on their way of life. Another point of contention is that the hadith compilations themselves are not free from controversy. Many ancient hadith reporters twisted or made up a hadis to suit their own narrow ends.The book has also been written in a fairly light manner and is easy to read. It is also an absorbing read, especially as so few of us know anything about the Hadith.All in all, an important and useful work, of particular relevance to those curious to understand some of the tactics being used in the ongoing Jihad against the West."},{"Title":"Understanding Islam Through Hadis","review":"This is a totally useless book for someone who seriously wants to study Islam or know life of Prophet Muhammed. What the author of this book has done is a classical example of quoting without background information and out of context.Hadith and Quran are a complex topic and anyone having a limited study like the author of this book will reach at wrong conclusion if he takes a hadith and tries to understand it without getting the background information or the information about when and how the order was withdrawn or replaced by the prophet."},{"Title":"The Wireless Web Usability Handbook","review":"As a person practicing and researching usability, I was interested to see what can be written about this challenging subject.In the index of the book, you can find chapters suchs as: Cell-Phone-Class Devices; the physcal layer, the logical layer, the cognitive layer etc. The same goes for PDAs, pager-based systems and so on. It seems very interesting...... until you read the text. For example, the book tells us that the Cell-phone class device has a logical layer that &quot;is really a tiny PC, with small amounts of 'main' memory...&quot; This is so rude, oversimplified metaphor, that it is more misleading than anything else!

While Star was definitely flakey. The plot while unrealistic, and I do accept that M&B; books are not heavy on the realism side, this one was flimsy in the story and character development. Star was only twenty when Luc finds her after eighteen months have passed, while Luc is very much older, and apart from the bedroom they seemed mismatched.Overall I felt Star was just too immature for Luc.

A rookie could read it and get some basics from the book. A veteran could definitely implement the ideas from Ron to really grow his or her practice.I agree with so much that Ron says in the book. Ron has been one of the most successful financial advisors in the business and his strategies for success are great.He breaks the book apart into a few different areas. The first part focuses on do you really have passion for this business. He gives you some tips on how to figure this out for yourself. For myself, I really love this business, and I wish I had started doing this many years ago. I love learning how to get better in my field. For example, I absolutely loved studying for CFP and now I enjoy the continuing education that I take to keep my CFP certification. The CE helps me get better which assist my clients even more.The next part is really for someone who is independent or has more flexibility with staffing within a wirehouse. This part focuses on getting the right people on your team and removing the wrong people from your team quickly.The next part focuses on managing your growing practice. As one grows, one needs systems to keep client satisfaction in check. I look forward to implement ideas from this section as I continue to grow my practice.The next section is on time management. The best item from here is at the end of each day to list the top six things you have to do the next day in order of importance. Then, do them. I have tried this before and will try this again. This is difficult because so many fires come up everyday. But, it is important to make sure you get the major items done every day. That is, you must put the big rocks in the jar before you put in the little rocks. If you do it the other way, you will never have space for all your big rocks.The next section focused on marketing and focusing the clients more on your services. I think this is critical. This business has become almost a commodity business; however, the big differentiator is personal service. This is probably the most important item on which I focus. If I am able to exceed my clients' expectations, they will in return refer me to their friends.He also has a great section on referrals. He has a great script to let clients know upfront that you will expect referrals from them. I also like that he suggests doing client seminars and encouraging them to bring guests. This is better than just having prospect seminars in which you don't if people are just there for the free dinner.The last section talks about focusing your activities on doing items you enjoy. I enjoy golfing, so I do golfing events for my clients and prospects. Ron likes wine, so he does wine tastings. Ron does suggest that you be very good at the hobby before you have these events. Unfortunately, I am not that good at golf, but I have fun playing and so do my clients and prospects.It is great to read a well-written book from a top producer like Ron Carson who really shares his success strategies for this business. If you are looking for some methods of growing your business and you are willing to implement some new ideas, I would highly encourage you to read this book."},{"Title":"Tested in the Trenches: A 9-Step Plan for Building and Sustaining a Million-Dollar Financial Services Practice","review":"I purchased this book along with 8 Success Strategies of Top Producing advisors. I found this to be the better of the two. It does, however, depend on what you're looking for. This book has some good exercises for soul searching and discovering your own personal mission & vision. Certainly, there were not many very new concepts but the presentation was quite good. The book helped to validate what I already knew: I desperately need to systematize my office. The book gives some pretty good advice on how to systematize as well as some other good tidbits. Any one good idea from any of these books is worth the price and this one has more than enough. As an added bonus this book actually helped me to understand my relationship with my dad and why he is the way he is. NOT something you'd expect from a book like this. Weird, eh? The one thing I find is that these authors all seem to agree that we should hold elaborate client thank you events that double as referral generating events for us. Perhaps it's because I can't afford to hold them, but I think these kinds of things would come off as really smarmy, possibly greasy, and almost certainly, spendthrifty. I can't help but believe that throwing hugely lavish dinners, taking clients on Alaskan cruises etc, would make my clients wonder \\"just how much is this guy charging me to be able to afford all this?\\" And if he just got a statement that his portfolio is down?....Nevertheless, a good book providing many ideas that I am in the process of implementing."},{"Title":"Tested in the Trenches: A 9-Step Plan for Building and Sustaining a Million-Dollar Financial Services Practice","review":"There are a lot of different books out there written by owners of different financial service firms but of all the books I've seen this book is by far the best.

As I'm sure anyone in the industry will attest, there is just no substitute for good, old-fashioned experience. However, one of the few shortcuts I have actually found is that the experience doesn't necessarily have to be your OWN.Mr. Carson does an excellent job of presenting ideas, none of which are revolutionary, but all of which are critical, to help stramline your efficiency and boost your business to the forefront of an industry that has become largely commoditized over the years.

Next to Achilles he was the best of the Achean warriors, but Ajax was deeply flawed in that he was stubborn and egotistical. I think his intelligence is further called into question by the myth regarding his death, which is the subject of this play by Sophocles. After the death of Achilles it is decided his glorious armor, forged by Hephaestus, will be given to the worthiest of the chieftains. Ajax expects the prize to come to him, but instead the other chieftains vote to give it to \\"wily\\" Odysseus. The inference to be drawn is that craftiness and intelligence are to be prize more than brute strength, which is why I tend to identify Odysseus and Ajax with that distinction between brains and brawn. Enraged by this slight, Ajax decides to kill Odysseus and the other chieftains who have slighted him, but Athena clouds his sight and he thinks the camp's livestock are his intended victims. When he comes to his senses, butchering a sheep he thought was Odysseus, Ajax is humiliated to the point he chooses to kill himself. The climax of this play, the oldest of the seven surviving plays written by Sophocles, is not the suicide of Ajax but rather a debate amongst the Achean leaders as to whether or not Ajax should be buried.The issue central to the play \\"Ajax\\" is whether the title character should or should not be considered a true hero by the Greek audience attending the play. Homer, of course, has nothing to say regarding Ajax's fate in the \\"Iliad,\\" although in the \\"Odyssey\\" when Odysseus encounters the shade of Ajax, the dead hero refuses to speak and turns away. However, in his telling of the tale Sophocles adds an important element to the suicide of Ajax. In his first scene when he is discovered amongst the slaughtered livestock, Ajax realizes that his intentions were wrong and that what he has done will make him look ridiculous; he decides to kill himself, ignores the pleas of the chorus, says his farewells to his son and departs. However, in the next episode Ajax returns, apparently reconciled to life; instead of killing himself he will bury his unlucky sword and live a peaceful life. Then a messenger brings the warning of Calchas that Ajax must be kept out of the battle that day. The next thing we know Ajax is cursing the Atreidae and falling on his sword. The change is significant because it makes Ajax's suicide a more rational act. Instead of taking his life in the heat of his embarrassment over what he has done, Sophocles has the character changing his mind twice and ending his life in the grips of a cold hatred against the chieftains.This sets the stage for the debate amongst the chieftains regarding the burial of Ajax. When Teucer wants to bury the body he is forbidden to do so by Menelaus, who calls Ajax his murderer, focusing on the intentions behind his rampage. Agamemnon also forbids the burial, making an impassioned argument for the rule of law and warning against the reliance of the army upon the strength of a single man, whether he be Ajax or Achilles. Ironically (and we surely expect no less from Sophocles), it is Odysseus who makes the argument in favor of burial. For Odysseus the good outweighs the bad and it is not right to do a man injury when he is dead. This argument certainly echoes the moral at the end of the \\"Iliad\\" with regards to way Achilles treats the corpse of Hector. Certainly Ajax was a arrogant brute, obsessed with self-glorification and unfeeling towards his family and people. But when the Trojan army almost succeeded in burning the Achean ships, it was Ajax who stemmed their attack. For Odysseus, and for Sophocles, it is clear that such a man deserves to be considered a hero and demands an appropriate burial. \\"Ajax\\" is a minor play by Sophocles, relative to what little has survived of his work, but it does speak to one of the playwright central themes, which is to find that which is heroic in a tragic situation. Having found that spark in the life of Ajax, Sophocles seeks to redeem the tragic figure in this play."},{"Title":"Sophocles: Ajax (Cambridge Translations from Greek Drama)","review":"With its Damien Hurst-esque cover art of gore-spattered, tongue-lolling, severed goat heads, this new translation of Sophocles' Ajax is calculated to shock. This is a slim and menacing-looking little book, with lots of white space in the text and a grittiness to the sprinkles of dialog.Ajax appears to be one of Sophocles' earliest plays; it takes place toward the end of the Trojan War, immediately after the funeral games for Achilles. During these games Ajax came in second for each of the competitions, but what really set him over was that he lost to Odysseus in the wrestling match for Achilles' divine armor. Ajax goes nuts, furious that he, the \\"bulwark\\" (as Lombardo refers to him in his Iliad) of the Greeks, the first to fight, the first to save his comrades in need, has been passed over in favor of the wily and conniving Odysseus. So Ajax does what any Homeric hero would do; he dives into a blind rage and storms out to kill the assembled Greek leaders. Only the goddess Athena obscures his vision, setting him after livestock instead; Ajax kills the whole lot, thinking he's really killing Greeks. The play opens immediately after this slaughter.Ajax offers more introspection and compassion than Homer (and, to be fair, none of the above is actually IN Homer; it all takes place after the Iliad). Rather than focusing on war and glory, Ajax instead focuses on the melancholic aftereffects of bloodshed. There is a despair which clings to the play, as Ajax comes to grips with what he's done and decides upon the only course of self-punishment which he believes available to him. The last half of the play deals with those left in the wake of this decision.John Tipton approaches his translation as more poetry than drama, which suits me fine. This means that a lot of the more \\"alien\\" aspects of Greek drama are shucked aside in favor of a clean read. Tipton gives each line of dialog a six-beat structure, which results in a fast-moving and breathless tale devoid of hope. This is a bleak and nihilistic translation, as if Cormac McCarthy in his \\"Blood Meridian\\" days turned his hand to poetic drama. Tipton gets a bit freer with the Chorus, that stumbling block for any modern reader. Tipton melds the Chorus into one genderless voice which spews out avant garde gibberish. This is probably my biggest problem with the translation; whereas the Chorus in most Greek drama does in fact get in the way (ie Aristophanes' \\"Lysistrata\\"), in Ajax it actually helps move the plot forward. Yet Tipton has hamstrung all of this. The dialog he gives the Chorus further increases the terror of the entire play, true, yet I'd much prefer some lines that make sense.Stanley Lombardo (whose translations of the Iliad and the Odyssey are the only ones for me) provides a brief Foreword which is to be avoided for those new to the play; rather, read it after, as instead of providing info on Sophocles it instead plumbs the depths of the play's meaning, which would of course ruin it for those who've never read it. That being said, a little info on Sophocles - who he was, when he lived, what other works he produced - would've been useful for those new to him. Yet this book seems catered for those already familiar with Greek drama, which actually makes sense: in this pathetic age, readers of the Classics really are a niche market, so it's sensible to speak to them on their level. A recap of Sophocles and his life might come off like a \\"tell me something I don't know\\" slap to the face.Tipton himself provides an \\"Account\\" for the afterword, detailing his translation choices and noting his influences, Christopher Logue chief among them. I'm a Logue fanatic; his \\"War Music\\" is my favorite published work ever. Tipton's Ajax is clearly cut from the same mould: characters curse, anachronisms abound, and the atmosphere seems more \\"Mad Max\\" than ancient Greece. Yet I find this translation better than any others I've read of Sophocles. It seems a perfect fit for these tough times we live in: tough times call for a tough translation. I'll be curious to see how those in a (hopefully) better tomorrow look back on Tipton's Ajax."},{"Title":"Sophocles: Ajax (Cambridge Translations from Greek Drama)","review":"The Classics are not so-called because they are old, but because they are most worthy. Plays by Sophocles survive today because they have spoken to every generation between his time and ours. \\"Ajax\\" tells the story of one of the great heroes of the Trojan War and how he destroyed himself through his own overweening pride. Hubris remains very much an issue among the powerful today. Ajax's inability to accept that Odysseus could be awarded the armor of Achilles instead of him, Ajax's rationalization that Odysseus could only achieve such an award by scheming against him, and Ajax's unwillingness to admit his mistakes to his superiors, all seem like things that only someone totally foolish would do. Yet the world's political and economic landscape today is littered with leaders and businessmen who are jealous, paranoid, dishonest, and unwilling to admit failure.There is real drama in reading this play, it does not feel stale or antique but rather resonates and makes the reader want to join the chorus in admonishing Ajax to do the right thing. Sophocles also gives us an engaging depiction of Odysseus. Odysseus shows the reader how to win graciously, lobbying for an honorable burial for a bitter adversary, which he does because he must answer to the gods for his behavior at all times -- the very lesson that Ajax refused to learn.I recommend this play unconditionally, it is something everyone should read. I do not highly recommend this particular edition, however (thus the 4 rather than 5 stars). The translation seems good and a lot of the notes add interesting information. But some of the marginal commentary consists of overly simplistic questions (e.g., \\"How does X make you feel?\\") that seem like they would insult almost anyone's intelligence and not be all that helpful as a teaching aide. I bought this edition because I wanted a slim volume that contained only this play, and it may yet be the best purchase for that purpose. Whether you buy this version or browse for another, read this play."},{"Title":"Sophocles: Ajax (Cambridge Translations from Greek Drama)","review":"This is probably the earliest extant play of Sophocles. Sophocles is the earliest known playwright to use painted scenery. He also decreased the importance of the chorus, added a third actor, and abandoned the trilogy format (each play is complete by itself). Ajax is the classical Greek tragedy about the downfall of a man who is sinned against and has a tragic flaw; in this case, insolence and pride. Ajax becomes enraged when Achilles' armor is awarded to Odysseus instead of to him. Agamemnon and Menelaus also exhibit insolence when they refuse to bury Ajax after his suicide. But, Odysseus changes their minds. This play is probably the earliest known example of a play containing a scene of violence on the stage instead of offstage.

Professor Leslie is a utilitarian philosopher at the University of Guelph in Ontario, and as such he's written this book with the express objective of providing a warning to civilization of the dangers that lie ahead. In spite of what the book's title may initially suggest, the book is not the work of some gloomy apocalyptic doomsayer; rather, it is a sensible consideration of the perils that an advanced civilization like our own must overcome over the next crucial period to advance. It's easy to simply take civilization for granted, but Leslie's point is that its survival is not guaranteed, but depends on the choices that we make in the near future. Prof. Leslie asserts that if humanity can make it past the next few centuries then civilization will be in fairly good shape; it's the period soon to be upon us that will be so rocky, with dangers in everything from the spread of nuclear weapons to the practice of biological warfare, from impacting asteroids to poorly thought-out particle physics experiments gone awry, from chemical weapons to the biggest threat of all-- the destruction of earth's fragile ecosystem upon which we all rely, but so often do not recognize. What Leslie is calling for is wisdom, and for the practice of restraint and discipline on a societal scale, to avoid the petty squabbles and foolish waste of resources that we can no longer afford. Admittedly some of the methodology used in the book is flawed and has been shown to be problematic, but this does not belittle its value. The book suggests that it's time to &quot;shape up&quot; and to put into practice, those qualities associated with &quot;higher functioning&quot; and a truly advanced society, and to recognize the dangers ahead of time-- thus applying foresight and planning far ahead for crises, and averting them in the first place. The book is therefore an excellent &quot;wake-up call&quot; to move us out of complacency, and for this reason alone it is quite valuable."},{"Title":"The End of the World: The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction","review":"Being tremendously interested in the end of the world (from a sociology standpoint) I immediately devour any books on catastrophism, eschatology or millenialism.What John Leslie offers here is something quite different than the run-of-the-mill babbling on possible scenarios. He looks at the likely(and not so likely) events which may trigger &quot;the end&quot;; somewhat similar to Asimov's approach in his 70's non-fic A CHOICE OF CATASTROPHES. Leslie takes us a little deeper into the complexities of these situations by examining the true risks and consequences involved, all the while maintaining a solid scientific objectivity.All this would make for a great book alone, but Leslie goes further. He has the courage to explore the idea that perhaps we are arrogant in assuming we can control our fate as a species (hence the ETHICS portion of the book title) and maybe we have lost (or never had) the necessary objectivity we need to endure.A truly fascinating book about something the average human being doesn't (but should) think about.Kudos to John Leslie for putting humans where they belong in the scheme of the universe: the tiny little box marked &quot;naked &amp; vulnerable&quot;!"},{"Title":"The End of the World: The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction","review":"The reviewer below misses the thrust of Leslie's argument. Initially, in the first two chapters of the book, he sets out to list ALL of the ways through which society could become extinct (a notion that has not been held in high esteem for policymaking relevance, anyway, in modern society). As such, he does borrow a lot from other authors. And, adding in, his lifting of the mathematical equation suggesting that we are near the end of 'our' time on the Earth makes mathematical sense, even if being totally anthropomorphic.... And the case is made, if you let it be, that we should probably start thinking about how we are going to 'go', and plan thereof....Aside from that, this book is a riot. The first two chapters, though morbid, are a laugh. The book (setting aside the good philosophy) should be read just for the initial paranoia. It's all in good fun...."},{"Title":"The End of the World: The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction","review":"John Leslie is a professor of philosophy at the University of Guelph. Much of this book is taken up with explorations of, criticisms of, and defences of the 'Doomsday Argument', championed by Leslie and cosmologist Brandon Carter. The 'Doomsday Argument' goes something like this:-if humanity were to continue to prosper and multiply, eventually spreading beyond the solar system, and perhaps the galaxy, the total number of human beings today (6 billion) will seem insignificant compared to the potential trillions and trillions of humans in the future. But if this were to actually happen, humans today would be among the very earliest of the race -perhaps in the first 0.1 per cent or even 0.001 per cent. How likely is it that we are that special? In the year 2090 the population of earth might be 12 billion people. Of all the humans who had ever lived, one in ten would be alive in that year. Instead of expecting to be in a remarkably early stage of human civilization, say in the first 0.1 per cent, it is much more likely that an inhabitant of the year 2090 will be among that 1 in 10 present when humanity died.To me this argument seems flimsy, sophistic, and somehow just wrong, but Leslie does an impressive and thorough job of refuting the many objections to it. My eyes glazed over during some of these detailed and convoluted defences, but then I only took one philosophy course in university. What I liked this book for was the exploration of the many delicious ways in which humanity could be wiped out. Some of these faces of doom might seem quite far-fetched and unlikely, but all have some formidable scientists and philosophers backing them. Here is an abbreviated list:-nuclear war. \\"Small nations, terrorists, and rich criminals wanting to become still richer by holding the world to ransom, can already afford very destructive bombs.\\" Suitcase bombs in particular worry me. I believe a few well-placed bombs could de-stabilize the United States almost overnight.-biological warfare. Such weapons are less costly than nuclear weapons, easier to conceal, and could be more dangerous because their field of destruction is harder to limit.-chemical warfare.-destruction of the ozone layer. \\"...by chlorofluorocarbons or other things.\\"-'Greenhouse effect'. \\"On Venus, greenhouse effect temperatures are sufficient to melt lead.\\"-poisoning by pollution. \\"Hundreds of new chemicals enter the environment each year. Their effects are often hard to predict.\\"-disease. Many deadly diseases are developing immunity to our best drugs. New viruses are thought to filter down from outer space. Global warming could thaw out some virulent disease from the past, such as the 1918-1919 flu, which preferred younger, healthy victims. (\\"They died horribly, their lungs filling with fluid, becoming stiff and solid, literally drowning them. As they expired, they vented pints of the highly infectious liquid from their mouths and noses.\\" -Calgary Herald, October 4, 1997)-volcanic eruptions. Which might produce a 'volcanic winter' akin to 'nuclear winter'.-hits by asteroids or comets. If Shoemaker-Levy had hit earth instead of Jupiter, we would all be having drinks with the dinosaurs right now in the Restaurant At the End of the Universe.-an extreme ice age due to passage through an interstellar cloud.-a nearby supernova. Earth would be bathed in deadly rays, cleansing it of all life.-essentially unpredictable breakdown of a complex system. As investigated by Chaos Theory: \\"the system in question might be earth's biosphere; its air, soil, its water, and its living things interact in highly intricate ways.\\"-something-we-know-not-what. \\"It would be foolish to think we have foreseen all possible natural and technological disasters.\\"-unwillingness to rear children. Seen already to a certain extent in rich nations.-a disaster from genetic engineering. \\"Perhaps a 'green scum' disaster, in which a genetically engineered organism reproduces itself with immense efficiency, smothering everything.\\"-a disaster from nanotechnology. \\"Very tiny self-reproducing machines -they could be developed fairly soon through research inspired by Richard Feynman -might perhaps spread world-wide within a month in a 'gray ooze' calamity.\\" Sounds like something from a Philip K. Dick story.-disasters associated with computers. Okay, so Y2K was a bust. That doesn't mean a real computer disaster isn't possible. We are becoming more and more reliant on them.-production a new Big Bang in the laboratory.-the possibility of producing an all-destroying phase transition. 'Comparable to turning water into ice\\", as in Ice 9 from Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle. \\"In 1984, Edward Farhi and Robert Jeffe suggested that physicists might produce 'strange quark matter' of a kind which attracted ordinary matter, changing it into more of itself until the entire earth had been converted ('eaten').\\" In contrast, there might be a very real vacuum meta-stability danger associated with experiments at extremely high energies. The vacuum we live in is not stable, it is meta-stable. This is because it is not a true vacuum. It is filled with a force field (a scalar field) and so is a pseudo-vacuum. While stable at low energies, a high energy experiment (such as planned in conjunction with the new super particle-colliders due to come on line in the near future) might provide enough of a jolt to destabilize it (like a ball bearing resting in a hollow on a wooden incline that starts rolling because of a nudge). An experiment might produce a bubble of 'true vacuum' which would then expand at nearly the speed of light, destroying everything in sight. \\"Rather as a tiny ice crystal changes a large volume of super-cooled water into more ice crystals.\\"-annihilation by extra-terrestrials. If and when E.T. finds us, he/she/it might not be cuddly or even friendly; he/she/it might just be hungry.-risks from philosophy. Suppose a fundamentalist U.S president or general wanted to hasten Judgement Day a wee bit by pressing a certain red button (see Dr Strangelove). Alternatively, someone in a position of power might, when looking at the prevalence of evil in the world, agree with Schopenhauer that \\"it would have been better if our planet had remained like the moon, a lifeless mass.\\" So why not release a humanity-destroying plague (see Twelve Monkeys).Leslie goes into much more depth concerning these threats, and isn't saying that any of them are inevitable. He is just saying that when we look at these areas of concern in the light of the 'Doomsday Argument' we should take their potential very seriously. We should be asking ourselves as individuals, as nations, and as a species, what we can do to lower their risk of occurring. Our survival is far from assured."},{"Title":"The End of the World: The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction","review":"This book is a strange mixture of four elements. The first presents main dangers to the survival of humanity, with preliminary references to the Carter \\"doomsday argument.\\" The second deals with philosophical arguments on prolonging human history. The third takes up at greater length the doomsday argument. And the fourth suddenly jumps to a short excursus on nuclear deterrence.The book up to page 153 is recommended to all who worry, with good causes, about the future of the human species. This part well presents main dangers facing the survival of humanity in the short and long term. Necessary measures needed for reducing the likelihood of termination of the human species are hinted at, including \\"politically incorrect\\" ones such as strong global governance (pp. 98, 146) with a huge police force (p. 106), limitations on science and technology (p. 90), and intrusive personal surveillance (p. 42). This is all the more noteworthy as most books dealing with dangers to humanity fail to draw realistic conclusions on what needs to be done.The book fails to consider the main root cause of possible demise of humanity, namely the inadequacies of its moral, cognitive, emotional and institutional capacities, as limited by genetics and constrained cultural learning, for using well the unprecedented capabilities to shape its future supplied to the human species by science and technology.Still, the cardinal message emanating from the first 153 pages is compelling: Extinction of humanity in the foreseeable future is a real possibility, but its likelihood can be much reduced if humanity adopts a range of countermeasures, including counter-conventional ones.However I cannot in good conscience recommend the rest of the book. The philosophical position of the author in effect grants ontological standing to moral values, with some states of affairs being regarded as \\"in fact\\" good or bad. This misrepresents the very nature of values as depending ultimately on human choice, however influenced by genetics and environments, without which there cannot be deep moral responsibility.The Carlson hypothesis, claiming that it is unlikely that we are born in the early history of humanity, to which much space is devoted, is a stimulating probabilistic speculation. But it is not sound, in part by ignoring that the chance of anyone of us being born at all is infinitesimal small. Indeed, all the probabilistic approach of the author permeating the book does not fit the fuzziness of the subject. Thus, stating that the probability of humanity being soon destroyed is 30 per cent (p.133) illustrates misplaced exactness. It would be much better to use an adjusted version of the scales of modal logic, such as \\"possible,\\" likely,\\" and \\"unlikely.\\"Discussing deterrence in one of my books (Israeli Statecraft, 2011, pp. 25-26, 182-183), let me limit my comment on the book's treatment of the subject to saying that this is much too serious an issue to be taken up apropos in the last few pages of the book).Professor Yehezkel DrorThe Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"Title":"The End of the World: The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction","review":"I am not done with this book yet.

You'll just be done with going over various disasters that are threatening us, most of which are self-caused: comets about to blast us to kingdome-come, nuclear wars intending to fry us ruthlessly into oblivion, diseases which either &quot;jumped&quot; out of labs or out of nature's arsenal, overpopulation and pollution and the combination of thse two, shortage of food, nanotechnology and the machines taking over (where's Arnie when ya need him) and so on and on.Now this is all a reality most of us are too irresponsible to face up to, indeed, as a species we are what i call &quot;perversely intelligent&quot;, that is, we have intellectual horsepower which is incredibly difficult to groom in a a truly meaningful way and we are thus subjects to dangers caused by that very intelligence.Writting a book about this, should be, again perversely, highly entertaining. It would by default be humorous because how can you actually discuss so much shortshightedness, idiocy, and the impending doom as the direct product without seeing the humour in it? The author of this book can. He takes us through these fist chapters with a language so dry and lifeless you'd think the end is already behind us and books are now written by left-over survivor computers which were not programmed for humour.Ah, but wait. You thought this is heavy, and if you havent quit by then (being possibly not the lion-hearted type) you're in for a major treatment that will suck out all your life force and leave you connected to another machine checking for a pulse:the latter part of the book (its second half practically) is basically a ridiculous attempt to tie all this together with philosophy. Now philosophy, for the uninitiated, isnt supposed to be a life-threatening experience. Not really. Professor Leslie though, puts in a courageous effort to convince us of the opposite, and I'd be lying if i said he doesnt coming damn close.Taking up highly insignificant theories few ever heard of, and elevating them to the holy grail of philosophy, the author transforms his book to a readscape as fertile as the Sahara. Hundreds of pages of pretentious pomp about not much really isnt what i associate with philosophy. Especially when it's coupled with aggresive arrogance : not too few times, the author basically praises himself after he argues on his own with his imaginary opponents in the philosophy field, beats them and then triumphantly announces his victory. That's downright pathetic and even if the philosophical quest in this book was enjoyable (far, very far from) this would still spoil it beyond recovery.Look elsewhere. You dont need the suffering really. The author does convince us that the end is near (which isnt hard actually) but then, since it is, why make it all the more agonisingly painful by going through unbearable books such as this? Save the precious little time you have left."},{"Title":"The End of the World: The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction","review":"Leslie may claim to be a philosopher, but he is an apocolist. He tediously rehashes almost every major thinkers thoughts and ideas concerning the mass destruction of the human race, brushing over many vital subjects, and subjecting the reader to in-depth analysis and over analysis of higholy improbable and highly theoretical situations whihc may or may not ever occurr. Not to mention that he takes as absolute a highly unregarded theory of ones place in time as being critical to how close one is to being in that population which is to be extincted. The title is highly misleading. Borrow it from the library and skim heavily, not too many salient points. For true enlightenment search the bibliography and pull up the origianl works and just cross reference them. This is nothing more than a compilation of other people's thoughts, with rarely one of Leslie's own."},{"Title":"Praise and Blame: Moral Realism and Its Applications (New Forum Books)","review":"Daniel Robinson was actually born in or near what is now called Greece on or about 400 BC. Recently awakened from hibernation, his lectures for The Teaching Company on &quot;the Great Ideas of Philosophy&quot; are a tour de force, challenged only by a series of lectures on the &quot;Great Ideas of Psychology&quot; and on &quot;Ancient Greece&quot;. Well credentialed, he is a Neuro Psychologist by training who has ventured into classical scholarship and &quot;the love of wisdom&quot; by inclination.He reinforces my preconceived notions about those who are captured by foolish consistency, currently called &quot;post moderns&quot; or &quot;de-constructionists&quot; or &quot;predistination materialists&quot; (my term) as valuably recycling trivial truths.This is a deep, humourous book of great seriousness. The only fault, is that, like Stephen Gould, Robinson knows too much and at times cannot resist telling us.Robinson is a moral realist; i.e.; he believes that moral truths are at least as true as super strings or MBranes or for that matter genes or alleles. But as a moral realist, he also believes that &quot;there is a limit to respect and tolerance, and that limnit is reached when fundamental moral tenets are violated&quot; and in the possibility that &quot;at any given time in world history, there are no identifiable occupants in the defined moral space!&quot;.Unlike this review (but like Robinson's lectures) this book is filled with nuggets that make the investment in time and money well worthwhile.For those seriously interested in how the world works and tired of the foolish consistencies of Dawkins, Dennett and Rorty, wade into this book. If nothing else, the one liners are great fun even as they are subtle and too often hidden.On substance, I consider this book off the scale.Sam Taylor"},{"Title":"FORTRESS MALTA; AN ISLAND UNDER SIEGE 1940-1943.","review":"This is the best military history book to be published since (and I'd rank it right up there with) last year's &quot;An Army At Dawn&quot; by Rick Atkinson. High praise, indeed, since that book won a Pulitzer Prize. If you've read the Atkinson book, you'll find that &quot;Fortress Malta&quot; complements it nicely, since both books end with the Allies poised for the invasion of Sicily. Mr. Holland, to judge by his photo on the dustjacket, looks to be still in his twenties. (This is his first book.) If he is indeed that young, that makes this book even more of an accomplishment. The quality of the writing and the way the book is structured demonstrate a great deal of skill and maturity. This is because the author has a lot of balls to juggle: he has to tell us about the aerial war; the surface naval battles; the submarine war; strategy and tactics, etc. This part of the story is well-told: there are many exciting sequences dealing with dogfights and convoys being stalked by submarines. But what elevates the book to the superior level is Mr. Holland's ability to bring home to us the human element. We get to know a lot of the pilots and submariners as real people - quirks and all. (Two people who leap out from the pages are Adrian Warburton and George &quot;Screwball&quot; Beurling. Warburton, despite being a reconnaissance pilot, managed the rare feat of becoming an &quot;ace&quot; - which means he shot down at least 5 planes. He was unorthodox. He once flew over Sicily to take some photographs, then made an unauthorized side trip to Greece to pick up some booze for the boys back at the base. He got away with such behavior because he always got his photographs - no matter what. Beurling was the highest scoring Allied ace of the war, with over 30 confirmed kills, with an incredible 4 in one day.) The same is true regarding the civilian population. Everyone was under incredible stress - day after day, month after month, and year after year. For much of the time the island was under almost constant attack. There were severe housing and food shortages. Some people were forced to live in underground &quot;cubicles.&quot; Inadequate nutrition led to sickness and disease. On the military side, there weren't enough planes to defend the island. Often, 3-4 Hurricanes or Spitfires would go up to do battle with 50 or more enemy aircraft. As the Axis powers were in control of the areas both north and south of Malta, getting convoys through with essential supplies (planes, fuel, spare parts, food, etc.) was extremely difficult. Plus, there was the added psychological stress of being &quot;trapped&quot; on a small island. The entire island was awarded the George Cross, the highest civilian award for valour. The action was unprecedented. It was also well deserved. After reading about these people for allmost 400 pages I felt that I knew them. As I approached the end of the book I hoped Mr. Holland would tell us what happened to them after the siege of Malta was over. The author, once again, did not disappoint. There is a postscript which follows the lives of all the major characters. As you might expect, this section is filled with both joy and sorrow. Some of the people led short and tragic lives, some long and happy. A surprising number are still alive today. (One is the well-known British actor Frederick Treves, known to this anglophile through his performances in the David Suchet &quot;Poirot&quot; and Joan Hickson &quot;Miss Marple&quot; stories.) The book has 7 pages of maps, placed in the beginning, which allow you to get your geographic bearings and follow the action. There are also over 80 wonderful black-and-white photographs. The dustjacket mentions that the author is working on 2 more books regarding the war in the Mediterranean. If &quot;Fortress Malta&quot; is anything to go by, we are in for some more great reading."},{"Title":"FORTRESS MALTA; AN ISLAND UNDER SIEGE 1940-1943.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Holland's Fortress Malta. Holland has a very easy going, understated writing style that makes reading him a delight. The book is very informative about a little-known - yet quite important aspect - of WW II. Holland tells of the great courage, sacrifice, and fortitude of the people of Malta during the Italian and German siege of the Island. Holland provides a perspective from the points of view of airmen, sailors, soldiers, and civilians.Although I certainly enjoyed the book, I rated it 4-stars for two reasons. First, the book, for the limited subject it covers, is too long at over 400 pages. Second, the book somewhat downplays some aspects of the war. For instance, well into the book Holland gives a recap of the number of Malta pilots killed. I was amazed at the high number killed! Considering that I was well into his book the total number of pilots killed should have been no surprise. One reason for this is that Holland writes this historical work in the style of a novel, concentrating on a limited number of participants rather than very detailed and comprehensive combat.Despite the misgivings expressed in the preceding paragraph, I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who would like to know more about this fascinating aspect of WW II."},{"Title":"FORTRESS MALTA; AN ISLAND UNDER SIEGE 1940-1943.","review":"I HAVE LISTENED TO MY FATHER-IN-LAW, WHO WORKED AS A MECHANIC FOR THE RAF, WAS MALTESE AND LIVED THROUGH THE WAR ON THE ISLAND, TELL STORIES STORIES ABOUT THE BOMBINGS AND THE DAMAGE INFLICTED ON THE ISLAND BACK THEN.

By singling out individuals to follow through the course of the siege and after, Mr. Holland brings us to identify with them, share their terror, their loss and their ultimate victory. A few of his accounts left me shaken and his account of the August convoy, Operation Pedestal, left me in tears. I somehow find myself enthralled by accounts of people in face of adversity, especially during World War II, and I would put this book right up there with any I've ever read and, believe me, I've read many. Lots of photos to help identify and identify with the participants. Also, great maps (the lack of always a sore point for me). Highly recommended."},{"Title":"FORTRESS MALTA; AN ISLAND UNDER SIEGE 1940-1943.","review":"Fortress Malta by James Holland tells the story of the battle for Malta from 1940 thru 1943. Mr. Holland nicely merges personal remembrances with the historical events around the siege. He opens the story by telling us about the British defenses (or the lack there of) and the opening moves of the war in the Mediterranean. Italian aircraft raiding the island and the defenders trying to cope with the attacks. Two topics during the 1940 portion of the book that were interesting were Faith, Hope, and Charity (the Gloster Gladiators that defended the island) and the British attack on Taranto and how Malta contributed to the attack. Other sections of the book deal with the German intervention over Malta (actually twice) and the Pedestal Convoy.While Mr. Holland is mainly focused on telling us the history of Malta during WWII, Mr. Holland does an excellent job of telling us the stories of the people that were caught up in events. Whether it's the native Malta people surviving the raids, gun crews living there through-out the time period (Army personnel seem to have been there for the duration), the pilots (due to the stress, the RAF was replacing crews about once every three months), or the Naval personnel. My personal favorite was Adrian Warburton and his exploits doing photo recon work. Simply amazing!Mr. Holland's work is his Freshman work (1st) and is very nicely put together. On an Amazon scale, I'll give it 4.5 stars, but since they only deal in whole stars, I'll give it the nod to 5 stars because of the Mr. Holland's writing style, merging history with personal remembrances, and dealing with a topic that hasn't been written about heavily. I'm looking forward to reading other histories from Mr. Holland, assuming he can do half as well or better."},{"Title":"FORTRESS MALTA; AN ISLAND UNDER SIEGE 1940-1943.","review":"It's suprising that this book has not gotten more attention on Amazon. Only one reivew since October. Too bad. British journalist James Holland, in his maiden book, engagingly tells the story of the indefatigable Maltese people and their stalwart RAF and Royal Navy defenders. The island's stubborn, against-the-odds resistance allowed Malta to remain a strategic Allied stronghold throughout the Mediterranian campaign: first, enabling the interdiction of Axis supplies and reinforcements headed for North Africa and then serving as a bridgehead for the Allied invasion of Siciliy. Hitler's failure to invade the weakened island redoubt has to go down as one of his bigger blunders.Holland's narrative is sprinkled with vivid, first-person recollections and meticulously reconstructed feats of derring-do. The relentless German air assualt's impact on ordinary civilians is particularly poignant, as are the the accounts of intrepid RAF pilots dueling numerically superior Axis fighters. The exploits of one reconnaissance pilot, Adrian Warburton, is the stuff of Hollywood.It was also fascinating to learn that the entire island was awarded the George Cross -- Britain's high civilian award for gallantry --for withstanding the vicious, three-year siege. The London Blitz pales in comparison.Here's hoping more readers discover \\"Fortress Malta.\\" Looking forward to Holland's next book."},{"Title":"FORTRESS MALTA; AN ISLAND UNDER SIEGE 1940-1943.","review":"I was very impressed by this book as you can guess by the Title of this Humble Review of mine. For some reason, Malta does not get the respect that is due for its part in the ETO of WWII. Basically it was a monkey wrench in the supply line for the Axis forces in the Med. and North Africa. For this it paid a very heavy price for this, which is outlined in this very well written book.If one wants to get a good idea of what this gallant island did the the war. Then one would be advised to check this book out. (Hint -It really earned its George Cross for which even today it proudly flies on it's national flag.)"},{"Title":"FORTRESS MALTA; AN ISLAND UNDER SIEGE 1940-1943.","review":"As some other reviewers have noted, Holland's focus is on the civilians and the warriors who endured the horror that was Malta, 1940-43. In a time of 'embedded' reporters and 'computer games' warfare, it is vital that we hear from those who have lived the actual horror that is war. Too many war books and 'armchair warriors' forget the ordinary people who actually experience \\"Shock and Awe\\" as it is now called. Wars always start with cheers but end in tears. Courage comes in many forms. We should honour those who offer their lives to defend freedom but we must give full acknowledgement of what war means for civilians.One of my relatives was an Australian spitfire pilot in 603 Squadron RAF who survived Malta. Sadly he was one of those who only found himself in war. Afterwards he could not cope with peace. He and his family paid dearly for his Malta exploits and their inevitable consequences. Truly all who experience war become casualties, in one way or another. Holland has done great service to the memory of those who survived and those who did not. He reminds us again of the tragedy and falsehood that is \\"Dulce et Decorum est pro patria mori\\". The world would be a far better place if all politicians and political leaders (of all parties and faiths) were made to read this book. Most highly recommended.Elizabeth, this book is the key to much of your parents' lives.greyollie,Australia"},{"Title":"FORTRESS MALTA; AN ISLAND UNDER SIEGE 1940-1943.","review":"This is a good historical account of malta during wwII.

It is well written and researched, but also fascinating and at times gripping to read. History is not so much about places and events as it is about people, and this comes across strongly in Mr. Holland's book: while telling the story of Malta's ordeal in World War II, he manages to bring to life the citizens and soldiers on the island and their personal ordeals, tragedies, and triumphs. One is left with a reverent admiration for the people of Malta and the British soldiers, sailors, and fliers who defended her during 1940-1943.

The trying circumstances of the embattled residents of the island are never far from view either. The author provides a nice postscript where he summarizes the postwar lives of some of the main characters involved."},{"Title":"FORTRESS MALTA; AN ISLAND UNDER SIEGE 1940-1943.","review":"This book is excellent and dives deep into the lives and struggles of the people who lived on the most heavily-bombed island by Axis Forces in WW2, from 1940 to 1943. The island and it's garrison suffered greatly from fuel shortages for their planes and severe food shortages, and were on the verge of surrender when each convoy of supplies would be decimated on the way to Malta. In mid-1942, another convoy set out across the hostile Mediterranean, but even while guarded by one of the biggest naval armadas in the war, it also fell under attack by German submarines, Italian torpedo boats, and German and Italian planes by the hundreds. One British carrier was sunk with over 260 dead, another was crippled, and the rest were forced to turn back. Thanks to the efforts of the crew on the oiler SS OHIO, which was loaded with critical supplies and fuel, while being crippled by bombs and torpedoes, the ship managed to make it into Malta, along with 3 other merchant ships, and actually sank at anchor after being unloaded! But the convoy's arrival helped change the course of the war in the Mediterranean and led to the rout of German forces in Egypt, since British submarines and aircraft were able to operate out of Malta and sink Axis supply ships that were fueling the war effort in North Africa.World War 2 wouldn't have been won without the efforts of our own Merchant Marine sailors and the military personnel and civilians that lived on Malta. And this book is their story."},{"Title":"FORTRESS MALTA; AN ISLAND UNDER SIEGE 1940-1943.","review":"World War II is a special hobby interest of mine. Malta's role in my opinion is usually overlooked. A serious obstacle in the Axis air and sea transport routes on Mediterranean it contributed more than its share by housing several Royal Navy and RAF unis which attacked and cut Axis supply lines several times and enduring some of the most horrific air attacks of the war. Not a large but a small island it is the most bombed place during the war. Axis siege caused some unimaginable hardships. Author James Holland brings all of that to writing , adding a humam touch. This is the story of Malta people , soldiers and civilians alike.

In particular, argues Tatla, the threat of an overly centralised and overtly Hindu India practising 'ethnocracy' (p 36) rather than democracy led the one million-strong Sikh diaspora to take up the role of popularisers-and chief fund-raisers-for Khalistan. Their reaction to Operation Bluestar also 'enabled them to redraw a strict definition of Sikh identity, highlighting the religious tradition and collective symbols of the community instead of the geography, language and cultural traits' (p 210). Tatla adds that support for Khalistan fed on the alienation which many Sikhs living abroad had long felt but rarely articulated.Tatla's excellent work underscores the 'situational' (p 210) nature of ethnic consciousness. Why then does he only grudgingly admit that, for the Sikh diaspora, 'a broader loyalty towards India probably still exists' (p210)? With the return of peace to Punjab and the entrance of the Akali Dal (the main Sikh political party) into the recent national coalition government of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, support for Khalistan has become a slogan rather than a belief."},{"Title":"The Sikh Diaspora: The Search For Statehood (Global Diasporas)","review":"The Sikh DIASPORA, is a very thourgh and excellent written book, not only for academics alike but for our future generations, Tatla explains fully within context to the reader, a past, present and future look of Sikh movements, an excellent book and well contributed to the series of Diasporas around the world."},{"Title":"Marxism: An introduction","review":"Few scholars could match the feat accomplished by academic David McLellan in this superb introductory text to the thought and theory collectively known as Marxism. From it consideration of the basics, including the ways in which Marx showed how the eternally recurring theme of exploitation of workers by the owners of the means of production provides the point and counterpoint which composes history, on the one hand, to the basic elements of the theory of value underlying his masterwork, Das Capital, McLellan traces with the faith of a seismographic needle the essential ingredients to Marxism, a revolutionary social theory which has driven bloody revolution throughout the world, and has been vulgarized by the misuses of pragmatists like Lenin, Stalin, and Mao, as well as sociopaths like the Pathet Lao.Marxism is a fairly complex system of thought, and what is often thought to be its tenets are most often the vulgarized forms crafted by Lenin and his ilk, attempting to use Marx's complex and idealistic theory to justify their own murderous and selfish political aims. Marx wanted more than anything to usher in an age in which the common man was a person who was much, rather than a person who had much. He believed he had discovered the motive forces of hsiotry in terms of the class struggle, and sought to end the exploitation of the common man as well as the sense of alienation the commoner felt through his participation in which he sold his labor in a marketplace allowing little or no chance for his innate creativity or humanity to show through.Although largely discredited and ignored today, much of what Marx wrote regarding the course and eventual destiny of capitalist society is as relevant today as ever, and much of what he posited regarding the increasing polarization of society along class lines is proceeding apace today, with the eerie way in which global capitalism conforms to his prognostications regarding the final stages of bourgeoisie society. The book is still open, and the future still remains, and this excellent introductory text on Marx is still, in my humble opinion, worthwhile reading.

Furthermore, anyone who buys this for an impressionable child/teenager should be banned from having any contact with humanity.Intentionally or not, this \\"diary\\" is telling its audience that it's TOTALLY HOT to only care about clothing, the media, make-up, hair, and being an heiress!!! YAY! Let's not strive for anything! LET'S JUST PARTY!!! No one needs to think about anything but what's on the surface!!! Buy more stuff! LOOK AT ME! I'M SO HOT!Do the world a favor get some real role models. You know, ones who actually do something good for the world. Then buy your daughter a blank diary; if she has writer's block you can make up your own questions! WHAT A GREAT IDEA!If you still want to give your daughter delusions of princessery to set her up for the disappointment that comes with the real world, where not everyone is an heiress, just read her some fairy tales. At least Cinderella had to work before she got her big break. I'm all for letting children live in imagination land, but Paris Hilton's influence should be unwelcome & rejected."},{"Title":"Your Heiress Diary","review":"It's bucking the trend of beauty minded America.

It was this Paris Hilton book and I looked it over and loved it! I would recommend it to any fan of Paris or anyone who likes to journal and likes fashion,beauty,shopping,etc. This is a journal jam-packed with pictures of Paris and quotes from her and other people. It asks questions like lies you're glad you told,lies you're sorry you told,your favorite hairstyles,inspirational people and quotes and your favorite fashions with spaces to tape them in. It is not a journal that's blank with lines to write it has questions you answer and stuff like that. I also would recommend it because when i was younger I bought a journal that asked lots of fun questions like these and had a blast rereading a few years later. It would be good for teenagers and young adults."},{"Title":"Your Heiress Diary","review":"Ok, I am thirteen years old, your average teenager.....

I am not saying I'm a huge fan... but what you all should be rating here is her diary... NOT HERSELF! So, get a grip and behave yourselves.I would have to say that this diary is a great outlet for teens to express themselves and feel fantastic about themselves. My only problem was that instead of photos of Paris, it should use the space for pictures of the user's self.This all being said, I would reccomend it for a teen girl who loves to talk, shop, or just loves Paris Hilton. I would have to say a no to any guys... this wouldn't be the right gift."},{"Title":"Your Heiress Diary","review":"I saw this in a bookstore.

And now Ms. Hilton is proof of it! The one thing I did see in this 'book' was her statement that she admires Barbie, because she doesn't really do anything, but always looks good doing it. Oh puhleeze! She admires a doll (not even a real person) and all for shallow reasons! And this is what we are parading in front of little girls to look up to?!? We are in big trouble! Whatever happened to all the women who were working for equal rights, equal pay, etc.? Weren't they always hollering about wanting to be treated as intelligent, capable people? And just when some strides are made in the right direction, this moron comes along? And she has legions of little girls admiring her?!?This is just plain sad.

Sounds pretty harmless for those who find it fun--the descriptions in the reviews tell of some OK life suggestions and values--there are probably some good and some bad. But I wanted to let some of the kids know: Paris didn't write this, and there's a good chance she's never seen it. An item like this is put together by a team--a professional marketer, a writer/editor of some sort, a publicity agent... maybe some additional consultants.Ideally, Paris would see it before publication... that would be the most honest procedure. I'd bet she didn't, however. After publication, a copy might be sent to her... if she likes to keep a collection of \\"Paris products.\\" Otherwise, one of her agents probably keeps the collection. There's a strong chance Paris has never seen this.Young Paris fans can still have fun with the diary. But if you don't like it, Paris is mostly not to blame. Who is? The publisher, the \\"book\\" industry that is producing more and more of these novelty products and fewer and fewer real books. The sellers, especially the big chains, Barnes & Noble and Borders. Does Amazon also encourage these items at the expense of real books? Not sure.Some of the posted reviews, pro and con, by young people are quite impressive. My conclusion is: enjoy the item, but remember to read deeper stuff as well. Keep writing!

I'd like to read it, and see what she writes about in her diary.\\"Well, to my disappointment, dear readers, and maybe even yours, this is NOT HER DIARY!!!

Oh my freakin goth, pink pages with Paris's \\"advice and tips\\" on writing, her stupid ideas on what to write about, photos that show her being oh-so-full of her ridiculously shallow self, and HIGHLY immature quotes that say things like, \\"People who don't like pink just aren't very colorful,\\" or, \\"Why wear black when you can wear pink?\\" or \\"You can be a heiress!\\" What the heck...I really look down on this girl. She thinks EVERYTHING in her shallow life that the stupid Gossip Girls novels are modeled after is an accomplishment! First, she's born into a very wealthy family (well, I suppose it's nice to be wealthy, but just not too wealthy), but I guess I can't blame her for that, because she never chose that life. Then she's an actress. A model. A porn star. A singer. NOW SHE'S A WRITER???????????????? OMIGAWD, the only reason why she ever became a published author is because she's a celebrity, and when agents and publishers get submissions from a celebrity, they would be incredibly stupid to turn down the offer, and they think, \\"Hey, this is a manuscript sent in by a celeb! I can make BIG bucks off of this!\\" whereas, there are TRUE writers out there who are struggling their hearts out to get published, but they can't get accepted, because they're new to the world of publishing, and agents and publishers think they won't be much of a success, AND IT MAKES ME SO MAD TO SEE PARIS HILTON AS AN AUTHOR!!!!! AND A BEST-SELLING ONE TOO!!! Now she just HAS to make this stupid diary so that she can manipulate the minds of girls to be these shallow, mindless, material-obsessed girls like her! I suppose she can give some good advice, like being happy, and pretending to wear an imaginary tiara on your head to give you confidence, but that's it. Yes, I do write (I've filled approximately 25 diaries and notebooks since the age of 9, and my 14th birthday is in a couple of months), but you would never catch me writing in this stupid trashy journal Paris Hilton published unless if you paid me.

In a small fishing village life's toil is interrupted by a festive, somewhat pagan-like wedding involving the bonding of two families of disparate social and economic means. Will this unification spell a new era of hope or despair? Is poverty a condition which should bare contempt, or could it be seen as a virtuous result of living one's life as Christ would have? Read and see for yourself!One of the most fascinating aspects of Bojer's work is the way he so vividly weaves into the story-line such a fascinating number of nuanced characters that represent a slice of rural and coastal culture of late 19th century NorwayFor further information about Johan Bojer see: 'Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature' (Second Edition) pg. 99"},{"Title":"The Fireside Book of Wine","review":"How much do I like this?

Dunne, who was an early British aeronautical engineer and inventor. He was also a philosopher of sorts who, in this book, explores the nature of time and dreams. This book fascinated me when I first read it and today is still worth multiple subsequent reads. The first few chapters are easy to wrap your head around, however in subsequent chapters Mr. Dunne uses graphs and table to explain vastly complex notions about time. If you are good at variable-centric math or sciences and enjoy a good book on the nature of reality, this is a good book for you. I find that the ideas that Mr. Dunne examines in this book hold both mystery and truth still today after 80 years."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT WITH TIME.","review":"When I was searching online for an understanding more about lucid dreams, I came upon a blog post where it is said that one can obtain lottery numbers through lucid dreams (which is ridiculous since a lucid dream takes place in either hypnogogic or hypnopompic state, which is not spontaneous nor easily accessible to the \\"future\\"). But, that blog has referenced \\"An Experiment with Time,\\" which the title itself has intrigued my curious mind. \\"How do one experiment with time, I wonder?\\"Finally, after reading this book, I found myself intrigued by the understanding how both \\"past\\" and \\"future\\" aspects can be mixed in a dream presently. And, he presented a number of exercises or experiments for the reader to try out in regards to dreams, which seemed to be both familiar yet novel. I also have found the author's presentation of a \\"time theory\\" to explain the precognitive dreams as equally interesting yet hard to understand (I must admit, one of my eyes was threatening to leave the socket while reading the latter part of this book). The idea of the \\"Observers\\" is interesting, but I am just not sure about the idea of observers being continued on for infinity. Nevertheless, it's an \\"interesting\\" theory, no more.I was surprised to find this book to be a \\"classic\\" and Dunne's ideas were being utilized for fictions, especially in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis.It is not just a book about the dreams, but more about the understanding of time and how we perceive it. I found myself glad for having read this book because of his ideas at the time. It was written in 1927 about the subjective experiences being backed up with technical explanations. It is admirable, indeed."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT WITH TIME.","review":"I was hunting for this book for 60 years, since I read it first time.Clear style, interesting ideas even after 60 years."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT WITH TIME.","review":"A very interesting book regarding dreams and our capability of \\"seeing\\" the future before it happens. What makes it more amazing is that it was written in the 1920's and yet it's still in force..."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT WITH TIME.","review":"I read this book because it seems to form the basis for the plot line of C. S. Lewis' short story, \\"The Dark Tower\\" (See my review of this book).The premise of the book is that in our dreams, we see the past and the future. When we see into the past, we call it \\"memory.\\" When we see the future, we call it \\"a strange dream.\\" Dunn says that usually, our dreams are an odd mixture of past and future events, which is why we so often fail to recognize the future events when they occur.So Dunne proposes an experiment to help you record your dreams, and notice the future events we dream about when they actually occur. I half-heartedly tried the experiment for a few days, and did actually dream of one future event, which happened the very next day after I dreamed of it.In this regard, the book is quite fascinating, and Dunne may be right. However, the book is extremely difficult to read. Most of it is like trying to swim through mud. You cannot read a sentence or two without getting lost. Some of this might be because the book was written about 100 years ago, and Dunne was an aeronautical engineer.But all of these difficult parts to read are his explanation for why and how we can \\"see\\" into the future. If you don't care about the scientific \\"how\\" and just want to replicate the experiment, the book pretty clearly and simply explains how to do it on your own.If you do try the experiment, and see results, I would love to hear about them!"},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT WITH TIME.","review":"I first read this book 55 years ago, and am glad to have it back in print.

The assignment was to perform a confirming or disconfirming experiment and, based on this experience and other readings, write a paper on experimental method. This book is an excellent tool for motivating critical thought, if one is so inclined. Or it can be read for warm and fuzzy new-age woolgathering. Whether you think it is science or hokum, it is a stimulating book suitable for college sophomores. Draw your own conclusions."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT WITH TIME.","review":"What can I say? I was very disappointed in the main part of the book. I had read it before, 75 years ago when I was 14, and found it very interesting on precognitive dreams. This second time of reading I realized that only one small section of the book is really about that type of dream, the rest is Dunne's own idiosyncratic rendering of an obscure, impossible to grasp, theory about time. It reads like a badly written engineering manual for deaf-mutes. I wanted the book for a collector's item and for reference in an article I have written on precognitive dream theory. As such it was worth the $70 to me."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT WITH TIME.","review":"In this gem first published in 1927, John W. Dunne puts forth a theory of multidimensional consciousness which manifests itself mainly in the \\"Dream effect\\". A mathematician and aeronautical pioneer, Dunne found himself having precognitive experiences throughout his adult life. His dreams would come true. Often times the very next day and in rich detail. I am myself mathematicly inclined, and can only ponder at the discomfort this would have created to a scientist of such a logical mind.And surely enough, he spent the rest of his life seeking an answer to the riddle.In \\"An experiment with time\\", he reveals his startling conclusions, which are based in deductive reasoning and experiments.By applying the concept of regression in human consciousness and time to the results of the experimental work he finds an answer to the problem of apparent psychic abilities in his more or less ramdomly chosen subjects.Not only that; he thereby also explains the phenomena of deja vu and many cases of clairvoyance, common precognition, ESP and many other \\"paranormal\\" occurances.It is important to note that this theory, which I can only describe as analogous to the theory of general relativity in its ingenuity and brilliance, have NEVER been disproven in its 77 year history.Furthermore there is no known physical law or concept that would disallow the \\"dream effect\\", even today.The pieces of the puzzle, therefore, fits uncannily well in the map of the eye-opening reality that Dunne unfolds.Towards the end, Dunne takes the theory even further to prepose the exsistance of an eternal multidimensional concsiousness and a higher, supreme consciousness, which it has to be said, I find rather speculative and philosophical. However, It is an extrapolation that is not wholly unnatural, at least in case of the seamingly immortal qualities of human serial consciousness.This piece is in my mind one of the most important books of the last century, and almost tragic that so few know of it. This is in part, I think, due to the non-scientific material which it brushes up against, but ultimately deciphers for the first time.As to the question of whether or not it is psuedo-science: The experiments can be repeated at all times in any laboratory with any subjects, and from that, the same results have so far been found. These are the parameters which define scientific research. And the more experiments are conducted, the more probable Dunne's conclusions are.This book is exeptionally engaging to anyone interested in these matters. Its my all-time favorite non-fiction piece and I can only recommend it, so that awereness of the theory increases."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT WITH TIME.","review":"This book reviews the author's strange experiences with dreams. He developed a theory of the nature of time as a result. It seems unlikely the author was attempting to deceive readers. He was well known, well respected, and his work was accepted widely at the time.Basically, the author believed dreams relate to a mixture of past and future events, and he developed a test of te theory. The results prove his theory seems to be correct, if you rule out intentional deception. The book is much more convincing than any description of it. And if the thesis is true, then it is is life-changing. I first read the book more than fifty years ago, and I re-read my well worn copy about every ten years, It changed my life."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT WITH TIME.","review":"The reader who was &quot;sickened&quot; by this book apparently didn't notice that it was written about 80 years ago. That reader also missed a central historical point: People have been reporting precognitive dreams for a very, very long time and trying to grapple with how to understand them in scientific terms for about a century. Dunne was one of the first to write about his experiences, and his training as an engineer led him to a thoughtful series of analyses and fledgling theories. Anyone who has had precognitive experiences will find this book interesting. But if you strongly believe that such experiences are mere coincidences, or logically incoherent, or impossible, you should avoid this book because it will just make you angry."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT WITH TIME.","review":"Dunne is onto something very important. The first half of the book is easy to follow and very insightful. It is an important work that, in my opinion, successfully demonstrates the precognotive nature of some dreams. I am perhaps more easily convinced than others as I too have had similar experiences. However, Dunne goes beyond proving the existance of such dreams and attempts to explain how and why they happen. The infinite regress argument seems to be flawed. He claims it to be proof of God's existance. I do not feel that he has successfully proven this theory about the how and why of time. For a very good analysis of Dunne's theory, see &quot;Man and Time&quot; by J.B. Priestly. Regardless, &quot;An Experiment with Time&quot; is a very important book that attempts to take an objective view on a very subjective subject."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT WITH TIME.","review":"I've been borrowing this book from the library for many many years. I'm ecstatic I can finally have my own copy!I still don't know how I feel about Dunne's theory----basically, that our dreams are memories from the future. But it's something that makes sense (no matter how far fetched it sounds....) and it's something that I'd *like* to believe.A regular person can easily understand the text; it's not all heavy-handed scientific terms. An enjoyable read."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT WITH TIME.","review":"This book came to my attention when I read Agatha Christie's auto-bio. I would like to copy part of what she felt about it; &quot;I realise that something happened to me - not a change of heart, not quite a change of outlook, but somehow I saw things more in proportion; myself less large; only one facet of a whole, in a vast world with hundreds of inter-connections.... I did feel from that moment onwards a great sensation of comfort and a truer knowledge of serenity than I had ever obtained before.&quot; As an Eastener I couldn't agree more with her that Dunne's purpose of writing wasn't about the experiment with dreams but the believe of future or destiny, as individual and a whole. Everyone's destiny has already laid to (or in) the future and one has to follow one's path without avoiding it. If one could see or realise about one's destiny, one then will be able to see all material things in a different perspective. Because of the society and believe in that period when the book was published, I believe that was why Dunne was trying in extreme to explain his believe in a very physical terms instead of philosophical terms."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT WITH TIME.","review":"_The author of this book admits that if anyone else had told him of their precognitive dreams he would have had no difficulty dismissing them as coincidence. However, the fact that he himself spontaneously experienced a number of striking examples of such phenomena changed everything. As well it should have, for if we can make contact with the future it means that the entire foundation of our shared conventional assumptions about reality and existence are simply wrong._The author, one of Britain's first aeronautical engineers, designed a series of experiments to attempt to repeat such contact with future events by way of dream. First he used himself as subject, and then he brought a larger number of ordinary friends and acquaintances in. He found that if careful attention was paid to documenting the details of one's dreams immediately after waking, and carefully reviewing and comparing those dream records with later events, then almost everyone has this ability to some extent. Most of us tend to ignore this fact out of some ingrained habit of thought. Later, it was found that this ability to contact the future isn't strictly limited to dream consciousness. It was found that while waking, people could open themselves up to seemingly random impressions that were later documented to agree with future events (such as concentrating on a book that one had never read before- and receiving definite \\"hits\\" on the contents and specific words and phrases- that go way beyond chance.) Further analysis of dream material also showed that we made \\"contact\\" with past events in our lives about as much as we did future ones. Once freed of our habitual way of assuming time as linear (and one way) and the world as strictly three dimensional, the mind seemed to be capable of intermittently ranging past and future in an unfocussed state. The conclusion was that both past and future exist in a higher dimensional framework- and since we can access them- then probably so do we._The first part of this book is primarily empirical, while the second is primarily logical (an elaborate model- complete with diagrams- explaining multidimensional mechanics.) The first part is much more readable. As for the second, as ingenious as it is, I cannot but help think that a cerebrum concentrated in third dimensional consciousness is inadequate to explain higher dimensional realities. We can experience the fact that there must be more to our ordinary conception of reality, but to truly understand it is another matter. Yet, the day will come for us all when we no longer intersect with this three dimensional world- and then we will be free to focus our concentration on the higher dimensional extent of our being._The only restriction in breaking free of our conventional time-consciousness is shaking our selves free of our ingrained habit of seeing the world. Once you have personally experienced such precognitive events, or perhaps synchronicity, then this is much easier- and their frequency increases. It isn't enough to wish or believe- you have to KNOW...."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT WITH TIME.","review":"This book is interesting not only in theory but in presentation. Although Dunne seems excited about his discoveries, his enthusiasm does not muddle the preciseness of his observations. It is an exposition of wonders, geared to explain away phenomena like clairvoyance, d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, telepathy, etc., but he is confident and professional all throughout, at times playing his own skeptic, chicanery-free. Given the burden of empirical proof, the scientific validity of the book will always be called into question. A previous reviewer believes that \\"the main problem arises with the writer's assumption of time having an unlimited number of dimensions. This is a statement that Dunne does not even try to prove at any point of his otherwise rather meticulous analysis.\\" In other words, Dunne conceives of time as being another dimension of space. He has no recourse but to assume that time has dimensions like space because humanity has rather limited tools of perception for the purpose of such a study. If time has dimensions, then it will take time to measure any unit of time, and one will need another unit to measure the measuring time, and so on, until infinity. In such a model, real time would be the unattainable border of this infinite series.What this reviewer regarded as \\"mind-boggling philosophical statements\\" I found to be charming intuitive gems:\\"Evolution has worked for possibly eight hundred million years towards the development of the brain. Today, as Professor McKendrick points out, nearly all the functions of our bodies are operating towards the end of the adequate nutrition of the grey matter. And it now appears that, apart from its self-sustaining and self-developing activities, the brain serves as a machine for teaching the embryonic soul to think.\\"My opinion of the book is best summed up in a preface written for the second Spanish edition by Jorge Luis Borges. It can be found in BIBLIOTECA PERSONAL (Emec&eacute;;, 1998). Borges later wrote an essay incorporating elements of the preface called \\"Time and J.W. Dunne\\" (1940), which is included in his SELECTED NON-FICTIONS (Penguin, 1999).Since the essay can be found easily enough, here is my translation of the preface, written in 1934:\\"A literary historian may one day write the history of a most recent genre in literature: the title. I recall none more admirable than the one on this volume. It is not merely for show; it ignites our interest in the text and sure enough the text does not disappoint. It is conversational in character and opens up marvelous possibilities for our conception of the world.J.W. Dunne was an engineer, not a man of letters. Aeronautics is indebted to him for an invention which proved its efficiency in the First World War. His logical and mathematical mind was opposed to all things mystical. He arrived at his strange theory via a statistical study of his nightly dreams. He explained and defended the theory in three volumes that provoked a clamor of polemic. H.G. Wells accused of him of taking the first chapter of his \\"The Time Machine\\" (pub. 1895) much too seriously; Dunne responded in a note to his second edition, which is now in print. Likewise, Malcolm Grant refuted him in A NEW ARGUMENT FOR GOD AND SURVIVAL (1934).Of the three volumes that constitute his completed work, THE SERIAL UNIVERSE is the most technical. The last, NOTHING DIES (1940), is downright popular science, meant for radio dispersal.Dunne proposes an infinite series of times that flow in and out and because of one another. He assures us that upon our death we shall be handed the happy reins of eternity. We shall recover all of the instants of our lives and compose them in whatever manner is most pleasant to us. God and our friends and Shakespeare shall collaborate in this.\\"And the closing line of the essay:\\"So splendid a thesis makes any fallacy committed by the author insignificant.\\""},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT WITH TIME.","review":"This book, first published early 20th century, has an intriguing theory regarding life, death, dreams and prediction of the future. Although antiquated in style, the idea is still fresh and original. You can try the 'experiment' yourself and sometimes it works. Worth seeking out if you are interested in the philosophy of what is life, death and what are we doing here. Was republished in paperback in UK in the 50's. I lent my copy to many people many who had no previous interest in the subject but then found it quite fascinating - unfortunately someone didn't return it to me!"},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT WITH TIME.","review":"This is the most interesting, accessible and convincing book on the nature of time that I have ever read.

If you believe the future is inaccessible, prepare to be stunned."},{"Title":"The Loser","review":"Open to the first page, take a deep breath, and begin reading--if you do it just right, it'll be hard to stop until you reach the end of this extraordinary 170-page diatribe of envy, spite, self-loathing, and misanthropy that plumbs the depth of the narrator's all-inclusive contempt for life and practically everyone living it, including himself. We're talking a novel that is one uninterrupted paragraph from beginning to end, spoken by one character, who's not very reliable, and quite possibly entirely demented. It's as if one of the more troubled heroes of a Dostoyevsky novel escaped to deliver a monologue written by Samuel Beckett. That'll give you an approximate idea of the style of *The Loser,* which is definitely not for everyone, the novel being more about the labyrinthine workings of an obsessed mind than it is about the ostensible events of the so-called \\"plot.\\" This plot--the intertwined fate of three young musicians, one of whom happens to be the famed piano artist Glenn Gould, and another who commits suicide--becomes the touchstone Bernhard uses to explore his themes of artistic ambition and the destructive power of genius, as well as the double-sided nature of friendship.Bernhard, like Beckett, was a playwright, and it shows in the intricate, serpentine \\"speech\\" the narrator delivers in *The Loser*--in fact, it might even be more rewarding if one were to read the text out loud to better \\"hear\\" the full intent of Bernhard's lush and cadenced \\"madman's\\" prose. For the novel is indeed a soliloquy: contradictory, ironic, by turns concealing and revealing, a confession that confesses the very impossibility of telling the absolute truth.*The Loser* is ultimately a novel for those who find language more intriguing than story, the mind's interior struggle for meaning more dramatic than physical incident. As such, it's a work of the first order. I cant recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"The Loser","review":"A masterful creation about artistic genius, jealousy, betrayal, and failure. Thomas Bernhard has constructed an immensely readable novel about the competitive relationship between three piano virtuosos, and how Glenn Gould drives the other two into self-abdication. The Loser puts Bernhard's own inimitable voice into the central character as he attempts to piece together the protracted process of descent his friend and colleague falls prey to. This text has astonishingly accomplished portraits of the nature of artistic genius and its strangely bewitching tendencies. In the final analysis, Bernhard asks us-as well as himself-whether or not we can truly face our own insurmountable limitations and appreciate divine genius when we finally encounter it. Unfortunately for his protagonists, and perhaps for himself, the answer to that question is a resounding \\"No.\\""},{"Title":"The Loser","review":"People love to read books about heroes and immerse themselves in what it's like to succeed, but few contemplate what it's like to be on the other side; what it's like to give up.The Loser is a snapshot of such a man who is, ironically, destroyed by his own genius and perfectionism in the face of another genius. Unlike his competition, The Loser (who lacks self direction and confidence), and Glenn Gould (who is brilliant but only capable of achieving, not of seeing his faults), the narrator is capable of seeing his flaws and misfortunes alongside his ability, a deadly combination which leads to his demise and despair. He seems to recognize, but not actually admit to himself, that he gave up his one chance at happiness, but by being so concerned with his past blunders he neglects his fortunes, most notably that he is the only one of the three central characters in the book who is still alive.I admit that this is the only book by Bernhard I have read (though I now plan to read more), and I only read it because, ironically, I had become obsessed with Glenn Gould during a research project. Needless to say, I was taken by surprise. This isn't a book about Glenn Gould, it's about genius and its effects on the psyche of the men who existed alongside it; the ones you never hear about because they didn't achieve what they had in mind. But it's not just about failure, it's about the even more frightening realization that one did not succeed not because he has yet to, but because he cannot."},{"Title":"The Loser","review":"Length:: 2:09 MinsA few words on one of the great writers of our time."},{"Title":"The Loser","review":"Read about Thomas Bernhard from an article on Susan Sontag. She was effusive about his work.The Loser is a meditation on the plight of the genius and his pursuit of artistic perfection. It's a dense novel--be prepared to trudge through a non-linear narrative and condensed prose. Indeed, as the translator points out, Bernhard doesn't use the language in a conventional way. His sentences are extended, complex, and the verb tenses are rarely in agreement. His narrator reminisces incidents from the past based on fragments of thoughts, freely skipping from one event to another, and often recounting an event numerous times.The Loser in the novel refers to Wertheimer. Both the narrator and Wertheimer were promising classical pianists before they met Elliot Gould in a seminar with Horowitz. Gould's sublime rendition of Bach's Goldberg Variations ended any illusion about their musical talent--not that they're without talent, but they fall short of the defining quality of a genius. For them, they're either the best or they're nothing.The narrator survives the trauma by building a wall of indifference around him. He gives away his Steinway piano to a girl student without talent and writes thesis and books that have no literary nor scholarly worth. Wertheimer can't deal with living under the shadow of Gould and takes a more drastic way out.Much of the most illuminating thoughts of the novel are couched in aphorisms. This is a reflection of Wertheimer's ultimate talent--he's a genius of aphorisms and not sustained argument. Wertheimer is supposedly based on Ludwig Wittgenstein, whose best works are extended aphorisms. Be patient with the novel and one or more of these aphorisms would strike you with a truth that holds you breathless."},{"Title":"The Loser","review":"I read through the first 90-100 pages of Thomas Bernhard's \\"The Loser\\" in one sitting. I enjoyed it that much. However, the second half of the novel was much harder for me to get through. \\"The Loser\\" is written as an unbroken, 170 page paragraph in monologue style told by a fictional student of piano virtuoso Glenn Gould about how Gould's greatness drove him and his friend, Wertheimer, to abandon their pursuit of the piano since they believed that they would never attain the greatness of their teacher and friend. The prose is dark, dismal, pessimistic and depressing. But the prose is also quite humorous. The first half of the novel is absolutely wonderful, but somehow, I could not easily navigate my way through the second half. The style of the novel changed from engaging to trying. Just getting through the prose seemed like an impossible task. The style of this novel is innovative and very interesting, but somehow, I could not stay engaged through the whole thing. Bernhard's rambling would have been far more easily tolerable in a shorter novel. The book is an interesting exploration of genius, obsession and greatness, but if you're like me, you may think that after 90 pages you've gotten the point and had enough."},{"Title":"The Loser","review":"Men of letters have a long tradition of firing off a parting salvo in their last will and testament. Shakespeare, who bequeathed to his estranged wife, Anne Hathaway, his \\"second best bed,\\" is the most famous practitioner of this art. While the Bard's bequest was steeped in a subtle, bitter brew, other writers, such as the Austrian novelist and playwright Thomas Bernhard, have used their final publication to fling straight vitriol in the faces of the living. Long known in Austria as a \\"Nestbeschmutzer\\" (one who soils his own nest), Bernhard nevertheless managed to shock his homeland after his death in 1989 when this clause of his will was read: \\"Whatever I have written, whether published by me during my lifetime or as part of my literary papers still existing after my death, shall not be performed, printed or even recited for the duration of legal copyright within the borders of Austria, however this state identifies itself.\\" This last phrase is no doubt an allusion to Austria's 1938 Anschluss with Nazi Germany, a shameful episode in his country's history that Bernhard \\"commemorated\\" fifty years later in the play, \\"Heldenplatz\\" (Heroes' Square). I say \\"commemorated\\" in an ironical sense because Bernhard, being the provocateur that he was, surely delighted in rubbing Austria's nose in its gravest mistake.If \\"anti-Austrian\\" is one hyphenated word that describes Bernhard and his narratives, then \\"death-obsessed\\" is another. Upon receiving the Austrian State Prize for Literature in 1967, he told his audience that \\"everything is ridiculous if one thinks of death.\\" The unnamed narrator of \\"The Loser\\" has come to a similar conclusion, having lost his conservatory pals Glenn Gould (\\"the most important piano virtuoso of the [twentieth] century\\") and Wertheimer (\\"The Loser's\\" title character, \\"Der Untergeher,\\" which, rendered literally, means \\"the one who goes under.\\"), the only \\"two people in [his] life who gave it any meaning.\\" Gould died of a stroke while playing the \\"Goldberg Variations\\" (This is one of many fictionalizations that Bernhard performs on the historical figure of Gould; in fact, the stroke struck while the pianist was in his sleep.), while Wertheimer hanged himself in a spiteful and embarrassing plea for his sister's attention. It was Gould himself who, in his \\"ruthless and open, yet healthy American-Canadian manner\\" dubbed Wertheimer \\"The Loser.\\" This epithet works in concert with Gould's staggering virtuosity to wreck Wertheimer's confidence, sending him to seek succor first in \\"the human sciences\\" and later in suicide. The narrator asserts that the die was cast the moment they heard Glenn's divine rendition of Bach's \\"Goldberg Variations.\\"Variations, as a formal technique, rely on thematic repetitions, and \\"The Loser\\" is their prose equivalent. Like a baroque fugue, the novel is polyphonic and maddeningly circuitous; the narrator's compulsive mind returns again and again to Glenn Gould, Wertheimer, Austria, death and, of course, the piano: \\"My ideal would be, I would be the Steinway, I wouldn't need Glenn Gould, he [Gould] said, I could, by being the Steinway, make Glenn Gould totally superfluous. . . . To wake up one day and be Steinway and Glenn in one, he said, I thought, Glenn Steinway, Steinway Glenn, all for Bach.\\" Jack Dawson, the author's assiduous translator, faithfully preserves the novel's almost complete lack of paragraph indentation. With dozens of run-on sentences, the novel convincingly captures the stream of thought in a consciousness beleaguered by madness. It is this uncanny verisimilitude to the unhinged mind that makes \\"The Loser\\" a strangely rewarding - and possibly exasperating - read.[...]"},{"Title":"The Loser","review":"This was the first book I read by Bernhard. I'm having trouble rating it, since it's not his best work but still worth 5 stars. The Loser definitively got me hooked on Bernhard and if you are reading this, thinking about reading him for the first time, there's nothing I can truthfully say to discourage you."},{"Title":"The Loser","review":"The novel is an obsessive (I think), or at least an autistic droning of repetitions and paranoid preoccupations with a tight set of recurring themes, most of them apparently autobiographical. The central tenet is an acknowledgement from the narrator that he would never be as \`good' a pianist as Gould, and subsequent renouncement of the piano, and, subsequent inability to crystallise anything productive in his life as a result of \`analysis paralyses'. The narrator, a nameless character, devotes the span of fifty odd years of his life, consumed, governed, informed by this one meme. He never publishes any of the work he keeps writing about Glenn Gould. The alternative would be a controlled descent into madness, which is exactly what happens to the narrator, arrested in a 2D plane of existence which never changes"},{"Title":"The Loser","review":"This book is not about music, really, even though all 3 main characters are musicians, best piano performers in the world. The book belongs to this very specific genre I'd call \\"On Human Condition\\". The main work in this genre would be \\"Waiting for Godot\\", I guess, and \\"The Loser\\" is definitely in the same domain.It is not at the same level of abstraction as \\"Waiting for Godot\\", which does not make it any worse, though, because it considers human endeavour from somewhat different angle, comparing 3 types of personality - how they cope with failure and success, life. The \\"existence machine\\" concept, which \\"the loser\\" uses to describe his position in life, could be considered all-encompassing methapor, but Bernhard shows that it is not universal, that other people experience reality differently.Bernhard also very clearly shows that success can be experienced as failure, that everything is relative to the personal \\"settings\\" in one's mind. The book is full of subtle absurd ironies, it is tragic and funny, very European, idiosyncratic."},{"Title":"The Loser","review":"apparently other people think like me! this novel is a witty stream of counciousness writing that happily mimicks the things that run through my head, only in someone else's life. taken without the political context, it is an amusing way to spend a couple of hours, if you are interested enough to spend a moment getting the actual context of the book, it is a steller and intelligent snub. i was pleasantly entertained."},{"Title":"The Loser","review":"Even my friend Paul whom I work with, whom has won piano competitions, and played all over the town,including The Whitney, and knew what it was like to be a virtuoso, and whom after 42 years of playing the piano still has a desire to play, even though now he sells pianos more than he plays, and I who also sell pianos, and know them very, very well, though can't play them as well as Paul, but knows just as well what makes them good, and also what makes a good book, believes this book to be a new book. And what I mean by a new book is that this book has never before been written, except for maybe other books written by the author, but with different characters. That this book is not a sad book, even though it may seem as such, just as my friend Paul is not a sad man even though he may seem as such, and I, who may be the most sad of all, although one may think me to be the least sad when compared to my freind Paul, or even this book, I thought."},{"Title":"The Loser","review":"Nothing great; the most distinctive feature of the book is the run-on sentences, and the fact that the whole thing is one long paragraph. The narrator's repetitions & constant returnings to things already said in earlier pages gets a bit tiring. The subject matter (failure, obsession, suicide) could have been approached in a more interesting, detailed way, but we just hear the narrator repeat the same things again & again, \\"Gould destroyed him, hearing Gould play was the end for him, after hearing him he couldn't go on...\\" etc. The Afterword tries to speak well of the author's reputation, but doesn't have much to say about _The Loser_ except how it's a comment on Austria and a semi-autobiographical exercise for Bernhard... Well, so what? I didn't read this to find out about Austria (which I didn't) or about Bernhard, so I find this book lacking (the Afterword even admits that most of Bernhard's works are re-workings of these same themes, so it sounds like this book is more of the same from Bernhard, which makes its repetitions seem all the more repetitious!). I wouldn't recommend it to any friends, and I wouldn't bother reading it again, so I give it 3 stars. The narrative style is entertaining at times, but seems a little superficial at others--as if he's not writing anything particularly deep, so he keeps distracting us with these run-on sentences."},{"Title":"The Loser","review":"This book was scheduled to be discussed at a Harvard Master Class, so I was looking forward to reading it before attending.

If it's just a little nudge towards inspiration, this is a good bet."},{"Title":"Patterns of Home","review":"If you're thinking of building a house and engaging the services of an architectural firm, this is a fabulous overview of the ten elements essential to creating an appealing single-family home. The text is clear and engaging and the accompanying photographs support the authors' point. I wish I'd read this book sooner, but I can assure you I'll read it again. This book should be first on your list if you're educating yourself about design principles."},{"Title":"Patterns of Home","review":"This book provides valuable informaion for those who want to pursue the perfectly built and positioned home. The concepts are fasinating and could be somewhat easy to put into pratice, however, the author uses large, VERY expensivly built homes leaving the impression that only the very wealthy can afford such superior design. This is unfortunate. I do believe that some the most basic concepts can be put into play in most homes it would just take some imagination and determination."},{"Title":"Patterns of Home","review":"There are a lot of books on residential architecture that show beautiful house designs. This book takes a different tact that I find most interesting. Instead of looking at the house first and then emphasizing features, it turns the process around. This book defines ten elements, or essentials, or patterns that help to define what goes into houses that are time proven to be a part of the design of exceptional houses.The book defines these points and then illustrates what they are talking about through pictures and description of several houses that illustrate what they are talking about. Several houses are used on each of the ten points, because there is no one way to design a house.For instance the first point is 'Inhabting the Site.' And sites vary. The site on a mountainside is dramatic. But it may be a long commute from the site in the historic community in which you work. And the house in an urban neighborhood is different than one in a suburb.The other patterns discussed such as light, use of materials, great room designs -- all have various ways that they have been implemented, and are illustrated. This is a different kind of book and brings new concepts to the individuals think of a new or remodelled house."},{"Title":"Patterns of Home","review":"I received a lot of inspiration and solid ideas from this book and I am very glad I found it. Still, I do not recommend it for everyone. Hopefully I can provide enough insights so you will either buy it and get good value or save your money.The authors describe in detail each of ten patterns, culled by years of experience from the original 253 patterns put forth in 1977 in \\"A Pattern Language\\". If you think this severe reduction in patterns alone will make the concepts clear and easy to use, think again. Even ten understandable patterns are hard to put into practice without good examples and insights - this is where the book was most valuable to me.Many of the individual homes used to illustrate the patterns are huge and 'designer-ly'. I was often tempted to skip a page because I didn't care for a particular style or thought the house must be so expansive that I would not learn anything by reading further. Time and again I read the section anyway and discovered some tiny but valuable insight or very clever architectural detail in what I considered to be an ostentatious overall design. Yes, this a 'back-handed complement' but in this case I want to emphasize \\"complement\\" and thank the authors for what must have been a considerable effort to locate, describe, and photograph pristine examples of these ten patterns (if this was easy everybody would be doing it). Message: Read past the glowing prose that describes these apparently brilliant Architects and their work and find the details and concepts that are valuable to you. They are sprinkled generously thoughout the book.In the end, I definitely found relevance to my much smaller project. It enabled me to leverage the patterns to suggest solutions to my unique design challenges. My copy is now littered with Post-Its covered in cramped writing, to remind me of an idea I had when I read a sentence or the inspiration I felt when I saw a photo or illustration. While I still only barely grasp the true utility of the patterns outlined in the book I gained a lot by reading about them. Where I was previously struggling to get my head around all the aspects of a good, well-designed home I feel I can now develop a plan that will make the best of my project.My background:I'm a homeowner with a distant background in constrution and cabinetmaking. I have a particular project at hand - a 1938 Spanish-style house that has great character but badly needs a major remodel. It is too small, has a charming but 'old' floor plan, sits on a narrow, sloping lot, and requires more than an good contractor and an excellent designer to reach its potential.Like many other reviewers I had previous exposure to \\"A Pattern Language\\". I was always intrigued by the concepts in that book but struggled to put them to practical use. I read the \\"Not so Big House\\" books but found them to be far less substantial (less 'prescriptive' than \\"Patterns of Home\\", if you know what I mean). While searching for a more accessible introduction to the pattern concepts I recently read Christopher Alexander's \\"Notes on the Synthesis of Form\\" which I found to be a good, if slightly dated introduction to the patterns explored in the later books.Rating: 5-stars for balancing the theory of patterns in design against the authors' experience and knowledge of solutions to a wide variety of architectural design problems."},{"Title":"Patterns of Home","review":"This is a great overview for learning the basic principles of home design.

He loved it, 10 easy steps with photos. This surprised me, because he's more analytical and I would have thought that he'd prefer the careful data presentation of &quot;A pattern language&quot;. I realized that I like to do in-depth research and plan, he likes to see the actions and results. I much preferred Alexander's &quot;A pattern language&quot;, and I found this book shallow and derivative. He liked the photos of the design principles being applied in &quot;patterns of home&quot;, and he liked having architectural decree as to what design patterns were most important. He immediately grabbed onto a few concepts and started distorting a house plan we'd been working on for months and which we had both agreed upon . This design had already incorporated key design issues from Alexander's book. After viewing sprawling disjointed modern houses depicted in &quot;Patterns of Home&quot; he began pitching a house site we'd already rejected on our acreage simply because it allows sprawl.

The cost of the homes are far outside the means of over 99 percent of American families. However, these large designs include truly practical concepts that can be translated into more realistic homes.Each design is far more useful and welcoming that what you might find in a bool of hundreds of houseplans. We are going to build an energy efficient home under 2000 sq ft, and we will refer to PoH to stay on track with the few essential elements.

It contains some of the most beautiful residences anywhere, gorgeously photographed and described. The book also makes a lot of sense. In a time when so many &quot;design&quot; books are self-serving treatises on a particular style or philosophy, &quot;Patterns of Home&quot; steers clear of jargon and techno-babble. The book delivers ten distinct, yet complementary studies (patterns) that serve to wonderfully illustrate how a house can truly be a home. I am an architect in private practice and I design several custom homes or estates per year along with my commercial, institutional and other commissions. While this in no way makes me an expert, it does allow me to highly recommend this book to those seeking to improve the livability of their home, or design meaning into a home. Even if one is not involved in, or contemplating such a project, this book is a great source of ideas and... well, it has a great deal of tremendous pictures!I am heartened to see Jacobson, Silverstein and Winslow put forth such an accessible, readable and pleasant book on a subject that has been dangerously worn out recently. The material in &quot;Patterns of Home&quot; is not necessarily new, but the presentation of it in such a thoughtful manner is valuable and meaningful. The arrangement of the material is logical, starting with site planning, spatial relationships, and the basics of shelter, light and proportion. The transition into feeling, perception and texture is seamless and rewarding to experience.The chapter (pattern) on &quot;Refuge and Outlook&quot; addresses a concept dear to my heart. My own home high in the Southern California mountains embodies much of this concept. The presentation of this concept gave words to things I've often struggled to explain. I was very moved by the elegant, yet simple language used to present this and the nine other patterns. The ability to crisply and efficiently write about ideas and concepts that can easily become mired in technical or philosophical discourse is not common. It is precisely this skill that the authors bring to this work, and which makes &quot;Patterns of Home&quot; so useful. The authors clearly appear to practice what they preach, and the honesty that I sense in this book is refreshing. I commend the authors on producing a book that is highly informative in a very sensible way.This book is a companion to Lawler's &quot;A Home for the Soul&quot; on my display table. I heartily give &quot;Patterns of Home&quot; five stars."},{"Title":"Patterns of Home","review":"I treasure &quot;Pattern Language&quot;, the book, and was excited to see this followup.The premise of looking back at the patterns and reducing them to a few (10) &quot;super&quot; patterns sounded promising.The charm of the original&quot;Pattern Language&quot; book lay in its quirky drawings, and its reliance on the reader to reflect on any personal experiences with the particular pattern being discussed. The lack of glossy photos gave substance to concepts. The new book follows in the footsteps of the &quot;Not so big house&quot; books method of discussing concepts while surrounded by photos. Undoubtedly, the success of those books gave rise to the structure of this one. I find drawings infinitely more communicative of design concepts than photos. The photos here distract the eye, making it harder to focus on the principle being espoused.The authors walk you thru certain homes or rooms which supposedly illustrate the concept at hand. I found the process sort of phony and aggrandizing of the architect's vision. Hello, but the point/power of &quot;patterns&quot; is that they are time-tested,non- regional, gut-level design parameters not requiring architectural vision. The, after the fact, microanalysis of houses to make their every aspect seem utterly preconceived by the genius architect is sophomoric. Again, the power of these patterns is that if you put them &quot;in play&quot;, good things, especially unforseen things, happen. Predictably. Hopefully, this book, along with the &quot;Not so big house&quot; books will inform the house buying/building community of design realities routinely ignored."},{"Title":"Patterns of Home","review":"Skip this book. Instead get &quot;A Pattern Language&quot; which is the quintessential work of Christopher Alexander. Alexander is the real genius behind the &quot;Patterns&quot; of this book. There is almost nothing new in this book &quot;Patterns of Home.&quot;In the late 1960's and 1970's Alexander and his group (including two of these authors), formed the Institute of Environmental Structure in Berkeley, California. Alexander was clearly the spiritual and intellectual leader of this effort. &quot;A Pattern Language&quot; is a compilation of that thorough effort. Alexander et al's book remains the most important treatise ever on the subject of Architecture. It disseminates a clear and concise identification of basic patterns that make a house a home, for example, pattern 115 of 253 - Courtyards that Live. In addition, &quot;A Pattern Language&quot; is written for us, in the hope that &quot;we the people&quot; can use the patterns to guide the development of wonderful homes and communities. Alexander's book is accessible to all of us.These co-author's of Alexander's great book include two of the authors of &quot;Patterns of Home.&quot; These guys are sidekicks and it shows. For example, in the forward to this book, they acknowledge working on this book part-time while engaging in a full-time architectural practice. They didn't put a life-force effort into this book, although it appears the photographers did. The illustrations and photographs are almost exclusively of high end giant homes in the price range of $300 to $500 and up per square foot! The vast majority of people do and will live in homes built to a budget of $100 psf or less. In short, this is a picture book for coffee tables that shows what an architect can do with an open-ended budget.I think I was dissapointed most with narrow scope of the photographs. As with another reviewer, I noted that the authors showed the patterns exclusively in new, contemporary, upscale California style homes, neglecting better illustrations of the essential patterns that can be easily found in other styles of homes, in older homes, or in homes from other areas of the world.Although I don't believe the author's intended, but this book is an elitist book for dreamers. The homes shown in this book are accessible to a tiny minority of ultra-rich people. If you, the reader, prefer picture type books, you're better off with Sara Susanka's &quot;The Not So Big House&quot; and others of her series. Her design approach is more accessible to a larger segment of the population. Best of all though, try &quot;A Pattern Language&quot; a truly wonderful book accessible to all of us. It will forever improve you architectural mindset.Regards, Steve"},{"Title":"Patterns of Home","review":"I am a HUGE fan of 'A Pattern Language', and found this book in the local library. It took me a while to realize that this book is a far cry from its predecessor. I found the patterns themselves interesting, but over-distilled from the quirky things that made 'Pattern Language' so wonderful...that book is full of the HUMANITY of places that people can create, and the effects on how places feel to us, how we interact, and how we live our lives in the context of these places.My big problem with this book is with the photographs. I actually had a hard time seeing and feeling the point of the patterns. These are all, for the most part, big, expensive architect showcase homes of the west coast. How about showing these patterns in more modest or 'hand made' type houses? How about showing some of these patterns in desert homes, or old european homes? Homes in Mexico or in Greece? How about the patterns shown in other world homes? All these homes are fancy and expensive...it's ok to show some of those of course, but if the book is about PATTERNS, then the best illustration of a PATTERN is to show it in a wide variety of disparate settings.This book, which I sat down to relish, was actually dull. It didn't stir my imagination and get the desire flowing the way 'Pattern Language' did. It's probably worth a look, but do as I did and request it from your library, and read it. Then decide if you really want it. I didn't."},{"Title":"Patterns of Home","review":"This book takes the main concepts in A Pattern Language and fleshes them out, illustrating them with concrete examples and explanations, and demonstating how they can work in a residential home. Some of the themes are quite practical, like capturing light and creating indoor and outdoor rooms, while others are more abstract and theoretical, like the concept of being able to look out from a protected space. All of the principles are based on human psychology and why we inherently like and feel comfortable in some places and not in others, which makes Patterns of Home much more interesting than a typical architecture book. It is a great guide for anyone that wants to design their own house or is interested in vernacular architecture in general. The photos and diagrams are great, and haven't been recycled from other Taunton Press books, which was a nice surprise. I found Patterns of Home very easy to follow and understand as it has a very organized layout that ties all the chapters and their themes together, making it an easy read in addition to everything else."},{"Title":"Patterns of Home","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I endorse the patterns approach to home design, and I've come to rely on Taunton Press for very high-quality construction books.Unfortunately, &quot;Patterns of Home&quot; is a disappointment. It should be subtitled &quot;How Architects Get Their Rich Clients to Build Large Homes Full of Amazingly Superfluous Detailing&quot;. A few of the example homes are very interesting, but the majority of them are overblown ostentatious mansions that most people can't possibly afford. Sadly, Sarah Suzanka, author of the &quot;The Not So Big House&quot; series wrote the foreward. She forgot to mention that most of the homes featured in this book are quite big.If you have a lot of money to spend, or just want to see how the other half lives, you might find the pictures interesting. I got bored and disheartened after the first 6-7chapters."},{"Title":"Patterns of Home","review":"Based on the 10 most important building patterns from the book \\"A Pattern Language\\", by Christopher Alexander (the book every architect should memorize) your expectations just don't seem to get met with this book. There are lots of good photos and lots of well designed houses, but you keep waiting for something to pop out at you when you are reading it, but it just doesn't happen. When reading the book \\"A Pattern Language\\" the small simple illustrations let your imagination flow, whereas in this book, the photo's of finished homes seem to shut off your own creative juices. Also the homes are mostly all huge and expensive. Good for architects designing mansions, but making you wonder how the patterns would have looked in a smaller home.Since not everyone thinks alike, I am sure some people will get allot more out of this book than I have.

Grueling, frustrating and aggravating are just a few. This book shows you how to let go of your inner editor using private writing to let those unpolished gems come to the surface. Writing is work, but there are ways to make it easier and this book gives numerous useful strategies for moving past writing blocks and barriers when you have to write. It is very clearly, creatively and humorously written. Leavy illustrates many of his concepts with examples from his own writing. The most useful thing about this book is that it demystifies the process of writing and shows you multiple ways to create new ideas, strategies and perspectives. These are real, useful strategies, not &quot;learn our new system and you will be successful&quot; systems that are so complicated that you never use them after you read the book. I started using them when I was a quarter of the way through the book and produced 20 pages of single space material in one day. Not all that was great, but I was surprised at how good some of it was. It turned out there were a lot of good ideas in my head just waiting to get out.

This ongoing exercise is valuable for sparking creativity, imagination and problem solving. Levy's ideas are presented directly and humorously, with plenty of examples. The author has an extensive background in publishing, particularly sales, which comes through in his style - part sales team rally, part lingo-ridden pep talk. This approach, however, works.

I was so enchanted by this book that I hired Levy as a consultant for a project that was instrumental to my business. Using the techniques he teaches in Accidental Genius, he proved to me just how &quot;ingenius&quot; he really is.

This book was specially crafted for all of us who may have the makings of a great insight or business idea glimmering but, for some reason, have been woefully unable to give these worthy (and often bankable!) gems a chance to shine. Why? Because of all the undue pressure we place on ourselves to make them come out whole and flawless the first time around. Accidental will give any frustrated, would-be 'genius' a refreshing change of perspective. First, this book tells you how to dissolve the barriers that can hold your creativity back, how to tap your own original notions, and write what you think. Mark Levy's easy--and at times very humorous--writing style will speak to you like the insightful coach you wish you always had, rooting for you at the sidelines--or, if you like, the margins of your page. Then, when you are all loosened up, Levy gives you the best of his successful writing techniques, developed from years of experience in publishing, marketing, and sales. These techniques enable you to do one better than simply 'work' with your concepts. Mark Levy incites you to play with them, turn them upside-down, grow from them (and sometimes away from them!),and delve deep into ideas that you may have previously accepted too easily at face-value. The chapter on 'Extracting Gold from a Business Book' was especially cool, and its usefulness extends to books and articles of any topic. And,without forgetting his purpose, Levy provides you with real-life exercises so that you can produce those rare and elusive creatures known as Solutions. Click yourself a copy.

The idea is that, by writing like this, you by-pass your conscious mental editing, fears and anxieties and simply write what pours forth, to yourself, without anyone looking over your shoulder. With this liberating approach you can then take the uncensored output of your effort and submit it to more traditional editing and fine tuning. As I wrote in my review ofWriting With Power: Techniques for Mastering the Writing Process, I sometimes use that technique to good effect when I need to come up with some good writing quickly. I have not attempted to use the technique to come up with good ideas yet; however, because the approach lends itself to breaking existing patterns, I am confident that it could lead to creative results. This book goes beyond Elbow's in that it gives you a variety of sub-approaches in which to try private writing. These approaches can be used for different circumstances and therefore give Levy's system added flexibility."},{"Title":"Accidental Genius: Revolutionize Your Thinking Through Private Writing","review":"Accidental Genius is a quick read, but has a series of ideas that will keep you reading your favorite author (yourself!) for a long time to come.This book is about using private writing to sharpen your own thinking. This is not a book about written communications. If you're looking for written communications skills, you can't do better than The Pyramid Principle by Barbara Minto - which is considered The Bible among consulting firms.If you're like me, you would have noticed that your typing fingers have a mind of their own - ideas start forming *after* you've started writing about them. Words starting forming on their own, and before you know it, you have a fully formed idea staring back at you on the computer monitor. This book writes out a few ways you can actually use this writing momentum to your advantage. The writing you would do as a result is meant for your eyes only. Writing in free-form and then reviewing the text makes the ideas present themselves to us in black and white (literally!), allowing us to refine them until they're ready.I travel on long flights, and have found the approaches in this book extremely useful in clarifying my thinking, and passing time."},{"Title":"Accidental Genius: Revolutionize Your Thinking Through Private Writing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;listening&quot; to Mark Levy as I read his book.

It's short, easy to read, and entertaining.

I have been attracted to the book in the first place by what the author writes in the Introduction:- Every recognized innovation has, in some way, been a product of human thought. It stands to reason, then, that the thoughts appearing in your mind have an enormous, potential value to you & the world;- Sometimes your best thoughts must be coaxed out, & played with, before they reach their fullest potential;- The world's most progressive companies have sophisticated infrastructures just to develop, and protect, the kinds of thoughts that you've already had or are capable of having;What does this book do, in a nut shell: it teaches you how to get at what you're thinking on paper, so you can convert the raw material of your thoughts into something useable, using an energising body of techniques called 'private writing'. It entails examining all kinds of work/life situations & creating solutions for them through personal reflection and free-form writing.The chapter on 'Extracting Gold from a Business Book' is my personal favourite.For me, I have often used the author's writing techniques as a catalyst to guide my own best thinking on paper. I use what I often like to term as my 'scratch pad', foolscape-size, spiral-bound, 100 pages per pad, 100 gms weight, similar to the type artists use, in conjuction with a multi-colour/multi-utility pen from Rotring. At one point in time, (for about 3 years) I used the Bienfang spiral-bound note/sketch pads until the only local supplier went out of business unexpectedly.On many occasions, I have astonished myself by being able to wrestle with the valuable business & life insights from my own seemingly disparate 'private writing' pages. I have translated many of my valuable insights into pragmatic projects. One of the sideline projects is writing reviews on amazon website.I have noted that one of the most outstanding results of 'private writing' is honing my own critical & creative thinking processes.Because of my personal interests in visual thinking, I often incorporate the 'rapid visualisation' & 'deliberate doodling' techniques I have picked up from Kurt Hanks as well as Joy Sikorski into my 'private writing' processes. As most readers may know, Kurt crafted the classic book, Rapid Viz, among many others. Joy crafted the following three marvellous doodling books, which I also own:- How to Draw a Cup of Coffee & Other Fun Ideas;- How to Draw a Radish & Other Fun Things to do at Work;- How to Draw a Clam: A Wonderful Vacation Planner;I have drawn phenomenal power from my purposeful integration of 'private writing' with 'rapid visualisation' & 'delberate doodling'. That's why I always use a multi-colour/multi-utlity Rotring pen in my work. My scratch pad is always a visual smorgasbord of relatively heavy text, mystical doodles & logical illustrations (thanks & no thanks to my engineering training!).To conclude my review, Accidental Genius, is a real, rare gem. I strongly recommend this book to any reader who wants to explore powerful insight generation, &/or to apply some structure & purpose to - & at the end, extract some value from - all those notes you've been writing to yourself."},{"Title":"Accidental Genius: Revolutionize Your Thinking Through Private Writing","review":"In the ACCIDENTAL GENIUS, Mark Levy does not want to become your judgmental English professor, intimidating you into writing that perfect essay. Those experiences likely lead you to view writing as an unpleasant undertaking, not soon to be repeated. Yet how many of us still hanker to be writers? If you've taken the time to search this book out this probably applies to you. Instead of the critical teacher, Mr. Levy wants to become your personal psychologist guiding you towards getting past the damage that may have been done and allowing you to once again tap into that inner creativity that I'm told is part of our birthright.There are many techniques presented in this book to get past the &quot;internal censor&quot; that keep many of us from taking the steps necessary to getting things out of our heads unto paper. Eventually we may actually convert these ideas into something that may actually benefit others and ourselves.The point is to write often and quickly, literally against a timer set for about hour. This, with repeated practice, will short-circuit the internal censor that tends to want to judge creative ideas as unworthy of being born in this world. Will everything that comes out of our heads be worthy of Einstein? Of course not...not everything that came out of his head was worthy of him. Like sifting for gold, one has to go through a lot of dirt(and BS) and eventually there will be a nugget. The big point is to go for quantity over quality; the refinement process is the next step before public consumption. Still a little sensitive to how good or bad your writing may be? Simply keep it private! The author shares these and other techniques and approaches. He covers everything from writing a book to solving a business problem.After several weeks of practicing with his suggestions, I found that writing became more automatic and easier. I also noticed that the internal sensor was playing less of a role in the production of my output. I was asked to help write a major proposal for my company, a task that I normally would have agonized and plotted through. Instead, much to my surprise, it was.... dare I use the words.... somewhat effortless and even pleasurable.This is a great book for getting started on harvesting ideas. For the next step, which is the refinement of raw ideas, I suggest the Gregg Guide. It deals with the rules of grammar, punctuation and other formalities.P.S. Please be kind when reviewing this entry. I did it to give interested parties a glimpse of what I thought this book was about and also to practice writing. I sincerely hope that I have achieved this. I did not write it as a class assignment or to please the grammar police."},{"Title":"Accidental Genius: Revolutionize Your Thinking Through Private Writing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;listening&quot; to Mark Levy as I read his book.

I'm a big fan of Blue Man Group, and they quote a &quot;Mark Levy&quot; in their promotional material. That book - &quot;Technicians of Ecstasy : Shamanism and the Modern Artist&quot; (1993) - is quite probably written by a different Mark Levy.But amazon's search engine popped 'Accidental Genius' to the top of the list. I was intrigued, especially due to the more-frenetic-than-usual ravings of Tom Peters. I bought it, and was not disappointed. I suffer from many of the problems Levy describes. Foremost, these seemingly great ideas in my head tend to get self-edited and written in an odd, foreign voice by the time they make it down onto paper.Levy's 'private writing' technique is a usuable, practible method that can be employed straightaway. Its power is to allow your voice on paper become the same as the voice you have in your head. It's disarmingly simple, but powerful stuff.Chockful of examples and exercises, you can start using Levy's techniques for immediate results."},{"Title":"Accidental Genius: Revolutionize Your Thinking Through Private Writing","review":"As a teacher of graduate students, I believe that the book will be an extremely useful tool for the people taking my classes.

I am itching to advise my students to buy the book and use the methods therein.

Now, thanks to Mark Levy's book, I've learned how to be accidental on purpose. Had Mr. Levy written this little gem 50 years ago, I might today be rich beyond the dreams of avarice and famous beyond all imaginings. And, more important, a lot less frustrated. This book is a triumph.Indeed, it's even inspired me to write a poemAttack the problem digitally With pen and paper and ink.

As a rule, I generally avoid books in the business genre, but, my friend assured me, this one was different. Well, she was right. Mr. Levy's private writing exercises are a great way to jump-start a bogged down brain. Everyone has an internal editor that usually gets in the way of good ideas; these exercises remove those barriers and show anyone willing to try how easy it can be to have a 'genius moment.' As a professional in a creative field, coming up with unique, fresh ideas is my bread and butter. Now I have another very valuable tool in my arsenal. Thanks, Mr. Levy!"},{"Title":"Accidental Genius: Revolutionize Your Thinking Through Private Writing","review":"As a professional sales representative who recognizes the power of the written word, I could not wait to read Accidental Genius...especially when I learned that Tom Peters wrote the foreward and that he, himself, gave Mark Levy's new book a 5 star rating! What more credibility do you need?! That being said, once I sunk my teeth into this fascinating book, the content didn't disappoint. Mr. Levy provides the foundation to unleash the power of our own writing abilities and gives a game plan on how to more effectively write, communicate and, frankly, close business. The only negative comment I'll give about the book is that it had to end. Buy this book. Read this book. It truly is extraordinary."},{"Title":"Accidental Genius: Revolutionize Your Thinking Through Private Writing","review":"How many times have you looked at a new idea or invention and said \\"I thought of doing that once...\\" How many times have you forgotten things because you didn't write them down? Answers: lots of times, lots of times.Now ask yourself \\"How many good ideas have come to me pure, shining forth with no clutter around them, precisely when I needed them?\\" The answer is likely to be \\"Never.\\"Accidental Genius tries to capitalize on these truisms by suggesting that the mechanism of writing can liberate the mind and allow the good ideas to pour forth - amid lots of debris, even nonsense. \\"Write fast, as close to the speed of your thinking as you can,\\" says Levy, and with a timer (one that doesn't tick). And be relaxed while you do it.The private writing log, which is Levy's main tool, can contain a journal, jottings on a problem or a wish, conversations with self or imaginary interlocutors, fantastic scenarios ranging from phenomenal strokes of good luck to horrifying catastrophe.During the time you assign yourself you pour it all into your log, which only you will see and use. Later, perhaps much later, you will look over what you've written and try to extract the gold nuggets. For the price of a pencil and a pad of paper, you have built yourself a personal brainstormer.Thought-logging has a long tradition among writing; many writers cannot survive without a notebook. Too many character sketches, images, details, dialogue and states of mind would be lost forever. However, the stated purpose of Levy's method is not to become a great or even a publishable writer but to keep a record of your thoughts for revisiting and future profit. The book is aimed at businesspeople but, at least in theory, anyone could benefit from the Levy method.First, the method, which seems inspired by meditation techniques -- paradoxically, it replaces mind-quieting with page-filling --, requires a relaxed state of mind before starting a thought-logging session. Thus, the practice will be much easier for experienced meditators than for people who constantly carry unacknowledged tensions, fears, or other obstacles.Someone capable of quieting his mind and relaxing may find it disconcerting to subject himself to a fast-paced exercise in free writing. Indeed, such a person may not want to get good ideas in this seemingly crass and haphazard way. Yet, in principle, the Levy exercises are no more absurd than practicing archery or repeating mantras.True, the tone of the book is boosterish, the author being almost too eager to tell you his secret recipe -- but as in food recipes, literary polish matters little and the results are everything. Wonderful things can be done with cabbage, raw fish and snails (ants and cockroaches, too).Despite its rough surface, this brief book has the bones of a fine meditation manual for businesspeople and a possibly useful tool for removing mental obstructions and even promoting a degree of self-knowledge in the age of commodity and show -- Levy's tacitly assumed and accepted scenario (whether the acceptance is reluctant or not, we don't know).Talking to yourself in writing cannot be a substitute for the lost art of civilized conversation, but it will likely be a useful exercise. At worst, the technique can work as a placebo or not work at all, in which case you have lost nothing (think homeopathy).At best, it can inspire you to pay attention to your thoughts and to develop an eye for good ideas, as well as good work habits. And if it teaches how to be comfortable in your own company, this book will have been not just a good buy but a steal. Good bones."},{"Title":"The Essential Frank O.

The reader is also offered some additional GENERAL information on various influencing architects, and architectual syles and/or movements. While the text is concise, it is truly unpretentious. The photographs are splendid, especially those showing his masterpiece, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao.

She could sew a mattress, make gormet meals out of nothing, clean your pig sty of a house this afternoon and serve the perfect meal at seven. Oh please!!! The only thing I did like was the first few pages and her love affair of the last few pages which certainly did not atone in my opinion for a tiresome book (oh alright there were some good spiritual truths imparted).

The entirety of Liberty's contents has since been made freely available online, but for those who are just interested in reading a representative sample, by way of introduction, or who might be more comfortable reading ink on paper, then the anthology contained in this book will certainly fit the bill.The articles are broken down by subject, and cover such topics as the political theory of anarchism (and how it compares to Marxism and Liberalism), the \\"labor problem\\", free banking, intellectual property, free love, children, and various ideas on acceptable tactics for spreading anarchist ideas. Anyone confused by the notion of \\"Libertarian Socialism\\" will find plenty of food for thought in these pages.Aside from Tucker, some of the other writers include John Beverley Robinson, Victor Yarros, John Badcock Jr., Gertrude B. Kelly, and Joseph A. Labadie."},{"Title":"The Individualist Anarchists: An Anthology of Liberty (1881-1908)","review":"Upon first reading, skepticism looms overhead, fat black rainclouds of doubt shadow the land. The ray of sun is: that no single opinion dominates this book, that it is refreshingly diverse. Anarchists in this volume emerge as political freethinkers, people of a courageous honesty who debate and exchange powerful ideas on the topics concerning social beings. When closing the book, wonder is in the wind...one ponders Mencken's germane analogy of politics to religion and the poplular participation of the masses in the exercise of control."},{"Title":"Family ancestors of Joseph Barron, 1771-1843, and Marie Josephine Gameline, 1786-1836, Cass Co., Ind","review":"Why would anyone want to read Shadow Box by Antonia Logue? Eighty per-cent of the source material is much more eloquently presented in Carolyn Burke's earlier biography of Mina Loy, Becoming Modern. Logue's novel seems to me to be transparent borrowing from someone else's work. It's as though she took the same deck of cards, blithely re-arranged them, and called it an original work of art. For further corroboration of this point of view, please refer to the Toronto Globe and Mail's review of Oct. 9, 1999."},{"Title":"Family ancestors of Joseph Barron, 1771-1843, and Marie Josephine Gameline, 1786-1836, Cass Co., Ind","review":"&quot;Shadow Box&quot; has received quite mixed reviews: some positive; others critical of its reliance on a biography of Mina Loy by Carolyn Burke. It overall &quot;suffers&quot; (if such be the word)from a failing critics find in modern, especially UK (by extension Ireland)literature: a reliance on already-established characters and history. Apart from those possible faults, I found the book interesting and well-written. Being unaware of Loy, and only vaguely having heard of Arthur Cravan, I found their characters believable;their epoch and milieu in which they lived colourfully-drawn. I do know something of Jack Johnson. The boxing scenes, the hostility Johnson received when entering the ring, were strong. The author has, apparently, never been an actual boxing fan. Her descriptions of the sport's technical aspects were thus impressive. Boxers fought differently then."},{"Title":"Family ancestors of Joseph Barron, 1771-1843, and Marie Josephine Gameline, 1786-1836, Cass Co., Ind","review":"I second the sentiments of the New York Times reviewer ' the anecdotes here, many of which seem merely to have been cribbed from Carolyn Burke's recent biography of Loy, read more like a book report than a reinvention of the events and people portrayed&quot;"},{"Title":"Family ancestors of Joseph Barron, 1771-1843, and Marie Josephine Gameline, 1786-1836, Cass Co., Ind","review":"I never liked epistolary romances but I found myself fully immerse into this one.

That this novel captures much of it in such rich, well-researched detail is due, however, not to the meticulous research of Logue, but to the scholar who wrote the biography upon which the novel is based.

I was at first disappointed at Arthur Cravan, the shadowy subject of the novel, not appearing more frequently; by comparison Jack Johnson\`s boxing career occupies a more important place. However the second part of the work, leading to its tragic finale, more than makes up for this initial disappointment. The pain of loss, especially the loss of a soul-mate as important to Mina Loy as Cravan was, is so realistically portrayed as to make this book unforgettable to the reader of any sensitivity whatsoever. Antonia Logue\`s fictional conclusion, in which she has Cravan still alive in 1946, his existence unknown to Mina his wife due to the death of Johnson in a car accident (the boxer was hastening to inform Mina of her husband\`s existence after his disappearance at sea in 1918), is arguably even more tragic than the doubtless reality of his having drowned in 1918; Mina remaining forever in ignorance of the truth. For someone who has come to love Cravan also for all he represents, this book is a godsend. I recommend it to all who wish to discover more about this remarkable man, the nephew of Oscar Wilde. May readers of &quot;Shadow-Box&quot; resolve to rectify the ignorance of Cravan, still today, in the English-speaking world, when he remains such a well-known and time-honoured name in the annals of French literature!"},{"Title":"Family ancestors of Joseph Barron, 1771-1843, and Marie Josephine Gameline, 1786-1836, Cass Co., Ind","review":"Ms. Logue makes a spectacular debut with this novel, which grabs the reader in the first few pages and pulls him/her along in the swift flow of the most compelling prose.

I was very glad to find that many other things mimic ADD and kids actually may not have ADD. This book took me through a step by step procedure to eliminate triggers that may cause symptoms. I am glad that someone finally realized that kids (and adults too) need alternative choices to drugs. I firmly believe that we are all different and some of us respond to drug therapy without complications, but to put a child on drugs without first determining if they really have the illness is criminal.

This dictionary is split between three volumes. The volumes themselves are taller than your average book, wider as well. Being split over three volumes takes this dictionary out of the \\"overly-large and unwieldy\\" catagory, but you'll still want a table surface to place the volume you're perusing. I aquired a used copy of this dictionary, and in the 36 years of it's existence, the pages have only yellowed very lightly (and has aquired it's own unique older book smell). Being unabridged, there is no skimping on word definition, and occasionally it sites contextual usage of words. In all, I'm quite happy with this purchase."},{"Title":"Cry Bloody Murder:: A Tale of Tainted Blood","review":"Every prospective parent should read this book. Every prospective patient should read this book. In short, YOU should read this book. &lt;/P&gt;In Cry Bloody Murder, Elaine DePrince retells the heartbreaking story of her familys struggle with bleeding disorders, AIDS and the drug companies whose products infected thousands with HIV. Of her five sons, two have died of AIDS and one is living with the disease. &lt;/P&gt;Both DePrince and her children have bleeding disorders; components of their blood, assigned to form clots, are missing. There is a spectrum of severity with such disorders. They are hereditary, and sometimes occur spontaneously within a generation. In Cry Bloody Murder, DePrince explains in detail the genetics, the medical history and treatment of bleeding disorders such as hemophilia and von Willebrand disease. Hemophilia effects men almost exclusively. &lt;/P&gt;During the mid-1960's, concentrated clotting factor products became available, extracted from the blood plasma of donors. The new products brought with them the hope of an easier, longer life for persons with hemophilia. They also carried all of the viruses coursing through the blood of the donors, including many forms of hepatitis. &lt;/P&gt;DePrince weaves back and forth between her family and the technical and historical. We fall in love with her sons. They become our brothers, our children and our friends. DePrince takes us on a journey through the happy times as well as the sad. Occasionally, one of her sons takes over the narrative. &lt;/P&gt;The means to eliminate the virus baggage were available in the 1970's. The companies manufacturing the product opted against using it. DePrince describes, in chilling detail, the process through which the United States Food and Drug Administration, the drug manufacturers and elected officials chose higher profits and convenience (for the manufacturers) over the human needs of the consumers. &lt;/P&gt;Many of the plasma donors were paid. Some donations were from prisons, and many from the poorest sections of society. The plasma was even imported from other nations. In the early 1980's, the hepatitis epidemic among hemophiliacs was joined with the AIDS epidemic. By the mid-1980's, the big majority of hemophiliacs in the United States were infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. &lt;/P&gt;On June 2, 1993, Cubby DePrince returned from the hospital the last time. He was 11 years old. He was vomiting continuously during the ride. However, Cubby insisted on visiting a Bob's Big Boy restaurant along the highway, where he and his mother had stopped many times before. The waitresses and management knew Cubby and had been his friends through several years of monthly hospital trips. He got up from his wheelchair to say goodbye. On June 8, Cubby died at home. &lt;/P&gt;DePrince discusses the litigation and the legislative efforts on the part of the hemophilia community. In most states, the blood companies were shielded from product liability lawsuits. There is a continuing effort to remove this statutory protection. The statute of limitations for product liability lawsuits are too short, when the deadly virus can take over a decade to incubate. &lt;/P&gt;One piece of legislation, the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Act of 1997 is presently before the U.S. Congress. Through this legislation, the survivors in the hemophilia community will gain a measure of financial relief. The bills supporters are presently struggling to gain cosponsors in the Senate. &lt;/P&gt;The story told in Cry Bloody Murder could be that of any family. Elaine DePrince didn't know that she carried a genetic variation that causes a bleeding disorder until her sons were born. The blood product industry supplies components to many treatments and inoculations. We are all at risk. &lt;/P&gt;In the final section, DePrince quotes a list Cubby drew up, 64 Reasons Why You Do Not Want To Get AIDS. The last three are as follows: &lt;/P&gt;62. You do a lot of important things because you have to squeeze them into a short time like ten or eleven years instead of eighty-seven. &lt;/P&gt;63. You try to be extra good and cheerful because if you are extra good and cheerful when you go to heaven, you'll get to be a guardian angel. Being a guardian angel is a better job than just being a spirit. &lt;/P&gt;64. You wonder if people will still remember after you are dead.&lt;/P"},{"Title":"Cry Bloody Murder:: A Tale of Tainted Blood","review":"This book serves well as both the intimate story of a family whose lives have been profoundly altered by AIDS, and an expose of the events that allowed this deadly disease to invade them.While the average American probably believes, as I did until recently, that the infection of thousands of hemophiliacs with the AIDS virus was an unavoidable tragedy, DePrince uncovers the awful truth that for many, if not most, hemophiliacs, infection with AIDS and the deadly hepatitis C virus was not only avoidable, but that the government and hemophilia profiteers (like Bayer &quot;The Aspirin People&quot;) chose not to act to produce a safer product in favor of bigger profits.DePrince also reminds us that the tragedy experienced by the hemophilia community isn't an isolated incident. Many millions of Americans are exposed to blood products each year, sometimes unknowingly, which means anyone at anytime could find themselves facing infection with HIV, HCV, or perhaps some unknown virus making its way into the blood supply today. Blood safety is an important issue to everyone - not just those who rely on blood products regularly. DePrince also advocates for the passage of the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Act which provides compassionate payments to victims of this disaster along with important improvements to blood safety.Read this book as if your life depended on it."},{"Title":"Cry Bloody Murder:: A Tale of Tainted Blood","review":"The only book on the subject availible, and long overdue.

It is written at about a 3rd year undergraduate level, so it should be easily accessible to interested readers. Mathematicians will probably find this book a bit easy, but for those of use who are not mathematicians by training, the ease of this book is welcome. The topics covered are set theory, the number systems, groups, group homomorphisms, rings, and polynomial rings. Landin provides plenty of definitions, theorems and proofs, but he is kind enough to also build intuition about the theory with incisive prose and illustrative examples. It is also great for self study, but does not include solutions to the problems. However Landin gives the reader the equipment necessary to solve the problems with little difficulty.

I'm about 2/3's of the way through and so far I think it has served it's purpose of introducing me to the topic of abstract algebra."},{"Title":"An introduction to algebraic structures","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to explore entry into abstract algebra. I don't consider this book a very good introduction to any area of math. This book is very heavy on the definitions, theorems and proofs. While the examples are good, they are little raisins amidst the hard tack that comprises the meat of the book.This book might be great for a math person who just needs the facts or someone who wants a concise listing of pertinent information, but if you want to learn the subject, there's surely something more engaging and less terse. It is not difficult, but it does not motivate me to read the 8th type of group in a 2-page section much like the last one. I don't use a dictionary as my textbook when learning French, but that might be all someone else needs.So some people might find it useful, but I didn't.

Then there's the tips that just fall into the &quot;just weird&quot; category: wash your face only once a day... or... showering for more than 5 minutes is destructive to your skin.I would have liked to see more discussion on exfoliation and antioxidants. The authors seem to entirely overlook the benefits of Beta Hydroxy Acid (BHA) products, focusing largely on AHA exfoliation. They also push moisturizer for all skin types, which seems kinda unnecessary.Instead of this book, I'd recomend Paula Begoun's &quot;Beauty Bible,&quot; which seems much more effectively presented, researched and documented.

The miracle of this work is that Churchill presents the story from all sides from an objective point of view which is usually lacking in modern writing. Through a combination of personal experience and detailed research Churchill has reconstructed the events of the war in heroic fashion."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"Americans have a warped view of history, and little understanding of the role of aristocracy and class in history--our own or Britain's. Churchill was a card carrying member of the aristocracy; one of the small group of men who ran England up to, and through, World War II. Their Finest Hour is an amazing documentation of the very height, and at the same time, end, of the all powerful aristocracy in England.Churchill's second volume of his Six Volume history of the Second World War begins with May, 1940, as the German army is rolling through Luxembourg and Belgium (both clinging to their neutrality right up to the minute the German tanks crossed the border), toward a woefully unprepared France (still reliant upon the Maginot Line, which in turn depended on Luxembourg and Belgium neutrality.Churchill has just assumed the post of Prime Minister, after having spent the prior year (and several before that) as an outsider bemoaning the refusal of Britain (and France) to prepare to meet the rising German threat. Those years of exile are the subject of volume one.The present volume focuses on the extraordinary difficulties Churchill and others in the British government faced once the war actually began. Once France was forced to surrender, Germany was left in what most of us think of as continental Europe without any enemies. It had allied itself with fascist Italy, made peace with Stalin, conquered Poland and France, neutralized Spain, and occupied Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium, Norway, and the Netherlands.In this sense, Britain stood alone. There was a very real risk that Germany could invade and conquer Britain in the Summer and early Fall of 1940. The German bombing of London was increasingly effective, and the British army was in total disarray, having just been forced to abandon France, leaving most of its equipment behind. Just how worried Churchill was comes through clearly and terrifyingly in this volume. Had Germany succeeded, the world might look very different today--the Second World War would have been transformed into a truly intercontinental war, with Asia and Europe allied against North America.Of course, Britain was not really \\"Alone.\\" Greece and Turkey were firm allies; Bulgaria and Yugoslavia stood against Hitler and Italy; and Britain controlled most of what we today think of as the third world--from Gibraltar at the southern tip of Europe, to Egypt, to South Africa, India, Malaysia and Burma, and Australia. Only by adopting a firmly eurocentric view of the world (which Churchill clearly had) can he title this volume \\"Alone.\\"Churchill and the rest of his government were able to move seamlessly into power, and immediately take control of this world wide empire precisely because of the peculiarly insular class system that ruled Britain. Even as an outsider, Churchill clearly had full access to all of the centers of power. He could not bend and shape them, but he was fully in the loop. Personal relationships and lifelong associations meant that he regularly met with leaders at all levels of the power structure--including most importantly (but by no means exclusively) top politicians and naval personnel. This sort of access by \\"losing\\" politicians in the United States today is unimaginable. Can anyone seriously envision Bush allowing the head of the CIA to meet regularly with Howard Dean to review the intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?The only weakness in this volume is Churchill's over reliance on his own contemporaneous telegrams and memos. he was absolutely prolific, apparently having dictated dozens of multi-page memos daily--yet still finding time to run the government. While fascinating historically, they really are bureaucratic memos. The first volume, by relying more on narration and less on historical documents, allowed Churchill greater reign to his incredible skill with the English language. Here, long sections read like just what they are--official documents written in haste, for the historical record.That said, his brilliant use of words shines through. The most stirring passage is toward the end--his eulogy in November, 1940, for Neville Chamberlain, who more than anyone was responsible for \\"appeasing\\" Hitler. Rather than lapse into \\"I told you so\\", he marshals some of the most stirring words ever written to praise Chamberlain; urging history to judge him on the strength of his character rather than the results of his actions, which are subject to the fickleness of history.In sum, this is a remarkable book, chronicling a remarkable time in history, written by a remarkable man who played a central roll in events. I can think of no other book by anyone at anytime which brings together all three of these elements--and is well written!"},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"All six volumes of Churchill's history _The_Second_World_War_are off scale in their quality.

Other reviews of this Kindle edition have remarked about the typos. Believe them! The typos are great in number and just plain foolish. They are as if the book was copied from a handwritten manuscript by someone who was not entirely familiar with the english language. I love these books, and will finish them. I am, however, considering purchasing hard copies rather than push through this sludge of typos. In truth, I have only completed a third of this second book. The Gathering Storm had no typos to speak of. This one's a wreck. It does diminish the experience."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"We all know that this is one of the great books in the English language, so its basic quality is scarcely a matter of reasonable dispute. There are some minor problems with the Kindle edition of the text, but they are not (as some have suggested) the fault of Amazon, nor are they particularly disconcerting.There are indeed some minor typos in the text--clearly the result of OCR errors when the physical text of the book was scanned. The publisher, Rossetta Books, is guilty of failing to catch and correct these errors. They are not, however, so numerous or so heinous as to make the book difficult for me to read with pleasure. A typical error, for example, is that the word \\"ministers\\" is routinely transliterated as \\"ministen.\\" This is perhaps due to the fact that in some mid-century typefaces the \\"rs\\" combination was turned into a single connected character which would look like an \\"n\\" to OCR software. One's brain does need to be a bit agile to tune out these typos. They are a problem, but not a big one.Some reviewers have complained about the quality of the illustrations. I agree that one or two maps are too small to be useful, but the vast majority of them (particularly the battle maps) display quite well on my K3. Do remember that you can enlarge any illustration by moving your cursor onto it and then clicking. Having the Kindle edition of the book is actually preferable to trying to consult the maps in a small paperback. Since one can download the book onto multiple Kindle readers at one time, I find it best to display the relevant map on one device while reading the text on another. This makes it very easy to follow the movements of the various forces.Finally, several reviewers complain that the book causes their K2 to crash. Happily, that has not been my experience. It is every bit as readable on my K2 as on my K3.At its current price of $2.99, Winston Churchill's \\"Their Finest Hour\\" is a very sweet deal indeed."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"Not the fault of the author. Winston is magnificent. But this edition is filled with hideous typos.

It starts with Winston taking the helm in 1940 with a National Coalition government. The fall of France, the deliverance of Dunkirk all melds into an English National nightmare for Mr. Churchill.The agony of an eminent invasion of Hitler's Teutonic forces leads Winston to declare \\"I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.\\" Next came the Battle of Britain in which Churchill utters the classic statement of this great struggle, \\"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.\\" Winston was in charge during this extraordinary historical event.Winston describes his Naval relationship with FDR and with continued prodding convinces him into the remarkable program of Lend-Lease. It is here that Winston is both an excellent Salesman and a proper Statesman. He neither comes hat in hand nor does he come as a demanding potentate. He merely states the facts of the situation as they are. In the long run Roosevelt agreed.Germany finally violates Russia. England is joined at the hip to the Russian Bear. What choice did England have? The long wait of fighting Germany alone was over. Pray tell what of a Grand Alliance with the giant of North America.I found this book to be the highlight of Winston's writing of the Second World War.

It tells the tale of the perilous Battle of Britain. At this stage in the war, victory was anything but certain for the United Kingdom, which struggled against the Nazi menace alone.Like the rest of \\"The Second World War,\\" the tale is told from the vantage point of Great Britain's indefatigable Prime Minister and War Minister, Winston S. Churchill. Few historical works that I have seen have the authority of being written by a principal player in the narrative.Churchill makes liberal use of offical and personal documents from the period, including his ongoing correspondence with President Franklin D. Roosevelt.As a piece of literature, the series shines. Forgetting the importance of the series as an historical document, Churchill's mastery of the English language makes for worthwhile reading.As someone who writes for a living, I find that the quality of my own writing goes up a notch when I read Churchill."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"As a late boomer (47) one of my earliest memories was watching Churchill's funeral on TV. I remember feeling it was such a solemn occasion, I wasn't sure exactly why at three years old, but I felt it. Many years later I live on the other side of the planet. I met Winston's grandson, who was my local MP before I left England.This is a fascinating insight into the situation, of decisions made and my first, first hand read from his own hand, there are many very important decisions made, on the hoof, with lives at stake, national identities at stake.I intend to read more, from his WW1 books, to hopefully gain a clearer idea of what happened in the Dardinelles, an event which is used to create a pivot for the national identity here."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"Kindle has done a great service transcribing this most important historical (and entertaining) book of the 20th century.

Their Finest Hour is no exception. Unfortunately, the Kindle edition is riddled with typos. I'm surprised a book of this quality got such shabby treatment in eBook form. Perhaps future Kindle editions will be more carefully prepared. Five star book, one star format: three star average."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"This is the second volume of Churchill's six volume history of the Second World War, which was written \\"just as the dust was still settling,\\" in 1948. Of the various phases of the war, this volume covers the one that Churchill was best placed to narrate: 1940, with the rapid collapse of French resistance, Britain had to fight alone. And it was Churchill's actions and rhetoric that proved an essential catalyst in rallying the British people to the task.The first volumeThe Second World War, Volume 1: The Gathering Stormcovers over a 20 year period, from the end of World War I until May, 1940. This volume covers not much more than half a year, from May until the end of 1940. The first half is focused on the fall of France, following the disastrous (for the French) German break-though at Sedan. Tough decisions? Adversity tends to concentrate the mind. There is a chapter of Churchill's decision to sink the French fleet in Oran, Algeria. It was one of the tougher decisions he was forced to make: to turn British guns on his former (and still) allies, killing over 2,000 French sailors, since the French Admiral, Darlan, would not undertake the proper actions to ensure that the fleet did not fall into German hands. There are also good chapters on the evacuation of almost the entire British Army from Dunkirk, which allowed it to fight \\"another day,\\" as well as the German plans to invade England, which were incorporated under the code name: \\"Operation Sea Lion.\\"The second half of the book commenced with the Battle of Britain, the air war that featured the outnumbered Royal Air Force defending Britain, and stopping the Luftwaffe. Many still remember Churchill's stirring tribute to the British airman: \\"Never have so many owed so much to so few.\\" The relentless German bombing of civilian targets was a key catalyst in rallying the British people for the war, as Churchill covered in his chapter: \\"London Can Take It.\\"There are several chapters that underscore the increasingly global nature of the war. Efforts are made to support the newly formed \\"Free French\\" units, under General DeGaulle, to oppose the collaborationist government of General Petain, whose government is located in the French town of Vichy. The \\"Free French\\" need a base to operate from, and so efforts are undertaken to capture Dakar, in Senegal. A British lifeline is the American war materials coming under the Lend-Lease program, and the Royal Navy must defend the convoys from German U-Boat attack. The \\"Burma Road\\" is opened, to supply Chinese forces which are fighting Japan. Germany and Russia continue their maneuvers under the \\"non-aggression pact\\" that each has signed. It seems both know that war is inevitable, but particularly Russia is trying to buy time, or is in deep denial. In the Mediterranean, the Axis stays on the offensive, with Italy attacking Greece, Crete, and is moving towards Egypt. Overall, it remained a dark period for Britain, but Churchill's final chapter is an up note: British victories against Italian forces in North Africa.As with the other volumes in this series, there are numerous telegrams and documents reproduced that only the very serious student of the war need read. Each chapter has useful summaries of the salient matters listed at the beginning, which facilitates ready reference. Once again, as with the first volume, 5-stars for this effort."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"Portions of this title are riveting. The tensions of the times in Britain come through clearly, and the bombings and sacrifices are telling. Churchill's writing style can be tedious in some areas, but the bad digital conversion adds to the issue. Several words are repeatedly misspelled in the Kindle version, and this should have been corrected before publication."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"I thought I knew a lot about world war two but after having read the first volume and now starting the second, I found out how little I did know.

His economy of words, clear thought and organization of such an immense subject have made these books a pleasure.Highly recommend this series to anyone wanting to understand this war from all aspects."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"shame on amazon. thousands of scanner errors. amaon scanned it and sold it without proofreading or even spell checking."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"After reading this book, you truly begin to see how narrow minded the average American perception of World War II really is. Not to discount the magnificant American battles such as the landing at Normandy or the Battle for Midway, but the Battle for Britain was absolutely the finest display of honor and courage throughout the entire war. This tiny island and it's courageous people stood alone and stood tall against not only the behemoth Nazi-German menace, but at the same time fought the Mussolini in northern Africa and awaited the Japanese onslaught in their Australasian colonies. It's an absolutely inspiring work, and it's an absolute sin that American schools don't teach the story of how the British people shined so brightly during their darkest hour."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"I began this six book series just for a taste with book one and three moths later I am well into book 3. Why? Because it is fascinating. Because it fills so many gaps in my knowledge of these times. Because it blends so many familiar themes and even familiar phrases with new material. Because Winston writes so very well. Because the times in which he lived shaped so very much the civilisation in which we live. Because if Tolkien's great work (The Lord of the Rings) fictionalised so much of this struggle Churchill's is the real thing but without elfs and goblins. And his breadth of vision is tremendous. One can easily forgive a touch of self advertisement.With respect to the format I bought volume 1 on paper nad then switched to Kindle. The small print of the paper version was miserable. The kindle version has a number of word recognistion errors but still wins easily. I never lose my place, I set the font size and the touch of the leather case is more agreeable than the paperback. I will be buying book four and on Kindle."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"If I were to be marooned on a desert island this series would be at the top of the list of books I would want to have with me. It is not only a tremendous and facinating work on a major event in the history of mankind by the one leader who stood alone against Hitler, but is a study of a master of the English language.Every page is a pleasure to read.The print and production quality of the books, however, leaves a great deal to be desired. Simply put, the printing is awful! Some pages are barely readable because the ink impression is so light. Others are so heavy that the words are a blob in some areas.As a printer myself, it is clear that the publisher demanded no quality control from their printers, and are, in the end, responsible for this unhappy situation. The result of this is that reading these paperbacks becomes a lot of work.Fortunately the authors incredible command of English, along with the history, make it worth the effort on every page. I can hardly put it down and this is my second read.The author and history deserve five stars, but the printing and production - and publisher - barely deserve one."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"In the first half of Vol. 2, 'Their Finest Hour', Churchill covers the Battle of France. As new Prime Minister he sets up his Coalition Government to fight the 'common cause' and prepare for the War. Germany was already in France and the Western Front was under attack. The Belgian Government was striving to remain neutral and soon all was being lost in the 'deluge of disaster'. The Germans broke the Maginot line and soon the Battle of France was lost. There was the successful deliverance of the British Expeditionary Force at Dunkirk and the preparations to defend the home front.The second half deals with the Battle of Britain with Hitler preparing for 'Operation Sea Lion'. In order for the invasion of England to be successful, Germany first had to control the air. London and various areas were shaken but neither the spirit nor the Country destroyed. Italy was on the move, in the Mediterranean, and invading the African coast. The Battle of Britain was won and the RAF had 'Their finest Hour', but the War was far from over. This volume covers the timeline of May 10, 1940 to Jan. 5, 1941.It should be noted and remembered that England stands in a different position militarily than France. England is a small, ancient, insular island that has withstood many centuries of assaults and attempted invasions. So when Hitler and his forces sought to make the same attempt, not only the RAF and the Royal Navy but history was standing against them. Also it wasn't just England alone that was fighting. It was also their devoted Commonwealth, Dominions and Empirical Attachments that were involved in the war. England was pulling resources from all over their Empire. For instance, Australia and New Zealand were fighting on the African coast and in Greece.America, under FDR, was moving closer to the war with the Lend-Lease Act and Japan was watching in the wings. Hilter was changing his war direction and moving into the Eastern Front. Stalin was changing his alliance with Hitler and moving closer to Britian and the United States. The impact and weight of the World's destiny was in the balance and starting to slowly shift. Nothing was yet certain and U-Boat packs still prowled the ocean.This is another of those 'deserves to be read' books. Churchill fills in the volume with his correspondence and hindsight. It is good to read and become acquainted with Churchill's thoughts and this fateful time, in history, so that hopefully there will be no repeating of these terrible events. Well worth adding to the Library."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"Sadly, the Kindle Edition of this work fails to do it justice. Churchill has dotted this text with numerous charts and tables illustrating the progress of the war, and every single one of them is completely illegible. The Kindle edition has included them at a shamefully useless resolution, and so I must suggest that any interested reader buy a different edition. I am very disappointed in this purchase."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"I bought Churchill's 6-volume history of the Second World War many years ago, but did not find the strength to begin reading it until some time later. The effect was immediate. Although it took me over a year to read all of it, that was only because I have long had the habit of reading a number of books concurrently. I simply couldn't put Churchill down. To say that the story of World War II is a gripping one, is to put it mildly. How much more gripping do you think it might be in the hands of that one unique individual who was both one of the central players and the recorder of the events themselves. At times, I found myself actually wanting certain historical events to go in favour of the Allies although, naturally, I already knew the outcome! Such is the effect of Churchill's writing.In the second volume \\"Their Finest Hour,\\" Britain was holding the fort against Hitler alone. After Dunkirk, spirits were low all over the place and the value of Dr Goebells's secret weapon was able to come into play with great effect. One can imagine the feeling of the citizenry of Britain at that time, trapped as they felt themselves to be in that little island, with an unbeaten army just across the channel snarling at them. The whys and wherefores of the actions of both Hitler and the German General Staff at that time, can be discussed until you are blue in the face. The fact is that, although most people on both sides of the Atlantic thought they were about to hop across and finish the job, the Germans hesitated, mainly for lack of a plan, and lost the chance. I don't know for sure if Churchill also thought the British might have been defeated in July, August or September of 1940, but from the end of that odd period of stalemate, he never looked back.This is fine writing by a, dare I say, highly experienced writer who was right in the thick of things almost from the word go. What a stroke of luck it was that Churchill, like Caesar but unlike Napoleon, both lived it and wrote it."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"This is probably one of the best books I ever read.

Does Amazon have any standards?"},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"In six remarkable volumes, the incomparable Winston Churchill sets forth the Second World War in enormous detail and largely from his own personal perspective as Great Britain's Prime Minister. In this, the second volume, Churchill sets forth the events of the year 1940, the momentous period when France fell to the Nazi tyrants and Britain stood alone against Hitler's onslaught. The book is divided into two parts. In the first part, Churchill explains just how and why France was defeated and how she came to capitulate to the Nazis in defiance of her pledge to Britain to keep fighting. I have never seen such a detailed description of the political arguments and considerations that went into this decision. The book is invaluable for this reason alone. Also detailed are the military setbacks that led to the French surrender and necessitated the British evacuation at Dunkirk. Churchill reprints many of his communications with other world leaders, such as President Roosevelt, his own ministers and military leaders and his communications with Parliament and the British public.After the French removal from the war, Great Britain stood alone in defiance of Hitler. Churchill makes it clear, however, that as British home defense became stronger and stronger, he remained confident that his country could repel any invasion. This did not save the nation from the horrors of the German blitz and this is described in detail, including Churchill's own experience in a bomb shelter. The specifics of the Battle of Britain, the first major air battle in history and the growing war at sea are also explored as is the growing relationship between the United States and Britain.The year 1940 is the year Britain survived on her own and was the only year in which invasion was a genuine possibility. Yet from the American stand point it is one of the most neglected periods of the war. Churchill's writing is elegant and accessible at the same time. This is true of all his works. The book and Churchill's memos and other internal communications reveals that even in this difficult and trying year, he always had a strategic vision of victory. Much of what Churchill predicted came to pass after many hard and deadly years. But in the year 1940, ultimate victory seemed impossible. Indeed subjugation seemed a realistic possibility. Without the leadership of Churchill, it is doubtful Britain would have stood defiant. After 1941, Britain's role in the war was diminished and then eclipsed by that of the United States and the Soviet Union. Churchill recognized and indeed welcomed this inevitable development and covers it in the subsequent volumes. But without question, 1940 was Britain's \\"finest hour.\\" Read all six books in this series."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"In this second-of-six volume series on Great Britain's role in World War II (WWII) British Prime Minister Winston Churchill details his nation's involvement in the conflict beginning with France's unexpected capitulation in May, 1940, to the defeat of Italian forces at Sidi Barrani in Africa in January, 1941. At a time when Britain stood alone, only an iron will to persevere and the English Channel prevented a Nazi takeover. In Churchill's words, this may very well have been, \\"Their Finest Hour.\\"Churchill narrates an almost daily account of activities worldwide that affected Great Britain and the British Empire. He recounts the Battle of Britain and analyzes the reasons for Germany's defeat. It was here, he made his famous statement regarding the Royal Air Force, \\"Never has so much, been owed by so many, to so few.\\" He also goes into great detail on his on-going negotiations with Franklin D. Roosevelt for American aid. This early correspondence would develop into the alliance that ultimately proved fatal to the Nazis.This first-person account of some of the most momentous events of the 20th century is essential reading for any serious student of the war. Churchill provides numerous insights, that are largely unknown to American readers schooled only in the, \\"we hit the beach at D-Day and Germany surrendered,\\" mentality. Written in simple, yet elegant prose, Churchill explains exactly what happened and why from the British perspective. , Detailed, readable and authoritative, \\"Their Finest Hour,\\" has inspired me to read all six volumes of this important work. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking insights into this tragic and exciting period of world history."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"In this second of six, this epic tale is wonderfully told by Winston Churchill. It is the stuff of bravery, valor and everything that stands in its way. More than anything, Winston Churchill's writing style is exemplified, to me anyway, by his daring to speak of great deeds, but also of cowardice.Winston speaks of his countrymen and our own President with the highest regards in being able to deal with the terror that was forced upon the world. He also goes so far as to tell the reader which Generals of the French Army had given up long before they ever should have. He speaks of the leaders of Italy waiting hungrily until only at the precise moment when it was at their utmost advantage to strike.He points out in his communicaitons with friend and foe the great things people said, as well as the mistakes people made, including his own from time to time. It is fascinating to see the first hand accounts of this great man in a desparate position doing his best to keep himself and his country held together.He delves into Britain, France, South America, Germany, Italy, Greece, the Americas and all other nations which at the time which may have had a hand in the war (some did, some didn't).I found this book to be a far more enjoyable read than the first as it covers all aspects of the war rather than focusing primarily on the Naval situation. As you will see in the first 100 pages at the battle near Dunkirk, this book covers all aspects from ammunitions to fighting forces.One thing I found interesting was that most nations did not choose to join WWII. They were forced into it by the Germans. Russia, France, Britain, Belgium, and yes, even the U.S. chose to fight only when the other alternative was devestation and slavery into the German hands. This is something our history books neglect to mention but which Winston is very gracios to point out."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"\\"Poor\\" rating is based on the corrupt file, not Mr. Churchill's truly absorbing history.I read many of the reviews of this kindle version and despite a few warnings that this file was corrupt,and that the diagrams and charts were illegible, I decided to download a trial of the book.

Beginning with Churchill's ascension to the office of Prime Minister, it continues to the end of 1940. It covers a time of the events of legend. On these pages we read of the end of the Phony War with the Blitzkrieg on France, the evacuation from Dunkirk, the fall of France, the emergence of DeGaulle, and the titanic Battle of Britain that may have been a turning point of the war.The sudden and shocking collapse of France is told by one who struggled mightily to hold things together as the situation disintegrated around him. Churchill's repeated trips to France to assess conditions and to try to rally the French makes for fascinating reading. Churchill's exhortations to continue the struggle, the French demands for more British commitment, the frantic pleas for an American declaration of war and the incredible offer of a perpetual union between Great Britain and France make for a rapid sequence of unique events that are stranger than any novelist's fiction. As the battle lines dissolved the incredible rescue of the BEF and other forces from Dunkirk saved the troops that were to form the nucleus of the band that would return to France four years later. The fall of France would place the French fleet in jeopardy which led to intense negotiations and the unfortunate British attack at the fleet at Oran.When the Battle of France was over, the Battle of Britain began. The Battle of Britain was the battle in the skies over Britain in which the RAF and the Luftwaffe fought for the air supremacy that was crucial to any German plans to invade England. When Germany recoiled from the battle the invasion tide receded and the British were forced to seek out other theatres if combat in which to engage the foe, this time in the Middle East.A gifted writer, Churchill tells the story that only he knew, as only he could write.

The fall of France, the deliverance of Dunkirk all melds into an English National nightmare for Mr. Churchill.The agony of an eminent invasion of Hitler's Teutonic forces leads Winston to declare \\"I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.\\" Next came the Battle of Britain in which Churchill utters the classic statement of this great struggle, \\"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.\\" Winston was in charge during this extraordinary historical event.Winston describes his Naval relationship with FDR and with continued prodding convinces him into the remarkable program of Lend-Lease. It is here that Winston is both an excellent Salesman and a proper Statesman. He neither comes hat in hand nor does he come as a demanding potentate. He merely states the facts of the situation as they are. In the long run Roosevelt agreed.Germany finally violates Russia. England is joined at the hip to the Russian Bear. What choice did England have? The long wait of fighting Germany alone was over. Pray tell what of a Grand Alliance with the giant of North America.I found this book to be the highlight of Winston's writing of the Second World War. If you don't read it, shame on you!!"},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"Insights which come first hand from Churchill.

Four or five millions of men met each other in the first shock of the most merciless of all the wars of which record has been kept.\\" - Winston Churchill, \\"Their Finest Hour\\"If you want to really read an authoritative study on how the daily grind of war affected the political leadership of a nation, Churchill's \\"The Second World War\\" series is as good a place as any to start, especially with the second volume, \\"Their Finest Hour\\". Here, Churchill, as Britain's new appointed Prime Minister, took over the reins of leadership at the outset of a very difficult time in the country's history when war threatened to destroy its very existence. His assessment of how the nation contended with the myriad of Herculean tasks, necessary to keep Hitler and the Nazis hordes at bay, makes for a fascinating read because they are seen mainly through his eyes and those of his colleagues in government. This war memoir contain a trove of letters, directives, memos, maps, charts, and recollections that tell a complex story of a man dedicated to saving a nation by exercising enormous courage, diligence, and resolve against incredible odds. It is evident from how he rallied the British people to fight back that Churchill was definitely the man for the hour. If Churchill's copious correspondence is anything to go by, he was relentless in his plans to design, devise and direct a national effort to thwart the enemy, even if the odds looked hopeless. Even though he let his generals conduct the war effort, he was always there to offer advice, make inquiries, and impose the will of the War Cabinet if things weren't going well. One features alone commend this book: Churchill's command of the situation at hand with respect to his grasp of the problem and his ability to involve others in coming up with solutions."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"This is a great book. Especially for World War II historians and enthusiasts.It gives great insight into the events from Churchill's perspective. It helps us to understand why Churchill and the British government acted at the time. It also goes to show how close they almost came at ending the war much earlier.Typos make it difficult to read at times.While it is a long read, it is well worth the effort. At times it is hard to put down because you want to know what comes next. You know what the outcome will be what you want to know how they processed the information.I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm","review":"Their Finest Hour includes details and background of some of the more famous vignettes of World War 2: the Dunkirk Deliverance, the terrible and foreseeable Battle of France, the Battle of Britain, the British victory in Libya.Churchill's personal correspondence delivers the reader a first-hand sequential view of German aggression, Britain's ever resourceful ability to keep up technologically with the enemy, the indomitable spirit of the English people, and the incredible slowness of the American government to realize that what menaced England would menace the United States if the Republic did not join the Allied cause.What other reviewers have mentioned concerning typos is true: Rosetta did not bother proofing a horrible OCR scan, which strikes me as callously incompetent.

It's also a tool for better reading comprehension because they learn also about false cognates at the end of the unit. Unit 1 is all about geography and includes a vocabulary of different words for the same object in different countries.

I have always liked Novell's Directory and found it the best to work with from its inception to the latest incarnation. That being said there were still a lot of tips in the second and third parts of this book that resolve issues that took a long time for me to resolve on my own. Whether you are installing eDirectory on a Novell system or Linux you will find everything you need to resolve installation issues and keep it in top working order in this book. The author chooses not to repeat the installation and administration information provided in Novell's documentation but instead has produced the best supplemental book available today.

It is one of those rare books that bridge the yawning gap between the popular personalised history books that are so inspiring to the young mind, (eg. E.T.Bell's &quot;Men of Mathematics&quot;, Kasner &amp; Newman's &quot;Mathematics &amp; the Imagination&quot; or Kak &amp; Ulam's &quot;Logic and(?) Mathematics&quot;) and the terse, somewhat desiccated university text books. This can leave the undergraduate not fully appreciating the motivation for exhaustive rigor and also losing any perspective of where the abstract theorems and lemmas are ultimately distilled from. This book links the historical characters, controversies and challenges with the modern techniques that gradually emerged to deal with the pathological behaviour of sets, series and functions. It would be a mistake to confuse this book, as some of your reviewers have done, with the many first-year undergraduate texts that are available. It could be regarded as a sophisticated high school book that gives a real flavour of how the classical problems are treated in modern rigorous style, or alternatively as a colourful motivational aid to early undergraduate analysis courses. I hope that the publishers encourage similar ventures in other branches of the subject, for instance algebra, differential &amp; integral equations, probability and perhaps even quantum theory."},{"Title":"Analysis by Its History (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics / Readings in Mathematics)","review":"This books gives a unique approach to Calculus using its historical development. The most notable feature of the book is that the order of topics is reversed from what has become standard in current textbooks. It begins with the analysis of areas and volumes. This is followed by derivatives, continuity, and the notion of function. This is the order in which analysis developed, but not the order one would follow if building understanding of the subject from a foundation upward. Historically, the foundations were laid last.The book is not intended as a history of analysis. It is rather intended as a textbook or reference in which the topics are presented in historical order. The historical background is intended to give insight into a modern view of the subject. It accomplishes this admirably.The book is filled with examples, quotes, vignettes, historical background, computer graphics, and copies of original documents. Special topics are interspersed throughout. The book gives us a fresh and envigorating view of Calculus. It is an invaluable resource."},{"Title":"Analysis by Its History (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics / Readings in Mathematics)","review":"This book's aim is really to teach analysis. It is not a book on history of science, the kind you read like a novel. The difference with a standard text is it proceeds after the historic evolution. It's quite an audacious approach, for mathematical rigor flowing from axioms towards theorems through lemmas and hypothesis doesn't fit well with historical connections which are chaotic, incomplete and abstruse. It's really not like the (many) books which have great concern for historical context discussed in appendices or footnotes. Here the history is underlying everything, but--once again--it isn't an history book anyway. Theorems are proved.I do not recommend it, not even to beginners, though it can be a good introductory book. It indeed is much less abstract than a classic text of the same level, with many illustrations, and in depth detailed explanations (for beginners serious after the idea of doing Mathematics, I suggest Rudin's &quot;Principles of Mathematical Analysis&quot;). It has many things at its advantage anyway. It shows for instance how many astoundingly insecure results were granted, and thus illustrates well the experimental aspect of mathematics, often denied. It comes with false proof (for instance Euler's taking limit of series or Ampere's theorem about derivatives of continuous functions), and reveal the difficulty of such giants like the Bernoulli, Cauchy or Weierstrass with the problems of convergence. It sure helps understand how mathematics are partly a science of discovery, not a science of just invention. It shows mathematicians are mere people, after all, and that one's difficulties have little significance. In the overall, it sheds light on the genuine mathematical world, which is often seen as a cold topic where one makes its way to the solution through lengthy linear computations. This a book that can definitely make you love mathematics, and ask once you caught the hint for more abstract, deeper texts (Rudin for instance).Thus while the merging (once more not the simple association) of the theory with its development's history was not necessary, it has been _very well_ done. If this approach pleases you, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Analysis by Its History (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics / Readings in Mathematics)","review":"This very interesting book contains very good historical perspectives on analysis. If you want to know how things like trigonometric functions, logarithms, infinite series, differential and integral calculus and differential equations come about (but written from a modern viewpoint), then this is the book for you. It is not a book for casual reading like E T Bell's Men of Mathematics, but the reader will learn a lot of college and undergraduate mathematics along the way."},{"Title":"Analysis by Its History (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics / Readings in Mathematics)","review":"Starting with the bottom line, THIS IS NOT a first-year undergraduate course in Mathematical Analysis and should never be used as such (you wouldn't use Hardy's A Course in Pure Mathematics, either, for all its venerable merits).If you ARE doing first-course Analysis, you'll have to stick to whatever textbook your professor chooses (hopefully NOT Rudin's masterpiece). If you get stuck with that, you will do well to search for a more user friendly alternative or supplement in the line of BINMORE or BRANNAN's book (there are others, for the market is flooded in this area), some good text that emphasizes the fundamentals taking his time, that emphasizes the practical connection between Analysis and (high-school) Calculus, and that uses a lot of visual illustration for good. If you remain stuck still, then you will have 1) to rethink the wiseness in choosing a career that requires advanced mathematics, and/or 2) as a last resource there is the \\"Yet Another Introduction to Analysis\\", which isn't the standard textbook either, but it can get you unstuck and on safer ground.Then, what on Earth do we need HAIRER and WANNER's Analysis by it's history for?For starters, it's a VERY BEAUTIFUL book (in the line of Proofs by the Book, if you know what I mean, but a step lower). The explanations are right and straighrforward, at an accessible level that reminds me of that other gem of a book, DUNHAM's Euler: The Master of Us All. It has a lot of examples and graphic elements and takes you into a wonderful journey into what is rather more Calculus than Analysis, alohg the path taken by the great classics (without being a book on the History of Calculus -try EDWARDS for that, and forget Boyer's-). In addition, if you just don't read casually the book for the sheer pleasure of it, but you DO WORK through it and do the exercises, you will end with a sure grasp of the fundamentals of Calculus (and thet is what Analysis is supposed to be), a surer grasp than you would have memorizing the whole of Rudin's consecrated and masterful text, Another reviewer takes issue with the many short quotations that decorate the book, as epigraphs to every little section, that are intended to maintain a historic flavor. Some of them make good sense, and a few others are rather quizzical or downright cryptic: all in all, it's a rather idiosyncratic and funny feature of the book, but it's not a matter to take issue with.IN SUMMARY: it's NOT supposed to be a standard textbook nor should it be used as one. But if you think that Calculus (and Analysis) is the greatest endeavor mankind has engaged in -take that \\"com grano salis\\"- and you remember still your high-school Calculus although you're not a working mathematician, but something more on the amateur side of it... if you appreciate mathematical books looking the beautiful way they should all look like (and remember -or get outright- Proofs from the Book)...if you'd love getting a refresher on Calculus cum Analysis, THEN PLEASE DON'T MISS that book, so very clearly and beautifully conceived and written. One book like this occurs only a few times in a century, unfortunately you and I haven't written this one, at the very least let's share the joy of reading it, at whatever depth level we feel like!"},{"Title":"Analysis by Its History (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics / Readings in Mathematics)","review":"I return to this book again and again just out of sheer pleasure. The depth of scholarship of the authors shines through on every page and the choice of historical material is fascinating.Topics like compactness and uniform convergence can here be seen to have arisen out of genuine necessity-they are not (as would seem from other books)mere names in a standard syllabus.

This is a disorganised mess of historical and mathematical tidbits. It's not a great place to learn calculus, but it's good side reading since there are many interesting topics, some of which are often neglected in today's books: continued fractions (!), complex functions already on page 56, an interesting section on differential geometry, Euler-Maclaurin summation, etc. The authors also have the very commendable habit of including charming facsimiles of figures from original works.Chapter 3 \\"Foundations of Classical Analysis\\" and chapter 4 \\"Calculus in Several Variables\\" are almost completely ahistorical. The \\"by its history\\" part of the exposition is restricted to some scattered superficial remarks, including silly nonsense such as that if Leibniz had know of the intricate progression of theorems needed for a modern proof of the \\"fundamental theorem\\" then \\"he might not have had the courage to state and use this theorem\\" (p. 239). And in another parodic misuse of the historical perspective, the authors introduce Descartes's folium merely for the purpose of practising the determination of stationary points (p. 322)---of course, Descartes introduced the folium for a much more interesting purpose, but to learn that story we must look for an \\"Analysis by Its History\\" book worthy of its name."},{"Title":"Analysis by Its History (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics / Readings in Mathematics)","review":"The idea behind this book, of presenting the topics involved in calculus in the order in which they were developed in history, is commendable.

This book, published in 1997 fills a needed void, and covers the natural history of this breed. As is well known due to the effects of DDT (which has been banned for many years), this species in particular was scarce and endangered for a long time. The Osprey is now making a strong come-back and is showing an astonishing adaptability to co-exist with man. Here in Florida, I have seen them build nests on metal signs over the freeways near water, and showing every sign of thriving. Illustrating this text are lush color photographs of these birds - soaring, fishing, nest building, raising young, courtship, etc. In the text you will learn how the Osprey enjoys the highest success rate of all the fishing raptors, and their fishing technique is discussed at length from beginning to end. Migration, courtship, vocalization, rearing of young, it's all here. The effects of man and development are also examined, competition from other birds, etc. This is a great book on these fabulous fishermen, definitely, a must buy!

There are occasional anthropomorphisms, such as \\"ospreys are relatively taciturn as they go about the business of providing for their family\\".

If you were a fan of the game Return to Krondor or if you are just a Riftwar junkie, you might enjoy revisiting some familiar characters. Tear of the Gods is just plain awful. Unlike Krondor the Betrayal which was based on a great video game, Tear is an awful book based on a lackluster video game.This is not representative of Raymond Feist's work. Do yourself a favor and read the Magician books, Silverthorn, and A Darkness at Sethanon before you start the Krondor Riftwar Legacy series. If you fall in love with Midkemia, then read every other book that Feist has written before stooping to this. Only the most devoted fans will appreciate it and even then it will be hard to tolerate the flaws. As a die-hard Feist fan, it's almost hard to believe that the same man wrote this book."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"This book, like all of the Riftwar Legacy novels, is a painful read of scripted, wooden characters that have absolutely no life to them. The plots are more like children's books, and everything is extremely predictable. The hero's are heroic, the bad guys are overtly evil, and the action is just as cartoon-like and predictable as anything being shown on Saturday mornings...It is best to skip this book, and the rest of the Riftwar Legacy along with it, and pretend it doesn't exist when you read the rest of Feist's Midkemia novels."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"I said it before, for Kronder: The Betrayal - Feist should stick withwhat he knows best, namely writing excellent books, rather than trying toemulate computer games.Rather than the well-structured sagas we are used to with Feist (I'm along-time fan, having started reading his work in the 80's), this book...and indeed most of this trilogy...reads exactly as what it is pretendingnot to be - a computer game with one ultimate quest, riddled with anumber of smaller side quests...open the magic box in the right sequence,destroy x-creatures before returning to npc character, etc., etc.In a nutshell, the priests of Ishap transport a magical gem once everyten years from a secret location to its mother temple in Rillanon, thecapital of the Kingdom of the Isles in Midkemia. The gem is called theTear of the Gods, and is said to allow the gods to hear the prayers ofeveryone on Midkemia. Without the Tear, the world would become godless(considering how many religious wars we have here on Earth, having aworld become godless doesn't seem such a bad thing) and magic might evenfade. Worse, if it fell into the wrong hands, it could be used as aweapon of unmatched power wielded for unspeakable evil...or some nonsenselike that. Anyway, the ship transporting the gem is attacked and sinks.The race is then on between James, Jazhara, a monk of Ishap named Solon,and a guildsman who can raise the ship, named Kendaric, against the evilnecromancer Sidi and his henchman Bear, to recover the Tear. The outcomewill determine whether Midkemia will be plunged into eternal darkness orcontinue on its merry way. Given that James appears later in theSerpentwar saga (as does William) and the Kingdom is still intact, atleast at the start of the Serpentwar saga, it isn't giving much awaytelling you that James and William survive this venture, and the Tear issafely recovered. The how in all of that is the key, then, but I'll leaveyou to decide for yourself whether dragging yourself through at least2 terribly planned and executed books is worth it.When I first read the book I was very disappointed and genuinely put offby Feist's work. It took an effort of some will-power to start readingTalon of the Silver Hawk (first book in the Conclave of Shadows series).I'm glad I did continue on to Talon, as Feist returns to form.

Squire James, Jazhara (the new court mage of Krondor), Kendaric (a member of Krondor's Wrecker Guild), Brother Solon, and William must track down Bear, retrieve the Tear, and destroy the evil that has taken over the small town of Haldon's Head.Feist has added some interesting plot twists in this novelization of the game and has greatly expanded upon character depth that was originally present. By doing this, he avoided the walkthrough-like feel that was sometimes present in Krondor The Betrayal. Jazhara especially is discussed in far greater detail. William, Solon, and Kendaric are given more depth so that you care about them a lot more than you did when you played the computer game.If you haven't read any of Feist's books, I recommend starting with Magician: Master and Magician: Apprentice, the first two books in Feist's Riftwar series. You'll appreciate this book a lot more if you've read all the previous ones, even though it is a good read in its own right.The book is 372 pages long, but I read it all in one night since it was so good that I didn't want to stop reading it. A must-have for any fan of Feist.Even though this book is not due to be release in the US until March 2001, it is currently available in the UK and Australia. I purchased mine from Australia since I couldn't wait until March to read another of Feist's great books."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"First let me say I'm a big Feist fan. Second, I have read everything he has written and I have also played the first video game &quot;Betrayal of Krondor&quot;.The entire Riftwar Legacy series is a steep drop off from his early works. All the books in this series are very quick, high action stories with characters previously established from the Riftwar series. I think Feist is relying heavily on the reader's memory to help him or her enjoy these books. Feist is taking his two most popular characters, Arutha and James and running them through this really fragmented and ridiculously dangerous story. In this book alone, James will face mercenaries, spies, demons, vampires, and other forms of evil incarnate in the span of about 2 weeks time. This is probably the video game element coming through in the book.Feist introduces a host of new &quot;main&quot; characters in this book (unlike the previous two) and it makes it more enjoyable to read. The problem I have is the new characters are not part of the history we have already read. Because Feist is going back in time with these books, you already know Jimmy the Hand will survive and these new characters will disapper of the face of Krondor, never being mentioned in his later &quot;Serpent War Saga&quot;. This whole series is not really adding anyhting to the entire Krondor series as a wholeThis is what I consider light fantasy. It's a fun, quick read. If you have a good imagination and you like Jimmy the Hand, this book will probably work for you. It is the best one in the Legacy series so far. If this is your first Feist, read the Riftwar Saga first. It is 100x better and it'll put these books in perspective. I hope in the future, Feist writes his books to be read, not played."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"Book 3 of the Legacy of the RiftwarOut of the three Riftwar Legacy books, Tear of the Gods is by far the worst. I know that all three of these books are based on video games, and this does hurt the storytelling somewhat, but Feist was way too obvious with this book (I am not kidding you, there was a \\"rescue the baby\\" side-quest). I'm a longtime fan of the Riftwar Universe, and I'm looking forward to new books in Feist's new series, but this was just a bad book.Here's the story: Every ten years the Temple of Ishap replaces its most holy object, The Tear of the Gods. The Tear is a mystic gem that allows communication with the gods. Supposedly, if the Tear fails without a replacement there will be ten years with no hope because humanity will be shut off from the gods until a new Tear can be formed (a process that takes a decade). The Tear is being transported by ship when the ship is raided by pirates, including one bad man named Bear.There are still problems in Krondor as someone is trying to throw the Western Realm into chaos. Jazhara, the new court magician for Prince Arutha is arriving in the city and Squire James is sent to escort her to the palace. On the way they get involved in several escapades involving some nasty acts taking place. As the story progresses Feist brings together the continuing troubles in Krondor with the search for Bear and the Tear of the Gods.Like the other two books, this book is filled to the brim with action (as you might expect from a video game adaption). Some of it works, other times it just feels forced. Unlike Krondor: The Assassins, or even Krondor: The Betrayal (to a lesser extent), Tear of the Gods did not feel like it really had a coherent story. The characters were moved from place to place, but there was none of the depth that I have come to expect from Raymond Feist and his Riftwar series. Even considering this was part of a lesser series from Feist, I was still disappointed by Tear of the Gods. Video games and novels are two different mediums, and this felt like too much of a video game RPG plot (complete with side quests, mini-bosses, and boss strategies). Feist still has two more books planned in the Riftwar Legacy series, and hopefully they will be better than this offering."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"I am a diehard Raymond Feist fan, have read everything he's written, so I think I have the perspective to say this is NOT his best stuff. I really felt he phoned this one in. The man who brought us Pantathian Serpent priests is now resorting to vampires as villans?! How pedestrian! This work was far less imaginative than any of his previous books. I really began to wonder if perhaps Mr. Feist has run out of gas with regard to storylines for the world of Midkemia (I hope not!). With the success of his video games perhaps his focus is less on writing these days and more on other creative pursuits. This book did have the feel of a video game. Every couple of pages the 'good guys' did battle with 'bad guys' and after awhile it got quite tiresome. Where the political intrigue and finely drawn characters that make his earlier work so engrossing? Mr. Feist is a master of creating believable worlds but he just took us to a very boring corner of this one."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"Feist's story line has become derivative and it appears he has joined Clancy in losing interest in pleasing a devoted audience. I am amazed at the amount of repetitive phrases he uses in this book (how many times did James almost lose his head; how often did he sidestep to have two opponents get in each other's way?). As I recall, in &quot;Magician&quot; and his other earlier work there were a number of underlying plots and twists. This book could not have been more predictable. Actually, the &quot;trilogy&quot; could have been one book. But then we wouldn't have had to read three novellas and pay for all three."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"Let me start off by saying that since the moment I have picked up my first book by Feist, I've been hooked. His continuing series is the best I've read next to Tom Clancy's run with Jack Ryan. However, it is painfully obvious that this book was written under some sort of duress. Storyline-wise, this is a VERY short story and really strikes me as something that should have been a minor plot strand in another book.The three main characters bumble from clue to clue in solving a mystery that's not very interesting to begin with, and there is no plausability for the story whatsoever. For so important a task as they are undertaking, I find it incredibly hard to believe a young thief/squire, newly appointed court mage, and a fairly minor Ishapian monk are alone in their quest. None of the other characters which we know and love make an appearance, not even Pug, which is surprising because of the magnitude of what has happened. I understand the constraints placed on the auther since this was a game first, and in the intro to the book Feist also mentions that he was undergoing a divorce while writing this, but I'm really quite surprised that he published this book under his own name.Like any other Feist fan I will continue to buy every book he publishes, until I see more than two books of this quality in print, but I urge anyone who has not already bought this to wait for the paperback edition. In a review by someone praising this book, he mentions he read it in one night, well, that is hardly surprising condsidering the large font used and the small number of pages."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"Let me preface my remarks by saying that I consider Raymond Feist one of the greatest contemporary writers of the fantasy of intrigue, along with George R. R. Martin. Mr. Feist's characters tend to possess a little more humor than Mr. Martin's, but that in no way detracts from the gravity and intensity of the stories. I dedicated most of the fall of 2000 to reading all of Mr. Feist's \\"Riftwar\\" novels, including the \\"Empire\\" trilogy that he co-authored with Janny Wurts. I thoroughly enjoyed every word I read and have recommended these books to at least a half dozen of my friends. . .So, why is this beginning to sound like a mea culpa?? Because, even though I enjoyed this book for what it is, an enjoyable yarn and a good read, I cannot call it one of Mr. Feist's best works. The first two books of the \\"Riftwar Legacy\\", \\"Krondor: The Betrayal\\" and \\"Krondor: The Assassins\\", worked as two connected parts of the same whole. \\"Krondor: Tear of the Gods\\" picks up on the same story line and introduces a new main character in the magician Jazhara, but instead of advancing the series and wrapping it up, as I had thought it was going to, it leaves us hanging for, guess what, another sequel. The same hook that began this book remains at the end, with no resolution, just with more red herrings thrown in. I realize that should not be a bad thing, but I'm beginning to fear, just a little bit, that Mr. Feist might just be teetering on the brink of becoming, gasp, Robert Jordan. It almost seems that Mr. Feist has lost his direction in Midkemia and is afraid to let go of the world and the friends that he has created, and, who, up to this point have been faithful and endearing. We have been to Midkemia during the time of the Riftwar in the original series. We saw the alternative view of the Riftwar in the \\"Empire\\" series. We have seen the aftermath of the Riftwar and saw the younger characters grow up in the stand-alone Riftwar novels, \\"Prince of the Blood\\" and \\"The King's Buccaneer\\". We saw the final barriers to peace in a future Midkemia shattered as the ancestors of the Riftwar conquered all in the \\"Serpent War\\" saga. A successful PC game, \\"Return to Krondor\\" was spawned by the Riftwar phenomenon. Perhaps the weakness of this book can be explained by the fact that the novels of the Riftwar Legacy are patterned after a game. Perhaps I should consider it remarkable that Mr. Feist has managed to squeeze three decent books out of a game and leave it at that. After all, every other attempt at turning a game into literature has been wretched.Raymond Feist is a major talent and will remain one of my favorite writers. I am confident that a man of his talents can step out of these temporary doldrums and produce more masterpieces of fantasy. I truly hope that the next installment of the Riftwar Legacy is indeed one of those masterpieces and it will manage to shut up a fool like me!!!"},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"Im a big big fan of Raymond Feist, his Riftwar and SerpentWar Sagas were totally amazing, as were his 2 &quot;in between&quot; books. Unfortunatly this hasnt carried over to the Riftwar Legacy. I had high hopes for the Legacy, that it would fill in some holes about Sidi and the Crawler that was only touched on in the Serpentwar saga. Unfortunatly it doesnt resolve anything, in addition the tear of the gods is single handidly the worse book ive ever read, and especially is Feist's worst book. Betrayl was good, Assassians was also good, but this book bit. Im not sure if its just becuase he was restrained by the video game, or if he just didnt care and just wanted to bust out a book about the game as quickly as possible, but either way, the only reason why you should read this book is to finish the series,and even then id think hard about it."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"Ever since I read the back cover of &quot;Betrayal at Krondor&quot; the first book in The Riftwar Legacy, I knew that it would be the plot of the computer game. I didn't have my hopes up about the book's content. That being said, I'm not as disappointed as most the other reviewers. I've read all of Feist's other books at least twice but will probably not re-read this series. It's nice to see Jimmy the Hand and the beginnings of William's career in the military, but it's not the same calibur of the Riftwar, Empire or Serpentwar books. However if you are a Feist fan, you should have a little fun. Sometimes that's all I ask in a book."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"I'll echo the words of others in these reviews and say that this is a poor novella in a generally good line of books. Feist has been one of the more consistent fantasy writers but the last three legacy books have left me cold.In fact I will go so far as to say that the novelization of the games has detracted from some of his earlier works as the familiar characters feel at best two dimensional and stilted."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"If you never read Feist before, or it has been a long time since you read Feist, this is a good book to read. Devoted Feist fans who have read his other series (Riftwar, Empire, Serpentwar, Conclave, Legends, etc) might think otherwise since it doesn't follow the &quot;norm&quot; of Feist's books and world. Purists will have a lot of complaints.Personally, I read this book right after the final Serpentwar Saga novel &quot;Shards of a Broken Crown&quot;, and finished it quickly. While many Feist fans found this book to be a little disappointing, I thought it answered a lot of questions for me... particularly about Midkemia religions and some vague references in Serpentwar.Feist had to work the plotline around the &quot;Return to Krondor&quot; game. Hence, the pace of the book is different than his usual writing and he introduces new characters. This book also tied up a few loose ends in Serpentwar Saga (even though it takes place about 25 years before Serpentwar, it really does help you to understand the background of Serpentwar). I have never played the game, but after reading this book, I was definitely intrigued.Readers who enjoy a fast-paced novel similar to what's found in game-adapted books and adventure party/AD&amp;D-based novels, will enjoy this book. If you enjoy playing RPGs and are trying to get into fantasy reading, I highly recommend it. People who has never read FEIST before really enjoyed &quot;Tear of the Gods&quot; as well."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"I'm a newly minted Feist fan, having picked up the Riftwar series in the last two weeks. After thoroughly enjoying Darkness at Sethanon, I went hunting for the next books to read and wound up with the Krondor series in my hands. It is needless to say that this series suffers in comparison to the earlier ones. There is just something missing in Feist's most recent works. Maybe--maybe--if there is a fourth book, and it is Feist's absolutely spectacular level best, he can pull this series off, but putting into reality a conspiracy as widespread as the one that he's been hinting at for the past three books is possibly beyond even Feist's considerable skills. I'll wait and watch and try to hope, but I'm not holding my breath. Instead, I'm going to read the other Feist series, plus Prince of the Blood and King's Buccaneer."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"I've never played the Krondor games on which this book is based, but I found the read enjoyable regardless. Feist is an entertaining writer, and with the Riftwar Legacy series, he's returned to focusing on well-rounded popular characters like Jimmy the Hand and Arutha. This is a far more pleasing turn, since the I didn't like the characters in the Serpentwar Saga quite as much."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"No matter what other people say about Feist's latest book I would have to say he keeps true to his series. I think this book fills in some of the background for James and other characters. I played the game (Return to Krondor) and I found that the book filled in some gaps that the game left out. No matter what other people say this book is a 5 + star."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"Just got done reading it. Feist makes you turn every page, I could'nt put it down. If you want proof I'll tell you that it only took me four days to read it, (of course its summer and I have nothing else to do.)

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"although I love coming back to Krondor, it wears on me that every page is a fight with someone, sword, rogue magic user... I love Fiest books, and I did enjoy this one, but after knowing how it all ends up, it's hard to get into the swing of things, if you haven't read his other books, do, this one too, it's a good book and enjoyable, if just a bit much on the constant action"},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"I have taken it upon myself to read the riftwar legacy over twice, and each time I have thoroughly enjoyed it. I think of Krondor: Tear of the gods as a fun read it made me laugh out loud more than once. Raymond E. Feist is able to bring out the new character Jazhara beautifully. He portrays her as a very well educated women of very high rank. Yet at the same time she is able to hardly be noticible in the poorest sections of krondor (until she uses her magic of course). Then there are the action sequences, I found that they were done wonderfully. I myself am a fencer and it is easy for me to picture these rapier sword fights. Also there is magic behind it all, the bone amulet, the demons, the temples, and the tear of the gods itself! I would reccomend this book to anyone who has interest in a little bit of adventure and mystery."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"I've read every book writen by Raymond E Feist, and enjoyed them all. Unfortunately I found &quot;Tear of the Gods&quot; to be his weakest work. It was overly predictable and lacked the character development Feist excels in creating. A complete disapointment."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"There's nothing inherently BAD about the Riftwar Legacy books, they're just not great either. They are ideal for someone who finds intricate plots confusing, or long sequences without \\"action\\" boring. These are like the Harlequin Romance novels of Krondor.In Tear of the Gods, poor Jimmy can't walk to work in the morning without having to kill a couple of cutpurses, then has to off a few more when going out for lunch, and rounding the day off with another fight to the death before turning in at night. It rapidly approached ludicrousness. We also get to meet the most impotent wizard ever, who is skilled enough to be hand picked to be the court magical advisor, yet can't seem to get a single spell to finish a street tough. She ends most fights by whacking them over the head with her staff, seems kind of sad really.Old fans of the Krondor books will enjoy seeing more background on some favorite characters, new readers will be very disappointed."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"This series is decent fantasy reading, but it is predictable and the climax for this book leaves you wanting.It can be written much better, it seems in the end to fall together much to easily and doesnt leave you with a twist.But it is good reading if you want a fantasy book and you cant help but follow the characters that you grow with if you read feists work."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"This book follows the plot of the video game Return to Krondor almost exactly. As a fan of Feist I am very disappointed that I knew everything that was going to happen because I have played the game. If you haven't played the game it is a decent enough book, however, if you have played the game, save yourself some money and just play it again. You won't miss anything."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"As Raymond pointed out in the opening of the book, this book is based on a 'Krondor' video game and boy, was he not joking. For anyone who has ever played the kind of role-playing type game like the well-known 'Krondor' games, this book will seem very familiar. The characters are extreamly undeveloped with Raymond basically hoping that his previous books with Jimmy the Hand will make up for this one. The plot follows the 'recipe' progression that a role-playing video game follows. In order for this to happen, you must ask this specific question, with this hand sign, leave the room, go to another building, then come back and the door will now be open - for no particular reason.The plot was fairly good but was completly destroyed, in my opinion, by the extream violence that was in no way ever eleviated by any humor. Jimmy fought vampires, necromancers, frankensteins, and baby-sacrificing trolls (give me a break here - this isn't Buffy the Vampire Slayer), only to chalk it up in the anti-climatical end to some god that loves chaos, hates Arutha, and speaks through his dead minions. The plot is uninspired and this 'new evil' is so obviously not 'new' thateven Jimmy remarks how similar this whole situation is to the whole Marmandamus series.Really Raymond, I loved your series - but you could do so much better then this - I don't recommend this book at all."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"Feist has been one of my favorite authors for some time now; Price of the Blood remains one of my three favorite novels, but Tear of the Gods just didn't live up to Feist's usual standards. Admittedly, he was struggling with personal troubles at the time that he wrote it, and it's based on a game, but regardless of the reasons, the book isn't up to par. The narrative is excellent and keeps you reading, constantly being pulled back in to know what is happening, but the characterization is weak and the plot rather contrived. Fights showed up every other chapter, and they all sounded the same after a while. Every time Jimmy steps forward to avoid his opponent's jab, and it's written as if we haven't already read that same trick three times. The ending? Three minute wrap up with a dozen loose ends. I sped through the book, then set it down feeling simply let down.If you're the type who wants to make sure you read every book by REF, grab this. Otherwise, I'd advise that you keep looking for something else."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"Has to win the award for most inane \\"artifact-that-is-vital-to-the-world\\".

This book, on the other hand, is pure drivel.I fully agree with others who have panned this book. It smacks of basic D&D; computer game plots and is just not worth reading. Please, read the first 4 Riftwar books, the Daughter of the Empire series (wonderful & underappreciated), but skip this whole sub-series. Feist needs to take stock of what kind of writer he wants to be.

I think, because for a trilogy based on a computer game, this one felt the most like reading the transcript of someone playing a game. The inclusion of monsters, vampires and animated skeletons was just a bit too over-the-top for me. Though exciting, it just did not fit in with the the trilogy, or the overarching series as a whole. If the main character had not been one of my favorites, Jimmy the Hand, then I would have certainly hated it.

However, I enjoyed reading more of &quot;Jimmy the Hand&quot; and William and the Crawler thing is, in many ways, more interesting than going to other worlds and walking amidst the &quot;city of the gods&quot;. I had to buy this via amazon.uk, but it was worth the extra money."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"I have only recently found Feist's books (in the last few months) and have been busily reading them. No doubt this guy is writing some of the best fantasy novels out there. The Riftwar and Serpent War Saga's are first rate. I read &quot;Tear of the Gods&quot; with great anticipation.Character development is amazingly thin for a Feist work. As others suggest, it reads just like the PC game is played. I felt like any minute we would see a line that says, &quot;...and Jimmy gained a level.&quot;I laughed aloud at the earlier review's point of using the same phrase over and over - I noticed that also. The constant rush from battle to battle, minor sub-missions that only delay the action rather than develop the plot make this a tedious read in many places.I would have bought it no matter the reviews just to finish out the series. Perhaps the reason this is less than Feist's best is found in the book's dedication as he describes personal matters that made this book difficult to write. Hopefully with those issues in the past, we can look forward to more of his usual stellar work."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"I believe that this book is inovative like many of Feist's other compelling books.

Feist's Krondor series. As with THE BETRAYAL and THE ASSASSINS, the story line is non-stop action and adventure on an epic scale. Sub-genre fans will fully enjoy Mr. Feist's fantasy feast, as the gifted author knows how to spin quite a tale. References to the first two books might slightly confuse new fans, who should read the first two books in order before trying this one to enhance the flavor of a cleverly designed plot. Still, this tale for the most part stands alone as a well-written novel that will provide much enjoyment to its readers.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"Our local library had this book three weeks ago so I jumped and was disappointed. Having followed the various series of Feist over the years, I am becoming disillusioned with the quality of writing, plots and characterisation in his Krondor books. Tear of the Gods reads like a second-rate boys' adventure story - laboured, predictable and internally inconsistent particularly with regards to the use or non-use of magic to solve problems in deference to the brute force approach. Subtlety is not part of this book and I closed it with no sense of engagement with the story and felt it added nothing to hte History of Krondor."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"I also was hooked since Magician Apprentice and have bought everything since, but it ends here. I really wanted to like this, but this is the third time I've plunked down $20+ on a Krondor hardcover with nothing in it except that it's written in a huge font and reads like the cheats to a roll playing computer game. If Feist didn't write this, then he really doesn't want to write about Krondor anymore. There's no feeling for the characters, they go from town to town solving riddles and quests that I really don't care about anymore. I'll go back to rereading his earlier work, but won't go for the new hard covers anymore. This will be a pamphlet when it's released in paperback. I suggest you wait for it and read it inbetween class or on the train. I was really dissappointed. I feel taken. I'd be curious to know why some people liked it(though I have a feeling that being short or helping them solve the eventual PC game might be the best reasons)."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"As with other readers I was extremely dissapointed by his latest 3 works, The Riftwar Legacy. About 8 years ago I picked up a hardback book at a yard sale of Feists Magician Apprentice and Master. I was so taken away that I immediatley bought every book he had and waited eagerly for the next. Anyone who knows Fesit knows him as a gifted writer, able to make his readers love and understand his characters. I even wanted to cry as Jimmy died, and felt my own blood rushing as Arutha defended Crydee. Alas this new series has none of that. It has left me to think that Feist has only taken a video games plot and added a few more words for the sake of it. I only hope he will continue the series as it was and continue to amaze us with the skills that make him one of the best ever."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"Raymond E. Feist's books have a special place in my bookcase. I read Magician 10 years ago, and bought all his other books since as soon as they are out in hardcover. I must have read the entire series at least 4-5 times so far.This said, Tears of the God (and the entire Krondor serie for that matter) feels like Feist didn't write them. I understand Betrayal and Tears are novelisation of computer games, however the storylines are too linear. Events seems to pop up just to make the book go forward, just like a computer game would. We are far from great characterization and relaxing with old &quot;friends&quot; feel we get reading his other books.Jummy the Hand is another disapointment for me in this serie. I can't seem to find a continuity between that Krondor serie's Jimmy and what he is in all other books. He seems just a little bit out of tune, not a true in-between in his caracterization.So, I would never recommend enough Feist's work, starting with Magician up to Serpentwar saga. However, to me Tears of the God, and the entire Krondor serie, is not an interresting addition."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"You have to read it because it is part of the series but it comes across as a throw off. This has nothing of the detail that the other books have. Everything gets solved too easily and without detail. It really comes across a franchise book that needed to be in at by a deadline. More books like this and I won't be reading any further."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"This isn't a computer game, it's a book. I had to keep reminding myself of that.I appreciate the fact that Feist fielded a computer game for the die-hard fans, but the attempt to mix a computer RPG with literature that you can carry to the toilet to read just isn't working. For those who have read some/all of Feist's other works, you get some small satisfaction encountering a few of your favorite characters (hence the 3 stars), but this thing really runs in a very linear fashion, clearly the illegitimate offspring of a computerized plot.After quaking before the might of Milander at the Imperial Games, the few roman candles that Jazhara set off seem pathetic by comparison. Jimmy \\"The Hand\\" becomes a relatively generic basher and is done no justice by this type of storyline. I was almost ready to turn the page and see, \\"You've gained an experience level!\\" For Pete's sake, they had to go back to the \\"witch\\" on the hill three freakin' times before she gave them all of the info they needed!Give me Tomas Ashen Shugar full of raging, ancient Valheru power. Give me a good computer based role playing game. Just please, oh please, Mr. Feist -- don't try to give them to me together!"},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"While this was entertaining in parts I must agree with most of the other reviewers of this book that it was overall a disappointmentwhen one looks at The Riftwar Trilogy and the Empire Trilogy (cowritten with Janny Wurts) one sees a definite drop in standards'The Krondor series lacks the depth which one enjoys in other Feist novels as well as the character development and interplay between the charactersIts just one melee after the other.It was so easy to see that it is just an addition transcript of a D&amp;D or Computer Fantasy Game sessionJazharra adds some interest to the book but like the others her character is not explored in any of the depth which we usually see in Feist's novelsFurthermore various potentially interesting characters such as the girl-thief Nita disappear before we get to know themMidkemia and Kelewan are fantastic world created by Feist , and have all the depth and scope of Tolkiens Middle EarthWhat a pity that this series does Fiest 's world a disservice"},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"Based on a computer game, and reads like one. Vampires here! Skeletons there! I don't know if this is going to be the quality of all future Feist books, but the Riftwar Legacy as a whole and especially Tear of the Gods are WAY below his normal quality level. Tear of the Gods is the first fantasy book that I almost didn't finish because it was just so monotonous. There was so much action and adventure that by the time the climax actually arrived, I could barely tell from all the wild adventures Jimmy and his friends had already had. If you've read the other two and you feel like you need to read this one, then borrow it from the library because it is not worth it to buy this book."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"Why is the paperback version is yet available, I bought one 2 weeks ago from a bookstore in the backwater island of Malta. After reading the book I felt strangely disappointed, Assassins and The Betrayal seemed to have much more to chew on. This one seemed a little flat, given Feist's previous works. Apart from that, given the inconclusive manner in which the story ends, it seems to suggest a sequel which I can't find a hint of anywhere. Does someone know something we don't??? All in all I feel Feist has produced far better works than this."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"As other reviewers have noted, the book follow the computer game &quot;Krondor: The Betrayal&quot; fairly closely. The structure that is acceptable in a computer game is not acceptable in a book. The book follows a very predictable, repeated, buildup, climax, denoument that you normally see in an episodic video game. I have read and enjoyed most of Raymond Feist's work, but this one was subpar and overall, not extremely interesting. I only hope his next works are better, as he is truly one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"I liked the book, surprised at how much he kept to the game's story line...

As the book goes you hear of a gem. The gem sussposely allows mortal to talk to the gods. Well every 10 year it needs ot be replaced. Well you meet the first new charcter a blood rage pirate named Bear. Hes paid to steel the gem and bring it back. Well as he goes for the gem his ship and both the holding place of the Tear of The Gods sink to the bottom while the pirates run off leaving there blood rage captain to die at the bottom. Well now the gem gone, this mean that no mortal can talk to a god for 10 years unless the new Tear is brought back to its place before the old one expires. Well like all Feist books a huge battle on the loom too between the Crawlers gang and the Mockers leaving Krondor in a state of choas and marshel law. This bring all charcter of Feist together to solve the problem and stop the now enrage pirate Bear killing everyone in sight and keeping the gem for himself.

I enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"This is the third, and probably last, book of the Riftwar Saga.Being a favorite of mine, I must say this book mostly does it justice, but there are some definite issues.One, it's a bit too short, sweet, but never-the-less, short. Sure, there are lots of pages, yes, but the font is huge, and the content is somewhat lacking in the end. I read it straight through in 1.5 hours or so (the other two books in the series took me 2-2.5 each).Two, the story is a bit mucky, there are some twists and turns, but none of the finely woven conspiracies which made his other writings famous.Three, he did not develop inter-character relationships very well during the book, some of the characters (especially the new introduction, Jazhara) seem a bit transparent, and lack emotional depth.Those may seem like big holes, but really they're not, all in all fans will be pleased, and this is a good fantasy read in the end."},{"Title":"Krondor: Tear of the Gods (Riftwar Legacy)","review":"I am sorry but I have to say I was disappointed with this book, as a novel goes it was ok, but I have come to expect far more from Ray (thou after Betrayal and Assasins I shouldn't be supprised).All three of teh books that Ray has written based on computers games have been tediously plotted following the game more than they should have. I personaly have enjoyed the games but find the book addaptions slavish to the games when they are different mediums and not really suited to mixing.Yes this book did have some nice twists in it (and no I don't think Hilda was one of them but I do want to know more.....) some nice characterisations William in particular, wasn't over impressed with Jazhara (sorry but I wouldn't want the grand daughter of a rival nations spy master as my magical assistant) and I found her morality to be unrealistic.All in all if you are a fan of Feist then you will read this (but wait for the paperback edition its cheaper or get it from the libary or second hand (sorry amazon)). If your not a fan WHY NOT??? then do yourself a favour and start with Magician and work your way throu several thousand pages of pure joy...And Ray if you read this please get back to the serpent war novels you left us on a cliff edge!!!THE PRICE OF IMMORTALITY by C.M.

He considers the subjectivist epistemology of postmodern philosophy to be the only valid way in which we can now express our theological affirmations.This book is NOT for the general reader, as it assumes a lot of philosophical knowledge, but is directed to his fellow theologians and students of theology. The book is well outlined and very thorough in it's coverage of the topic.I found Prof. Osborne's book to be interesting and I agreed with his basic conclusions concerning sacramentology and postmodern thought. The older theological paradigm (which is based upon an objectivist epistemology and ontology) is frought with too many difficulties. It is becoming more and more irrelevent. Postmodern thought, however, allows us to get fresh look at the philosophical basis of our current theological affirmations. With this fresh look we can then move forward in expressing our theological affirmations in such a way that the Christian sacraments are seen in a phenomenological, existential and subjective way. In short, in a way that will speak to the postmodern person."},{"Title":"Fever!","review":"I read this book in 1975, after graduating from college. It was riveting. When I finished it, I decided I wanted to study viruses. The next year I entered graduate school to earn a Ph.D. in viruses, and the rest is history.

Many of the characters in this book I knew personally. I was shocked when the news came to our mission station that Dr. Jeannette Troup, one of the main characters in FEVER, had died from this awful virus. Just three years prior to this tragedy, in February of 1967, she had delivered my daughter at the Bingham hospital where Dr. Jeanette later died.This book tells how difficult it was to trace the source of the virus and how heroic the doctors were in not giving up in spite of many obstacles in testing reluctant people and many many animals. Traveling was not easy and communication difficult.Since this book is out of print, I was happy to be able to buy a used copy through Amazon."},{"Title":"Fever!","review":"A doctor uses her mouth to draw a virus-containing solution into a pipette, hospital workers bare-handedly contact infected patients, a deathly ill victim travels to a hospital via a routine commercial aircraft flight, researcher-sleuths attempt to learn about a virus only minimally protected against it - seem likely? All of this and more actually happened during an outbreak of a virulent type of fever in a missionary hospital in Nigeria in 1969. Many prayers were said, many doctors took part, many people died and much was learned about what to and what not to do when dealing with contagious diseases in the process of tracking down the vector, determining the methods of transmission, and attempting to find a treatment. Published in 1974, Fever! provides a look into how outbreaks of contagious diseases were handled at that time and is a fast-paced, engrossing, frill-less story. The race against the clock to find a cure section was especially compelling.

Several years later, I wandered into an area of my medical center that looked as though it had been partially demolished, and then abandoned years before.

Their claims to the land are rooted in Biblical history and this book makes a good case for those claims, because they obviously had some Divine Help!"},{"Title":"O Jerusalem","review":"This book documents the Jewish struggle to create the tiny state of Israel and the struggle of the Arabs and British to crush it, with particular focus on Jerusalem. It contains some interesting accounts and much interesting information, but it is not without its flaws.Beginning with the decision at the United Nations at Flushing Meadow to accept the re-partition of the Land of Israel into two states, one Jewish and one Arab, and the violent Arab reaction, it leaves out the fact the Britain's Palestine Mandate of 1920, included what is now the State of Israel, the disputed territories (the West Bank (Judea and Samaria) and Gaza) and Jordan.In 1922 Transjordan (later Jordan) set up on three-fourths of Palestine, leaving one-fourth of Palestine for the Jewish national home. Therefore the partition plan accepted in 1947 left the Jews with only 13% of the original Palestine Mandate.O Jerusalem partially covers the biography of Hitler's ally, and founder of the \\"Palestinian\\" Arab movement, Mufti Haj Amin El Husseini. Husseini stirred up the bloody Arab pogrom against the Jews, in the Old City of Jerusalem, in 1920. Two years later, at the instigation of the British Mandates political secretary, the rabidly anti-Jewish E.T Robinson, he was appointed \\"Mufti of Jerusalem\\", the equivalent of Bishop of a city, with Jewish and not Moslem routes, and a Jewish, not Moslem plurality.Haj Amin El Husseini manipulated his way to becoming President of the Moslem Supreme Council, and in the following years, he set himself up as an unchallenged dictator of all the Moslems in the Holy Land, through a combination of patronage and terror, in which thousands of Arab opponents and potential or suspected opponents where murdered on the orders of the Mufti, in a bloody purge.In 1929, the Mufti orchestrated more violent of Jews in Palestine, covering the Land of Israel in the blood of Jewish men, women and children.When the British finally decided to arrest him, he fled to Beirut and later to Baghdad, where in 1941, he aided in a Nazi-backed plot to overthrow the British government in Iraq. When the plot failed he fled to Iran and then to Nazi Germany where he formed a close friendship with Adolph Hitler and attended Nazi rallies as an honoured guest.He did everything in his power to achieve an Axis victory. He recruited Arab agents to drop behind the British lines as saboteurs and raised two divisions of Bosnian Moslems for the SS. He facilitated the German entry into Tunisia and Libya. He personally visited the Nazi death camps including Auschwitz and he urged the Nazis to speed up the Final Solution. In 1943 Husseini personally influenced Reich Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to prevent four thousand Jewish children being sent to Israel, instead diverting them to Hitler's death camps where they perished.It was the Mufti who led \`Palestinian' Arab forces against the fledgling Jewish State, and who is a much-admired uncle of PLO leader Yasser Arafat.We also learn that Haj Amin was not the only Arab terrorist to be trained in Nazi Germany, as part of the Axis war effort. The commander of the Arab Liberation Army , Fawzi el Kaujki was a noted celebrity in Berlin during World War II , where he was furnished with every luxury he needed by Hitler's Nazi regime, including his blonde German wife.The book covers the role in the war effort of the War of Independence of the likes of David Ben-Gurion, Golda Meir, David Shaltiel, Yitzhac Rabin, Yigal Allon, Yigal Yadin and millions of ordinary Jewish men and women. Unfortunately the Revisionist freedom fighters -Irgun and Lehi -do not get fair treatment and are unjustly maligned in the book. The account given of the alleged massacre of Arabs during the Battle of Deir Yassin is based on the lies of the Arabs and their British allies. Unfortunately the Hagannah, the military wing of the Labour Zionists added to these lies to malign their political opponents in the Irgun and Lehi.A heroic account is given of the struggle of the Jews of Jerusalem, to survive Arab attacks and starvation."},{"Title":"O Jerusalem","review":"oo much about the fighting and not enough novel about the people and what they were feeling.

Considering all of the college history books I've read, I think I can truly say that this is the best &quot;true&quot; historical telling of a topic that I've read...yet. The authors, in true journalistic form, did their research, and brought in those &quot;human interest&quot; aspects I so love in the historical novels. Their treatment of both the Arabs and the Jews is about as unbiased as one can be--I didn't see any blatant pandering to either side-- and felt that any (potentially) incindiary remarks were based wholly on historical track record (e.g., Arabs don't have a history--in Palestine--of cultivating the land, and this neglect is mentioned a few times). I recommend this book to anyone wishing for an in-depth (but not too technically deep!) look into the partition vote, the siege of Jerusalem, and the establishment of the State of Israel. ( As an aside: I'm not too interested in politics, but the political wrangling inherent in the entire partition process is quite fascinating. It goes to show that 'goodwill gestures' have about a million moving parts--not necessarily made out of love!)."},{"Title":"O Jerusalem","review":"\\"O Jerusalem\\" is a classic. By focusing on one narrow yet vitally important aspect of the Arab-Jewish conflict surrounding the birth of Israel between WWII and 1948, the authors bring to life all the characters, good bad and neutral who played a role in the saga of Jerusalem. As readers of the book will discover, prior to 1948, Jerusalem was a city with a mixed Jewish-Arab population. The Arabs and Jews lived in relative harmony, sometimes in mixed neighborhoods. Under British rule, all religious groups had access to their own holy sights. The authors demonstrate how villaims like Husseini, the Mufti of Jerusalem, a rabid anti-semite who spent WWII hiding from the British in Berlin, brought ruin to the Arabs of Jerusalem. Indeed, the Arabs come across as the ultimate victims, which they were. Their victimizers were not the Jews, however, but their fellow Arabs. Ultimately, war comes in 1948 and the Jews are victorious in establishing the state of Israel. Many Arab residents of Jerusalem are forced from their homes either by the Israeli Defense Force, fellow Arabs or their own fears. Most wind up in the part of the city that has come to be known as \\"East Jerusalem\\". The old city, including the Jewish Quarter and the Western Wall is captured by Jordan and ALL Jews are expelled. The book describes in great detail, the tragic consequences of this conflict which was not wanted by the Jews, not wanted by their Arab neighbors but spurred on by interlopers like the Mufti, the British and many bad players fromt he Arab world like King Abdullah. It is a fair analysis. It does not make the Jews out to be saints nor does it portray all the Arabs as blood thirsty monsters. It lays blame where it belongs. Those pre-disposed to a revisionist view of Israel's birth will not appreciate this book because its fair analysis does not meet with revisionist ideology. But for anyone who wants to learn the truth about this conflict, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"O Jerusalem","review":"Authors Lapierre and Collins have written a wonderful account of the establishment of the State of Israel. They have talked to people on all sides of the problem (there were more than just two sides) and, although not impartial, the end result is as gripping as it is valid. I have said that the authors have not reached an impartial result, and by this I mean that they tilt towards the Israeli side. I do, too, to be honest. But Lapierre and Collins show a lot of professionalism and at least seek balance. I recommend this title to anyone interested in the Middle East conflict, together with Dan Kurzman's &quot;Genesis 1948: The First Arab-Israeli War.&quot;"},{"Title":"O Jerusalem","review":"Collins and Lapierre make an important and much needed contribution to a field often beset by propaganda masquerading as scholarship. In the place of such works of half-truth, these authors offer a crisply written and carefully researched history of Jerusalem, the eternal city. Instead of taking sides, as is so often the tendency when dealing with this subject, Collins and Lapierre give considerable attention and equal weight to all sides. The authors interviewed literally thousands of people in order to understand people's emotional attachment to this often fought for city. Using this research they then tell the epic tale of the modern quest to control it.The book is both informative and riveting. Putting the facts before bias, they tell a story that needs to be told. I cannot recommend it enough."},{"Title":"O Jerusalem","review":"This book provides a detailed examination of the events surrounding the foundation of the state of Israel in 1948. The story is told through the technique of alternating viewpoints from the the Arab and Jewish sides. The major players in this historical drama are made to breath because their characters are written about with the style of a great historical novel.Absolutely essential reading for an understanding of the foundations of the current situation in the region.The book shows two peoples who are both captive to historical and political forces that set them on a path toward beligerence with each other that seems today to have no end in sight.Both bravery and brutality is displayed by each side as the struggle for control of Jerusalem develops.What is especially disturbing is the inevitability of the conflict that was accepted by both sides from the very beginning. Reading this book now with the events of each day in the news sounding incredibly similar to those that took place in 1948 gives this history remarkable relevance and enabled me to synthesize what is occurring today into a broader historical context.The book is well researched and documented and written in a brisk style that makes it difficult to put down. Highly recommended for a deeper understanding of a troubled region of the world."},{"Title":"O Jerusalem","review":"Most people who have not made it their specific study are relatively unaware of the creation of the state of Israel. Fortunately, there is this excellent account of the birth of Israel and the war that followed. This book does have a number of flaws, but despite this should be read by anyone looking for a fair account of the origins of the Arab-Israeli conflict.The book is the result of exhaustive research by two well respected authors including several hundred interviews conducted in the late 1960s. The focus of the book is at the micro level, the lives and experiences of common people who were swept up into the maelstrom of battle, but at the same time it does address the Macro considerations of the great leaders and powers. As such it contains an amazing caste of characters, mainly in their own words, from Jewish immigrants, to King Hussein of Jordan, to simple Arab villagers, to President Truman. Perhaps despite this, O' Jerusalem is a VERY readable book and a true page-turner.The real failure of the book is that it was the product of its time. It was written shortly after the Six Day War in which Israel took on three of its neighbors and decisively defeated them. It was also long before the full implications of the refugee problem were known. As a result, it tends to paint the Israelis in a rather positive light. It leans ever so slightly in their favor on most questions. (more on this later)That said, the authors made great efforts to be totally objective and exercised the greatest academic rigor. When there are contradicting versions of an event, they provide both versions with sane and level headed analysis. They restrict their information to primary sources rather than so many books now which use secondary or processed information. In some cases, they have found accounts from both sides of a single firefight in which the actions of one interviewee are remembered by a participant from the other side. It is an amazing feat of historiography.There is also no effort to paint over the flaws and faults of either side. This is perfectly exemplified by the books treatment of the massacres of Dier Yassin (when about a hundred Arabs were murdered by the right wing Jewish Irgun and Stern Gang) and Kvar Etzion (When an approximately equal number of Jewish settlers were murdered by Arab Irregulars perhaps with the connivance of the Arab Legion). Both are honestly reported. When sources disagree, it is pointed out.It is perhaps the best recommendation for this book that it will probably infuriate the \\"true believers\\" on both sides. Neither side turns out to be plaster saints or a pack of black devils. They are human. This makes this book one of two a person MUST read in order to understand the Middle East. The other FYI is \\"The Lemon Tree\\" by Tolan. That book leans rather hard towards the Arab viewpoint. Ideally read them together for an incredibly balanced version of events.The founding of Israel was, depending on your point of view, an incredible miracle or an incredible \\"Al Nakba\\" Disaster. Both sides will agree however that it is an incredible story. This book is probably the best and most readable account of the incredible story that still affects the world in which we live even 60 years after the events it relates have transpired."},{"Title":"O Jerusalem","review":"Collins and Lapierre focus their book, O Jerusalem on one city in the years between World War II and the creation of the independent state of Israel, but, the story itself spans centuries and continents. This is a book about courage, terrorism, heroism, deprivation, politics, and, ultimately, war.Concentrating their narrative on material gleaned from thousands of interviews, the authors intersperse personal histories-heroic, tragic, and sometimes even humorous-with public history to create an illuminating epic, part folk, part academic. Their emphasis on ordinary people reacting in ordinary ways to extraordinary events encourages the reader to empathize with characters on both sides of what was, and continues to be, a complex stuggle.Collins and Lapierre allow the story to expand as they trace the roots of the conflict back into Biblical history and as the participants travel the post-WWII world, seeking weapons, political support and military solutions. However, no matter how far afield the story wanders, the authors always bring it back to its center, Jerusalem.More than fifty years after the central events of this story, it is interesting and instructive for historians, amateur and professional, to review who was allied with whom in the Middle East of the 1940's and who provided the training, weapons, and support to which of the participants in the struggle. ... Although it does not provide the complete answer, it is an excellent place to begin the search."},{"Title":"O Jerusalem","review":"The subject of this book arise passions all around the world: the birth of the State of Israel in 1948. Since then controversy, war and a seeming endless conflict between Jews and Arabs rage unquenched.Any text approaching these events will be immediately scrutinized and criticized by confronting parties.The authors are not rookies; they have a well earned reputation thru their previous book \\"Is Paris Burning?\\" (1965). They apply the technique of interviewing key witness, ranging from public figures to almost unknown particulars. All of them have their saying and express their viewpoints unrestricted.Collins and Lapierre take this huge mass of information to produce a coherent, ordered, dynamic and griping story. At the same time they managed to keep the balance without avoiding sore spots.This is an informative book commendable for anyone who is interested in Near East history. You may start from here and proceed afterwards with more partisan essays, giving them credit as it suits to your particular beliefs.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"O Jerusalem","review":"This unbiased account of the siege of Jerusalem during the1948 Israeli War of Independence, told through the eyes ofboth Jew and Arab alike, offers a unique opportunity tounderstanding the complex situation which currently existsin the Middle East.

A new book so condition not relevant"},{"Title":"O Jerusalem","review":"The authors portray the bloodthirsty Arab invaders as noble fighters and devote a disproportional amount of writing to the alleged massacre at Deir Yassin. They make the libelous claim that Jews raped Arab women, looted, mutilated, and executed civilians. Even the Arabs themselves admitted that the &quot;massacre&quot; didn't take place and that Arab propaganda made up the atrocity and rape stories in order to whip up the Arabs into a murderous anti-Jewish frenzy.Stay away from this biased and mythological account. It is anti-Israeli fiction, not a serious historic account."},{"Title":"O Jerusalem","review":"This particular book gives a great opportunity to the global community to learn more about and facts underlying all the terroristic acts and religion based conflicts.With hugely detailed statistics,lots of interesting facts and all the stories related to those behind-the-curtain tricks it is not only enjoyable to read but also absolutely essential for those who wants to know more about Palestine Wars.However; the most striking feature about the book is that it was written in such a way that historic events that occupied an extremely crucial portion of the related people , are interpreted as events in a classic novel.The authors did not use the classical history narration and they used techniques like flashback to make the document more effective. What I did not like about the book was that in various parts, some pointless details made it difficult for me to concentrate on the main actions. O Jerusalem is a typical Lapierre-Collins cooperation and it sure is a miracle of the investigating journalism."},{"Title":"O Jerusalem","review":"One can nitpick -- vague timelines, some wrong presumptions -- but one cannot deny that this is a book which is long on fact and even longer on good storytelling. The authors have the usual &quot;orientalist&quot; anti-Arabism in the style of the book -- Arabs &quot;swarm&quot; and do &quot;frenzied&quot; things and are compared to locusts traveling at one point. The authors maintain a Labor Zionist emphasis, e.g. the Irgun and Lehi Zionists are called terrorists (please let the reader decide!) and it is clear that the LAbor Zionists are getting &quot;home team&quot; coverage, but the authors do not suppress certain facts, e.g. they do dispute as a result of their investigation the old (and today discarded) contention that Arabs fled as a result of an evacuation policy by Arab leaders and state more accurately that Arabs fled form fear of war, terroristic violence and forced expulsion. It also looks as if they talked to everyone, Jewish, Arab, and British who was there. A classic of popular history, by no means the last word, but certainly one of the best."},{"Title":"O Jerusalem","review":"When Israel took over Jerusalem in 1967 many listened and watched. The first reaction of the young people in the Middle East was how could one close one's eyes to history in the making?Many of my generation have not seen Jerusalem, the place we prayed to remain the birth of civilization rather than a symbol of new style of warmongering.Elderly people wept, all were stupefied by the speed Jerusalem \`fell' and later became interested to see how the city will be administered. Their first thoughts, though, were \`thank you God there was no material damage to the old city like there had been no war'.This book has been able to squeeze the last ounce of drama from the events that happened in this important (and holy) city and described in admirable details how Jerusalemites were resigned - more in anger than in hatred - to the inevitable.The author is obviously enthusiastic at witnessing the transformation of the 1967 silence of death city of Jerusalem to a dynamic place starting with just another chapter in the annals of two thousand years of changing hands."},{"Title":"O Jerusalem","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. It was well-written and well-researched. I also thought the authors were fair to all parties concerned, especially the Jews and the Arabs. My husband made the comment that he had thought the Jews had won through organization but, after reading the book, he thought otherwise. I was surprised by the involvement of the British. Excellent book."},{"Title":"O Jerusalem","review":"A perfect pairing of voice and narrative is found in this dramatic recounting of the 1948 battle between the Arabs and the Jews for possession of the city of Jerusalem. It is the story of the birth of Israel as meticulously researched by the authors.History comes to vivid life as we hear of the years between World War II and the creation of an independent state - Israel. We are reminded that this area was sacred to both sides, and we hear Ben Gurion and Golda Meir as well as Arab chiefs and soldiers who felt just as passionately that their cause was just.Theodore Bikel, probably best remembered for his long running role as Tevya in &quot;Fiddler On The Roof&quot; offers an incomparable reading. Vienna born Bikel was 13-years-old when his family moved to Palestine. An inquisitive and intelligent young man he was to master Hebrew, Yiddish, German, and English.Early on he joined the Habimah Theatre, and later was a co-founder of the Israeli Chamber Theatre. He became interested in folk music and the guitar at approximately the same time that he studied at London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.All of this study and work was prelude to a multi faceted career - as musician, actor, and author. His awards are many, including an Emmy.Bikel's reading of &quot;O Jerusalem!&quot; merits another statue on his mantel.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"O Jerusalem","review":"Having read thousands of pages on the middle east conflict (including the more standard \\"advocacy\\" (propaganda) and academic texts) and I can safely say this book is the most riveting and informative of them all. The authors come across more as storytellers than as lecturers, offering the history in a narrative style that reads like a particularly dramatic novel. The authors devote more or less equal time to the Arab and Jewish protagonists (and antagonists) in the colorful cast of characters and don't shy away from using the word terrorist as appropriate - regardless of the bad guys' motive. Ultimately this book's greatest strength is that it (perhaps inadvertently) sheds so much light on the modern debate between Israel's \\"traditional\\" and \\"revisionist\\" historians, whose arguments themselves go right to the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict. To get a real grip on this conflict, skip the activist lectures and devote a few days to reading this book instead."},{"Title":"O Jerusalem","review":"This monumental work is the most gripping and informative account I've read about the rebirth of Israel in 1948. Of course the focus is on Jerusalem and the text does not cover the war in Galilee or the South in any detail. The work includes the roles of famous persons and the experiences of ordinary people in equal measure.Part 1: A Time To Mourn And A Time To Dance covers the UN decision in favour of partition, the Arab reaction, some background history - ancient Israel as well as the British Mandate period - and the various missions by both sides to procure arms.Part 2: A House Divided, deals with the beginning of hostilities and unrest in the city, the deteriorating situation on the Tel Aviv- Jerusalem road, various horrific bombings of certain landmark buildings, the intensifying struggle for the city and the different Arab forces involved in the war.Part 3: A City Besieged, concentrates on the harrowing struggle to hang on to the Jewish quarter of the old city from March 20 to May 13 of 1948. It includes an account of the tragic events at the village of Deir Yassin, the veracity of which is still in dispute today.Part 4: These Shall Stand describes the movements of the various Arab forces and the Jewish response.

It holds the reader's attention by dealing with events from the perspective of a wide spectrum of individuals. The narrative is often very sad and sensitive readers should be aware that certain passages are quite disturbing. But this book is probably the very best history of the Rebirth of Israel and the part Jerusalem played in this momentous event."},{"Title":"O Jerusalem","review":"Well-written 1972 book that focuses on one aspect of the creation of the Jewish State of Israel. Countless interviews are strung together here with people who lived through the first war between the Jewish and Arab inhabitants of Jerusalem and environs, and to a lesser extent, other parts of the area that was to become Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. Like the authors' other well-known book, \\"Is Paris Burning,\\" \\"O Jerusalem\\" reads a bit like a screenplay, and, in my opinion, some liberties are taken in presenting the thoughts and emotions of the book's subjects even though many of them perished in the 1948 war and never were directly interviewed by the authors.Because of the almost exclusive focus on Jerusalem in this weighty chronicle, there is an absence of information on what else was taking place in other parts of the area at the same time. Also missing is much about the Ottoman Empire and British mandate periods that set the stage for the ultimate showdown between the longtime Arab inhabitants of the region and resurgent and growing Jewish population.Overall, the authors' purpose in telling the story of the triumphal birth of Israel does not allow for a completely objective telling of the whole story. There is considerable focus on the disarray and out-and-out villainly of the Arab governments of the time, but much less on the everyday Arab citizenry living in the disputed territory, who were ultimately to become the biggest losers in the l948 struggle.There are other problems with the book--the most important reference map for this book is tucked into its last page--but it ultimately serves as an interesting snapshot and a partial explanation of the conflict that continues unabated nearly 60 years after this telling. If there is some lesson here, it's that good intentions and high purposes are easily forgotten in the passion and viciousness of war."},{"Title":"O Jerusalem","review":"No novel could have been more exciting than this detailed story of the birth of Israel and the early struggles.

I request all readers to laugh at world leaders whenever they mention the word &quot;peace&quot; with respect to Isreal/Palestine conflict.I am amazed at Jewish unity during very difficult times. I am equally amazed at the Arab disunity - then in 1947/48 and even now. If only they had commited themselves then, Israel wouldn't have existed. This is one thing that David Ben-Gurion feared and never really happened.Its amazing to know that Jewish community relied on four militia movements (so to say) - Hagannah, Irgun, Stern Gang and Palmech to defeat the Arabs - infact their armies predominantly belonging to Egypt and Transjordan.Is that height of Jewish patriotic fever or height of Arab disunity or height of Jewish efficiency.

It's not a traditional novel in the sense that it lacks a discernible plot. It is, rather, a series of journal entries each written by a different imagined character. The characters are developed only through the words they use in their journals. The characters are distinct personalities, what they have in common is that they are all practitioners of alchemy, or alchemical medicine, and as such, have world views quite different from that of any (well, most, at any rate) modern readers. Connell's writing perfectly captures the tone and spirit of arcane writings from the Renaissance and early modern period. Perhaps it helps to have studied the works of real historical alchemists to fully appreciate the feat of mimicry that Connell has achieved here. That he has crafted several distinct voices and characters in this fashion is nothing short of amazing."},{"Title":"The Alchymist's Journal","review":"3/4 through this i still periodically wanted to throw it at the wall. The author practices the mystification of old alchemists and contemporary language artists. While sometimes it seems to be a word salad gleaned from six obscure thesauruses, he really does unfold the world view of pre-scientific thought from superstition through rudimentary experiment to mysticism. Its Ken Wilbur's evolution of consciousness in antifiction form. Alchemy is not a material science; it is a qualitative knowledge all but lost to our time. In the tone of ecco and borges but more challenging. It wouldn't hurt to read a few histories of alchemy and medieval northern europe first. Check out What IS Painting for a much more accessible treatment."},{"Title":"The Alchymist's Journal","review":"The Alchymist's Journal, by Evan S. Connell, according to the inside cover is a fictional tour de force of rich historical re-creation and spectacular prose. A love for historical fiction, the description on the sleeve, and all of the great reviews on the back of the book convinced me to purchase this book. I need not have bothered. I found this book to be unreadable.This book was most definitely not a rich historical re-creation. There was absolutely no historical atmosphere in this book. This alone would not make the book so terrible. I have read other historical novels that did not have a good medieval feel and still liked them. However, Connell seems to have gone out of his way to make this a hard to read book. The prose is not spectacular, it is incomprehensible. After attempting to read this book, I am convinced that all of the reviews on the back could in no way be about The Alchymist's Journal. They must be describing a different novel."},{"Title":"Matthew (Interpretation Bible Studies)","review":"If you are having a Bible Study, this booklet is handy and somewhat informitive.

There were a great many characters introduced, and an undertone of misogyny that distracted from the book as a whole, as the hissing and popping of omnipresent scratches would distract from enjoying an old vinyl record. Most of the women except the always-serene love object (and she's always described exactly that way, too) are devious, disloyal, highly flawed schemers, petty and competitive in shallow ways for unworthy ends.Still, the major problem was that there were so many characters with so little to do that the whole book felt choppy. This is the ninth book in the Notre Dame series, but the first I've read, and maybe that's the problem. Experienced aficionados of these books might welcome the return of old friends, instead of feeling assaulted by an onslaught of unlikable strangers. Having fewer characters and spending more time making them distinct individuals might have made a stronger book and a better read, for old fans as well as newcomers. On the plus side, the Notre Dame lore was a pleasure; more of that would have been most welcome."},{"Title":"Irish Gilt: A Mystery Set at the University of Notre Dame (Mysteries Set at the University of Notre Dame)","review":"This is no fast-paced thriller but rather a gradually unraveling mystery featuring the surroundings of Notre Dame combined with literacy superior to most mysteries.

I think the main problem is that in mystery series you need to get invested in the main characters...and this book really never spends that much time with the two investigators.

Joe's work consists mainly in writing resumes, but he also has some offbeat clients, such as Willie, a middle-aged man who collects Asian penpals and Beanie, an eccentric sidewalk proselytizer. Joe's Word doesn't have much action; the novel centers on the everyday conversations and events in this neighborhood. Joe's office is next to a beauty salon called Hair Today, whose proprietress Teresa also acts as Joe's assistant (as improbable as it is that someone like Joe would be in a position to hire a staff). Joe drifts into a relationship with one of Teresa's clients, a younger woman (though Joe's age is never specified, he seems to be in his mid-forties or thereabouts) named Clio.The story is meandering, the pace slow and leisurely. This book was first published in France. The author, Elizabeth Stromme, has previously published books in that country, and I can see why. The pace and the focus on eccentric provincial characters has a European flavor with which many Americans (including, I'm a little ashamed to admit, this one) may get impatient. The book's jacket calls it a &quot;noir style&quot; novel, and this is sort of true, only it's noir sans many of the qualities that noir usually contains, such as murder and suspense. The tale flirts with crime and shady dealings, but they remain in the background. My least favorite parts of the book were Joe's long letters to would-be Asian brides (and the replies) for his client Willie. These letters are, I suppose, meant to be funny, but to me they just dragged on. This is a book I wanted to like more than I did; I like novels set in L.A. as well as noirish atmosphere and Elizabeth Stromme is a fine writer. While I enjoyed it, I just found the pace too slow and some of the characters a little too cutesy. On the other hand, this is the sort of book that has an ambiance and characters that some people will adore, and I hope it finds its audience."},{"Title":"Joe's Word: An Echo Park Novel (City Lights Noir)","review":"What I especially like about this quirky short novel is the tone which is evocative of LA's darkest secrets and most peculiar characters. From start to finish, it is this tone that permeates the writing and draws one in to a very strage world. Can LA really be like this? I suspect so. City Lights' choice to include Stromme's novel in its new &quot;noir series&quot; is indicative of just how unique this work is. Don't expect a compelling plot line and it won't change your life but be prepared for a dreamlike excursion to places you may not want to visit in reality. It's a refreshing take on the noir sensibility with a dreamy overlay of a well understood and slightly disturbing place.I heard Stromme do a reading from the novel at City Lights a couple of months ago and can attest to the probabilty that she may well be as eccentric as her characters!"},{"Title":"Joe's Word: An Echo Park Novel (City Lights Noir)","review":"I admire anyone who can write a novel. The organization of one is a difficult endeavor; however, I feel compelled to warn potential readers that they may not be getting the kind of book they had envisioned based on the commercial reviews.In some sense I feel terrible about having to direct people away from purchasing this novel as I did. Perhaps it would be better to borrow it from your local library.The author has gone in the right direction by setting the novel in Echo Park and the idea of a &quot;public writer&quot; opens up worlds of possibility. Unfortunately, the author is not able to pull it off, though. The characters surrounding, Joe, the title character are uninteresting, living lives that I really didn't care to read about. In fiction, I generally am not interested in reading about people who lead more boring lives that I do. (And I lead a pretty boring life.) My idea about fiction is that situations and characters should be distilled or heightened in very particular ways.Unfortunately, &quot;Joe's Word&quot; does not achieve this and I cannot in all good faith suggest that it be purchased."},{"Title":"Joe's Word: An Echo Park Novel (City Lights Noir)","review":"Distinctive and very good for those who've only seen LA on TV or film, that its's also a 'familiar' urban life. Liked it especially for not being cranked up into &quot;DRAMA&quot; and for the way in which the letters are this make-believe, and then the varied consequences that the make-believe has; and the way it is NOT predictable the way those consequences do work out."},{"Title":"In Our Time","review":"Mr. Fischer's collection of short stories is a gentle introduction to a wonderful writer. The loosely connected stories examine the tender emotions young men feel toward their families, their friends, and the young women in their lives, whether they are acquaintances, girlfriends, would- be girlfriends, or would be wives. Fischer's work in these stories is emotionally evocative and simple in style. His descriptions of rivers and trees and other wonders of the natural world are so vivid and distinct that each setting becomes a character whose subtle effect is felt throughout each story. I highly recommend this heartfelt, contemplative collection. I understand this is Mr. Fischer's first foray into fiction, I hope it is not his last."},{"Title":"In Our Time","review":"Some of the best things about this book include the descriptions and the way it is written. The descriptions are clear and even unlike any other I've read, and the writing is to the point so that the stories move quickly. Most of the stories are about things in the end that are hard to describe. Things like growing older or changing, or meeting someone you like but not doing anything about it. It's good writing. I know of Jeff Fischer through the Motley Fool and he should keep writing fiction."},{"Title":"In Our Time","review":"As I started reading this book, I found the first story to leave me hanging and I wondered if I would truly enjoy the stories. But I liked the descriptions and the readability of the story so I continued on. Each story got me more and more into the book until I was reading it into the nighttime, wanting to finish each story. I also felt that I needed to not read them all at one time because I needed the time to ponder over the stories. They are all such unique stories, written in a way that you can see and feel the beauty of the surroundings, and the love, anxiety, loss, grief, and happiness of the characters. There were times when my heart was actually pounding and I wanted to be in absolute quiet so I could just let the feelings the stories produced in me flow thru me. There were times I wanted to quickly and quietly turn the page to see what was going to happen, as I was holding my breath wondering what would happen next. After reading the first story, I knew that in some of the stories, I would not know how it ended. That is the true difference of these stories. Some have a definite ending, but some just linger on in your mine and you put your own lifetime experiences into the story and come up with an ending, be it that day or perhaps days later as you rethink what it had to say. I hope this author writes more. I will look forward to his writing. This was a very different and almost haunting experience. The crystal clear pictures of nature had me walking the beaches, seeing wonderful scenes, but also feeling the emotions of human beings with deep convictions and caring. Very well done!"},{"Title":"In Our Time","review":"Jeff Fischer's writings in this book force the reader to lookunder the surface for the deeper realities of thethe stories. In several stories, the true subject ofthe tale is not even mentioned- Mr. Fischer leaves it upto the reader to work out what is being said but notspoken about - a kind of literary cavo rilievo.Like Brahms' intermezzos or Chopin's nocturnes, eachpiece stands on its own, but when experienced all together,they work to create larger, more comprehensive feeling. Mostof the stories follow the life of Mike Gallo and his family,friends, and loves, starting from boyhood and continuing on intohis early adult life. An altogether enjoyable read,with wonderful descriptions throughout. I look forward toMr. Fischer's next book!"},{"Title":"In Our Time","review":"Jeff Fischer's stories are so descriptive and clear. As I read them, it was so easy to picture and feel what was happening. This is one of the few times I could say that about someone's writing. I also liked the way he makes you rethink what has happened and look for the meaning. The meaning that is not only the meaning of the actual story he is telling, but also as the message relates to my life and how we live it in relation to others that we love or just meet in passing.I hope he continues to write as I look forward to more of his work."},{"Title":"In Our Time","review":"Jeff Fischer's stories draw you in to intimate scenes of family, friends and love -- a young man, Mike Gallo, with his parents, brothers, and women. You are instantly and deeply present at the Gallo table, Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris, or the corner of a street in Ljubljana, where, true to life, things are not quite as they seem nor perhaps going to work out quite right. These are self-contained short stories, but collectively they paint a picture of Mike's world that leads inexorably to the crisis of the last story. Compelling, clear, and vast in the geographies both of the world and the human heart, Jeff Fischer's &quot;In Our Time&quot; captures a young man's time fully and memorably."},{"Title":"As You Like It (SparkNotes Literature Guide)","review":"We are collecting as many Sparknotes as possible.

I had purchased this book with the anticipation of not taking any course study. To make a long story short, the book by far was much better than the course itself.

I don't think I could've passed the Health exam without this book."},{"Title":"Life and Health Insurance License Exam Cram","review":"The book did give me the information I needed to pass the state test, however, the included CD was not very helpful and there was nothing that helped prepare for individual state tests, although there is a state specific exam on the CD, there is no way to review it other than taking the test."},{"Title":"Life and Health Insurance License Exam Cram","review":"This book has great information and is pretty well-written. HOWEVER, I ordered it to supplement my online Kaplan course and was extremely disappointed to find out it is virtually identical (like 98%) to the study content of Kaplan. Nowhere does the book say it is affiliated with Kaplan, so I feel duped. I wasted $18 overnighting it several days before my CA State Insurance exam only to find out I already had the info! In addition, it is outdated. Most of the content is still applicable, but certain tax laws and statutes have changed since 2005 (as one would expect), so if you buy this book, don't take it at it's word on any tax information or specific investing levels."},{"Title":"Life and Health Insurance License Exam Cram","review":"I bought this book because the title, Exam Cram, led me to believe the questions on the included CD were similar to the state exam test questions and they were not. I took my test today. I would have been better off buying the \`exam cram' course offered by one of the schools in my state that offer pre-license training. I was just trying to save some money from the local school's price of $69, but the questions weren't at all what were on the test I took today. Because I went to the local school, and took a lesser priced exam cram 8 hour class for $20, I passed. I'm sure if you are really good at reading technical material and memorizing peculiar pieces of it, the book will do just fine. But, if you want to pass the test, so you can go to work in the real world, and not the test world, and see how the state will form their questions and how they may try to trick you with the way they are worded, you're better off with a school that offers training in your state and has questions that more closely resemble what you will be asked. I passed my test today, but I don't believe it had anything to do with the questions included on the CD that came with the book, rather the information that was highlighted as being on the test when I went to the local school."},{"Title":"Life and Health Insurance License Exam Cram","review":"This book is too small to hold and open for reading.

I went through a popular online course as an alternative to class room instruction, and since the text for the course was completely online I wanted to have a hard copy text to study as well. This book seemed like the best choice.I got the book a couple of days before my test date, and before going through it I wasn't as confident. However, the book is structured well, written clearly, and written to emphasize the most important facts needed to pass the exam, instead of minutiae. By the day of the test I still was a little concerned due to the volume of information covered but much more confident than I had been before getting the book. The test was moderately difficult, but I was among the first to finish. I think I may have finished before any of the other Life and Health exam takers, and I did indeed pass (I have been told that many people don't pass on their first try with that exam). I'm not entirely sure I would have been successful without the book; I know for a fact that I wouldn't have finished as quickly without it. Some have criticized this book for not having state specific information in it, but I don't find that criticism to be all that valid. The information presented in the book may not have been written specifically for California, but the content was almost identical to the content of my California-specific online course. Additionally, very few of the questions on the exam were specific to California anyway. I highly recommend this book based on personal experience.

In conducting research, I was looking for clear, substantive definitions of complexity theory as it applies to social systems. Byrne lays a foundation with distinctions about chaos, complexity, non-linear relationships, and agency. Byrne discusses the limitations of reductionistic science, as well as mathematics as a language of modeling, not as ultimate truths. For students who are seeking a good grounding in the applications of complexity theory to social science issues, Byrne offers perspective for several social systems such as cities (communities), health care, education, pulic policy, and governance. On the whole the book is balanced between scholarly theory and practice."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of My Truth","review":"If you research the Douglas family or just love Scottish history this book is well worth your money. Having spent some years researching the family myself, I can appreciate just how much information is contained within these pages, and how much trouble the author has gone to to bring the family to life. You can buy and read straightforward history of the many battles James Douglas fought, but if you seek to understand the man and why he fought, what he fought for and believed and who influenced him, you will find that information here. Keep a notebook and pen beside you to take notes. Consult the glossary and who's-who in the back. If you know nothing of the family history to begin with, the reuse of names by each generation can get confusing.This is not a flowery romance, but a portrait of strength of individuals and family, with common goals and support for one another in times we can hardly imagine. It is for the most part backed up by extensive documentation. Where documents fail, other unproven but chosen pieces fit neatly.Photos throughout add to the story, carrying you along to see the real places, as you can see them now and then imagine how they must have looked before.James Douglas, like Bruce, was a miracle, loaned to Scotland by the powers that be for the time that needed him. But like all of us, under his armor, he was only human."},{"Title":"Hearing: by Jael (Library of American Fiction)","review":"Hearing is fiction in the grand tradition and will appeal, I think, to readers ready and willing to be transported by fabulous writing into the reaches and depths of a fictional world. This novel gets my highest recommendation, but this one is not for you if you're looking for nonfiction embroidered with fictional touches.I'll flip through each chapter to give some idea of what you can expect, while trying not to give away particulars of the twists and turns that make reading this novel such a pleasure. In the first chapter, \\"Trail of Seduction,\\" the narrator Jael B. Juba describes how she's following the \\"trail\\" made some 15 years earlier (in l977) by her friend Elizabeth Harding Dumot-from Athena, New York, to an antebellum house in Old Tarragona, the historic section of a Florida Gulf Coast town advertised as \\"the oldest continuous settlement in America.\\" As you move along with Jael over this terrain, you begin to understand how Harding was seduced into buying the broken-down old Boullet House and how Jael experiences that seductive pull when she travels the same route in l993 to return the diary of the long dead Frances Boullet to the Boullet House, where Harding found it. You hear the story of how Harding falls through a rotting windowseat one day while restoring the house, and finds herself in an architecturally concealed voodoo sanctuary. This secret space is so vividly and realistically described that you actually believe in its reality. By the end of the long first chapter all living major characters have been introduced. You have the feeling that you know the people of Old Tarragona and you know where you are in this semi-tropical atmosphere. You're now prepared to hear what's in the diary.In the second chapter, \\"Bride of Freedom,\\" you begin reading the diary compiled by Frances Boullet as she approached her ninetieth birthday, back in l935. She originally had 40 volumes of diary and had filled up 39 of them, starting at age 15 on the eve of the Civil War. To fill the remaining blank volume (the one you'll be reading) she cut the material she wanted out of the other 39, burned what was left of them, and pasted her selections into the remaining one. From the way she puts together these cut-outs you get slices of her life and world over a period from l860 to l935. You hear what she sounds like as a teenager, a young woman, a mature woman, and as the old Frances putting together volume number 40. As you listen to changes over time in her voice, you get a strong sense of how she and her cronies develop over decades of time and how America developed from its Floridian and Caribbean beginnings. This chapter is highly entertaining.Continuing with the diary, the third chapter, \\"Heroes and Refugees,\\" takes on Frances's father and his ancestral line, showing her turns of character as well as those of America's early settlers. In the fourth chapter, \\"Of Legacy and Dispossession,\\" you hear the story of how the times brought people together in such unexpected connections that a woman with Frances Boullet's French and English lineage found it natural to adapt the practice of voodoo to her life-and many other fascinating stories of her kin and kind. In chapter 5, \\"Blood Washes Blood,\\" Frances reveals how the African diaspora and the Caribbean islands, especially Haiti, came to play a profound and lasting role in her life and death (a fascinating and moving read). Chapter 6, \\"Remains,\\" does a smashing job of tying up loose ends from this amazingly rich and unusual range of material.The last chapter, \\"The Opening,\\" may be my favorite. All the other chapters prepare you for this one, which is a celebration of the opening of the secret voodoo sanctuary to the public. Besides being very funny, it brings you to the sudden realization that you, the reader, have involuntarily acquired an insider's ease of understanding what goes on here in the heart of \\"the oldest continuous settlement in America.\\" The voodoo sanctuary has opened for you too, it seems. Beware!"},{"Title":"Hearing: by Jael (Library of American Fiction)","review":"Hearing is a really satisfying novel because of the way it builds and accumulates and stores and supplies meaning little by little, page by page, in gripping patches of prose laid out like a vast acreage of many crops growing side by side to produce a bountiful plenty. But I'm not sure it can be read at the beach, it's not to be dipped into and enjoyed at random-it can only be fully established by reading it sentence by sentence from beginning to end because of the way meaning slowly accumulates even as decades of time are covered. There are no end of stories. They are used, story after story, story on top of story, to build meaning. The authors seem to want the power of stories to be questioned, not to get rid of them or put them down but to break their hold on us. The novel's facinating voodoo sanctuary hidden in a antebellum house depicts a place where its votaries go to tell stories and give them a new kind of hearing. There, they can at the same time freely hear stories and, as one of them puts it, hear \\"the speech of deliverance\\" from stories.As for me, I just want to hear more stories woven together like these. Reading this book brings a new experience of how stories can be heard moving over a vast range of feeling in a short compass like an unfamiliar musical composition."},{"Title":"Hearing: by Jael (Library of American Fiction)","review":"An incident recounted on the first page or two of this novel sets the stage for what it's all about. Jael B. Juba catches a plane from New York to New Orleans and sits beside a man \\"wearing one of those Italian silk suits women always want.\\" It's not the man she wants but his suit. Busy with her own personal matters and put off by her perception that he's preparing to come on to her, she resorts to a queer form of protection from unwanted bids for attention. From her briefcase, she pulls out a sheaf of papers she carries to use for just such occasions and studies a sheet closely. A display of what she's looking at takes up the whole of page 2 or so in the novel and certainly confirms Jael's comment that it's \\"just the right amount of alien without that fatal exotic-erotic combo\\" to put them off: \\"the most dense, absolute nonsense computers can generate, every element scaled, cropped, flipped, modified beyond recognition, overprinted, no telltale repetitions.\\" At the very beginning, this device, besides recalling eighteenth century novelists we may have read in high school, like Sterne or Defoe, performs all kinds of functions. It questions our expectations and distances us as it does the attractive man beside her but it also sets up a playful, teasing interaction with us. This foregrounding of print technology (along with a reference to the man's \\"closed laptop astride his genitals, IBM compatible\\") situates us in today's world of media. It clues us in on what not to expect in this novel. There's no budding romance here. Jael's feelings are strong and deep but, we discover shortly, they are directed toward an old handwritten diary: \\"Old leather as soft-skinned as a smooth fat baby.\\" An object produced with the older technology of the pen and one that links her to others, alive and dead, from a past not of her own making.As in many modern novels (Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, Joyce's Ulysses, McEwan's Saturday, to name a few), time in Hearing is restricted to a day or so in the life of one character (Jael) while covering decades, even centuries, of events (as far back as sixteenth century European struggles for control of the Americas). The novel unfolds as the telling and \`hearing' of Jael. We read the diary at the same time as Jael re-reads it. We hear Jael's stories as she tells them and we travel with her into a wild spit of Florida for consecration of her beloved book, the old diary, and on to South Beach, Florida where she leaves us with a sketch for a flyer and a sign advertising a new line of work she envisions for herself:Jael B. Juba, Travay Philousiacfirst and last practitionerAs to what this sign could possibly mean, only Hearing, its centuries of movement resounding through a couple of days from one woman's life, offers an answer."},{"Title":"Hearing: by Jael (Library of American Fiction)","review":"Hearing by Lydia Fakundiny and Joyce Elbrecht is a highly complex and totally engrossing novel, a tour de force in collaborative fiction. It works as a sequel to The Restorationist, from 1993, but it isn't necessary to have read its predecessor to enjoy Hearing. The work is brilliantly conceived, using the device of one composite diary, compiled from forty volumes of diaries with significant incidents, stories, and history cut and pasted into this final volume. The forty volumes span as many years from the late 19th century into the first half of the 20th, but dip far back into the early years of this country. The myriad layers of time flow logically and smoothly in and out of one another. I thought of it as a tightly packed flower bud with each diary entry like a petal unfolding, and each one opening a new dimension of either time or locale or culture. There are many distinct voices in this novel, each one clear and different from the others - a truly masterful handling of language. Furthermore, the story is completely engaging with shocking surprises along the way, a bit of mystery, a wealth of history and Caribbean culture, and a touch of serious social commentary. If you enjoy reading works that fully engage your brain and all your senses, that open up new worlds and suck you right in, this is the novel for you."},{"Title":"Colorless Soul","review":"COLORLESS SOUL examines the complex issue of race relations in the North by tracing the author's family history after the Civil Rights War to the 1980s.The author asks the question &quot;What is White?&quot; This is a question that cannot be easily answered. The state of whiteness is not simply appearance. In the United States, a person who has African American ancestry can never be white. To the world, he may appear to be white. However, under the doctrine of the one drop rule, he always will be African American.The author eloquently demonstrates this point in the portrayal of her maternal grandfather Alex Bonner. Alex was raised by his white father and his family. As a young boy, Alex hated African Americans with vengeance. He wanted to have nothing to with black people.At the age of 12, Alex is told the shocking truth about his heritage. Alex feels betrayed, because he has been living a lie. He does not want to pass for white. He is African American. He leaves his family and begins to live the rest of his life as a black man.An equally compelling issue is the fact that men who fathered children by African American women denied the fact that their children existed.The author's paternal grandfather was an Italian who lived in the North. He never acknowledged her father or his family. The Italian grandfather wanted to pretend that her father was never born and he did not exist.This pretense is no better than her maternal grandfather's family who wanted her other grandfather to pass for white. What is worse? Denying your African American ancestry? Or denying that you are a father of a black child?The author discusses the dynamics of growing up as a lighted skinned African American in a working class family. To some, she is privileged, because she has light skinned and straight hair. However, the reality is that she is African American; and she like dark skinned African American faces the ongoing struggle of racism. This is an inescapable fact.COLORLESS SOUL is a moving and poignant novel. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Colorless Soul","review":"I loved this story. It was engaging and very well written. At times it was almost like being a fly on the wall or growing up as one of Mary's sisters as the author made your privy to so much private family information.

And although there were specific names that the author couldn't mention in her book I believe that Colorless Soul is a wonderful piece of documented history that can easily be passed on to children and great grands regardless as to whether or not you are related to this author.

The pictures were very nice as well. The only disappointment one may possibly find with this book, is that it is not long enough, but it does not take away from the beauty of this book. I look forward to the sequel the author mentions possibly writing. I read the book in one day because it was that captivating, but I just felt the need for more. Even though this book is quick reading, it has a lot of valuable information. I could easily see this book as some sort of teaching tool at the college level on the topic of &quot;race relations.&quot;This book definitely gave me a lot to ponder and brought back memories of days gone by. It touched all of my emotions: I laughed and cried and could relate to many of the situations."},{"Title":"Evangelical Hermeneutics: The New Versus the Old","review":"There are some books I can read in an evening or two and feel like I have a good grasp of what the book is all about. There are others that I can pour over hour after hour and still feel like I am only scratching the surface of the book. Evangelical Hermeneutics falls into the latter category. Though not an easy read, this book is rewarding.Hermeneutics is one of the steps used in interpreting and studying the Bible. Specifically, the author defines it as \\"a set of principles for interpreting the Bible.\\" Once a passage has been properly interpreted, meaning and application can be drawn from it. It stands to reason that if the principles of interpretation are wrong, the meaning and application are likely to be wrong as well. What the author seeks to show is how these principles have changed over the past decades and the effect that is having on Christianity today.The author's goal for this book is fourfold:-To discuss the recent changes in recent hermeneutics-To show new meanings being attached to grammatical-historical interpretation-To compare traditional grammatical-historical interpretation with new evangelical hermeneutics-To identify the dominant principles of new evangelical hermeneuticsRobert Thomas believes strongly in the value of the traditional form of hermeneutics, known as the grammatical-historical method. Throughout the books he cites examples of modern theologians who have either wrongly applied grammatical-historical principles or have invented new methods of hermeneutics. More importantly, he shows the effects these people have had on the Christian world. He focuses specifically on several issues: feminism, open theism, missiology, theonomy and a few others. One of the more fascinating chapters deals with dynamic equivalence (which is a method of Bible translation) and how it is not as much a method of translation as a set of hermeneutical principles. Some of the other topics that caught my attention were preunderstanding and the New Testament use of the Old Testament.There are several applications to my life and my faith that I have taken from this book. First, it has solidified my understanding of the principle of single meaning, which states that each passage in the Bible has one and only one meaning. Second, it has helped me see the value of the grammatical-historical method. Though this is the system I have adhered to in the past, I am now more confident that it is the most Scriptural method. Third, I see the importance of removing all possible preunderstanding before I examine a text. What I mean by this, is if I am going to examine what the Bible says about the role of women in ministry, I need to look at the passages to determine what they mean, not what they say about women's roles. It is a subtle but important difference. Finally, I have come to understand more clearly the Holy Spirit's role in helping me understand the Bible.I can't deny that at times I felt lost in this book, primarily because the book presupposes a greater grasp of hermeneutics than I currently have. The other reason is that it spends a lot of time discussing the end-times and that is not a topic I have studied in great depth. The author also tends to use words without fully defining them. An example is the word \\"meaning\\" which he defines as \\"the author's truth intention.\\" \\"Truth intention\\" is not a phrase I am familiar with, though perhaps if I was more familiar with hermeneutics I would be.I would recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand how Scripture is supposed to be used. Realize, though, that it does help to have a solid understanding of hermeneutics before reading it. I suspect I will be returning to this book often as I study the Word."},{"Title":"Evangelical Hermeneutics: The New Versus the Old","review":"This work is a wonderful explanation of a plague that is resting on the Lord's house in our time. To borrow from Dr. Thomas, this book explains the sea of uncertainty that the church has loosed herself onto by leaving behind the methods of Biblical interpretation that have secured it. We have begun handling our sword without care, and we are now paying the price. This text traces the methods that have been used to alter the principles that have secured our faith, and more, it charts a clear path back to the firm foundation of true understanding of the Scriptures. This book is a must read for all those who care about the interpretation of Scripture, whether a man is seminary trained or not, this book will have great value."},{"Title":"Evangelical Hermeneutics: The New Versus the Old","review":"Dr. Thomas has touched a nerve with his book on hermeneutics. He comes from the 'old school' that takes Scripture as it reads rather than the practice so often today of projecting your 'pre-understanding' into the interpreting methodology. He follows Milton Terry's hermeneutic methodology which is more reliable and lets the Scriptures speak for themselves.This is not for your 'novice' in the faith for he covers some very difficult areas of theology. But, what he has done is to put the ship back on course from the wild interpretations coming down the pike today! Some modern theologians will not like what he has to say of their handling of Scripture, but truth must be presented...even if it cuts to the quick!I am so thankful for this excellent book!"},{"Title":"Evangelical Hermeneutics: The New Versus the Old","review":"Robert L. Thomas gives a clear and precise evaluation on how todays evangelicals have shifted away from the traditional grammatical-historical hermeneutics of the Bible. This book is a must read for Seminary students and Pastors who are faithful to the Word of God through expositional preaching!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Evangelical Hermeneutics: The New Versus the Old","review":"Robert Thomas has given a call to evangelicals to realize that in their ranks that some have been changing the rules for the worse, the rules that should be followed in interpreting the Bible. Hermeneutics, the set of rules or principles for proper interpretation of God's revelation, is SO FOUNDATIONAL to everything else that it can be argued that the concerns Thomas raises makes this work the most crucial one today, other than the Bible itself, because everything else is built on it.There may be some refinements that others could make in this topic, and one could hope that Thomas or someone else will address these issues also in a more popular work, but this book should form a strong foundation for any such future efforts.Without question, I believe that anyone concerned with accurately understanding what God has revealed to His creatures, needs to be aware of these concerns, and those in positions of influence to guide the Church, seminary and other professors, pastors, Christian leaders, CANNOT ignore its implications. They need to understand what has been happening and take action to shore up the foundation and protect the propositional truth that God has given us in His Word."},{"Title":"Evangelical Hermeneutics: The New Versus the Old","review":"There are many wonderful statements in this book. Thomas is an impressive scholar with a life time of study of the scriptures.Unfortunately, this book seems to be more interested in pointing out everyone else's flaws with absolutely no awareness of the author's own.Thomas spends over 500 pages lumping together people with whom he disagrees into one big category: the failure of preunderstanding. The book is a book about how everyone else has failed to interpret and study the Bible objectively because they have rejected Milton Terry's hermeneutical method, which isn't even necessarily true.Its true. All the scholars he criticizes have failed to interpret scripture objectively. The problem is that Thomas doesn't seem to be aware that neither has he! Thomas has just as much preunderstanding when he approaches scripture as everyone he criticizes, but he never seems aware of it - at least not in this book.Instead, Thomas excels at quoting someone he disagrees with, misconstruing that quote, and then ranting about how that person isn't objective, never realizing that his own preunderstanding has destroyed the authorial intent of the person he's quoting. Thomas regularly fails to understand the authorial intent of Moises Silva's statements on linguistics and interpretation. Thomas regularly fails to understand the authorial intent of Peter Cotterell and Max Turner in their book on linguistics and interpretation. And that's just the icing on the cake. Every single chapter is like that.When it comes down to it, Robert L. Thomas is so busy pointing out the splinter of preunderstanding in everyone else's eyes that he is yet to have noticed the log in his own.There's another review on the internet: just google \\"findarticle\\" and then search for his title.At the request of a commenter, I've added a couple examples from the chapter on linguistics, but since they turned out to be so long, I've included them in a separate comment below.

While I cannot complain about the substance of either book, the layout/format of both books will drive the average person to the brink of insanity and make the learning process that much more difficult. Exercises/Labs are presented and numbered in an incoherent and most annoying manner (e.g. lab 4.1, 4.1.1, 4.1.2; 4.2, 4.2.1, 4.2.2 etc), but the solutions to these labs do not appear right after the exercise itself (where they belong in an interactive book);but rather, the solutions for many of the exercises appear several pages later. Trying to go back and forth between the exercises and the answers will drive many people batty. Try to look through the book and review the formatting before deciding to buy it. As for the review questions at the end of the chapter, again, instead of having the answers follow the questions, you have to turn to the back of the book - most annoying. Finally, at the end of each chapter, there are a series of questions designed to &quot;Test your knowledge&quot;, but don't bother looking anywhere in the book for the answers to the questions - there are none!

If so, then this book is not for you because you're already a guru. Oracle Press books handle that nicely. SQL is analogous to a foreign language, and most people learn foreign languages through extensive exercises that build towards mastery. This book does that, and, as such, there's little out there that compares. If you patiently enter every SQL query in this book and break it down into its constituent parts, examine each query's output, do every exercise even if it means looking at the solution as you solve it, complete every \\"Test Your Thinking\\" exercise, redo chapters 4, 5, and 7 at every opportunity, and think, this book will become the most extensive SQL reference work you can imagine--that's right SQL, not simply Oracle's implementation of it. This is because this book shows you how to apply SQL in ways you may not have imagined (my brain still hurts). The drawbacks: (1) Oracle dbase software required for the companion dbase--don't get this book if you don't have access to Oracle because it relies on intimate knowledge of the companion dbase, (2) dizziness from the frequency of your hand smacking your forehead when asking yourself \\"Why didn't I think of that\\"? The prose is succinct and elegant in its clarity except for chapter 7, where the need for and role of correlative subqueries, inline views, and scalar subquery expressions and the theory behind them could have been explicated better, particularly where and when they can/should substitute for equijoins.

Paul Park imagines the lives of several biblical women, and gives us a sense of what their lives might have been like. The three Marys the title refers to are Mary, mother of Jesus; Mary Magdalen; and Mary of the Mary and Martha story. The author takes stories from the new testament and tells them from these female viewpoints.Three Marys is told in simple language that feels appropriate for the characters that Park imagines. At the same time, the novel is complex enough that I had to pay close attention to the details. My sense is that if I were even more familiar with the gospels, I would catch more of the subtleties that Park weaves into his fiction. As a lapsed churchgoer, I felt that I understood some of the references that he made to The Bible, but assume that I missed others. Now I want to go back and reread portions of The Bible to see just how clever this author is.It is interesting to consider what these women, who were so close to Jesus, went through.

It's a very unique writing style and I found it hard to follow.Although the book uses names of people and places from the bible it contains virtually no actual facts or events (other than the crucifixion itself). The story goes something like: \\"She ate a piece of bread\\", \\"She pulled up her blanket\\", \\"She walked down the road\\".

While it contains a couple of inscriptional texts, it generally eschews these for literary texts, some of which are included in works dating from quite late. I have mixed feelings about Courtney's work.There is a pretty large range of content here. Courtney starts with the Twelve Tables, an Old Latin text which remained popular among later educated Romans. This is followed by fragments of Ennius' \\"Euhemerus\\" which is, sadly, the only Ennius here. Cato gets the most attention by far of any of the authors represented, with (rather bizarre) selections from his \\"De Agricultura\\", \\"Origines\\", and speeches. Next is a chapter on senate decrees, which contains the highly interesting \\"Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus\\" as well as \\"Ad Tiburtes\\". There are two brief sections on military oaths and religious formulae, which of course are sure to maintain archaic features to be effective. A chapter on orators, the supposed \\"Letter of Cornelia\\" and selections from antique historians. This last section is interesting in that the writings of various historians are placed alongside parallel chapters in Livy so that one can see Livy's use and incredible embellishment of source material.Is there a downside of the text? Yes. It should be mentioned that if you are looking for a text for studies in comparative Indo-European linguistics, ARCHAIC LATIN PROSE will be of limited utility. The texts are there, so it's at least something, but Courtney has little interest in tracking the development of Latin out of Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Italic. He is more interested in matters of style, which for the student of comparative linguistics will probably seem dull and irrelevant. Yes, ARCHAIC LATIN PROSE is a must for students of comparative IE linguistics, but you are certainly going to need Philip Baldi's FOUNDATIONS OF LATIN to explain the salient phonological and morphological features of many of these texts."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"As always Richard Evans book was great I always enjoy his books .

Evans' depiction of Eliana's Italian husband is an unattractive concentration of all the male-dominant traits to be found in Italian men, and right at the beginning the reader rejects him. And so we root for the mysterious American Ross Story to win out over the man. This outcome is never in doubt, but Evans takes us there in caring style."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"This was my first book by Richard Paul Evans. I have always loved Nicholas Sparks and was recommended this because the writing is supposed to be similar. If you like Mr. Sparks, you will love Mr. Evans as well!It is a story of a young American woman who marries an Italian man, moves to Italy, has his child and lives a very lonely life in a loveless marriage. She meets an American man and they become fast friends and soon fall in love.The story is wonderful and you will find when you finish the book you wish it was not over.

I read it in a few days and finally finished it late one night. I haven't read such a great book in years.

You can escape into the landscape and the romance ~~ and finish it in an afternoon.3-16-03"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"Though not as good as some of Evan's books, this is lighter, but nonetheless thought provoking. Yes, his Italian is not quite accurate, but for an American hero, it is better than some might expect. Yes marriage is forever;however, even God acknowledges adultery as grounds for moving on with your life and Eliana's husband frequently changed lovers.Her husband's only redemption.....his love for his son finally made him realize his own shortcomings and allowed both his son and Eliana to &quot;move on to happiness&quot;.Some reviewers have called it a &quot;quick read&quot; lacking in the emotional pull of some Evans' novel.......however, I read this book twice and find that if you read it fully....not quickly you will be surprised at the &quot;meat&quot; and emotional pull of this work. The beauty of Florence is touted thoroughly, but I would have liked to have had more incite of the harvest time and the people therewith.In short and in retrospect...I would choose this book again for a romantic and heartwrenching story of a young, lovely, lonely woman whose husband's straying has left her with a life centered only on her son and her religion....everyone needs validation that they are not only needed but loved for themselves.I recommend this book to anyone with tender heart...."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"THE LAST PROMISE by Richard Paul EvansRating: 4/5 starsMarch 26, 2008THE LAST PROMISE is the story of two people that meet and fall in love in the Italian countryside. Eliana is an American woman who marries an Italian man and moves with him back to his native Italy to help manage the family vineyard. While their courtship was wonderful, now that they are married he is rarely home, as he says he's traveling for business. Their son, a highly asthmatic child, Alessio, stays with Eliana while her husband is away. It is fate that brings her together with another American, Ross Story, who is now living in Italy for reasons not immediately made known to the reader. All we know is that he's decided to get away from America to start a new life in Italy. The place he chooses to stay is a room on the vineyard where Eliana lives.The two are attracted to each other right away, and then Eliana tells Ross she is married. They strike up a friendship and the attraction is apparent to them as well as to others who watch them together. But they keep the friendship platonic, because she has made it clear that she is married and has no intentions of leaving her husband, despite how unhappy she is. But, despite what she says, it is inevitable that one day they may cross that fine line. Would she risk losing her son for the love of another man and her happiness?I've read a number of books by Richard Paul Evans and I think this was my favorite so far. I loved the Italian backdrop, and I also think Evans did a good job with the characters. They felt like real characters to me, and not just fictional flat characters placed in a story. I'm definitely recommending this book to those who enjoy reading love stories."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I really loved this book!! Never been to Italy Richard's Paul Evans words make you feel that you are right there. I love Eliana and Ross, I thought her son Alessio was so adorable and very sweet. I felt for bad for him wanting to have his father's approval, all he wanted was his dad to be there for him, Mauirzio was such of a jerk of a husband and a father!! As I kept reading I wanted to jump in the book and strangle Mauizio!! My heart went out to Ross when he was telling Eliana how much he loves her and you can tell she loves him as well, but when she got married she promised to love honor and cherish, for better for worse in sickness and in health. But what Eliana doesn't understand is that the promise has already been broken by Mauirzio. Now she had to find it in her heart to see deep within her if she can keep that promise she has made. If I could I would give this book more than five stars.Happy Reading Lisa"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I rarely have the chance to read (have two boys and third on the way) and I just happened upon this book at the bookstore and the cover caught my eye. I read the jacket and decided to give it a try. It sat for months on my dresser before I finally got to pick it up. I read half of the book in just a few hours...it is a wonderfully written novel and I am definitely going to be reading the rest of his books. The characters come to life and it's extremely difficult to put down! Definitely the best book I've read in YEARS!"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I have really enjoyed other Richard Paul Evans books--such as the Carousel, the Looking Glass, and, of course, The Christmas Box. But, after reading this book, I wondered if Mr. Evans has been attending mindless romance novel workshops."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"From beginning to end the author keeps you interested and longing for more. I was caught up in the lives of Eliana and Ross and was disappointed that the story had to end. Evans has a way of making the entire book come alive; the setting, the characters, the emotions. I highly recommend this book and look forward to a sequel!"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"Perhaps it isn't fair when an author writes several books that you loved in past that you keep comparing their latest book to the one they've just written. But that is the reality of life. Actor's performances are compared from one movie or show to another, artists' works are often compared and singer's latest recordings are compared to what they did in the past. Therefore based on past books I read by Richard Paul Evans the mere mention of a new book by him fills me with great anticipation. Sometimes I can hardly wait when I've finished his last book for his next title to be published. And so I picked up The Last Promise filled with the promise of a really good read and finished thinking this book was simply an OK read. And while an OK read isn't bad from some authors, I'm accustomed to a book by Richard Paul Evans which really packs and emotional punch and even offers some spiritual guidance. Even criticism of Evans being sappy and preachy never deterred me from enjoying his books. Perhaps if I expected a romance novel I might have given this book 5 stars, but unfortunately even for a romance book this title had a rushed and rather unexplained ending and left me yearning for a better read.Eliana Ferrini left America several years before when she married an Italian man that runs his family's business. Meeting this man while she attended college, today she lives in Tuscany with her husband and young son Alessi. By all appearances thy have a comfortable life and a wonderful future. But appearances are deceiving and Eliana is miserable with her unfulfilled life and a future that stretches out with only boredom ahead. Her husband travels constantly, has many lovers and if Eliana could have her way she would return to the United States and make her home there. The only pleasure Eliana has other than her son is her love of painting but fears that her loneliness will someday break her spirit. All attempts on her part to reason with her husband fall on deaf ears. And when she finally finds to courage to suggest a divorce, Mauritzio says he will give her one but their son will have to remain in Italy with him. This is out of the question for Eliana. Then a mysterious stranger, Ross, rents the vacant apartment in their building and helps Eliana during an emergency. This gentleman has come to Tuscany to wrestling with his own demons, but as the days and weeks go by, it become obvious that the these two lonely people are more than interested in each other. Perhaps they have finally found a soul mate and a way out of their existing lives. In the end, though, Eliana will be faced with a difficult choice, which may change her life forever.Evans does a fine job of describing the Tuscany region, the city of Florence and harvest time at the Ferrini vineyards. But as desperate as Eliana's situation was coupled with a sad event in Ross' past, they were rather superficial characters to me. And for some reason I kept looking at the book cover to see if I had made a mistake, and this was written by Nicholas Sparks instead. I guess we don't always love every book we read by an author and I certainly will read this author again. I only hope his next book will promise to be better than this one."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"Good, enjoyable book. I hadn't read anything by Evans in awhile, but will read more in the future. This book held my interest and even though the outcome was predictable, the path to the ending was not. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I like how Richard Evans address difficult situations and brings them to our notice. Here he addresses an american living in Italy and meeting an american woman married to an Italian and the difficulties there. You can see some of the challenges living in Italy for Americans. I admire the way the book is written respectfuly. It is a book that absorbs your thoughts and is not a quick read. I have a seventeen year old that has read and enjoyed the book as well."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"This is the first Richard Paul Evans book I have read and I loved it. I am not a big romance book person but I could not put it down and have read it three times in the past year. You can actually feel the pain the Eliana is going through. It also has good morals and makes you think about your own life, love life or not."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"Richard Paul Evans' novel, \\"The Last Promise\\" is a wonderful compilation of beautifully described places in Italy that brings the Italian culture to the forefront of his story. While he shares the topography and landscape of the area he weaves it all around a wonderful love story of such gentleness and tenderness it will bring tears. He teases the reader with gentle touches of suspense so that you keep turning those pages. I couldn't put the book down until I read the resolution. If you like romance and tender love, you must read Richard's book, \\"The Last Promise\\".Reviewer: Jeanette Cooperhttp://www.bestpublishedbooks.com"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I have added it to my library of future reading.. I read all of his books and know it will be well worth reading. An excellent writer. The book I received was of good quality."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I only picked this book up because it was set in Tuscany, I had never heard of the writer. The plot was so-so and overly used, but interesting. I would have loved it if he had actually desbribed the places in Tuscany with feeling and the senses, not as a tourist guide reading a map. Not the best writing, but casual reading. I much prefer Diana Gabaldon."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I was looking for a quick read over the Christmas Holiday weekend and happened across this title by the author whose name I recognized from \\"The Christmas Box\\". I had read that title years ago, shortly after the death of my daughter and never even saw it as a romance, I saw it as a getting-over-grief-story, so I was intrigued to see how Evans \\"wrote romance.\\"The opening of the book confused me briefly (annoyed me?) though once I got passed it I easily remembered the formula of romance novels and could fairly easily see where this one was going.Notably enjoyable in the journey was the discussion of art, Italy and Eliana's painting of Ross' portrait. I was very curious about \\"The Big Secret of Ross\\" but again, that just got on my nerves as a part of the formulaic aspect of the romance. It would not dissuade me from reading: in fact, there was gold here which makes me recommend the book to folks looking for some quality entertainment in this genre.One of the most interesting aspects of the book was following along on Ross' tours at the museum where he is an \\"under the table\\" tour guide.Question: Why didn't Eliana maintain her Italian name in the U.S?I most likely won't get an answer.... Though I simply HAD to ask it!Final note, if you haven't read \\"The Christmas Box\\" I highly recommend it. Especially excellent if you have experienced loss, which I think most of us have at one time or another."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"After finishing this book, all I could say was &quot;Wow...&quot; Evans has successfully touched my heart with his novel. I just simply could not put the book down! I like how he puts the English meaning of the Italian phrases next to each other. That made reading very easy.This novel has opened my heart and made me realize all the things I take for granted in life. It made me realize how much love means to someone.I recommend this book to all of my friends."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"Richard Paul Evans' descriptions of the Italian countryside and shared intimacy are reminiscent of those by Kirk Martin in Shade of the Maple and even Nicholas Sparks. Add this book to your collection along with Shade of the Maple and The Notebook - classics to always treasure that are wholesome and speak of everlasting love."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I rarely take another reader's recommendation, but am so glad that I did! I am a huge fan of Richard Paul Evans and read The Christmas Box at least once every year. I am so excited that he has another novel coming out! Anyway, I took a chance and read Shade of the Maple and wow, what a beautiful story. So descriptive and inspiring, makes you cry happy and sad tears at the same time! I also read an excerpt of Mr. Martin's new book at thegraveldrive.com and even it made me cry! So now my life is doubly blessed. Both of these guys know how to write stories with meaning. Keep writing!!"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"As always, I loved this book. I really enjoy all the books by Richard Paul Evans. Great book!"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"This was my least favorite of all the books that I have read by Mr. Evans, I guess because it hit too close to home mirroring a lot of what happpened to me eons of years ago even to the point of making me cry for the lady and her son. Her husband was a real jerk!!!However, I am glad that I struggled through to the end because like my life, it had a very positive and happy ending."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"Although Evans pulls a plausible story together from among seemingly ordinary people, Italian & American, and entertained me with it, I questioned often while reading, \\"are Italian men generally this immoral?\\" In the end I answered my own question, \\"No. It is just entertainment. It was written for Hollywood. It is fiction, it is fiction, it is fiction...\\" Why do I long for novels from Evans that are more true to life? I'm in the wrong section, sorry."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"Another emotional story from Richard Paul Evans. Eliana meets the author poolside at an Italian resort.

I really wish it would be made into a movie!!!"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I loved The Last Promice. It was written with vivid imagery and a realistic plot line. I could almost smell the grapes on the vine and see the brilliant sunsets. I guess I have to admit that I miss the smaller size of the authors previous books. The rough pages and smaller size made me feel as if I was opening a private journal of someones life. Though the characters were american born, I couldn't relate to the almost to perfect Eliana. Her conflict was honest and sad, but to have the hero just &quot;magically&quot; pop out of know where seemed to organized. I like it when R.P.E. gives us great stories of people we can relate to. Eliana and Ross were lovely to look at but difficult to relate to in my world. Another great book...even so. Can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"Heaven bless Richard Paul Evans for writing the kind of books that you not only enjoy reading yourself but that you can safely give as a gift--to you mother, grandmother, ANYONE--without feeling uncomfortable about some of the content.I loved it, and I know my mom will, too."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"The Story story was just interesting enough to keep me reading, but I have never been so thoroughly put off by the protagonists of a story. Everything was so perfect about Eliana and Ross that I found them way too contrived/artificial, although supposedly based on a couple of bona fide homo sapiens, and certainly exceedingly boring. I have to wonder if the author didn't use the same device - the \\"real life\\" fictional interview - that others have used to try to make the story seem more true-to-life; even with this, or even if the entire story were true, it's not much of a story. At least the studly Ross's capacity for 70+ consecutive push-ups was explained by his exhaustive physical training regimen while he...uh...had nothing else to do. Glad I bought the book at a clearance store."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"If you like novels that keep you interested and awake, hold on to your seatbelts because you are in for the ride of your lives! This book is written for anyone who has ever loved another. It's about being truthful with one's self and &quot;getting real&quot; with your deepest of feelings. You will be amazed how this love story unfolds, and you'll find yourself thinking about the characters and the story for days after. You are gonna love it!"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"Ok, this is just a light-weight romance novel and not great literature, but why can't a romance novelist who lives part-time in Italy, as the author of this book claims he does, write the Italian language accurately? Every other phrase of Italian had some kind of error in it. This probably doesn't make any difference to readers who don't know Italian, but it's damned annoying to those who do. Why didn't Evans ask one of his Italian friends to proof-read his Italian?And does anybody really believe an American guy can literally walk in off the street and get a job as a tour guide at the Uffizi, as the hero of this novel does? Talk about romantic fantasy--that's more of a fantasy stretch than any of the romantic stuff in the novel!Oh, and Evans' comment about the towers of the town of San Gimignano being bell towers....any guide book to Tuscany will tell you they were defensive towers built in the Middle Ages, and NOT bell towers!The story is just interesting enough to keep you reading, but the prose is flat and unimaginative. This book would make an OK airplane read, but nothing more."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I almost didn't read this book because I didn't want to have a guided tour of an Italian art gallery complete with English subtitles. After a day of letting it sit, I decided to give it a chance. Something intrigued me about the premise that it was based on a \\"true story.\\" However, I just couldn't buy the main character \\"Eliana\\" who is American with many American tendancies, but she allows herself to be bullied by her Italian husband to the point of being beaten and then promises him she'd do \\"anything\\" if he won't take her son away from her. She'd even break the heart of her newfound love -- twice!! It's just too unbelievable. As mentioned in other reviews, the descriptions of Italy are great, but the story line leaves you disappointed."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"It is difficult, if not impossible to critically assess something you love. Subsequently, this review is not a critical assessment of character development or the other technical components of what makes a good book. This is a purely emotional, subjective and heartfelt reaction to a beautiful love story.After reading \\"The Last Promise\\", I could not stop crying. For so many reasons. The sheer beauty of the prose - poetic and provocative. The descriptions of Florence were so evocative and real that I was often shocked to glance up from reading and not see Italy outside my window. Ross and Eliana ~ their passion and love were palpable. I loved them both; felt such a deep emptiness to have finished reading. The closer I came to the end the more frenetically I read, yet the more I wanted to savour each and every word. When the story ended I felt utterly bereft to no longer share their world. As I sat there with tears streaming down my face and clutching the book, my seven year old son wandered into the room and I had to explain to him how it is possible to miss people you don't even know, people who are characters in a book, yet real and living spirits in our hearts.I am not often so deeply moved within the pages of a book, yet I identified with Eliana in so many ways. The line &quot;Maybe there's another woman out there, another Eliana, trapped and wondering if life has forgotten her.&quot; How often I have felt that very sentiment. To read my thoughts written by someone else's hand was startling, yet comforting all at once. This book was my introduction to Richard Paul Evans. I have since enjoyed all of his books, though this one holds a special place in my heart.I highly recommend \\"The Last Promise\\"."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"3.5 Stars would be more accurate. I was reminded of Nicholas Sparks while reading it, but Evans fell short of the 4 star mark that I began to anticipate. Publishers Weekly did an excellent summary, but after reading the book, I don't feel that I know much more about what is probably a beautiful story. It just doesn't live up to its potential. His descriptions occasionally evoked beautiful images of Italy, but more often fell flat. It wasn't precisely a waste of time, but the hardcover was a waste of money."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I appreciated the way in which Richard Paul Evans incorporates Italian proverbs with the start of nearly each new chapter. These thoughtful proverbs echo wisdom and experience, and they certainly apply to any love story... allowing the reader, even if it is just for a second, to break away from the act of reading the story itself and muse about what it means to be in love."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"This emotional story breathes with heart, soul and zest. You can practically taste the mouthwatering Italian cuisine and envision every detail of the Tuscan hillside village where it all takes place. The characters come alive-you can feel their pain, their love, their passions; it is as though they are in the same room. Magnificent! Evans just gets better and better. The story is about a young American artist (Eliana) married to a wealthy Italian businessman (Maurizio) seven years her senior. Eliana met him while she was on a university extension program in Florence and he sweeps her off her feet with his continental charm. He comes to America to finish his schooling and be near her. They eventually marry and she leaves the familiarities of her small hometown in Utah and establishes permanent residency in the Tuscan region of Italy near Florence. Her friends and family back home sigh in envy at her storybook lifestyle with her handsome husband indulging in the finest of foods and wine in a picture postcard setting of culture and history including their residence, a quaint fifteenth-century villa beside a vineyard. However, not all fairytales have a happy ending. Maurizio turns out to be an unfaithful, uncaring husband as well as a workaholic. While he is away on frequent business trips, she spends most of her time painting and caring for their seven-year-old son (Allesio) who has a severe asthmatic condition. She tries to make the best of her situation and is reasonably happy but secretly craves a more fulfilling, deeper relationship with her husband. When Maurizio is home, she does everything to please him, hoping he'll change but it only gets worse. He continues seeing other women while he's away and when he returns is even more demanding and insensitive to Eliana's needs. After a time, Eliana learns to accept her situation realizing there is nothing she can do. If she left her husband, he would seek custody of their son whom she loves more than anything in the world. In the meantime, an American (Ross Story), with a mysterious past rents one of the villas in the same complex where she lives. Their paths cross one evening when she needs help in getting Allesio to the emergency room after he suffers a life-threatening asthma attack. He agrees to take her and they become close friends, discovering they have many common interests. Their friendship grows into an intense unconditional love for one another, but at the same time Eliana knows it's hopeless and that nothing could ever develop in their relationship. Her narcissistic husband would never consent to a divorce or allow her to have custody of Allesio, and with his influence, the Italian courts would support him all the way. The uncertain saga continues until Story's past is revealed and we reach a surprise conclusion. The novel is cleverly laced with Italian proverbs at the beginning of each chapter intermixed with excerpts from Ross Story's diary. Evans has a writing style all his own and after reading the comments in some of the other reviews, I have to disagree with the reviewers who compare his style with Nicholas Sparks or Kirk Martin. Sparks and Martin are good authors in their own right, but only Evans has the unique savvy that the others lack. In my opinion, only The Notebook by Sparks deserves the same accolades. Keep up the quality writing, Richard Paul Evans! I look forward to your next book."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I absolutley loved this book. I kind of stoped reading since highschool, and a friend passed it over as a suggestion. I read it and it jump started my reading and infact gave me an idea. Now i combine my reading with wine drinking, i would have finished the book earlier if i took smaller sips while reading. This is a great book to break you back into the world of reading. I was completly taken into the story as i was reading. i think richard paul evans is a great author and ive read many of his books since then, and i haven't found one that i didn't like. but my favorite is by far 'The Last Promise' you will get so emotionally involved with this book."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"This was a beautiful story of hope, love, food and beauty. This was the only book that made me want to read in the kitchen while trying something out of my new italian cookbooks, don't forget the glass of wine. I couldn't wait to keep reading but never wanted to finish. Italy is a must now."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I love all of Richard Paul Evan's books. They bring tears to my eyes and remind me that real love is God given. Not only did this book do just that but it took me to Italy, one of the most romantic countries in the world. I hope to go there someday. The only reason why I gave this book 4 stars is because of what happens to their marriage. I was torn at the end of the book because I believe that marriage is forever. If there is love, then there is hope."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"Is there any way to get reviewers to NOT disclose the crucial &quot;what happened&quot; in their reviews? I was going to buy the book from you, called The Last Promise&quot; and was reading reviews of it and unfortunately read the one I have pasted in below, which disclosed the crucial &quot;what happened&quot; and now I lost my desire to purchase and read the book. I DID NOT want to know that the heroine decides she cannot leave her husband for the man she really loves! I would have wanted to read the book NOT KNOWING how it turns out!!A Love Story I Want Forget, July 29, 2003Reviewer: wildwoodldy (see more about me) from Village Mills, TX United StatesMy heart ached for Eliana when the realization came that Eliana could not leave her husband to be with the Ross, the man she truly loved. Mr. Evans used such good description of the emotion each character felt that it touched me deeply. I could feel the pain everyone was experiencing. The description of Italy was such that I felt as if I was actually there even though I have never been to Italy."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I never got this book. I am still researching if I paid for it or not. I also received an email for another used book that I ordered and did not get saying that I would receive a $4.00 refund. Never got it either. Not a fan."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I really enjoyed this book although I hope the writer isn't mormon - that would totally ruin it for me."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"DISAPPOINTING! I was so disappointed after I read this book that it had no uplifting moral values that the past books have had. I looked forward to buying this book to share once again at Christmas but not this year. The story was lagging ... How unfortunate! As for this reader, this will be THE LAST, ......PROMISE!"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"A few days ago I finally finished THE LAST PROMISE, by Richard Paul Evans, a sweet little novel written a decade ago. I loved it most for the descriptions of Italy, especially the small town and the vineyard where the main character, Elliana (Ellen, in the U.S>), lives with her brutal, controlling husband, Maurezio, who is rarely home. Elliana is American, and the mother to young Alessio, a sweet little guy with terrible asthma. Enter Ross Story, an American who came to Italy of late, to live forever. Why did he leave the States? He is working as a tour guide, and has rented a cottage on the grounds of the vineyard where the lovely Elliana lives, very unhappily, mostly alone, taking care of her child while her husband flits about, pursuing one mistress after another.No surprise that Elliana and Ross start to build a relationship, a very warm, loving and gentle one. But there are troubles to face, least of all is that scoundrel Marezio, and Ross's past. This is not a book I will long remember, but it is one I enjoyed. At times, I was reminded of The Bridges of Madison County, though the couple is far younger, and the days are modern ones. Nice little book."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book as I do most of Mr. Evans' books. This one is especially entertaining and I like the way he gives some insight into the area and the wine-making process. A really good read."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"As with all R.P. Evans books this one will not disappoint. Easy read and well worth .A bit of history in this one as well as the typical Evan's romance."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"Having some experience in visiting Italy and the Tuscany area, I thoroughly enjoyed being able to visualize the area and its people. It is a story that gives you hope for a second chance at true love and happiness as opposed to a loveless relationship that is based on control and a double standard"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I read this book yesterday when my electricty we\\\\as off for 8 hours. Thank God for my Kindle, I enjoyed this book. It gave me an insight into another culture and their ways. Richard Paul Evans is one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"This was a great, easy read. I love the way this author writes!

Will be getting more I am sure."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"This is a story of family - very powerful - easy reading - always a good thing from this author"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"Richard Paul Evans has produced another masterful story. I always love reading his works, and The Last Promise was no exception."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"Richard Evans has such a gift for writing and this book is no exception. Another great read from this author!"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I've always been a fan of Richard Paul Evans, and his mastery of story telling has never been better!Set in Italy, The Last Promise tells the story of a lonely wife and mother, Eliana, who is forced to make a horrible choice after falling in love with an American who moves in next door to her.In pure Evans fashion, you become totally absorbed in the lives of these characters. No matter where you are when you begin this book, you heart and mind are thwarted into classic Italy, with images so vivid and rich you swear you were there.For simple storytelling that will take your breath away, The Last Promise will soon become a prized volume amongst your collection!"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I loved The Last Promise! Eliana, Ross and Italy--what a combination of wonderful characters and incredible settings! The story grabbed on hard from the first and wouldn't let me go. I opened the book and closed it when I was finished with the last page. I paused only for an occasional snack and bathroom breaks! It is such a treat to read a book with characters you fall in love with, a book that generates inside you that \\"fall in love\\" feeling all over again. I want to sit down and read it again. Excellent book."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I am such a fan of Richard Paul Evans, when I got this book, I expected it to be good. I did not expect it to be as wonderful as it is. There are no words to describe how much I love this book. The way Eliana and Ross's love unfolds, and the way Evans describes the beautiful Italian landscape, and way of life, makes you feel like your actually sitting there, watching this story happen. I've gotten many a person to read this book and they usually finish it in one day. And like I said, I've read it four times, when I usually don't read a book more than once.I totally recommend this book to anyone, b/c I guarentee you'll love it, and most likely read it in one day!"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I thought this book was excellent! Extremely romantic and interesting you won't be able to put it down. :)"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"Richard Paul Evans' \\"The Last Promise\\" is a finely crafted novel...one which holds the reader's interest, creating an underlying feeling of suspense. Even though there are no murders or other crimes woven into the story... no 'who-done-it' theme; it is nonetheless a gripping and spelling-binding tale. It may be considered a \\"woman's story,\\" but--as in the case of Nicholas Sparks--good writing, GREAT writing! isn't restricted by gender.--Ron Howe / Erskine, Minnesota (rchowe@gvtel.com)."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"There is no literary genius hidden within this novel. However, I fell in love with the main characters, Eliana and Ross. This book took about 3 or 4 hours to read and was a page-turner the entire time. The main problem with this novel was, the way it began. After reading the beginning, you new the fate of Eliana and Ross the entire time you were reading the book. But it was still a great juicy read though! There is nothing like a romance, based in Italy, during grape harvesting time. It sounds cliche, but Americans falling in love in Italy is never boring."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"This also was my first book by Richard Paul Evans. I liked it very much. The reviews say it describes the Tuscany landscape in incredible details, but I guess I didn't see it. Oh, there were some great details about certain festivals and some landscape, but not exactly what I was expecting. Though I really enjoyed the book, I was hoping for a bit more prose in it and great lines that I found in Bridges of Madison County. Not too many of those prose paragrahs there. On a positive note, the Italian Proverbs were great - I really enjoyed them. Evans is a good writer and well worth your time to read this book."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I gave this book 5 stars because I thought it was as well done as possible for a love story. It was entertaining and a joy to read. I only have time to read at night and I found myself fighting to keep my tired eyes open long enough to find out what happens next. What I enjoyed most about the book is that it took me away to another world. I didn't have to memorize or remember any details (like the non-fiction books I'm normally reading). I could relax and enjoy the experience. This is the first book I've read by this author. I've ordered a few more of his books and look forward to getting started reading another."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"If you've got any interest in Italian art, give this book a try. If you enjoyed studying Italian literature in college, again, it's worth a go. There's a bonus if you've actually been to Florence, seen the art and read the literature--Evans' descriptions of the city and the art, and allusions to the culture are right on (at least, in my humble estimation). This aspect of the book does not disappoint--in fact, Evans' detail and fine grasp of the culture were what earned this book all three stars in my rating. It's a beautiful read.The story itself was delightful until the last quarter of the book. I agree with the reviewer who said the pace of the plot seemed to be rushed toward the end, I think to the detriment of the reader's experience. It was one of those reads that you can't put down, yet when it's over, that feeling of satisfaction isn't QUITE there. At times the formulaic nature of the writing is distractingly obvious. And I was particularly disappointed in the lack of detail surrounding Maurizio's \\"transformation.\\"If you're trying to decide whether to buy this book, I say--eh. Don't bother. It's not worth the money to own. But do definitely check it out from the library. It IS worth your time to read."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"This is my favorite Richard Paul Evans book thus far! Richard has such a way of bringing his charactors to life. He captured the beauty and essence of Italy, and made me fall in love again. I will be reading this novel again and passing this book on to my friends."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"It was easy to become wrapped up in the push and pull of these two people trying to find and hold onto each other. This love story contains some beautiful moments... and memorable moments make Richard Paul Evans' latest release a fun read. I found that I really wanted to get lost in Italy myself. Having traveled briefly in Northern Italy in the past, Mr. Evans' intricate desciptions of the landscaped had me longing to return. I enjoyed the little Italian lessons along the way!"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"Not to be too cynical here but, puhleese! This book is melodramatic, predictable, and sappy. Richard Paul Evans' use of intricate detailing paints a pretty picture but, essentially, adds nothing to the story in terms of character development and plot progression. More than halfway through the book the reader still knows next to nothing about Ross Story OR Eliana except that extenuating emotional circumstances, and the added convenience of locality, brought them together. And, of course they find each other attractive and stimulating - heaven forbid the guy that moves in next door be a troll. If you want a realistic love story ... go read some Richard Yates, or even John Irving. These are two writers who really know how to get at the core of human emotion. Richard Paul Evans, for me, misses the mark."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I felt this was a top notch romance novel. It was different than Richard Paul Evan's other novels. My only reason of not giving it 5 stars was I believe in \\"till death do us apart\\". I realize Elaina's husband was a real jerk. But I have a problem with the high divorce rate and don't like it when books seem to make marriage not a serious commitment. Although Ross counter weighted this by his complete commitment to Elaina. So far I have read and own all of Richard Paul Evan's books and this is one I will read again."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I have treasured each one of Richard Paul Evans' books, and was so excited to hear that The Last Promise is here in time for the holidays. I respect Mr. Evans because he is not afraid to write stories that are tender, deep and timeless. They have a redemptive nature and a wholesome quality that few writers have the courage to explore anymore. I recently discovered a couple books by a new author, Kirk Martin, that strike me as being very much like Mr. Evans' books (Shade of the Maple and The Gravel Drive). They reaffirm the values of selflessness and sacrifice as the cornerstones of true love. I can't wait for The Last Promise, and for those who enjoy Mr. Evans' work, I highly recommend Mr. Martin's novels as well."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"In this story, the main character, Eliana will leave her home in the USA to go live in Italy with her husband Maruzio, and son Alessio. Life is grand and they own a villa. But Maruzio seems to be gone for longer periods of time, and Eliana suspects he is having many affairs.Their tenant,Ross, moves in the villa and seems to take an interest in getting to know Eliana and her son well. When Alessio, who suffers from severe asthma, has a severe attack with it, it is Ross that rushes mother and son to the hospital to save his life. And from then on, Ross is always around. Eliana feeling lonesome, spends a lot of time with this gentleman, and as her marriage falls apart, you can guess what happens next.It's predictable as to what will happen, but still is a good story."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"If you love Italy and a good romance story you will love this book. It was one of those books that I never wanted to end. How to ever find something else to read after such a wonderful journey through &quot;The Last Promise&quot;.

It reads like a combination of a Nicholas Sparks novel and also &quot;A Year in Provence&quot; however in this case we spend the time in Italy with lush descriptions of life in Tuscany instead of France. The story is nicely crafted as well with all the essentials of a good novel: conflict, love, great descriptive writing and some meaning of life thrown in as well. I stayed up late a few nights and finished this book quickly. Now I wish I hadn't finished it so soon - I miss reading this great novel already."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"This book transported me to the beautiful Italian countryside where the story takes place. Eliana's problems are ones that anyone can relate to and having love win out despite all the hardships life can throw at you leaves you feeling uplifted and a little more optimistic when you get to the end of the book -and in a few short days if you are like me and can't put down a good story!! I already have this book on my Christmas shopping list for a few people!"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"My Italian boyfriend gave me this book for christmas. The plot seemed promising. However, before getting to the first page, we started to find errors.For starters, see &quot;acknowlegments&quot; second page---John Pitanzo, buon fortunata (sic) with your book. We decided to ignore it. Sadly, the errors became rather too common. Many of the proverbs in Italian contained grammatical errors. We wonder why the author didn't ask one of the numerous friends he acknowledges to correct his Italian. The story did prove to be interesting, but the errors created too much of a distraction. We expected more from a published work and don't recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I really enjoyed this book. He is a new author for me and i am excited to find him. His stories hold your interest and they have no bad language which is hard to find these days"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I don't know why I'm drawn to books about Italy...Mr. Evans has a unique talent in writing that draws you into his book(s) and won't let you go until the very end.The characters are very well developed, the story line very easy to follow and descriptions of Italy are fantastic! It reminds you that although we live in America, there are many other countries who have different cultures (that are centuries old) which are still practiced and followed today. I believe \\"old\\" and young alike will be thoroughly entertained in \\"The Last Promise\\".I highly recommend this book! Thank you, Mr. Evans, for sharing your wonderful talent; to Amazon.com for making books (and many other items) available to us all - AND, for allowing me to express my opinion(s) in such an open forum!You won't be disappointed when you read this book - enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"I love Richard Paul Evans books.

It is one of those books you just can't put down, you have to see what happens next. Going to be a long wait for the next installment!"},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"Truly enjoyed the story. Very romantic and very descriptive of how other cultures treat women. Having an Italian background made this more enjoyable since I have experienced many of the same traits with Italian men that were described in this story. Also was great to read the Italian language phrases (might understand what some of my Italian relatives are saying). A nice surprise ending. Didn't want the story to end. Maybe a continuing story will occur."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"Probably, so far, my favorite book written by Richard Paul Evans.

Through this story we learn many lessons, one being how little we know about the social convention of those in other countries and another of the necessity we all have to feel loved. These lessons are brought to life as you journey to Italy where through his vivid account you can practically smell, taste and feel your surroundings. While this book is a mite different from his other works it highlights the extensive range of his talent as a writer."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"Wow. I absolutely loved this book! After reading it, I had a new goal in life...to go to Italy &amp; paint. The story was so beautifully told, and told so well!

One day, an American art buff named Ross Story moves in to the apartments that Eliana's husband owns in the Italian countryside. THe two are immediatly attracted to eachother, but allow some time to let them fall in love. The only complication is that now Maurizio is jealous. Can Eliana find a way for her &amp; her son to escape her terrible marraige? Can they find a happy life with Ross? I admired the incredible depth of the characters in this story. They were wonderful and believeable. I liked how this wasn't an &quot;everything is going according to plan&quot; book, because since it wasn't, it was much more believeable and unpredictable.

Usually when I read a book, I am finished with it. However, this book I will reread many times. The quotes in the book are worth remembering. Great story, beautiful writing, and filled with wisdom! I will be purchasing copies for my children. Friends have been on waiting lists at the Book Exchange, but they are still waiting. I think the reason is the book is a keeper. No one wants to part with it. The Lost December is more than a story, it is a testament to the everlasting love a parent has for his/her child."},{"Title":"The Last Promise","review":"This book was literally tossed at me with the comment \\"I think you'll like it.\\" What an understatement. Truly one of the better novels I have read. A terrific story, extremely well developed characters, and an easy read. Hadn't heard of RPE, but I definitely am a new fan. The story is a love story that takes place in Italy. I have never been there, but I must say after reading this one it's next on my travel list. Our main character Eliana leaves the states to marry Maurizio (who turns out to not be such a nice guy). They have a sickly son who is left to the care of Eliana while her husband is off traveling and in the company of several different women. When a new man moves into their apartment building, an American named Ross, he an Eliana start up a relationship that of course Maurizio is made aware of by one of his employees who lives in the village. Of course what is good for him is not OK for his wife...things get ugly, to the point of Maurizio threatening to take their child Alessio, away from his mother. I don't want to divulge too much of the plot to you.

I had never read any of Richard Paul Evan's books, so didn't know what to expect. I really loved it and felt close to the main characters immediately. I especially liked that it was set in Italy and was so descriptive to location. I felt like I experienced what the characters experienced, and I was disappointed when it came to an end (as I always am with a good book), though the end DOES NOT disappoint.

Before reading this book, I actually enjoyed A.J. on the Howard Stern Show and his show on E. What a disappointment. One thing for sure, A.J. sure does love himself and hasn't grown up. I can understand men enjoying this book because of A.J.'s female accomplishments - most men would get a kick out of this book. For women to enjoy this book - I just don't understand.The book bascially is A.J.'s personal diary from when he began his career. Unfortunately, the diary consists of personal accomplishments that have nothing to do with his career. For example, how many women he has gone to bed with, how many hearts he has broken, all the clubs he had gone to nightly and the red carpet treatment he received.The book was boring and though it should have been a quick read - it wasn't - I forced myself to finish it and then I sold it on-line to some poor soul.Don't waste your money unless your a guy who loves to hear stories about a male's female accomplishments."},{"Title":"Fame: Ain't it a Bitch: Confessions of a Reformed Gossip Columnist","review":"I bought this book because I thought AJ was interesting the first time I saw him on Howard Sterns E show. Since then AJ has been on Howard a lot and is really repetitive. He's gotten laid a little bit, he has hung around celebritys here and there. Who cares. The book is just AJ feeding his ego. AJ is a sick guy. He is going through his mid life crisis and really wants desperetely to be famous. He tells boring stories about how great he is &quot;Look at me, look who I'm friends with&quot; &quot;Look who I slept with&quot;, ect. ect. I expected a lot more outta this book. I did however read it from cover to cover but then I threw it in the trash which I rarely do with a book. I had a couple of friends who were mildly interested in it but I told them I would be wasting there time by giving it to them. Don't buy this book, it is horriable.

For awhile, he filled a niche in the gossip world as the macho gossip columnist. But he had bigger aspirations and left gossip behind and apparently the Peter Principle caught up with him (see my last paragraph).In AJ's world, image is everything. He acts like a gangster cause he thinks it makes him look cool. He dates super models cause he thinks it makes him look cool. He hangs out at hasbeen producer Robert Evans' house because he thinks it makes him look cool. He even sees being punched out by Chuck Zito as some kind of honor. In the book, AJ also recalls an incident in Paris where he found someone else's credit card and tried to use it in a restaurant after running up a bill of several hundred dollars. That he sees nothing wrong with this says a lot about his complete lack of morality.Since the book's publishing, AJ had his ultra-boring talk show AJ After Dark on the E! Network canceled after just a couple of episodes. He was also kicked off the Howard Stern radio show for suckerpunching Stuttering John. Not sure what AJ is doing now, but it probably involves receiving food stamps (and from the enclosed photos I would gather that it doesn't involve washing his hair)."},{"Title":"Fame: Ain't it a Bitch: Confessions of a Reformed Gossip Columnist","review":"The most boring book I have ever tried to read. A. J. fills you in on all the women in his life and who cares. The fact that he thinks he was a big time gossip columnist comes from his high opinion of himself not from knowing or meeting any stars.

I opted for the airplane magazine."},{"Title":"Fame: Ain't it a Bitch: Confessions of a Reformed Gossip Columnist","review":"I read this book because I liked his show on E!Mysteries&amp; Scandals. I have never a read a book with so muchego in it. I really did not care how many women he sleptwith or the stars he hung out with. Please, his littlestory about John Kennedy Jr. was such a joke. John hasmore class than to hang with Benza. I got tired of his&quot;more on this later&quot; you would forget what later was.And every other word was f***ing this or that. He is awanna be mafia guy, only problem is he would be not makeit in that world. His 15 min. of fame are over. No wonderhe got kicked off Howard Stern, he is a jerk. All the picsin the book are of him looking &quot;tough&quot;. Sorry, AJ but youare all talk. Get a real job. I read the book to the endonly because I was laughing so hard. Now the pages linemy cats litter box. Lets hope for our sake he never writesa book again.

I was hoping for some good reading from this fairly personable, talkative guy.After reading his book I must say my impression of him has changed completely. He spends every chapter talking about himself and not really contributing any gossip at all. I mean, who doesn't know Mickey Rourke is a mess?AJ is merely massaging his own ego, endlessly bragging about his sexual conquests, and his limited friendships with has-been stars. To add insult to injury, he's trying hard to come across as a macho man. Well, he fails miserably. Real men don't kiss and tell. I was hoping this book would be a lot more entertaining, but it's merely a vehicle for the author to brag, brag brag about himself the silly way teenage boys do. What a disappointment."},{"Title":"Fame: Ain't it a Bitch: Confessions of a Reformed Gossip Columnist","review":"It seems everyone here all agrees that this is a lousy book and that A.J. Benza's life is rather disgusting or at least unimpressive. \\"Z\\" in the review 'Tedious Reading' says it all best. I had all I could do to finish it and did so quickly. He sure likes to talk about drinking and popping pills. The one real reason I spent the one penny it cost me for the book was in the hopes that there would be some photos of him which there were. I will give him this much credit. He is a handsome man."},{"Title":"Fame: Ain't it a Bitch: Confessions of a Reformed Gossip Columnist","review":"...

I have'nt seen AJ in YEARS!!!"},{"Title":"Fame: Ain't it a Bitch: Confessions of a Reformed Gossip Columnist","review":"The life and times of gossip reporter is not something I would ordinarily read, but it sucked me in. What it comes down to is AJ is just an interesting guy. Any man who is an associate of both John Gotti and JFK Jr. is alright in my book. If you are looking for the all the hot celebrity stories that did not get published in the newspaper, you will have to look elsewhere. Instead AJ gives and honest and insightful look into the world of gossip, but mainly delves into his personal experiences. What we see is a man who crosses over the line from reporter to insider. He sits on stories to protect his 'friends'. His column becomes a forum for his own personal agenda. He looks at himself for what he is, and we also get a look into the world that we all want to live. Or on second thought maybe we don't."},{"Title":"Fame: Ain't it a Bitch: Confessions of a Reformed Gossip Columnist","review":"This book proves that if a person is at the right place at the right time and kisses the right rear-end, you can become famous. I don't think that A. J. is anymore talented than the next wannabe gossip columnist. He just has the street smarts and where-with-all to accomplish the feat. The book was fairly enjoyable, but not near gossipy enough. He knows some juicy stuff, but is not telling. He is indeed in awe of Bob Evans, Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson and Mickey Rourke. Why they want to be friends with him is the question. He has dated some beautiful women but none of the relationships stuck. There were many hot nights out on the town in New York with his buddy Chico, but not enough description of the places or of the people who were actually there. This book was written too fast and skipped over instances that he kept referring to as &quot;more about that later.&quot; And then there was never more about that later! I am feeling sorry for A. J. because what he thinks was a good life in New York was really a very shallow life. I hope he gets a grip on it and does better in L.A. although that's a pretty shallow town as well."},{"Title":"Fame: Ain't it a Bitch: Confessions of a Reformed Gossip Columnist","review":"It's amazing to read some people weren't satisfied with this book because it didn't deliver enough gossip.

And rightly so..The sub-title: \\"confessions of a REFORMED gossip columnist.Granted, I came away thinking he wasn't the most talented writer in the world, but he never claimed to be anyone other than the guy who finally made it past the velvet ropes. The same velvet ropes that he and his friends used to be denied entrance.Don't feel sorry for his demise. He got the game twisted.The best advice he got came from Pete Hamill, reminding him that he was writing too inside, that he should be writing for the people not in the loop, giving them a taste of what that's like. Instead of being worried about putting his celebrity \\"friend's\\" lives on blast, with the knowledge he had he could have scraped the bare surface and continued his job.That's gotta be the only reason that a Cindy Adams or Liz Smith still exists - although Liz Smith's column rarely breaks any news.Gossip reporters being no-talent hacks?What kind of literary skills are required to write the scoop on a drunk actress who passes out in a bar? The only skills a gossip columnist needs are the means to get the information and a sense of humor.Where did I learn that?

Benza not only takes you behind the velvet ropes of NYC's hottest night spots and parties as he chronicles his days as a New York City gossip columnist but also gives you a glimpse into his electrifying life. A life where he balances on the slim line of journalistic integrity and being a confidante to the &quot;A&quot; list of stars and celebrities with whom he befriends.When most people break into the jet set they pretend to be blaze' and aloof.

Though the book was somewhat shallow, so is this profession. But everyone must understand that these people (gossip columnists) play an essential role in making celebrities into . . . . celebrities. Tabloids and columnists help careers and though they won't admit, PR agencies need the tabloids and columnists. Celebrities are whores for the notoriety. AJ shows us that. He helped made some stars into who they are today. AJ made a name for himself. He made relationships. It's all about having the relationships and the balls to capitalize on them. This book provides a somewhat entertaining insight to the NYC club world / social life from a guy who had to earn his front row seat. I wish him all the best."},{"Title":"Fame: Ain't it a Bitch: Confessions of a Reformed Gossip Columnist","review":"The ego trip this guy is on is disgusting. If you saw Politically Incorrect, you've read the book. It's all about A.J. The world revolves around HIM! There is no substance to the book, the man or his character. Having seen the girl that appeared with him on PI on Larry King the week before, I was looking forward to hearing more about her life in the Mob, but AJ's ego wouldn't let her talk! HE had to be the center of attention. His book is the same way. If I had not already read the book before seeing that show I would have had a better clue what was between the pages.

Ten years ago, he was doing it at the Daily News, getting the scoops and doing the right thing by his fellow journos. And like a lot of us, as the 90s wore on, he became the character he created, living the stories he covered, taking the names and notes that would add up to a young life lived hard and well enough to be a book someday.

I don't know what I would do without them!"},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 10","review":"This volume starts out with Tohru Honda and the Sohma crew spending time at the new Summer house Shigure rented... without Shigure. Shigure pays a visit to Akito, telling him where all the others are. Yuki also comes down with a fever that concerns Tohru and while everyone is out of the room he promises to tell Tohru something he has kept secret in the future. Kisa and Hiro show up at the summer home. Kisa buddies up to Tohru, which only serves to annoy Hiro. Tohru acts a bit more reserved about her mother after some harsh words from Hiro on the subject.Shigure visit's a bookstore run by Mayuko Shiraki, the homeroom teacher of Tohru and Shigure's ex-girlfriend. Their pasts, and that of Kana and Hatori Sohma, are revealed. Hatori also shows up at the book store, much to Mayuko's surprise. Her feelings for him from the past return to rear their ugly head, but she must now deal with the fact that he may have a girlfriend, according to Shigure.Shigure pays a visit to the summer home, where they are gearing up to eat watermelons. in the evening Kyo confronts Tohru on why she has been acting distant and he tells her about the death of his mother. Hatori also shows up to tell Shigure that he has delivered Akito and Kureno Sohma to a nearby guest house.Yuki meets Akito unexpectedly , just before the news of his presence hits the Sohma home. They realize they all must pay a visit, all but Tohru and Kyo, that is. Tohru goes out in the evening to search for Yuki, who has not returned from his walk yet, and under a shooting star Yuki reveals some things that weigh heavily on his mind along with a moment they shared together in their younger pasts, and then shares an intimate moment with Tohru.So, the romance between Tohru and Yuki is heating up as I expected, but I can't help but feel sad for Kyo. I wish he would be a man and confess, but alas, he hasn't yet. This is still one of the best so far, and the inclusion of Akito only manages to amp up the thrill factor. Glorious I tell you, can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 10","review":"Very good volume, all in all.The younger cast spend their summer break vacationing at the Sohmas' beach house, inciting water races, hunts for stag beetles, watermelon-smashing, a little bit of romance, and...also some angst foreshadowed in there. We see a glimpse of Yuki's past through his eyes and discover that Tooru may have her own demons to exorcise as well - namely, about her mother. Also some Hiro angst thrown in by way of an argument with Kisa.We then switch gears and learn about Mayuko's (that's right, Tooru and co.'s homeroom teacher) bittersweet romance. It is discovered that she had an unrequited love for Hatori during his and Kana's courtship, but as Kana was her best friend she decided to repress her feelings and dated Shigure. However, this only made her even lonelier. In the present, Shigure comes back to visit his ex-girlfriend and talks to her about Hatori, who later pays a visit to her as well.Back to the beach house, Tooru does some thinking on what the life of a Juunishi member must be like, and she and Kyou do some talking about their parents. Meanwhile, Yuki takes a walk by himself and meets up with Kureno and Akito. (Shigure and Hatori also show up prior to this.) Akito seems to tell him something that consequently \\"opens the lid\\" for him, but we won't learn what is said until another few volumes.The last scene is a sad but sweet one, whereby Yuki fully understands his feelings for Tooru. And on a closing note, let me just say that they are much, much more complicated than they appear."},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 10","review":"No matter how much you hear what happens from other people who have read the Fruits Basket books, nothing beats really reading them yourselves. The artwork is simply amazing, and the plot always seems to be changing from volume to volume.In this 10th installment of the series many characters find themselvs uncertain about their own feelings. The summerhouse fun continues until akito decides to show up....and, well, you should just read it yourself....But I'll just say that quite a bit of interesting flirting goes on between Kyo and Tohru....and Yuki and Tohru especially...."},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 10","review":"Volume ten is leading up to suspense and definite drama.You can definitely tell that Kyo and Yuki have feelings towards Tohru, deeper feelings then what we have seen so far.With Yuki trying to open the closed lid, I must agree with Tohru, something inside of him is moving. The ending to this book of course just made me want to cry because we now know that Yuki feels something very special towards Tohru.That special section on Hatori and Mayu is really good. I never really knew that Mayu was connected to the Sohmas in the way she was.I was a little worried about when Akito went to visit Haru, Momiji, Hiro, and Kisa. But that changed quickly when we switched to Tohru and YukiAll I can say is this is a really good book and you should buy it if you haven't."},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 10","review":"This is easily the best Fruits Basket volume to date! The whole Sohma gang, along with Tohru of course, makes plans to head out to a summer resort together. Meanwhile, back home,romance is in the air!! Hatori has a new girlfriend..? Shigure sees his ex-girlfriend, and plays matchmaker for Hatori... with the one woman outside the family who still remembers the time the sombre doctor was in love with Kana. She's been in love with him for a long time, but hasn't seen him for two years.... until that sly dog (literally) Shigure intervenes! Meanwhile, one of the zodiac members discovers they're going to have a younger sibling soon, Tohru's relationship with both Kyo and Yuki deepens, and a suprise visit from Akito to the resort sends everything out of whack.This new volume from Natsuki Takaya will make you laugh and cry by turns, make you want to smack the characters for being so naive (but nicely), and will definitely leave you craving more fruits basket!!"},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 10","review":"I liked the sub plot with Mayu and Hari. It was interesting to finally learn Mayu's connection to the Sohmas. The Beach scene with Tohru and the guys was really funny. Tohru is so excited she forgot to Breath!"},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 10","review":"I'll say right off the bat i'm a Kyo and Tohru fan, not Yuki Tohru. This manga volume fills in a lot of unanswered questions about Hari and Kana. It also gives you a sneak peek at how one day Hari will love and be at peace again...Hiro gets once again jealous of Tohru when it comes to Kisa, and Kyo realizes she's not as cheerful so he does his best to make her realize there's nothing wrong with her and Hiro realizes he was wrong. Hiro also promises Kisa one day he'll be the perfect man for her.This book also has Akito appearing at the summer house for part 1 of 2. (in the next volume)I know from reading up to volume 17 that the whole purpose of Yuki and opening the closed lid is the fact that Yuki dosent think of Tohru as a lover but as a mother he never had. (that's a fact, I warn Yuki/Tohru fans to not get all worked up... this series is not going to end your way.)All in all this volume isn't bad, heck no fruits basket volumes are bad... but it's not that exciting... the best is yet to come in the next volume, i promise!!! :D )"},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 10","review":"The book is in great shape, no wear and tear on the cover or any of the pages. It looks brand new. And the shipping was very fast."},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 10","review":"Since I read the previous nine Fruits Basket volumes and enjoyed them, I went on to Volume 10 to see how the story progresses.Tohru and the Sohmas take a trip to a summerhouse that Shigure has rented, but Shigure himself doesn't go along for the trip. While the others are at the summerhouse, Shigure reminisces with an old friend; she turns out to be Shigure's ex-girlfriend and Tohru's homeroom teacher. Their pasts, as well as Hatori's, are revealed to the reader during their reminiscing Tohru also starts to think about what it must be like to be a parent or a lover of one of the cursed members of the Sohma family. Kyo and Tohru have a confrontation, and Hatori arrives to the summerhouse and announces that Akito and Kureno are in a nearby guesthouse. Akito's presence at the summerhouse causes tension among the other members of the Sohma family.This volume definitely focuses more on character development than on furthering the actual plot of the story. However, you sometimes need to have these character development volumes, because the information that comes out in these volumes can help progress the story further down the line. You learn quite a bit about several of the characters, and I enjoyed it a lot. It was nice to start seeing more layers to these characters than what was included in the anime series. I would definitely recommend this volume to readers who have read and enjoyed the previous Fruits Basket manga volumes.I wrote this review after checking out a copy of this manga volume through the King County Library System."},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 10","review":"Made a great gift.

This is it, sort of.The Good:I fully appreciate the historical section, especially the last 100 years.Excellent photography. I think that one could actually learn to knit by themselves with this book. Most books show you diagrams, which most people agree are useless, unless someone has already walked you through the stitches in person.Clear instrucions are included for most of the techniques, but many expert, even intermediate, techniques are missing.The Repairable:Three areas could use some clarification. I may have missed it, but it seems that the simple increase is the same as the fully finished increase. I prefer to increase by \\"making one,\\" which is not explained. The other techniques missing are the \\"sling-shot\\" cast-on and some critical finishing techniques.It is written for a reader/learner. Those who learn with different styles may miss some very important points which are buried in text. On the other hand, a reader might read straight through and love it.The very best post-script would be: \\"A good starter book in a library of knitting literature.\\""},{"Title":"Instant Expert: Knitting","review":"I really like this book! I am a novice knitter, and I needed something that did more than just show me a diagram. The bright, colorful photographs are beautiful, and the instruction is very clear! The book is filled with lots of different stitches, and several really neat patterns! If you were to purchase each of the patterns individually, the total would be MORE than the cost of this book! I've had experienced knitters tell me that they are going to buy this book because it is all inclusive!"},{"Title":"Instant Expert: Knitting","review":"When I flipped through this book at the store, it looked great. The pictures were big and colorful and I thought it would help me see what to do. Once I tried to use it, I found that the pictures in the early part of the book were useless. First, she made \\"casting on\\" incredibly confusing, but when someone showed me in real life, it was very simple. Why she does it the way she does is beyond me. It's like teaching a beginner the most complicated way to do something. When showing how to do knit and purl stitches, I felt that the photos didn't really show where you were supposed to be wrapping the yarn or pulling it through. The descriptions were vague and the photos no help. I looked at the part about dropped stitches and it was useless. It basically says if you drop a stitch to use a crochet hook to catch the yarn and pull it through. Pull it through where? If you are brand new to this, you won't understand. I had to turn to two longtime knitters at work and a Web site with video to make up for what the book didn't show. I'm hoping that once I get better and can do patterns that this book will become useful. For now, it seems like a waste of money."},{"Title":"Instant Expert: Knitting","review":"I got this book when I was learning how to knit, and it helped me a lot! I already knew how to do the stitches so it helped me a lot when it came to reading patterns and understanding some techniques.

I found that I couldn't follow the directions for simple things like casting on, casting off, switching colour or starting a new ball, and ended up watching video demonstrations on YouTube to get the hang of all these things. Another reviewer has noted the shortcoming in the instructions -- so to speak -- for picking up a dropped stitch. Similarly, telling someone to tie the yarn ends together when swtiching colours is useless if you don't also tell them how to go about switching the yarn in the first place, nor is it clear from this book exactly how one switches needles in the middle of the project. What I do like is the stitch library, and for me the book is worth owning for that. For apparently more complex things, like cable knits, I'm going to have someone teach me in person."},{"Title":"Instant Expert: Knitting","review":"I don't think you can learn how to do the basics of knitting from this book or any other. I think you need to have someone show you casting on, knitting, purling, picking up stitches, and binding off. You have to try these basics a while too. That said, once you can do these things pretty well, this is a very good book for the next steps. Tools, gauge, types/weight of yarns, managing color, different stitch combinations, some easy projects, and then a start on designing. Also, for the price of this book, you can't go wrong even if you buy it for only one aspect."},{"Title":"My Fare City: A Cabby's Diary After Dark","review":"I loved my fare city.

Hope he does a sequel."},{"Title":"The Stone Forest","review":"This book was a real page turner, very hard to put down. It kept you guessing right up until the very end. Great book."},{"Title":"The Stone Forest","review":"I really liked this book. It was suspenseful, but not gory and had a SWEET love story - not full of graphic sex. It kept me interested until the very end. If you like Carlene Thompson or MHC you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Stone Forest","review":"I loved this book. It had me guessing until the very last chapter. I thought I had it figured out a couple of times, but she had me fooled. I thought it was unique that Jenna built treehouses. I was rooting for her and Mace throughout the whole book. I couldn't wait to find out what had happened to Mandi. If you like romantic suspense, read this book!!!"},{"Title":"The Stone Forest","review":"This book was totally awesome and I don't know why some gave it such poor reviews. It started a little slow but that isn't unusual. It kept me guessing about a number of things and couldn't put it down til I &quot;solved&quot; it!!!!!! I will definitely read more of Karens books!!!!"},{"Title":"The Stone Forest","review":"Of the things I consider important in books, Karen Harper does two things very well, one fairly well, and two poorly (in my opinion).Both Stone Forest and Shaker Run (an earlier book of hers) are fabulously rich and vivid in terms of atmosphere and environment, and both environments are quite unusual as well. The other thing I've really liked about these two books are her descriptions of wierd mental processes: as an example, in both books you're in a person's point of view when they are drugged by the bad guys, and both times I felt myself fuzzing out and getting really disoriented along with the heroine before I realized what was happening. Very effective!What Karen Harper did *fairly* well in both books was develop an interesting plot with interesting character concepts. However, the concepts never really caught fire or came to life in either book, particularly not the romance portions. I just never felt a spark between the h/h in either book, and never really got interested in the main characters either time. It actually says a lot for her ability to create unusual and interesting environments that I kept reading, because I usually put a book down when I am so unaffected by the characters.So, if you want an interesting suspense plot, with fabulous atmosphere and very unusual and interesting situations and locations, Karen Harper's one to watch, but I hope that, even though she's a part of a romance publishing line, she stops trying to sell her books as romantic suspense."},{"Title":"The Stone Forest","review":"In 1985 Ridgeview, Indiana, following her sweet sixteen bash, Jenna Kirk relishes the memory of Mace Macaman's kiss even if he is the boy friend of Mandi, her older sister. That night, Mandi gets Jenna to help her reenter their home after she returns from her tryst with Mace. However, someone abducts both siblings holding the sisters for ransom inside the town's extensive caverns. Jenna manages to escape, but remembers little of her ordeal. Mandi vanishes. Jenna and Mace separately flee the town with its now nightmarish memories while her mother successfully runs for state office.Fifteen years of nightmares and therapy propel Jenna to come home to confront what happened. From the start of her return, she receives packages and notes from apparently Mandi. Though most townsfolk believe he killed Mandi, Mace returns to town because of his father's illness. He joins forces with Jenna to learn the truth. However Jenna begins to recall what happened on that fateful evening; she wonders if she can trust Mace even if he has her heart.THE STONE FOREST is an exhilarating romantic suspense that never eases off the throttle until the final page is completed. The story line is loaded with non stop action, but it is the lead couple that hooks the reader. As Jenna climbs out of the labyrinth of the pits of hell, she struggles between love and trust. Mace is a wonderful \\"victim\\" condemned by most of the townsfolk. Though the final twist seems too bizarre, the audience will read Karen Harper's taut tale in one sitting to learn what happened to Mandi.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Stone Forest","review":"I've never read Karen Harper before and when I saw the summary ofthis one I thought it looked good. I was wrong. There is waytoo much dialogue in some scenes of this book and the charactersdon't show a lot of emotion. This book has a few parts that weremysterious, the rest seemed dull and drawn out. I was happy that the author didn't include profanity or any brutal violence, but instead of a classic thriller she ended up writing a predictable story. I hope her other books are better."},{"Title":"The Stone Forest","review":"Well this book delivered on exactly one thing...mystery. There was absolutely no romance. A couple of chaste kisses(no detail: simply \\"they kissed\\") and a few bottom gropes do not count as romance. If you want to read a murder mystery then by all means pick up this book but if you want a romance then don't waste your money."},{"Title":"The Stone Forest","review":"Three words - Uninspiring, slow, and unromantic. This book was nowhere near as interesting as I'd thought it would be. I picked this one up at a Thrift store, and when I read the blurb on the back, I thought it looked fascinating, but it ended up being pretty darn boring.The story at it's core was interesting enough, but while reading it, it just seems to drag on and on. The plot is low-intensity, slow-moving, and just generally lackluster. There was a ton of potential for the plot, but it never materialized. I just kept thinking: come on! something exciting needs to happen! For a book that in the end was mostly suspense versus a romance, the plot needed to grab the reader's attention better. The whole thing just seemed like a series of little, half interesting events.The romance...what romance? The love story in this Romantic Suspense was only a small step above the romance in the one and only unromantic Lisa Jackson book I read. The whole romance is based on Jenna, and the fact that she's been in love with Mace since she was a kid, but Mace had been her sister's boyfriend. When she goes back home, he returns not long after because his father has been diagnosed with a terminal illness. There's no development to this pairing. For Jenna, she just loves him, period. That's all the readers get from her. For Mace, he comes back and he suddenly wants Jenna and a future with her. There's this line near the beginning where he thinks about how during the years he was away, his sister (Jenna's best friend) told him once that Jenna had a huge crush on him and he thinks to himself that the more he thought about that fact, the more intrigued he was by it. That's it. The so-called love between them is built with little contact or anything. They just seem to be in love. During the book, they hardly spend any time together. They kiss a few times, and spontaneously tell each other they love each other. It was boring as heck. I didn't believe for a second in their \\"love\\" and wasn't inspired by their store at all. It was stupid. It just very barely qualifies as a romantic suspense.So all in all, there wasn't anything I found particularly interesting about this book. I couldn't wait to finish it. For something with such a good blurb on the back, the end product was a total let-down."},{"Title":"The Stone Forest","review":"Though &quot;romantic suspense&quot; novels are not my usual favorite, I picked up The Stone Forest in the airport last week looking and hoping for a light read and passing entertainment. Within 6 pages I knew I had wasted my money. The dialogue in this book is - - horrible. I literally could have done it better myself. The basic plot had potential, the writing skills and dialogue between characters are just very very bad. It's already in the bag of things to give away."},{"Title":"The Stone Forest","review":"What could have been a creepy romance between the old boyfriend of a sister was actually very sweet.Tomboy Jenna and perfect sister Amanda were kidnapped on Jenna's 16th birthday. Only Jenna was returned a few days later. 15 years later Jenna returns to her childhood home hoping to uncover clues about what happened to her sister. Also returning home after a 10 year absence is Mace, the man Jenna has been in love with her entire life. He is also the old boyfriend of her sister.Together they begin to unravel the truth, and find out all kinds of secrets about the town and their families along the way.I enjoyed the telling of the story. It was suspensful and romantic. The characters had human flaws and were people I could relate to. I'm already looking for another book by Harper to read."},{"Title":"The Stone Forest","review":"The Stone Forest was my first book by Karen Harper and based on this, I'll certainly give her another try. Jenna Kirk, the protagonist, is struggling to make an independent life for herself, after a traumatic childhood kidnapping. Someone does not want her to achieve her goal. Is it her dead sister's boyfriend, her childhood friend, the family shrink, or an unstable townsperson? Suspects, and suspense, abound."},{"Title":"The Stone Forest","review":"I picked up The Stone Forest because I like romantic suspense and it looked interesting. It took me about two years to finally read it, and that should have been a red flag. I read a lot of books, and it can take me a while to get to a book. I like to finish anything I've started and try to give books the benefit of the doubt. I've read some pretty bad books and managed to finish them (The Wish Club by Stella Cameron is one - I could not believe that anyone would actually publish it with all the plot holes and cliched writing) However, I just could not get into The Stone Forrest. I made it as far as chapter five before I just peeked at the end to see whodunit. It was not at all surprising. The characters were just flat and did nothing to raise my interest in what happened to them. And the plot bored me. Seriously. I just did not care, and nothing the author did made any difference.Don't bother with this one is my advice."},{"Title":"The Stone Forest","review":"Real page turner. I read it one day.

I recently read the 1964 edition, picked up long ago at a booksale in Melbourne, Australia. Ashton's work is probably timeless. It is a down-to-earth, very well reasoned history of the various historical tendencies and phenomena that together are called &quot;the industrial revolution&quot;. I cannot vouch for this volume being absolutely correct. The author does not have much time for those who dwell on the evils of industrialization, or who want to include class struggle in their analysis. Though I was not fully convinced of this, still I was willing to listen. Not being an expert in the field, I was looking for a decent explanation or summary of the whole process. I definitely got my money's worth in Ashton's book. It is well-written, without jargon and without presumption of vast historical knowledge on the part of the reader. It gives you an overview of such various fields as population growth, early forms of industry in England, the technical innovations, capital, banking, labor unions, conditions of workers, industrialists' clubs, and relation of agriculture to industry. Though I found the part about banks and interest rather rough going, it was entirely due to my own poor understanding of the field. My edition could have used a map. The shires, the rivers, and the many towns of England are not all imprinted firmly in the brains of North Americans. Other than that, I would heartily recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their understanding of the Industrial Revolution."},{"Title":"The Industrial Revolution 1760-1830","review":"I can't believe I'm the first to write about this. I bought this a few years back while a graduate student in modern European history. My focus was primarily industrialization. This book is a joy. Ashton provides a thorough picture of the Revolution from several perspectives. He describes how events and developments built upon each other and how the innovators fed each others efforts. Most importantly, Ashton is a terrific writer. Other books on this and like topics can be as dry as the Sahara. Ashton is engaging and witty. This is not a book that requires a terrifically large committment. Even if you are not a student but simply interested in the topic, please read this."},{"Title":"The Industrial Revolution 1760-1830","review":"If you are looking for a well written and concise history of the Industrial Revolution then this book is for you. It provides a decent overview but little detail or analysis."},{"Title":"The Industrial Revolution 1760-1830","review":"This is a fairly short book, but packed with information. It is one of those books that needs to be read slowly to digest it. Judging by the introduction and \\"afterword\\" this book set off years of economic research and controversy, as various schools of thought tried to support or refute the author's positions.Much of the recent research is highlighted in the afterword.Well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Industrial Revolution 1760-1830","review":"Thomas Southcliffe Ashton (1899-1968) was professor of economic history at the London School of Economics from 1944 until 1954, and also wrote the booksAn economic history of England: the 18th century,andEconomic Fluctuations in England 1700-1800.He notes that \\"It has often been observed that the growth of industry was connected historically with the rise of groups which dissented from the Church by law established in England.\\" (Pg. 14)He states that as with industries making us of \\"casual\\" labor today, \\"more people entered these trades than could be assured of regular work. Underemployment, rather than periodic unemployment, was the bane of the domestic worker.\\" (Pg. 39)Ashton points out that throughout the 18th century, it was customary for manufacturers to be paid for their goods as long as two years later; but with the speeding up of transport and communciations, \\"there was a tendency to shorten the accommodation.\\" He adds, \\"A new sense of time was one of the outstanding psychological features of the industrial revolution.\\" (Pg. 69)When dealing with the question of child labor, Ashton cautions us, \\"The conduct of factory masters must be judged in the light of their own age and of that which preceded it,\\" since we now have a standard of life \\"immeasurably higher\\" than theirs, and we place \\"a different value on child life.\\" (Pg. 79)He perceptively observes, \\"It is sometimes suggested that the presence of women in an industry has a humanizing effect on the men who work in it; but one would need to take a very optimistic view of the nature of man to believe that this was true of coal-mining.\\" (Pg. 83)After noting that not until \\"the whole apparatus of government has been drastically reformed and a body fo qualified public servants had been called into being could life in urban areas be other than squalid,\\" Ashton summarizes, \\"If the industrial revolution was not able to bring its rewards in full measure to the ordinary man and woman it is to the defects of administrative, and not of economic processes, that the failure must be ascribed.\\" (Pg. 97)Ashton's book is an intriguing and persuasive perspecive on this controversial period."},{"Title":"The Industrial Revolution 1760-1830","review":"There is not much to say about this great little book. An excellent author, a dedicated scholar, a readable book that summarize an important episode in the social evolution of the world, the industrial revolution, started by no other than the British people. This book can be found in the \\"Brevarios\\" serie of the \\"Fondo de Cultura Economica\\", which has several interesting books, similar to the Oxford's \\"Short introductions\\", but in spanish. \\"Necessity is the Mother of invention\\" ... for some countries only."},{"Title":"The Industrial Revolution 1760-1830","review":"This book is a collection of essays on economic history pertaining to the Industrial Revolution. It is not a politically correct book, often turning traditional accepted beliefs about the industrial revolution on their heads. For example, one of the reasons why many poor families had dingy, windowless dwellings was the window tax charged by the government based on the number of windows in your house. Ventilation and health suffered as a result. Another example is the reason for the shoddy tenements built in the cities experiencing rapid industrial growth. Government rent and building regulations made it awkward to invest capital in housing. As a result, the cities that witnessed the greatest economic growth were often some of the least developed and regulated prior to the Industrial Revolution. In short, this is a well-researched economic history that suggests free markets and property rights as being central to the Industrial Revolution while demonstrating that the government regulations often made things worse for the working poor. If you like this, you'll enjoy books by Burton Folsom, like the Myth of the Robber Barons or Empire Builders."},{"Title":"Essential Wicca","review":"I am not Wiccan. I am a Shaman; but Wicca was one of the many faiths I explored.I have several positive, negative, and neutral things to say about this book, so I will seperate them into three lists.Here are some of the things I like about this book. I am limited to 1000 words. ;-)1. The altar layout illustration on page 64 is nice and complete. (You should not allow this to cause you undue concern. Start where you are; even if you have nothing more than a birthday candle, matches, and use your finger to cast a circle. You can always add tools as you find them, or feel the need to add them.)2. This is one of the very few books to correctly identify the invoking, and banishing pentagrams. (I can count the number of books that got something this simple correct on one hand. Banishing prntagrams are always drawn widdershins (counter clockwise).)3. I HIGHLY praise this book for teaching the shielding exercize on page 77. (I wish more authors would teach simple shielding techniques to assist against psychic attacks.)4. I praise the authors for discussing the belief factor on page 82. (It is impossible to have faith in something you do not believe.)5. I HIGHLY praise the authors for discussing the perils in some forms of divination as in Ouija boards, spirit tapping, etc. (If you are interested in divination; I would HIGHLY recommend that you set up a shield (as described on page 77) before practicing divination to protect you from evil and negativity in the area.)Here are the problems I have with the book.1. The book is heavy and cumbersome. (I would have preferred for the book to be in a smaller format with more pages. The wide pages put a lot of stress on the wrist when trying to hold the book.)2. On page 108; the authors claim that Wicca is a nature worshiping religion. (Uh... ahem... er... ;-) I don't think so. I have never heard of or saw a Wiccan worshiping a tree or a stream. They always cast a circle and invoke Deity.)3. On page 74; the authors discuss white and black magick. (In my opinion; magick is simply magick. the white or black connotation only comes in depending on the magickians intent.)Here are some of the things I am neutral about, and I hope you will consider.1. On Page 75; the authors discuss a visualization of roots growing from the base of the spine into the ground. (I would recommend you switch the visualization of roots from the feet growing into the earth (because your feet are already on the ground).)2. On page 80; the authors talk of cleansing the athame with salt water. (Salt is corrosive and could lead to the blade of the athame rusting. I would suggest that you channel your energy into the athame to bless it and raise it's level of vibration, or smudge it by passing it through the smoke of a purifying incense as in Copal, Frankinsence, or Sage.)3. On page 116; and others; the authors refer to the energy used as chi. (Ch'i is only one of the dozens of names this universal lifeforce energy has been called over the past 5,000+ years. Here are some of the more common names (Akasha, ch'i, Itaki, Ki, Mana, Manitou, Nuwati, Orenda, Orgone, Prana, Qi Ruach, and many others.))E-Mail me if you have questions or comments; Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"},{"Title":"Essential Wicca","review":"I am not Wiccan, though I am sympathetic and exceedingly interested in this fast-growing religion. As such, I wanted a book that would be informative, easy to absorb and broad. This book was actually recommended to me by a high priest in my area, and it did not disappoint. I learned everything I needed to know, which is not to say that I've learned it all...but I think I have the broad strokes. Were I ever to aspire to be a solo-practitioner, this book would no doubt guide me quite adeptly.Highly recommended. I have been told that the late Paul Tuitean and his wife were (and are) extremely well-loved and highly respected in the Wiccan/pagan community. From what I've gleaned and what I've learned, this book is accurate, fair, and a reference you can trust.Peace."},{"Title":"Essential Wicca","review":"I have been a Pagan since the mid-70s and have a very extensive library (over 300 books, some of which I have even read &lt;GRIN&gt;). If I had to recommend just ONE book to someone just starting out, this would be the one. Is it the &quot;one true book&quot;? No, there is no such thing. Will it tell you everything you want to know? Probably not, which is why most Pagans/Wiccans never stop reading and researching. Does it have lots of spells? Nope. So why do I recommend it?When I first started out, there were very, very few books around and information was very hard to come by, especially for a solitary Pagan like myself. During the last decade, information about Paganism and Wicca has exploded. Sometimes too much information can almost be as bad as too little. Most of the newcomers I talk to are overwhelmed and confused and don't even know where to begin. Conflicting information makes it even more difficult. Should athames be sharp or dull? Should I do rituals robed or skyclad (naked)? What is a ritual and how do I even start? And the one that can keep a discussion going on for days, how do you decide when something is harmful or not?Essential Wicca takes you step-by-step through the basics. What Wicca is, what it isn't, casting a basic circle, magick, rites of passage, sabbat and esbat rituals, explanations about covens and what they do, and an extensive glossary. It is written from a &quot;centralized&quot; view, not Tradition-specific. All in one very readable, very sound book. I got this book from the library because I was curious about its contents and to see if after all these years I would &quot;learn anything new&quot;. I will be buying it this weekend to add to my library as one of the &quot;core books&quot;. I feel it should be the first book that any new Pagan or Wiccan reads and that they will have a very good grasp of the basics after reading it. And then everything else you read will start to make more sense.The other book I would recommend for those just starting out is &quot;Your Book Of Shadows&quot; by Patricia Telesco. Most newcomers want to start their BoS as soon as possible and this book gives you some ideas on how to organize it (so you don't have to redo the entire thing later like I did &lt;GRIN&gt;).Bright blessings!"},{"Title":"Essential Wicca","review":"If you are planning on becomming either a solitary or a coven-bread wiccan, I can't stress this to you enough - PURCHASE THIS BOOK!

Head protects this person's privacy, but I wish he had named the person who could have made such a stupid comment. That's just as ridiculous and uninformed as homophobes who say, \\"No blacks are gay.\\" Head provides this strong anecdote to convince black men to seek therapy for depression, an illness of which he suffers himself.Unfortunately, I think the people who will pick up this book are the ones that would already agree that mental illness in the black community needs to be seriously addressed. In that way, it's a shame that one has to read 200 pages of preaching to the choir. For those who complain about supposed \\"race cards,\\" this book will really frustrate them. Though the author speaks of the microaggressions that black men face consistently, neither the author himself nor the others he describes can point to one racist act that tipped them into depression. I agree with the brother that racism is burden which negatively affects the mental health of black men, but I think many readers skeptical of that supposition will not be convinced here.The author says little about masculinity and rigid male gender roles. Thus, this book applies to black women almost as much as it does to black men. Concerns about gun violence, disproportionate prison populations, and stereotypes of the angry black man are gendered, but his discussion of racism and the need to have adequate mental health care was not. One can only ask if he excluded women because he thought it would lure in more black male readers or if this tactic would get black wives and other female relatives to pick this up for the men in their lives. (The author never states his wife's race; this makes me think she is white because I think he would have spelled out how his illness affected a black wife if that were his individual situation.) Still, the end of the book does talk about how black women can convince their male loved ones to seek counseling.The book has deceptive chapter titles. One of the best chapters, \\"If You're Black Go Around Back,\\" sounds like it would be another chapter on racism, but instead it spoke of imprisoned brothers and those who are homeless. The author focuses on medicine as the cure and says little on counseling. This is a problem: Americans of all races and genders just want to pop a pill to cure their ills instead of seriously thinking about prevention, especially that in the long-term. Because men, including black men, don't seek counseling enough, this was a huge, problematic missing piece of the book.This book speaks of (in)famous black men and their mental concerns, for example, Mike Tyson, Jayson Blair, and Dr. King. The author said his psychotherapist was white and mentions Former First Lady R. Carter and gay Yalie Andrew Solomon in his book, so white professionals in the mental health field will probably fill very comfortable with this book and may recommend it to many others.Readers may want to read this alongside Ellis Cose's \\"Rage of a Privileged Class\\" or see the film \\"The Hours\\" at the same time because the depression and anger in all of these seems to come from nowhere. Though the author fails to mention it, movies such as \\"The Brothers\\" and books like E. Lynn Harris' autobiography cover black men seeking mental therapy as well."},{"Title":"The Wheatgrass Book: How to Grow and Use Wheatgrass to Maximize Your Health and Vitality (Avery Health Guides)","review":"This is a very informativve book that makes ultimate health clear, easy and desirable.

Wigmore was a vibrant 76 when she wrote this book in 1985, with her weight the same as it was in her youth, and her hair returned to its natural brown. She explains everything you need to know about wheatgrass, and there is a lot to know about this most basic of all plants.In the early chapters she notes the scientific data, Chapter 6 is about what wheatgrass can do for you, including weight control by \\"speeding up blood circulation and metabolic rate\\". Chapter 7 has instructions on how to grow it and juice it, and in Chapter 8, the many uses, including some nice mixtures to juice up a tasty and nutritious \\"green drink\\".Wigmore explains \\"free radicals\\", and the damage they do to our cells, enzymes, and the power of chlorophyll, which is plentiful in wheatgrass. It is also an excellent source of Vitamin C, Vitamin A (in the form of carotene), B Complex, Vitamin E, and minerals like calcium and zinc.Wigmore describes how to set up an indoor growing area, but for those of us who live in all-year-around temperate climates like Southern California, can like me set up a growing corner on a patio. I use roasting pans, buy my wheat at the local health food store (the red wheat is delicious, and very inexpensive), and use good soil.Wheatgrass is powerful, so it's good to know all you can about it before using it, and adhere to the warnings to start with small quantities.An invaluable book for anyone interested in joining \\"The Green Revolution\\", to improve their health, need less sleep, and enjoy the many other advantages of wheatgrass, and if you have cats, they'll like to nibble on it too."},{"Title":"The Wheatgrass Book: How to Grow and Use Wheatgrass to Maximize Your Health and Vitality (Avery Health Guides)","review":"Ann Wigmore gives a thorough analysis of the incredible powers of wheatgrass and how it can improve your health. I must say this book changed my life: wheatgrass juice will improve your health, boost immunity, aid in weight loss, and more. I even feed it to my parrots, and they are ten times healthier now--I haven't lost a single baby bird since I started feeding the parents wheatgrass. This inexpensive of book will save you oodles of money--far fewer medical bills!"},{"Title":"The Wheatgrass Book: How to Grow and Use Wheatgrass to Maximize Your Health and Vitality (Avery Health Guides)","review":"This book was extrememly helpful in validating my beliefs that natural is always the better way to go especially when it comes to something as important as our bodies. Ann is very thorough in her explanations of the benefits of wheatgrass and how to grow your own as well as use it in many beneficial ways to improve the body's immune system. Her credentials are great - she knows whereof she speaks. I learned a great deal about the benefits of raw living foods as opposed to cooked food and how the living enzymes in our food are destroyed at certain levels of heat. It's a little frustrating though to learn that most of the things in the supermarket (except for the produce dept.) don't give my body much nutrition at all. But the good news is there's many authors out there trying to make the transition easier for those of us that want to try to take better care of ourselves. To them, I say a big thanks!"},{"Title":"The Wheatgrass Book: How to Grow and Use Wheatgrass to Maximize Your Health and Vitality (Avery Health Guides)","review":"This book was very informative in the health aspect. Ann Wigmoore made the medicinal qualities of wheatgrass very easy to follow, but the actual growing process was very brief. I was looking to start growing wheatgrass in my kitchen. I started small batches here and there. I ran in to different problem's with all of them. Mainly white and green mold around the roots and discoloration in the wheatgrass. The book was quite brief on problem solving.There is a number in the back of the book you can call if you run into problems growing. I did contact them, but did not recieve a call back. The late Ann Wigmore's school is still an active running school in MI called 'The Creative Health Institute'. I had suspected they might be too busy to get back to everyone that called. Overall this book is very useful and inspiring if your just looking to learn the health benefit's of wheatgrass, but buy a more informative book or gather information online if you are interested in growing it yourself on a larger scale. A process you should consider. It is inexpensive after the initial start up costs, and so important to one's health.I also recommend her book 'The Sprouting Book. A great starting book as well.

This is the best source of information of the nutritional benefits of the the juice.I am not a big fan of the colonics or fasting which this book also touts as beneficial. That is a difference of opinion. However, Dr. Wigmore gives a very evenhanded description of how the fasting is done, how the fasting may be modified and no dire consequences if you just can't do it. It is the same with the colonics. She explains it all and then very understandingly states, you don't have to do it. It isn't for everyone.My skeptical boyfriend (committed carnivore and diet coke drinker) has read the book also (it was in the bathroom...).

There are many aspects to this account of colonial regime in Mozambique whose sole reason for being was the extraction of raw resources from the land.The reader is introduced to the physical landscape of Mozambique, which in itself was as responsible for the success or failure of the Cotton Regime in the differing regions as any human agency. More land under cultivation meant production so the Regime sought to extend the planting of cotton to new regions, irrespective as to whether these places could sustain intensive agriculture. In the north, under-development and isolation helped local residents to resist the Regime more effectively than those in the south. It was in the south where Cotton Regime was to alter the social customs of the local population by forcing out migration of males.This exodus of men left the majority of work to be done by women and children. This started to blur the lines in regards to what had been gender specific jobs before the Regime. As Issacman says; women were perpetually on the front line in peasant struggles against the Cotton Regime.There are many things that I am leaving out in this review. Issacman goes into detail about how the Regime tried to control peasant access to their own fields to produce food for survival. These moves inevitably lead to food shortages as cotton fields were moved further away from villages in order to more easily control peasants. In this the Portugeuse were aided by local chiefs who would be rewards with people to work their own cotton fields.What I found to be one of the most interesting aspects of the book was Issacman's assertion that the peasants were not helpless victims of the regime. That they did indeed find ways to &quot;cope&quot;, a term which is distinguished from &quot;resisting&quot; by the author. Coping strategies are seen to have the unintended affect of proping up the Regime. This can be seen as a strategy akin to a work slow-down in a contemporary labour environment. For the peasant growers in Mozambique these options were thus very limited, such as escaping the regime by fleeing to neighboring countries, holding back some of the labour, or by boycotting the system at strategic moments. Issacman saw these &quot;Hidden&quot; protests as the weapons of the weak.Thus, there were to be no great rebellions or revolts. The structual position of the cotton growers was not to change. These forms of resistance are seen by Issacman as a type of safety valve, which perpetuated the system of exploitation."},{"Title":"Insect Viruses and Pest Management","review":"One of the most comprehensive texts on entomopathogenic viruses to be published recently is that by F. R. Hunter-Fujita et al. (authors and editors). This opus magnum is divided into four sections: basic principles; world survey, practical techniques; and environmental factors influencing viral survival.The section on basic principles is subdivided into 10 chapters on: the rationale for using microbial pesticides, virus characteristics, assessment of biological activity, baculovirus ecology in insects, control strategies, virus production, formulation, spray application, conducting and recording field trials and future developments. Although this section duplicates much of what has been presented in earlier texts, it brings together information that has not been integrated into one text before, updates earlier information and broadens the utility of the book. The &quot;rationale&quot; chapter is a concise and convincing justification for the use of microbial control agents of insect pests. A fairly short chapter describing characteristics of entomopathogenic viruses provides a synopsis of each of the families of viruses found in insects with the majority of the information devoted to the Baculoviruses. The chapter also includes the latest nomenclatural information. The next chapter is a short introduction to the principles of assessment of biological activity that is supplemented with detailed &quot;hands on&quot; procedures in part three of the book (Practical Techniques). The chapter on ecology of baculoviruses in insect hosts presents a detailed overview of this subject and supplies the reader with a multitude of references. In addition to pathology and the dynamics of virus transmission, biotic and abiotic factors that influence viral activity in insects, persistence of virus in the environment and epidemiology, there is a section on the use of models in understanding and using Baculoviruses in pest management. The chapter on control strategies includes the use of viruses in classical and semi-classical biological control, inundative applications, methods to enhance effectiveness and integration of viruses with other pathogens and conventional chemical insecticides. Chapters on virus production, formulation and spray application present a mix of theory and practical information. The most comprehensive of these is the chapter on formulation which includes a broad range of formulation components and their functions. The chapter on &quot;Conduct and recording of field control trials&quot; delivers a concise overview on a variety of topics related to conducting field trials, including parameters related to the condition of the virus inoculum, virus coverage, susceptibility of the target insect, field design and statistical treatment, and recording data.Part two of the book, &quot;World survey&quot; is a review of the usage of entomopathogenic viruses against specific pests from a global perspective. Twelve chapters cover 11 geographical regions in terms of current research and control practices. The introductory chapter by P. F. Entwistle presents an overview in the form of tables for each of the geographic areas covered in subsequent chapters. In addition to the viruses that are addressed in each zone, the tables present an overview of work being conducted on: strain search, characterization, infectivity testing, ecology, safety testing, environmental impact studies, formulation research, field trials, extension trials, production and development, registration, commercialization and sales. The following eleven chapters are contributed by 15 authors, most of which are from the geographic areas being covered. The length and content of the chapters varies, but the reader will be furnished with a summary of fairly up to date information literally from the four corners of the globe. The general format of each chapter includes a regional perspective, information on virus production, formulation, safety tests and registration, and field experimentation. Most of the information regarding field experimentation and efficacy is organized under specific target pest insects.Part three is an extensive &quot;how to do&quot; section of the book that concentrates on techniques used to work with entomopathogenic viruses and their production in host insects and cell lines. It also includes biochemical and molecular methods (Western blots, protein assay, PCR, etc.) and a variety of useful information from general laboratory practice to spray application. The chapter on mass production, product formulation and quality control actually contains very little regarding mass production, but procedures for production are covered in several other chapters. Procedures for formulating virus supplement the detailed chapter on formulation in part one of the book. The final chapter of the section on registration requirements is a bit out of place in that it does not include practical techniques per se. Chapters in this section will be useful to the novice as well as the experienced insect pathologist and include step by step procedures, materials that are required, and didactic figures and diagrams to assist the user.Part four on environmental factors influencing viral survival contains two short chapters focusing on solar radiation and the effect plant surfaces can have on viral activity. The solar radiation chapter generally covers the physical properties and biological impact of ultraviolet radiation in terms of damage to DNA, RNA and proteins. The chapter on plant surfaces addresses the effects of leaf surface macro- and micro-structure, and chemical and micro-meteorological conditions and their measurement.The book will make an excellent addition to the library of anyone working on entomopathogenic viruses. Its thorough coverage of the subject will provide the reader with a single source of information without the need to cross reference another 2 or more books. The dedication of the book to the late Norman Crook is a sad reminder that we have lost one of our best in the field of entomopathogenic viruses."},{"Title":"Blues for Unemployed Secret Police: Poems by Doug Anderson","review":"The poetry of Blues For Unemployed Secret Policy dramatically reflects Doug Anderson's experiences growing up in the sixties, serving as a field medical corpsman in Viet Nam, and confronting the modern era where &quot;a good torturer can always find a job.&quot; Anderson's poetry is passionate, humorous, original, and ranges from bad politics to love gone wrong. The Oracle: On the altar the flies of God/swarm on the pomegranates and roasted oxen./We say we want to know the truth/but as the light sweetens/and the priestess does not arrive/we grow comfortable with the old lies./I want and do not want the razor-edged/pendulum that swings in my heart./The woman gone and why./Years of wide-eyed blindness./There is tenderness in all gathered here/in the shade of the temple./When we were young we dreamed/of a plateau where everything/could be seen in all directions/and suffering evaporated in wisdom./Silence is the power/that pools in the shadows of words/and when finally we stop speaking/it pins us to the ground"},{"Title":"Blues for Unemployed Secret Police: Poems by Doug Anderson","review":"I discovered Doug Anderson's collection of poetry _Blues for Unemployed Secret Police_ when he was invited to teach a poetry workshop at my high school several years ago, of which I participated in. Doug talked to us about his poetry, his experiences in Vietnam, read some of his poems (from this collection) to us, and then helped us with our own poems by providing critiques. His manner, his poetry, and his humility--as well as his willingness to come to a high school and teach to a bunch of self-important high school students. Doug's poetry is riveting, it draws you in, and its beautiful in its humility. I recommend this collection to everyone."},{"Title":"Blues for Unemployed Secret Police: Poems by Doug Anderson","review":"Anderson's first book, The Moon Reflected Fire, won prizes, among them the prestigious Kate Tufts Discovery Prize. Such a strong first book leaves a poet plagued by the cynic's question,&quot;sure, that book was good but can he do it again?&quot; Blues for Unemployed Secret Police is Doug Anderson's answer and it is a resounding YES. This is one of those rare books in which stunning poem is followed by stunning poem, where we come to understand that the poet's earlier focus on Vietnam was an instance of a larger focus on the complex beauty and darkness which attend any real look at our deepest natures. Anderson compels our attention because he knows that the intensity of experience, whether pain or joy, which can be easily identified in extreme situations is also present when we find ourselves walking down a city street wondering why we are drawn to its noise and confusion (see Babylon) or when we are watching a &quot;live petroglyph&quot; &quot;drawing the story of light larger in each twirled telling&quot; (see Lizard). Anderson lives (uneasily) with his own beast, and with &quot;the new evil&quot; that &quot;pours into the deep cup with the evil I have already seen&quot; without forsaking what is good and nourishing in the world and among us (see Kimono, see Crow, see Coyote). Listen to this: &quot;We don't come with souls, we make them up out of our ripening and our going to seed.&quot; How do you NOT read a poet who can write that?"},{"Title":"Blues for Unemployed Secret Police: Poems by Doug Anderson","review":"Doug Anderson is a poet of rare authenticity. His work is layered, nuanced and resonant, capable of being forceful and tender, direct even as it alludes to the mystery of what we don't see beneath what we do. He delivers white hot emotion viewed through dispassionate eyes, and a connectedness that finds release only by going deeper into itself. Anderson writes political poems that ache with sad knot of love and love poems that crash through the senses like the assaults of war. His humor is wry and dry, but always there is the sense that it has been reached by way of tears, shed and unshed. I can't recommend his BLUES highly enough. Like the musical genre, it is a layered book, in which love and loss hold hands."},{"Title":"Radio operator's license Q & A manual","review":"I used this book and a test guide to take the FCC GROL exam, even after it was obsolete.

It has given me a clear view of the big picture and how the elements that i've studied all work together. I wish this had been my text book while i was studying."},{"Title":"Designing Large Scale LANs","review":"Review of Designing Large Scale LANS, by Kevin DooleyGood book! This is what the title implies: a book about designing large networks. It's not primarily an implementation book. It treats its subject rigorously, but without tons of detail at the end points. For example, you won't find cat5e pinouts discussed. You will see a redundant, heirarchical network design. I like a book with real math as , and the author actually provides some for aggregate Meant Time Between Failure (MTBF) calculations. Stats and probability! Cool! He gives less rigorous but useful rules of thumb for capacity planning.Lot's of advice reflecting his extensive real-world experience. Like the importance of physically redundant trunk links (rather than just two circuits in the same fiber bundle|conduit). My impression was that stuff never failed unless a backhoe severed it, but I was...incorrect. Thanks! I will be working on a plan to get redundant links in place.I had an intuitive sense that there is a trade-off between redundancy and complexity. Reliability is the goal, and you can add features (primarily redundant circuits and components) to a point where the complexity reduces reliability. Dooley gives a fairly clear impression of where the trade off is profitable.The VLAN treatment is extensive. Again, I knew that trunking all VLANS on the campus net across all trunks was wasteful; he quantifies it.Overall, the book stands up well after 4 years. He doesn't spend much more than a sentence or two on wildly obsolete media like 10Base2 (coax). There's the occasional PanAm moment (the shuttle taken to the space station in the movie \\"2001\\" is operated by PanAm) like when he refers to Compaq as a manufacturer of network interface cards. I still see issues with 10BaseT and probably you do too, so I don't begrudge him any space on the topic. He was forward thinking enough to mention gigabit ethernet. He refers to Cat6 cable as a future standard. He cautions against using intermediate patch panels, which I was given to understand are o.k. One major building on our campus uses them, at the behest of the wiring designer. Oops. I haven't noticed any problems, but now I know to look.Wireless is the area where change has been fastest, I think. Probably something to do with inexpensive, commodity hardware (with broken initial specs) leading to faster refresh rates. He mentions (back in 2002, I remind you) the utter brokenness of the WEP encryption standard. But if wireless in detail is your thing, this is not your book.There isn't much on different types of fiber optic cable. (not in book - this is my own accretion of data) What I know of is: single-mode on the 9nm wavelength, which goes from 10km to 80km depending on the fiber transceivers. Multi-mode is in 50nm (newer(?) better distance|speeds) and 62.5nm (more common)The IP routing/subnetting stuff is good.QoS treatment is good: he shows why you can't just throw bandwidth at a problem to give good video|voice. Variable latency (called \\"jitter\\") makes it hard for voice|video apps to buffer, leading to pops and crackle that drive users up a tree. Of the three approaches, he recommends only Guaranteed Delivery will suffice.Multicast treatment is good. I have never had a handle on that stuff. Now I do.Some good operational details - in the network monitoring section, he urges us to monitor even quiet backup links. If the backup failed and nobody noticed, they will when the primary dies.In sum, this book is worth the time to read it. It's a little old, but the stuff that is essential to its topic has not changed. Heck, the age just means you can get it dirt cheap. Check ebay or amazon used. Even with list price books, the real cost is the time to read them. This one should reward someone growing into the network engineering role. Being able to grab a copy for $5 plus shipping is just gravy."},{"Title":"Designing Large Scale LANs","review":"The simple but explicit way in which this book went about its chores is exemplary. This book kept its promise of maintaining vendor-neutrality as it unveils the guiding principles necessary for structuring-out a Large-scale LAN. Its design focus centered on stability, reliability, and manageability of Local Area Networks. It also, explained the importance of complementary hardware and software selection in order to optimize both the system's integration and performance.This book discussed issues pertaining to how to run and maintain robust infrastructures, including the identification of single points of failure through statistical analyses. Detailed elaboration and analyses of the pros and cons of network topologies are part of its strength. It also provided detailed information on how to implement standard network protocols like IP and IPX; as well as their dynamic routing protocols such as EIGRP, OSPF, BGP, and NLSP.Similarly, informations on DNS, DHCP, NAT, and VLAN implementations were generously supplied. I was particularly impressed with the detailed analyses of both IP Multicast and IPv6. The same goes for the numerous design options, decisions, and manageability.This is truly a hands-on guide for all those responsible for building and/or maintaining reliable and efficient networks."},{"Title":"Designing Large Scale LANs","review":"Nothing to write home about.

It goes through every layer of the OSI model as it relates to networking and explains how protocols and technologies work in those layers with clear and concise explanations and graphics. It also include some maths so you can convince those with the check books the cost of supporting a large-scale network. Look up MTBF. In the last pages of the book you get a short article that discusses the colophon(cover art) on the front of the book. In this case it is a reindeer.

However, the author also outs himself as &quot;a native-born, white, upper-middle-class professional of northwestern European origin.&quot; That alone must not necessarily mean anything, but he is also a proponent of very old-fashioned cut-throat capitalism. His final proposals for change in immigration jurisdiction is to auction off permits for residence in the US at &quot;market value.&quot; Whoever is willing to pay the most for one of the 700,000 permits Leer wants to hand out annually will be allowed to settle in the US. While he does allow for a parallel asylum system for political refugees, this very cynical concept would effectively put an end to all immigration of economic refugees, who would not be able to pay whatever Leer's &quot;market price&quot; turns out to be. The author is especially proud of his ridiculous proposal for ensuring immigration mostly of qualified, younger professionals and preventing older, poorer, or unskilled people -- unable to bid -- to enter the US. I would have never expected such a heartless, cynical, and inhuman proposal from a professor of sociology. Adam Smith would be proud of him, but hopefully no contemporary politician or pressure group will ever seriously consider his crazy, misanthropic suggestions."},{"Title":"A Miracle in Paradise: A Lupe Solano Mystery (Lupe Solano Mysteries)","review":"I have read all three of Garcia-Aguileras other books, and liked them all. The only thing I liked about this book was visiting Miami and hearing from Lupe again. The story was just not believable. Many questions were left unanswered and I felt unfulfilled when I finished the book. For example, Lupe goes through the trouble to apply (and get accepted) to a retreat at the nunnery, and then she never goes, and it is not addressed again. Hmmmm? We never find out why the murderer feels the way he does about Cuba, or why the triplets are under his power.

I loved how Cuba, politics, religion and US came together in this one book since the story is not just well written but also well developed. I advise everyone to read it and if you are confuse at the end, go back and read the prologue, it might shed some light of why it ended that way."},{"Title":"A Miracle in Paradise: A Lupe Solano Mystery (Lupe Solano Mysteries)","review":"I have read and enjoyed the previous books in this series, and this one is a big disappointment. Although Lupe remains an appealing character, the plotting is sloppy and there are too many unresolved questions."},{"Title":"A Miracle in Paradise: A Lupe Solano Mystery (Lupe Solano Mysteries)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book for its mystery and background. I am an Anglo, Catholic originally from Tampa. I'm old enough to have had childhood playmates whom we then called Cuban refugees, so it's interesting to see that some turned into Cuban-American princesses, like protagonist Lupe. (Not surprising, I guess, because most of the pre-Marielitos (spelling?), were professionals and business people, even if they came to the U.S. with nothing and had to start over.) However, none of this background is necessary for a reader to like Garcia-Aguilera's books. As a matter of fact, G-A explains it all in an engrossing way.Regarding an earlier reviewer's criticism that Lupe never goes on her retreat ... Lupe does mention (on page 204) that the case may not necessitate her actual attendance.I thought using triplets was contrived. It could just have easily been twin sisters and an older or younger brother. My own picayune comment is over use (twice on page 229) of the word &quot;monogram&quot; instead of &quot;monograph&quot; for the learned paper/booklet written by character Sister Mary about the Cuban Virgin. This was probably the publisher's error. Overall, a wonderful series of mysteries. I look forward to the next."},{"Title":"Cooking by the garden calendar","review":"its always good to review the things most needed in life and this is one of them. and so it goes."},{"Title":"The Toys of Princes","review":"Ghislain de Diesbach is one of the great short story writers of all time, on the weight of these stories. His vignettes of fantasy set in the exuberant and elaborate world of the thousand and one small kingdoms of Eastern Europe, with their Baronesses, Countesses, Canonesses, Dukes, kings and queens, and lords and ladies, are overwhelmingly nasty and yet at the same time wonderfully addictive. With a controlled hand, Diesbach paints sweeping pictures of small kingdoms, of mystical occurences and the supernatural. He scarcely has a happy ending for anyone, yet his endings satisfy. There is only one weak story in the whole book - The Divine Baroness. Yet this story is rich in imagery and language as well. Read it. You'll feel enriched and overwhelmed by the strange stories, the cruel and biting humour, and the strange beauty of this book. The greatest story is Iphigenie of Thuringe, though The Canoness Vanishes, The Apparitons of Kurmunster, and the title story are also worthy of particular notice. A book composed of miniature masterpieces and overwhelmingly memorable yet appropriate endings. You wouldn't have them any other way, even though you may feel saddened or exultant. Inevitability is the key word."},{"Title":"The Toys of Princes","review":"No book by Ghislain De Diesbach is likely to become a best-seller in this country.The subjects of his non-fiction are rather esoteric and his fiction must be one hard nut to translate. For a contemporarty (he is twenty years younger than this reviewer) reading his stories reverts one to long forgotten times, when fiction was just that - a product of fantasy.These well translated stories, dealing with absolutely fictive persons and events, are a pure delight. They take the reader back into times, when chivalry ruled, when sad facts were just that. They are highly recommended particularly for a reader overfed with infantile fantasies of writers who aim at youth, but are careful not to step on any or most facts of life.A book to be read for its pure pleasure."},{"Title":"The Toys of Princes","review":"I can't even remember why I bought this book, but I'm glad I did. Entertaining short stories, with a touch of innocence that reminded me a lot of H.P. Lovecraft, without the gruesome details. A great discovery, highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Toys of Princes","review":"In a collection of stories best described as enchanting, Diesbach opens up a space of history without resorting to artifice. These anecdotes twist and turn in delightfully unexpected ways, making us aware of timeless human nature."},{"Title":"Mrs. Jack;: A biography of Isabella Stewart Gardner","review":"If you are an art lover, live in the greater Boston area, or are planning on visiting soon, this book is a must-read. Not only was this one of the most fascinating women I have ever read about, but she and her husband together, moved in circles with the &quot;shakers and movers&quot; of their generation. All of the famous Bostonians you hear about in historical lore were a part of their lives. Henry L. Higginson, who started the BSO was married to Belle's college roommate. John Singer Sargeant, was one of her closest friends and painted her twice. They were related to the Lowell's the Peabody's and the list goes on. Her museum, in Boston, (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum) is one of the treasures of the art world. Her taste so impeccable that her museum was chosen for one of the most famous art robberies in recent years. The book is so well written that all will enjoy &quot;living in the past&quot; with the &quot;Belle of Boston&quot; from start to finish!"},{"Title":"Mrs. Jack;: A biography of Isabella Stewart Gardner","review":"Living in Boston I felt it was my duty to learn as much as I could about the infamous/famous Isabella Stewart Gardner. This book proved to be the perfect source. A detailed look not only into Isabella's art collection, but also her life, the author fills the pages with stories that bring to light how Isabella became so famous. Many a times, I found myself smiling at the passages that highlighted Isabella's quirks and personality traits.After reading the book, I went to the Gardner Museum and found I could easily remember all the paintings mentioned in the book due to the fascinating stories behind them.Reading this book is like stepping back in time and exploring life with Isabella herself. I highly recommend reading it"},{"Title":"Mrs. Jack;: A biography of Isabella Stewart Gardner","review":"I wish I had known of this book *before* a recent visit to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. The museum building itself is breathtaking when you walk in. And then you move from room to room and see so many of the works referred to in this biographical account of her life, her artist friends, and her collection activities. Now so many of the pieces have interesting backstories--I must go back to the museum!The biography itself is fairly straighforward, but paired with a visit to the museum is quite a worthwhile package."},{"Title":"Mrs. Jack;: A biography of Isabella Stewart Gardner","review":"I bought this biography at the ISGM in the modern Centennial edition (2003) (1903 creation of the Museum). Written in 1965 by the famous biographer of many Bostonian families Louise Hall Tharp it represents an official biography of this incredible woman collector. Drawn mostly from material available in the 1950's and '60, when many people that had personally known Isabella were still alive, the book poses itself as a meticulous reconstruction of her life, habits, travels, relationships, posessions, houses, jewels, and works of art. Descriptions of her friends and protegees are detailed and Isabella's social, cultural and economical context are clearly identifiable. However, what is missing is a character study as we are used to in modern biographies, that requires a certain degree of inductive fantasy on the Author's behalf. Naturally, when the biography was written it was perfect and adeguate for its times. There were many things that could not be written about, or rather that it was better not to indulge in such as the homosexuality of many of Isabella's friends. More modern biographies have been written: \\"The Art of Scandal\\" by Douglass Shand-Tucci and \\"The Memory Palace of Isabella Stewart Gardner\\" by Patricia Vigderman, that also have their drawbacks, but that are livelier and have greater appeal to our present biographical tastes.This book however remains a classic, expecially for the first part of Isabella's life, when her husband was still alive. We must not forget that Mrs. Tharp has written many biographies on the society of that period and is capable of weaving a closeknitted description of Beacon Hill residents and their world.The Centennial Edition contains many photographs, all Isabella's portraits and reproductions of the ISGM and some of its works of art.Even if dated, \\"Mrs. Jack\\" remains an indispensable cornerstone for the knowledge of Isabella Stewart Gardner's fascinating life."},{"Title":"Mrs. Jack;: A biography of Isabella Stewart Gardner","review":"I visited the Isabella Stewart Gardiner Museum knowing nothing about Mrs.Jack. Upon leaving I found myself thinking about the museum, the experience left me feeling that Mrs. Jack was trying to tell a story about her extravigent life. I wanted to learn more instantly. As I read Mrs. Jack: A Biography of Isabelle Stewart Gardner I fell in love with this intersting womans life. I could hardly peel myself away from the book because it not only confermed things that the museum left me feeling about Mrs. Jack, but also gave me the perspective of the life of a wealthy woman of the nineteenth centery and how she spent her time and money. I have now have done some more research on Mrs. Jack and have found no copy's of this book in the museum gift shop. It makes me wonder if it's because Mrs. Jack went to great lengths to make sure that certain parts of her personal life were left private. Could this be, because this book is so eye opening into the personal life of Mrs.Jack. Thus the reason for the muesum not selling the book. See what the museum and this book has done to me making me speculate. It's all in good fun! Enjoy."},{"Title":"Mrs. Jack;: A biography of Isabella Stewart Gardner","review":"Loved Mrs. Jack - if you are a fan of Isabella Steward Gardner Museum, it's a must. A great background on how she acquired many of the Museum treasures, and a window into her personality."},{"Title":"Preparing for Contact: A Metamorphosis of Consciousness","review":"The Royal &amp; Priest books are a must for anyone who wishes to understand the nature of human-extraterrestrial contacts. The subject is treated with subtlety and sophistication. The idea that we need not fear extraterrestrial beings and that we can learn from each other is wonderful. The book also makes it clear that we need not look for UFOs or ETs in three-dimensional reality. Our contact with them can be much more productive and rewarding if we tap into dimensions beyond the physical. By so doing, we will be learning more both about our universe and ourselves."},{"Title":"Preparing for Contact: A Metamorphosis of Consciousness","review":"I have read all the books by Lyssa Royal.

Anyone seriously into this subject cannot do without the information coming to us through Lyssa."},{"Title":"Preparing for Contact: A Metamorphosis of Consciousness","review":"Covers the standard abductions and missing time, but also explains how/why millions are having contact and not remembering it, and the metaphysical reasons for why ETs are unable to contact the world en-masse. Goes deep into compatibility/uncompatibility of various realities and how shifts of consciousness could fascilitate contact."},{"Title":"Preparing for Contact: A Metamorphosis of Consciousness","review":"I grew up in a small Caribbean island where lights in the sky, paranormal phenomena and unexplained occurrences were considered mysterious, yet accepted as natural events. Thankfully, because of this cultural upbringing and in spite of my scientific training, I retained an open mind.So it follows I've always wondered what makes some very intelligent people excessively skeptical and closed minded about anything they can't measure with scientific instruments, perceive through their five senses or process with their rational minds. One of the reasons I like this book is because it explains the psychological reasons of why this is so.Also, for those who like me, have been waiting for the day ET's will appear en masse and finally put the, \\"are we alone?\\" issue to rest, there is also a big surprise - contact has been taking place all along, but most of us humans haven't been able to perceive it and remember it consciously due to our compartmentalized mental barriers and because our narrow reality focus does not converge with theirs.Conscious contact depends entirely on us, and will only be possible when we reach a common ground by expanding our awareness into the realm of our multidimensional selves. The other reason I like this book is because it explains in detail and in simple terms how we can prepare the ground in our psyche to enable communication with them."},{"Title":"Preparing for Contact: A Metamorphosis of Consciousness","review":"I bought this older edition because it was the only kindle edition on the book page. I later found out that if you go to the kindle store you can get the new edition for two dollars more. The new edition is greatly expanded and updated. I have to say it was very easy to get a refund for the old edition and then download the new one. I only had to go to my kindle library online and click once to get a refund. Having said all that this is one of the best books on ET contact I have ever seen. It examines the phenomenon on a much deeper level that anything else I have come across. The new edition has a less hokey cover as well."},{"Title":"Preparing for Contact: A Metamorphosis of Consciousness","review":"I am reading the same idea presented in many different ways...that in the continuing process of human evolution, we are at this point in time evolving our brains to think differently. Bruce Lipton, your stuff was good, but for some reason this was easier for me to grasp. Evolutionaries by Carter Phipps was good, but I identified with Lyssa's info more. Children of the Sun, same material, but you scare me. Tom Kenyon and the Hathors I also love. If I were to criticize this book, it is that Lyssa had many pages to explain exactly what their protocols were and she did not. There are lots of transcriptions of Sasha and Bashar, but none of the meditations Sasha led just before contact work. They are not in the contact CD's either. And the explanations of our brain frequencies and the need to change them was very repetitive. Exactly what frequencies they would be operating at in the future was not revealed. The frequencies of the Pleiadian brain, also not revealed. And the biggest difference between this book and similar authors is the premise that contact and taking our place in the global family is the purpose of this particular evolution. But I gave it 5 stars, because after reading all the other sources, this was the material that actually got me doing some things to hasten and enable my own evolution."},{"Title":"Preparing for Contact: A Metamorphosis of Consciousness","review":"This book really surprised me, there was a lot of in depth content that can be easily transformed and used in improving our every day lives.Look deeper , its their and you will find that the knowledge you can use in your life will transform it greatly.This is a must read even if you are not interested in contact, but if you are, even better! ;)"},{"Title":"Preparing for Contact: A Metamorphosis of Consciousness","review":"Im a believer, but why do aliens have to communicate like forieners?Clumsy, long winded and confusing."},{"Title":"Preparing for Contact: A Metamorphosis of Consciousness","review":"I picked up a friend's copy of this and what can I say?

Watching the antics that Amelia and her brood get into is so entertaining. There are a number of years between the action in the previous book and this one, but not a lot has changed. Ramses appears to have spent quite a bit of time roaming around on his own, and he has matured quite a bit. Amelia and Emerson are just the same, and they are as hilarious as usual. If I have any complaint it is with the character of Nefret. As much as I love all the other characters in this series (and they are all like old friends to me after reading all the books up to now), I just can't get myself to like Nefret. Her character does not ring as true as all the others. She is a spoiled little girl who tries to act like Amelia, and fails miserably at it. Anyway, this book is full of the usual villains, forgeries, tomb robbers and assassins. There is enough action to keep any reader happy. I can hardly wait to read the next book in this wonderful series."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I've read several other books written by Elizabeth Peters and have enjoyed them. But this book was not up to her usual standards. Combine an over use of superfluous adjectives with a weak story line and an unexplained passage of time by the end of the book you earned five stars just for sticking with it."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Although I greatly enjoyed this book, I was not left with the same satisfied feeling that many of her other books left me with. It seems to be getting just slightly too involved with internal politics, with the bad guys playing so small of a role, that they seem almost an afterthought. I too do not understand why Nefret had to become so weak &amp; tragic, but the character development of Ramesses is quite excellent. I would like to see David fleshed out a little more as well -- he really intrigues me.I agree with many of the recent reviewers so don't have much to add.I hope Emerson never stops popping the buttons off his shirt :-) I hope Narmer has a recurring role as well!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I think this book has been a disapointment. All of the characters do things they would never normally do. We need to see what Nefret thinks. The characters and plot are getting very dry. Spice them up by changing the setting. Please keep Amelia the way she has always been. If the series are going to center around Ramses now, please make it interesting. Ps, I love Ramses."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I was relieved to find I wasn't the only one disappointed in this latest installment. &quot;Falcon&quot; is still a worthy read, but not up to par. The relationships weren't developed enough, and the mystery was too predictable. Peabody and Emerson used to have such a delightful repartee! What happened?"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I can't quite decide about this book. I was disappointed in it because like so many others, I look forward to reading about Amelia et al on my summer vacation. This book is the first in the series that I bought in hardcover, and I am sorry I did. It is fine, but flat, and though I would hate to see the series end, the thought did cross my mind that maybe, Amelia is losing steam. Nefret's actions were seriously out of character, and it will take some work on Elizabeth Peters' part to make me believe whatever story she tells about it. In short, I agree, please no more cliff hangers!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Why? I loved all of the characters in the Amelia Peabody books, but Ms. Peters has made Nefret into a fool. Come on, what happened?

Don't change major characters into major jerks!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I always eagerly await the publication of the newest Amelia Peabody installment. However, I was disappointed with this one. It was no better than average. The mystery story line was weak and seemed like an afterthought. The melodrama was overplayed and became the focal point of the book. I do like the way the author inserts segments from other &quot;sources&quot; throughout. It adds a nice touch to get the viewpoints of other characters.I hope that the next Amelia story gets back to the tradition of The Snake, The Crocodile, and the Dog and Crocodile on the Sandbank."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I am a big fan of the Amelia Peabody series, but this book I could have done without.

He's now just a sullen taciturn young man without emotional intelligence or maturity.Sigh...I miss Amelia and Emerson!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I love the Amelia Peabody series, but this one was not up to par. I wish Elizabeth Peters would stick to the formula of finishing the tale in one volume. I do not want to wait months to see what happens with the Nefret/Ramses romance.

One character does a very reckless and impulsive act. But it is realistic. Hardest thing to like in this book is that Amelia is &quot;out of the loop&quot; regarding Ramses and Nefret so we readers don't get as much of that sharp whitty commentary on others actions.I truly admire the care this author (and publisher) take to insure consistency among the various books. I eagerly await stories that fill in between the current book time and the previous book (as alluded to). Actually, I look forward to the next installment regardless of its position in the timeline."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"It surpirses me how many readers rave about this story. Like some of the other reviewers I do not like cliffhanger endings. And I was totally put off by Nefret's actions -- she acted worse than the girls she scorned throughout the book.

Lewis. Amelia Peabody is obviously her favorite charcater and a possble alter ego and makes a wonderful entrance to all readers in The Crocodile on the Sandbank. Her last two Amelia Peabody's, The Ape that Guards the Balance and The Falcon..., have revived a series that had become the sligtest bit repetitve. In The Ape that Gaurds the Balance Amelia confronts an element to her character that devastates her but adds incredible depth to her life as a longstanding and lovable character. E. Peters did an excellent job of adding a very realistic foible to an endearing and irascible character; it took courage as it may have turned many loyal readers off. Read the book to find out.Two excellent books, together and separately. But, please, In The Falcon at the Portal did Ms. Peters have to turn one of the most independent and original heroines, Nefret, into an insipid Victorian miss? I am heartbroken she could make such a poor choice, Nefret I mean. Ms. Peters will have a lot of explaining to do in the next installment. I too hope it comes sooner rather than later. Given the ending of The Falcon.. it adds new meaning to clifffhanger. great book!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Elizabeth Peters has done it again.

But I will be counting the days until the next installment at any rate."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Don't get me wrong. This was a very good book and I would highly recommend it, but I was frustrated and disappointed and left without any good feelings at the end.

Some of the things that occurred in this one were upsetting.

Amelia is as wonderful as ever; great additions in Sennia, Emerson &amp; Ramses interaction with Sennia. Nefret behaves out of character, but then so do we at times (hope she is fixed fast). I was heartbroken, truly, when Abdullah met his fate in the last book, and was touched to &quot;hear&quot; from him here, although I am not fond of dream messages. However, Ms. Peters can do ANYTHING and do it well. I hope Howard gets to Tut's place pretty soon; do we get to see that???? Great Egyptian atmosphere. With that teaser at the end, I hope Ms. Peters is scribbling away at this very moment!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Like many of other readers, I too want to smack some sense into Ramses and Nefret. Nefret is truely acting like a twit unless some unforseen plot turn in the next book (HE Who Thunders in the Sky due next year) reaffirms her normal good sense. Nefret might pitch a fit, but to take such a permament step such as a wrongful marriage is uncharacteristic. I hope the next book sets things straight. Star crossed lovers (or willfully blind lovers) are amusing for a time, but let's get on with it before I lose all respect for their intelligence.

Nefret's actions were completely out of character, and Ramses has become a little wooden man--would that he could have some endearing character flaw, like Emerson's temper, or Amelia's stubborness! Ramses is painted like a saint and Nefret, like a silly Victorian piece of fluff, nervous breakdown and all.The mystery in the series is paling (how many times can Amelia be shot at in the desert--and missed? how many tombs can be robbed?) and the romance only works if we care about--and believe in the integrity of--the characters."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I love the Amelia Peabody series and purchased this volume as soon as it became available. I then, of course, read it straight through and found myself, at 1 AM, done with the book without feeling done. I think there are too many strands left dangling, and I am uncomfortable with &quot;cliffhanger&quot; endings. After all, it isn't as if I can read the next installment any time soon. I also found myself becoming annoyed with a couple of the characters - Nefret and Ramses. For all the talking they do, they seem entirely lacking in communication skills, which, given the literate and verbal context of the previous novels, is so unlikely as to be an apparent ploy on the part of the author (as is, of course, the cliffhanger ending). The lack of archaeological detail was also diappointing. So why 3 stars and not fewer? The internal commentary from Amelia is still incisive, sarcastic, and entertaining and I appreciate each new encounter with her. I find myself wishing that the &quot;children&quot; would all head for the Antipodes...Within the past month I've strongly recommended the series to 3 people whom I thought would enjoy the books as I have. Now I hope that they start at the beginning and not with this volume, because I think they'd never read another if this were the first.

I finished this book 3 days ago and can't get it out of my mind. The plot was vintage Peters, but the emotional wollop of this book was, I feel, a new device for her. I simultaneously wanted to throw it away AND buy the sequel as soon as possible. I appreciate all the other readers' comments. I've read 20-30 of the other reviews and find soalce in them. I do not feel alone in my emotional tantrum. Amazon -please, please try to interview Ms. Peters - I would really like to understand why she sandbagged the plot of Ramses and Nefret. I'm feeling that she betrayed characters her readers have grown to love over many years. I only hope the ususal wit and genious of her plot machinations will come to light and explain it all in the sequel(I for one, won't be satisfied with anything less). I'm rooting for Ramses."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"A most wonderful read! This novel sees the Emmerson family growing and the emphasis moving from the parents to their maturing children. What some see as darkness is surely a shifting perspective which is necessary to the growth of these characters. Bastet and Abdullah have has passed and Ramses and Nefret face the pain and challenges of life experienced within the framework of a changing social and political environment. The twists are significant and at 12:30 AM I awakened my wife with a pointed gasp, \\"My god!\\" The ending must be disturbing for any Peabody fan, but it is an ending that acknowledges the struggles of relationships and yet preserves hope and promise. The times are changing for the Emmerson's and this novel simply reflects that change.

I am still uncertain if I liked what I read. The style of writing was easy to read as usual. But I'm startled by the changes in the characters whom I have become so facinated by over the years. Like that, Amelia has become a laid back matron, Emerson's old feiry personality has apparently faded with age, Nefret has become a mentally unstable young woman--a far cry from her old self, and Ramses...! Well,all i can say is that for those of you who have read Jane Eyre or Once and Always, you will see that Ramses has become moody, depressing, and rather disturbing.( By the by, the same can be applied to Nefret and her relationship with him.) No longer is the mischeivous boy who could never be shut up when he went on a lecture--now, it's like drawing nails to get him to speak a sentence. I've been an admire of the Peabody mysteries for a very long time, so I perhaps I've grown so used to my favourite characters that I see any change in them offensive. If the series continue in this more &quot;realistic&quot; direction, I don't know if I want to read anymore. It's like, now that I know what the future is, even if I go back to the old installments, I will never be able to look at these characters in the same way again. So, I'm going to pray Ms. Peters will return to her original Amelia, Emerson and family, because the new ones are too uncomfortable to read."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I like all the Amelia Peabody books, and this one is one of the best !The suspense will keep you turning the pages , the egyptology is accurate,and it has humour too.

However, I kept going, and grew to know the characters. It was very good, but I don't reccomend this as a first Peabody novel. Not because you'll get lost, but because in this one, all the characters are adults and don't seem like themselves in other books. That makes it hard to read the others before this, believe you me."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I have just discovered the Amelia Peabody mystery's at our public library and have been reading them all summer, I was lucky enough to begin close to the beginning, (The Mummy's Case) and have read them in order since--until I got to this book, it was checked out, I went on to the next one--don't do it! I had to stop reading and go back to the library and hunt down a copy of Falcon if you skip this one, you wont \\"get\\" the beginning of \\"He shall Thunder...\\", I liked this book, but did feel that occassionally it got a bit bogged down and had to reread a few sections to fully understand the meanings of some of prose. I do think Ms. Peters sometimes gets so wrapped up in Victorian Euphemisms, sometimes its a bit hard for those of us in the 21st century to understand--but excellent summer read."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"As a true lover of the Amelia Peabody series, I found this one to be far too upsetting, not to mention the unfinished dilemmas. I cried shamelessly over the loss of Abdullah in an earlier book, but found this one to be much worse. What has happened to Nefret's intelligence? Are Amelia and Emerson getting too old to participate in the adventures? One of the main attractions for me in this series is the humor- what's happened to it? Let's hope the next one gets back on track!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I adore Peabody and Emerson, and have become a huge fan of Ramses. I really enjoy the excerpts from Manuscript H, and would definitely be interested in reading about Ramses' exploits away from the family.So all I can say is, I can't get this book out of my mind - it's simply heartbreaking. Not a fan of Nefret in the earlier books, I find it hard to be forgiving here... I notice that other readers see her behavior as uncharacteristic, but it was certainly foreshadowed. What I want to know is, what was she thinking?&quot;Falcon&quot; is not as funny or light as the other books, but it's stayed with me, and I often find myself rereading certain sections, hoping the outcome will be different. Any book that moves me so much has to be good.So if you're a Peabody fan, and you don't mind that things change [and that the mystery is somewhat less involving than usual], read this book. You may be saddened, but I don't think you'll be disappointed.I am eagerly anticipating the next book, which will, I hope, provide some answers, and some closure."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Much as I love Nefret and Ramses, the Peabody series has always been about Amelia Peabody Emerson and her husband Radcliffe. This newest installment focuses much more (as has been the trend in the last three books) on the &quot;children.&quot; I really liked the technique Peters uses of incorporating excerpts from &quot;Manuscript H&quot; and other letters, but this technique dominates the book. Significant developments with the characters of Ramses and Nefret leave the reader feeling like she just got kicked in the stomach. I was so angry, I actually stopped reading in the middle of the book until I could calm down. But after looking at the previous books, the events are heavily foreshadowed, and as much as I don't like what happened, it is more realistic than simplistic happily ever after. This just shows that Peters is not afraid to move away from the expectations of genre fiction. I still love these characters though and enjoyed the book on its merits. I feel certain that Peters intends to resolve the cliffhanger in a satisfactory way. I just hope that Peters returns her focus to Amelia, who deserves a little more attention."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"While I've only read three of the Amelia Peabody Mystery's by Peters' (and totally enjoyed each one) this paticular book left me with a sour taste for the book series.

I want to read the next book in the series but I don't want to be let down again.I hope that the mystery and allure of &quot;The Ape that Gaurds the Balance&quot; my favorite in this series so far comes back in the next book.

And although what happened between them may not be what we all wanted that doesn't mean it wasn't a possible outcome or something that shouldn't have been written. Not everything turns out exactly how you would like when you'd like it in real life; or in good writing.

Another book like Falcon and I will stop reading and buying her books!!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"While I read the first 8 books of this series over and over, I can't say that I'll read these last three (beginning with Seeing A Large Cat) more than once. They've taken a decidedly &quot;serious&quot; turn and just are no longer the &quot;fun romp&quot; they used to be. I have to agree that Nefret has been one of Ms. Peters' weakest characters. She is quite shallow, trendy and mercurial. Quite frankly, if Ramses is true to his character, I can't see what he would see in her. They just don't go together. I guess that's what makes these last three a bit of a disappointment. They just don't seem &quot;right&quot; or consistent with the character developments of the first 8 in the series. I keep hoping that Nefret is a &quot;passing fancy&quot; and that Ramses will find someone with more substance. I just can't see how he would be attracted to &quot;fluff&quot;. Ramses has been my favorite character since he appeared and I hate the turn this character has taken. I, too, kept hoping Nefret would be an evil plant from the Master Criminal every time she perched on Emerson's chairarm and cooed, &quot;Professor darling&quot; ... positively sickening!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I have always trusted Barbara Michaels/Elizabeth Peters, so I did not hesitate to buy the latest Amelia as soon as it hit the shelf. I didn't think she could write a bad book. I was wrong.In a recent article in Crescent Blues, Peters said: \\"if characters are properly drawn ... they have firm personality traits that cannot be changed to suit my convenience or that of the plot.\\" Yet changing personality traits to fit a contrived plot is exactly what Peters has done here. I have read the Amelia series several times, but in \\"The Falcon at the Portal\\" I don't know who these people are.From the beginning Amelia &amp; Co. seem like wooden parodies of themselves. Amelia has been suffering in the last two volumes. Here, she provides little but commentary and some amazingly uncharacteristic actions. Can you imagine the original daring, impetuous, Amelia resentfully staying home to furnish a new house while her beloved spouse plumbs the depths of a pyramid - however dull? And then maundering on - if only to herself - about how she had done her duty? No. The real Amelia would cry \\"The Devil with Duty!\\" and be the first underground. Would the mighty Emerson of yore, who never let murder, mayhem, or amnesia interfere with his excavations, tamely shut down his dig for DAYS so the house could be decorated for Christmas? Please. (These are not spoilers, only details. With spoilers, I could go on at length.)Since \\"Seeing a Large Cat\\" this series has been going down hill, but the elder Emersons are not the only ones to suffer. Peters appears incapable of dealing with the younger generation with the same integrity with which she (once) did their parents. Perhaps she, also, still thinks of them as children. David is dull, Lia still only a foil. Ramses manages to remain somewhat intact and finally even opens up a bit (the one bright spot in this book) but his actions are utterly incomprehensible. But I knew we were in real trouble when - from the first few pages - I could see that Peters was re-writing Nefret's character. Until now, Nefret has been an intelligent, capable, warm-hearted girl showing every promise of becoming \\"a woman of character.\\" Now she is moody, reckless, mercurial, and occasionally vindictive. After three chapters I thoroughly disliked her. She acts like a brainless heroine in a bodice-ripper gothic romance - Ramses should drop this Nefret like a hot brick.These are not the same people we have been reading about for years, and too much time is spent trying to convince us otherwise. Comments like \\"It would be surprising if he had acted differently\\" and \\"she had always been that way\\" are liberally sprinkled throughout.I will always be grateful to Michaels/Peters for the impressive body of work that she has given us to this point, but she is too fine, and too experienced, a writer to have done this."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"This series DOES go in order & progresses through the life & adventures of Peabody & Emerson. Do start with Crocodile on the Sandbanks and work your way through the series in the correct order. I expect each book is stand-alone excellent, but it's more fun to read through in order. The series is about a wealthy Victorian lady who decides to travel. She ends up in Egypt & meets an Egyptologist & falls in love & marries him. The rest is one adventure after another.

As for the on-going non-romance of Ramses/Nefret - enough already. This teasing has been going on longer than &quot;Luke &amp; Laura&quot; on the soaps - and Nefrets' new personality traits strain credibility.

My mother used to hear me burst out laughing in the backseat of the car as I followed the exploits of the world's most wonderful archeologists. This latest book is no exception, with twists, turns, and homicidal maniacs aplenty. I would highly recommend this book, and all the preceding ones, to anyone who likes their women strong, their men handsome, and their mysteries with a generous helping of hilarity. Her in-depth research and obvious love of egyptology only make her stories that much more enjoyable. Thank you, Elizabeth Peters, for keeping me entertained all these years!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Good relationships demand honest communication, a characteristic which the younger Emersons need to develop. Their reticence leads to mayhem and much pain in a good murder mystery that kept me guessing in an entertaining manner."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I'll be blunt--I practically worship at MPM's feet, but the ongoing saga of Nefret/Ramses is ruining this series. These star crossed 'lovers' are so distracting it's hard to focus on the mystery and on Egyptology. Let's face it, we all KNOW, even before we start to read the book, who the bad guy will turn out to be. In this sense, the review, at the top of this page, definately ruins the mystery (I won't provide any more details since some of you may NOT know).The book is definately a must read for MPM fans and for anyone interested in Egyptology. It is always a joy to catch up on the activities of Amelia and Emerson, even if they ARE becomming seconday characters, and the addition of Sennia to the list of ongoing characters (at least I hope she will appear in future books) is a great one. I love Horus' reaction to her.All in all, a good read, except for Nefret acting like a twit."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Elizabeth Peters has done it again! She has captured my attention and left me hungry for the next Amelia Peabody mystery. In the Falcon at the Portal, Peters picks up several storylines from previous novels and manages to weave them with new characters and villains for an exciting future. I love how the series has evolved from one voice to many with the addition of editor's notes, manuscripts, and letters. Egyptology, romance, and adventure are the cornerstones to her success thus far. Peters has been able to enhance the series while still maintaining the intergrity of the early novels."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Once again, Amelia's adventures have kept me enthralled!

With this latest Amelia, THE FALCON AT THE PORTAL, she's outdone herself with both plot twists and character insight - it's continuous action from first page to last, with the people so real they practically pop off the page. There's theft, there's murder, there's mayhem, there's romance . . . and just about anything else you can think of, all happening at once.Be ready to shut yourself away for a day, because you won't be able to put it down. But I warn unsuspecting readers, this book is full of emotional upheaval and doesn't tie everything up in a neat little bow at the end. If you're looking for pat fiary tale conclusions, you won't get them.Bravo! Ms. Peters. NOW, WHERE'S THE NEXT ONE?!!!!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I expect some seriousness, even tragic events, from Elizabeth Peters, but I *also* expect a happy ending. I was, instead, deeply depressed by the ending. I read this book immediately after reading &quot;The Ape Who Guards the Balance&quot; because I couldn't wait to find out what would happen between Ramses &amp; Nefret. I was not at all pleased by the turn of events!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"This is one of my favorite books in the &quot;Amelia Peabody&quot; series, but this abridged version cuts out most of the romance, and all of the humor. Samantha Eggar does a great job bringing each character to life. The vocal portrayal is excellent. You can tell just from her voice, much about each character. And you have to; much of the text pertaining to character development has been left out. In shortening the story for the audio version, the quirky things I treasure about Peabody, and Emerson and especially Rames have been cut out. Secondary characters like Lia and Katherine pop in briefly, and only confuse the narrative. This leaves a bare and somewhat disjointed plot."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I'm one of those very few people who feel that Ramses and Nefret just shouldn't be together. It's too pat, and Nefret just has no substance. She's a fluffhead, and Ramses deserves much more than that. I keep hoping it's just a passing fancy, but I guess maybe it's not. I kept hoping Nefret would end up with David, but I guess that's shot. Anyway, the only reason I gave this book less than five stars are because of Nefret's ridiculous actions. There's not enough of the interplay between Peabody and Emerson, because that's what make the previous books such fun!! I miss the Master Criminal, and I keep hoping to see him pop up again. I loved the intro of Sennia, it makes Ramses more human, and I love the way Peters explored the often prickly but deep relationship of Ramses and Peabody. Absolutely wonderful!!! I cannot wait until the next book to see how everything turns out! Keep up the great work, Ms. Peters and thank you so much for these great books!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Ms. Peters managed to surpass herself with this one. She maintained the tart, hilarious style of Amelia while giving us a treat in the form of what is happening with Ramses and Nefret. It was so nice to really get to know David a bit more too, not just as a sounding board for Ramses. I actually am stunned by the great character development in this one including the minor characters. Yes, it is a cliff hanger; the basic mystery is solved, but there are two enormous new problems set up for the next book. My only comment is, hurry up!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I almost detracted one star because the famous Elizabeth Peters humor is not tremendously in evidence in this latest installment of the Emersons' saga, and humor is important to me.

Unfortunately, this quickly became my least favorite. It felt more like a soap opera than a mystery. Also, some of the characters seemed to act in ways that were not in their makeup and it felt forced. While it is certainly Ms. Peters' perogative to have her characters act in any way, I was disappointed. I'm hoping for a better one next time!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"...and want to shake some sense into them. Part of the appeal of the Amelia Peabody mysteries is that after reading the preceding books in the series the characters become so real that you begin to feel that you know them personally - and, like Amelia, long to give them the benefit of your own wisdom and experience. Accordingly, Falcon at the Portal is, in turn, appealing, appalling, frustrating, maddening, and thoroughly enjoyable. And as always, it is an education in Egyptology and the modern history of the region. Presumably Ms. Peters knows where she is going with all this. At this book's close she has them on the eve of WW1. What next?"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I really loved this book.

I want to know just what is going to happen with those two."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Elizabeth Peters' skills as a writer, not exactly paltry to begin with, have grown over the course of the Amelia Peabody books. The series was always fun to read, but the latest few have an emotional impact most mystery writers cannot match. The characterizations, especially of the younger generation, are much deeper than they used to be; Amelia and Emrson are forced to grapple with events that challenge their composure more than anything since Emerson's amnesia (in The Snake, the Crocodile, and the Dog). This does demand more from the reader, who can no longer be confident that everything will be tied up in a nice neat happy ending by the end of the book.I almost subtracted a star, because Nefret acts in a way that I believe to be out of character, but I left it in because presumably Peters knows her characters better than I do, and anyway it may be wishful thinking on my part. At any rate, she has promised to tie up some loose ends in her next book -- thank goodness!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"What a great read. I was so disappointed with the last Barbara Michaels books that my usual impatience for a new Peters book--particularly an Amelia book--was greater than normal. It was well worth the wait.

Peters outdid herself with this one; it's wonderful and anguishing at the same time. It has far more emotional impact than any of her other many works.What happens is so painful, and yet so believably in-character, that I'm still stunned. She weaves in so much historical and personal complications, and it meshes perfectly. But, oh, the angst and pain! It broke my heart.To quote my beloved Ramses, &quot;this family is good at melodrama, and that was a stellar performance by all concerned.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I read the newest Amelia Peabody book in about five hours.

I'm also enjoying the romance element of the younger generation; the series really flagged for a few books before &quot;Manuscript H&quot; and other innovations came up.That said, I'm becoming a little disturbed at the way Amelia has become less and less perceptive, and more and more a foil for others' astuteness. Moreover -- not to give away the plot -- at least two important developments in this book relied on Nefret using remarkably bad judgement.

Professor Emerson's famed temper (the Egyptians call him \\"the Father of Curses\\") consistently gets him in trouble with the British authorities who control Egyptian excavation sites, so once again he must choose among inferior sites. The Emersons are accompanied by their son, nicknamed Ramses, and by their foster daughter, Nefret Forth, an independent and wealthy young woman who loves excavating and also loves the clinic she has established to provide medical care to Egyptian prostitutes.David Todros, grandson of the Emersons' late reis Abdullah, is about to marry their niece - daughter of Radcliffe Emerson's brother, Walter - as the story opens. Just before the wedding, the Emersons are offered a forged artifact that the seller claims was sold to him as being from Abdullah's antiquities collection. The supposed inheritor of that collection (which does not exist) is David Todros. The Emersons choose to keep this from David, believing they are doing him a kindness by giving him an untroubled wedding and honeymoon. But as they settle into their chosen dig site in Egypt, they realize that more is going on; and that not only David's reputation, but their own lives, are in danger.I've been eager, as I have read through this long running series, to see how the romantic feelings of Ramses Emerson toward the clearly oblivious Nefret Forth would play out. I never imagined what the author would do with that relationship in this book! It certainly makes for a riveting read, because I finished the novel in two days - and then I had to dive straight into the next installment.

If you haven't read any of the series this tale is darker and more dramatic than the usual \\"happy go lucky, oops, we're in big trouble again\\", archeological adventures of the Emerson family. The love story that weaves through the tale is very gothic. The dangers are larger and more sinister. The villains are not the usual greedy, dumb crooks, they are evil people filled with malice and this gives the story a more epic feeling.

The occasion is one of joy for the young couples' circle of family and friends and a scandal for the rest of society. David is Egyptian, the grandson of Abdullah, the reis of Emerson's digs while Lia is English, Emerson's niece, daughter of his younger brother, Walter and in the years leading up to WWI mixed marriages simply did not happen.The family had also been reading the recently published exploits of another, not so highly respected, family member. Percy, Amelia's obnoxious nephew, had written an account of his recent adventures in Egypt, a volume that the family has found both aggravating and amusing.Once in Egypt though these events, compounded by faked artifacts, unrequited loves and the cause of Egyptian nationalism all conspire to once again keep Emerson from his work.This is the 11th in the AMELIA PEABODY series of comic-mystery novels centering on archeologist Radcliffe Emerson, his wife Amelia and their ever expanding family set in the early 1900's. As always with this series the mysteries take a secondary role to the (mis)adventures of the characters as related by Amelia and Ramses. The overall story arc of this series is much more a factor than is usual with series mysteries, so much so that a reader should definitely begin with CROCODILE ON THE SANDBANK and proceed in order.

How long had she and young Geoffrey been married?According to Dr. Willoughby Nefret went from wife to widow in the space of weeks. Nefret was, according to Amelia's reckoning, barely a month along, if that. Carefully reread the letters from collection B and you will see that an argument can certainly be made for the child's not being Geoffrey's.If this was indeed the case and the father was Ramses it is hardly surprising that Nefret's reaction seemed so over the top. For a woman of Nefret's scruples the idea of carrying the child of the sort of male creature who creates and then leaves a baby to a life of misery and degradation might easily lead to a reckless, and mistaken course of action.Aside from that plotline I am happy to see that with the advent of little Sennia all of the talk about equality is now being lived up to. It is all very well to have dark, handsome men as heroes of novels, but why do the women have to be so everlasting blonde and blue eyed to be considered beautiful? As a dark haired and dark eyed woman I feel that it is a legitimate question.Now I hope that Sennia will be allowed to grow up to be as much of a beauty as Nefret is purported to be. It would be rather dampening to make her the gutsy, ugly duckling as it would only perpetuate the received prejudices about feminine grace and beauty being reserved for the whitest races. Equality is as equality does."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"This book was great. A real page turner. It definutly left you wanting the next book though. I have read every book so far in this series and love how the charecters have evolved over time. The only thing is I did not like one of the actions perpatrated by Nefret. We will see what it leads to in the next instalment of the series. The story very interesting and I have recomended this book to all my friends. Hope you enjoy the book as much as i have."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I have been an ardent admirer of Ms. Peters and the Amilia Peabody series from inception. This last effort, Falcon at the Portal captures all of the excitement of her previous Peabosy/Emerson novels. Exciting archaeological expedition, curses, mysterious forged antiquities and all of her compelling characters united in an effort to clear youg David Todros's name!. What I found difficult to imagine is why she elected to venture in the negative direction with regards to the character of Nefret Forth. Until now she has proven to be made of heavier metal than shown here, and while I'd admit that she has been head strong, emotional and impulsive in her past, she has never been self destructive nor behaved stereotypically of a woman of 1911. We shall have to await the next saga to see if her phoenix is capabale to rise from the ashes. Ms. Peters will have a difficult time correcting this one."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Do we have to wait another year for the sequel? There are too many unanswered questions in this one, could also do with more humor. The novel is definitely worth a read! Hopefully all will be well with Nefret and Ramses and we will see more of the Peabody-Emerson dialogue in the next one."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I maintained a high level of interest reading all of the Peabody series, but 'Falcon at the Portal' kept me totally riveted to my reading seat after The Ramses-Nefret MOMENT. The rest of the pages flew by in my restless hands. I cannot wait for the next installment."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I have to say that Falcon at the Portal might be one of the best books in this series. Besides having suspense and excitement at every turn, it was also an emotional rollercoaster!The new developments in the relationship between Nefret and Ramses...well,I was stuck to my chair! Readers have watched Ramses grow, and I believe that it is in this book that he really becomes a man by taking on the responsibility of Sennia. This new addition as well as the the possibility that Ramses has found a kitten to love as he did Bastet, could make for some tender moments in the future books that might help take the edge off what I am sure is going to be a dramatic novel. I am eagerly awaiting the next installment. Thank you, Barbara, for writing such a wonderful series!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I've read and throughly enjoyed every Elizabeth Peters' Amelia Peabody Series Books, from the first one to the falcon at the Portal, and anxiously await the next volume in this series. I particularly love the Spirited, and Independent Amelia, her bravado in trying to keep a handle on her wayward family is truly outstanding.Not to mention the most enjoyable background of early 1800 Egypt and the Historical Finds. I hope Elizabeth Peters never tires of writing this wonderful series and continues to develop these full of life characters, whom we've all come to know so well and love. Elizabeth Peters is a talented writer, whom I hope continues this series for many more volumes...I will never tire of reading these over and over again! I can't wait for the next volume so please Ms. Peters Hurry!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I don't often buy mysteries, my usual fictional tastes run to intriguing historical fiction like &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; or &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot;. But I've heard so much about the Amelia Peabody books that I had to give one a try, and so I got a copy of Falcon at the Portal. Gee whiz are they all like this ? I thought they were sort of an entertaining romp, that the style was rather light. Ouch, this novel hurt. It was well-done, but my goodness, what was the point of so much heartache ?"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"When I finally got my hands on The Falcon At The Portal, I felt the familiar rise of Petersonian fever. I let the house go hang, sent the children out to play in the traffic, and immersed myself in the delights of Amelia Peabody and company. What followed was satisfying and surprising. Unlike most mysteries, the latest offerings in this series seem to be more character driven than story driven. The relationships among some of the main characters have become excruciatingly complicated, but in ways I never could have imagined after reading the preceeding book. Peters generates considerable heat between Ramses and Nefret. The passionate, loving and devoted marriage of Amelia and Emerson remains comfortingly central to the action. A crucial new character is introduced, cousin Percy is resurrected, and Abdullah is mourned on every page. The mystery is tidily wrapped up at the end of the book, but personal loose ends are left floating everywhere. If Ms. Peters insists on writing cliff-hangers, it is my fervent hope that she is eating properly, getting regular check-ups, and looking both ways before she crosses the street! I eagerly await the next installment."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"In Falcon at the Portal, Elizabeth Peters goes far more deeply than ever before into the emotional lives of all of her characters. From the lovely evocative dreams that Amelia has of Abdullah, to the sheer passion that possesses Ramses, Peters lets us see and feel with her characters more surely than ever before, while not losing a jot of the usual madness that surrounds the Emersons every season - forged antiquities, doubts being cast on family members, and more than a few completely unexpected plot twists, turns and in fact revolutions! Brilliant writing, great fun, and deeper (and, yes, darker) than most of the series, this is a *terrific* book, and I await the next in happy anticipation. Peters is a splendid writer, long may she wave!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I adore the Amelia Peabody novels because they are so unlike any other mystery series. First, the bulk of the time is spent on archeological digs pursuing important scholarship in Egypt. Second, the characters are so outrageously original (Amelia is an early 20th century Wonder Woman who passionately craves her husband, Emerson is a steam boiler always about to go off on some emotional tangent or other, Ramses is a mixture of Oliver Twist and Super Boy, Nefret is Elizabeth Taylor in Dr. Florence Nightingale's role -- you get the idea). Third, the plots always involve lots of local history and interesting perspectives on manners of the period. Fourth, the whole crew is always off on some unexpected adventure or other. I often wonder how any of them ever sleep, between their day-time adventures and the clandestine night-time ones. It makes me tired just to think about them.The characters have really grown on me. This is one of the few series I have read where the characters are probably the main attraction. The Nero Wolfe books by Rex Stout have a similar attraction for me.In this book (as in the recent ones), the action revolves around tensions among the family members. Clearly, everyone wants more psycholoical space, but the others good-heartedly want to look out for each other and impinge on that space. One would think these characters had read Freud.Two characteristics of this book bothered me. It seems like the loose ends were greater in the family drama at the end of the book than they were at the beginning. I don't mind if Elizabeth Peters is going to do that, but she should bring out two books at the same time when she does so we are not left waiting so long for the resolution.My other concern is that I think that Peters cheated a bit with Nefret's actions and emotions in this one. The Nefret I had built up in my mind (child goddess of the desert who captivates all and sundry who come within her reach) disappeared in this novel, and seemed to be replaced by an imposter. I think that Peters owes it to us to close this gap with one of her upcoming books.If you have not read any of the Amelia Peabody mysteries, DO NOT START WITH THIS ONE! Most of the joy of these novels comes in the build-up of the characters from one book to the next. While you need not read them all, you certainly should work through them chronologically from the earliest publication date. Have a great time when you do, and keep your tongue firmly in your cheek!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I NEVER buy hardcover books. However, I read the reviews and as a lover of E.Peters I had to read the book for myself. I bought it intending to read it and return it for a refund....needless to say, I changed my mind and will have to keep the book. I have always rooted for Nefret and Ramses, and this book made me want them together even more. I agree that Nefret acted out of character, but I trust that these actions will be explained in the next book, which I am eagerly awaiting. I loved the addition of Sennia despite the trouble she caused. To those who called the book melodramatic: what did you expect from the Peabody-Emersons? The melodrama is what I love about this series. Still, this novel is more a tragedy (or as much a tragedy as an Amelia mystery can be), because it ends on such a low point. I thought the mention of Nefret's dreams was intriguing, and I am hoping they will be mentioned more in the next book. I also liked Amelia's Abdulla dreams; he was a wonderful character and I am glad that he hasn't entirely disappeared from the series. I can't wait for the next! I will probably have to buy that one in hardcover, too. Luckily they are worth the money!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"My husband and I are avid &quot;groupies&quot; of Amelia Peabody &amp; Company. The Falcon at the Portal was by far our favorite. Yes we were disappointed that Nefret was not destined for Rameses in the true Victorian sense (after all Amelia thrives on Victorian values does she not?). And yes we were disappointed when the book ended with no hint of Nefret's future...BUT this book of all the others drew us in so closely to what was taking place that we were emotionally tied to the two and felt true loss for Ramses...now that's what a good story should do! At the conclusion, although we were left hanging, we snapped out of it and ran to the computer to see if a sequel was available. What a relief it was to see that, yes indeed, Ms. Peters had been true to her readers and provided us with yet an another opportunity to follow along with her and her family as they mature through yet another episode of life. This has made her characters much more real and endearing to us. Bravo for Ms. Peters! We are looking forward to walking through the rest of lives with Amelia, Emerson and the rest of Amelia Peabody and Company!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Seriously, I adore Ramses. This is a decent addition to the series, but not the best. If you can't stand cliffhanger endings, wait until the next one comes out before reading &quot;The Falcon at the Portal.&quot; It might as well be called &quot;What Nefret Did.&quot; Up to now it's been clear that she is impetuous, but never stupid. I don't know what to think about her anymore. Amelia was less than her usual terrifyingly astute self. I did like seeing David happy with Lia, but-- come on Ms. Peters, did Ramses deserve what he got? Sennia's a fabulous addition, and I can't wait to see what she becomes.I borrowed this from the library, finished it at 2 A.M., and couldn't sleep the whole night. Really, the ending can be fatal to avid readers of this series. Be warned."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"It is the mark of a tremendous author that so many people feel that the Emersons are actually a part of their extended family. I feel as if I have watched Ramses and Nefret grow up and that Amelia and Radcliff are members of my family. I still mourn the loss of the cat, Bastet, every time I read another of the Emerson adventures. This is one outstanding series.Even though this is a real page-turner, the lack of an ending leaves much to be desired. New readers of this series will recognize it as a very good read; it is those of us who have allowed the Emersons into our hearts that are upset by the current events.This book was not as humorous as Peters' past books, and Nefret's personality certainly wasn't the same as the Nefret of past books. I am disappointed in Nefret's actions - I thought she was better than some stereotypical Victorian female.I also was not really thrilled with the warning Amelia received in her dream at the end of the book.Honestly, can't we just get Ramses and Nefret together and let them carry on the fine Emerson tradition of murder and mayhem combined with archeological digs and humor? Ye Gads!I am willing to bet that the next book in this series (I certainly hope it will come out very soon) will be a big-seller. There are too many of us who want to know what happens next.My recommendation is to wait until the next book comes out, then buy this one and read both of them then. I certainly wish I had waited."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I read the first Amelia book when I was about 12 and have grown up with Ramses and the rest. I have waited patiently for each installment, veiwing it as a reward for surviving each school year. But this next installment cannot come too soon! This book has a very painful twist, but it just makes the book better. I bought this book in hardcover the first day it came out, and was reading it in the laundrymat when I came to the Moment (you know what I'm talking about), I lept up from my chair and started squealing hysterically. The people around me were rather alarmed, but that's just an example of how Elizabeth's Peters incredible writing affects devoted readers. This book was worthy of Amelia Peabody, and it filled in some vital parts of the character's personalities. But PLEASE, Ms.Peters, if there is anyway He Shall Thunder in the Sky could come out early...well, it would make a great graduation present, from me to me."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"So far, I have loved each and every Amelia Peabody Mystery. I am especially enjoying the growth of Ramses as a character in the forefront of the series. I would recommend these to anyone. If you love mysteries and have even a passing interest in exotic locales, these books are definitely for you."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Like most of the other reviewers, I was entranced by the story in this book, happy for David and Lia, frustrated for Ramses and Nefret...but it held together very well. Ms. Peters has developed these characters a great deal since my first reading years and years ago, and has incorporated the political realities in a very real way.As I said in my review of \\"The Ape...\\" I would love to give 4.75 stars but Amazon doesn't have the facilities for that.Read it, enjoy it, and by all means, have fun with it!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I have read all of the books in the Amelia Peabody series and I will have to say that the Falcon at the Portal is one of Elizabeth Peters best. The suspense will keep you guessing until the very end and a few big plot twists will even surprise those readers who think they &quot;know&quot; the caracters. I hope Ms. Peters has already started on the next book.If you have never read any of the books within the series, I would suggest that you start with the frist book (Crocodile on the Sandbank) and work your way through all of the books in the series. The caracters are the same, and as time goes by, each volume begins to paint a picture for the reader. The picture is not only of richly developed characters but also of an exciting period in history."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I felt betrayed by my favorite author when I picked up this book. Instead of humor and whimsy, there was melodrama and tragedy. Yuck! It was like getting a kick in the stomach! I won't get the next book until I check it out thoroughly. I have read all of the Barbara Michaels/Elizabeth Peters books, and I must say, I intensely dislike this one and hope it's an isolated example. I have never been so disappointed by a book!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I couldn't wait to read this book. I was certain that the romance between Ramses and Nefret would be put to rest one way or the other. Instead, I am more frustrated than ever. Why oh why was Nefret's character turned into the simplest and weakest of silly young women. For her to run away like she did and then to marry Geoffrey was unbelievable. Why all the tragedy? Why still the premonition of more heartbreak to come? Why was Nefret's character destroyed? Too many questions are left unanswered. Bridge novel or not, the readers are left unfairly hanging. Instead of the book reading like the familiar Peabody novel it read like a movie of the week book. I was for the most part dissapointed."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Ms. Peters' most brilliant to date. Mixture of the comedy we've come to expect from Amelia Peabody and some darker strains, beautifully handled and juxtaposed. The children are growing up and are turning into fascinating characters in their own right. The love interest is exactly the right touch, and the ending keeps me hungry for the next installment. Well done, Dr. Mertz!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I have LOVED the Amelia books and have been a loyal Elizabeth Peters fan ever since I read Crocodile on the Sandbank. Falcon at the Portal was a big disappointment as it did not have the same flow and flavor of earlier works, lacked the same crisp wit and the way she turned Nefret into an insipid character with bad judgment was not worthy of how she allowed Ramses to develop. One thing I've always liked about the Peabody books was being able to read and reread them to relive the story. With Falcon, I stop shortly after page 216. Although I look forward to having this resolved in the next book, I will be holding off reading it until I am assured of a better ending!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Well, I have to say that I was a little disapointed with this one. I have read every single Amelia book, and compared to all the rest-except Deeds of the Disturber, that was really bad-this book just wasn't that good.First of all, the archeology wasn't as interesting as usual, in fact, it wasn't even a major part of the story. Second, the mystery wasn't good at all. I knew who it was two chapters after meeting the main bad guy. But, I did like the whole Ramses-Nefret deal, although I'm totally disgusted by Nefret, she's being way too melodramatic, and it's not good at all because she used to be one of my favorite characters, but now I just want to tell her to stop messing with his mind. Anyway. I disagree with everyone who thinks the &quot;children&quot; are annoying, because they have breathed new life into the books, especially Ramses-I love him!-and I'd like to humbly ask Ms. Peters to please KEEP PUTTING THEM IN! That quartet is the main reason I-and everyone else I know-read them! Anyway, even though this wasn't my favorite, I'n DYING to read the next one, and I hope that Ms. Peters will continue the series for a long time."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I was very disappointed and frustrated with The Falcon At The Portal. I have loved this entire series up until now. The tension and possibility of a love relationship between Ramses and Nefret has been drawn out way too long. In this book I hoped that we would finally see a happy conclusion to this part of the story, but instead we are thrown, unexpectedly, into a huge tragedy. I was so angry about the series of events that drew Ramses and Nefret apart that I couldn't even finish the book. I flipped back through the book to see who the &quot;villian&quot; was, and promptly threw the book on the shelf. I feel that we have been drawn along in the story of Ramses and Nefret far too long to have something like this thrown at us! I read these books for enjoyment and relaxation at the end of a stressful day. This book certainly didn't do anything for my stress! My advice to anyone who is reading the series.....skip this one!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I know that there is no guarantee of a happy ending in real life. However, I had been lulled into expecting a happy ending in Elizabeth Peters' Amelia Peabody series (at least for the main characters). Wrong again. What was even worse, was that the behavior that brought about the unhappiness was completely contradictory to all previous character development. (I'm not being specific so as not to give away the story.) I was bitterly disappointed in this installment.On the positive side, I get the impression that the author may be planning a spin off series with Ramses as the lead. An undercover agent of the police force?"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"This was a book I read years ago, but it was presented as new. I was very disappointed"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Elizabeth Peters was born and brought up in Illinois and earned her Ph.D. in Egyptology from the University of Chicago's famed Oriental Institute. Peters was named Grand Master at the inaugural Anthony Awards in 1986 and Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America at the Edgar Awards in 1998. She lives in a historic farmhouse in western Maryland.The Amelia Peabody books may or may not be an acquired taste, personally I love them. They are set in Victorian times when there were still very strict rules of etiquette and polite behaviour was the norm. Although most of the books are set in Egypt, in the desert under very trying conditions and extremely hot weather the \`English' way of life was still expected to be adhered to, sometimes with quite hilarious consequences.Amelia Peabody is Elizabeth Peters' best loved and brilliant creation, a thoroughly Victorian feminist who takes the stuffy world of archaeology by storm with her no nonsense dress sense and forthright opinions.In this book Amelia has more trouble than she knows what to do with, but in this case it is family trouble. Her niece's new Egyptian husband David, stands accused of forging priceless antiquities and though he is definitely skillful enough to do this Emerson have known him long enough to know that he simply cannot be guilty of such a crime. Meanwhile Amelia's nephew, a detestable young man if ever there was one, begins an amorous pursuit of Nefret, Amelia's son Ramses wife."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I enjoyed this book. I thought it was interesting. I liked the way she combined the story with the political unrest in that era. Having said that, I didn't like Nefret marrying Geoffrey. I thought she was smarter than that. I hope all is made right in the next book. Other than that, Good Job!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Masterful, as always. I agree with previous comments about Amelia's lack of perception in this one. But stuff close to home is sometimes easiest to misread. The book starts a bit slow, but events towards the end packed an emotional wallop like being run over by a steam roller for those of us who love the characters. And don't be too hard on Nefret. Yes, my first reaction was that she's acting like a twit, but who knows? Maybe she realized her mistake immediately and decided to punish herself, not Rameses, by her subsequent actions. Only Ms. Peters knows for sure at this point. And if she has any affection for her loyal readers, she won't make us wait another year for resolution. I don't agree that resolution will spoil the books by detracting from tension in the narrative. Humor has always been the best part of the series. She's created a truly stellar ensemble cast that makes you laugh by virtue of the interplay of their personalities and quirks. If that quality is maintained, the series could live on forever without tarnishing."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"To those reviewers critical of changes in the behaviour of Amelia and Emerson, it should be noted that 20 or so years have gone by since they met in Crocodile on the Sandbank. It's a bit unreasonable to expect them to remain exactly the same. As for Ramses and Nefret, yes, the Falcon at the Portal is frustrating, but I suspect that E. Peters knows what she's doing. Look at her Vicky Bliss series. The romantic tension between Vicky and John went on for four novels and was a vital part of their quality. But in Night Train to Memphis they resolved all their misunderstandings, declared mutual love etc. and there hasn't been a Vicky Bliss novel since 1994. It's likely that E. Peters can't think of anything really interesting to do with John and Vicky now. Think about it. The Amelia/Sethos tension kept the first several Amelia Peabody novels really alive and I think that the Ramses/Nefret situation has made the three most recent novels interesting in a similar way. Things shouldn't be all neatly wrapped up at the end of every book; not if they are part of a series. All in all, I really enjoyed The Falcon at the Portal and I look forward to the next in the series -Egyptian nationalism is on the rise, Percy is lurking about somewhere, the First World War is looming."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"In 'The Hippopotamus Pool' Amelia's dream vision portents danger and mystery to come to her clan of children, and it has arrived with a vengeance! I fell in love with the story of Ramses and Nefret some books ago, and this book stole my heart. It weighed on my thoughts long after I had finished, and I can only hope that Ms. Peters does not keep us in suspense indefinately. I must disagree with those who deride Nefret's actions-- while certainly painful, I believe they belie her passionate temperment and the depth of her emotions. As a younger reader, I am overjoyed to see more action involving the &quot;children&quot; of the Peabody-Emerson family...Thank you Ms. Peters!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"This is the most suspenseful Amelia Peabody since Crocodile on the Sandbank.

Like many other readers, I was disappointed in Nefret's actions, but it was one of the reasons I couldn't put the book down. I kept waiting for Ramses and Nefret to be reconciled-at least partially reconciled-a little reconciled? The torture is too much- I want them together."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I wait eagerly for books by Ms Michaels/Peters who has been my favorite author since Ammie Come Home in 1970. In Falcon at the Portal, Ms Peters continues to deliver the unexpected twists and turns which characterize her Amelia Peabody series. As the book nears its climax, the reader fully expects the Ramses/Nefret conflict to be solved as they declare their passion for each other. Nefret acts uncharacteristically Victorian as Ramses is caught in a net of misinformation and deliberate deception, thus setting the stage for at least one more book in this popular series. Famous characters tumble in and out of Amelia's drawing room and, as always, her quick wit and her passion for Emerson make for lively reading."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I finished this book this morning and I have been feeling frustrated about it all day.

Peter's readers have long enjoyed the tantrums of this wealthy and eccentric English family which are grafted onto a smattering of Egyptology and a simple (gentlemanly) murder mystery where the bad guys expire or vanish after a longwinded explanation of what they were doing. But this simple story line cannot carry the new complication of the sexual energy between Nefrit and Rames and the trouble it gets them into. The editors of this series needed to give Peters some needed advice about plots. I suspect Peters was just trying to wring out one more book and to increase the emotional energy, but she has damaged the entire series (just read this one and then try to read the earlier ones). No doubt she will write the next book to solve this problem between Nefrit and Rames but she would have been better off to have killed off Amelia and Emerson and let Rames and Nefrit take their place as the next generation of eccentric and trantrum loving Brits that solve mysteries (and were perhaps present when Carter discovers that marvelous tomb).

Never having been a great fan of Ramses to begin with, I would really like to see Ms. Peters return to one of her other character series (Jacquelyn, Vicky) for a book or two and then straighten the Emersons out."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Amelia and Emerson are two of the most entertaining characters in the mystery world. Peters has done a great job in the series by introducing a new generation and letting both generations grow up. I applaud her deterity in making Ramses and Nefret as interesting as they are, and by adding a new, much younger character, Sennia, who can continue the series into the 20th century.That said, I was heartbroken at what the plot imposed on Ramses in this story. While much has been made of Nefret's impetuosity of character, the books have always shown her to regain her composure in a relatively brief time. It was out of character for her to lose control over the extended period of time it would take to hare off and marry someone else. I thought it was a very interesting departure from the expected, just from a technical writing standpoint, but overall unsatisfactory as it was a false note for Nefret. Ramses has been an outstanding character from the get-go, and his relationship with his parents has grown up, as has he. In prior books he has not always believed in his parents' love for him; it was wonderful to see that they believed in him when Nefret did not. However, the emotional pain he was put through spoiled the book for me (I scarcely paid any attention to the plot after page 245, wanting to see this great wrong righted). Stringing the Ramses/Nefret situation out in prior books added the right note of romantic suspense (thank goodness Peters didn't go through another round of the jealousy game with Amelia and Emerson!), but Nefret's marriage to Geoffrey is a stunningly out-of-tune touch from a usually highly skilled composer.I hope that this matter is resolved satisfactorily, through the bravery and good sense of Ramses and Nefret, in the next book. (And with lots of romantic details; poor Ramses deserves it!)"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I've awaited the publication of this latest installment of the Amelia series with intense anticipation and pleasure. I love the humor and history of the series, love the characters and their quirky interactions and verbal sparring, and am, frankly, besotted with Ramses. Through the series, I've watched the lad grow from being a precociously independent, eccentric and original child character into an intense, complex, intriguing and magnetic young hero. The emotional impact of Falcon at the Portal is stunning and its affect especially on Ramses is hard to take. I read it in mere hours and once finished could not stop thinking about what had happened. I had not expected such heart-rending, hand-wringing, lip-biting suspense and pathos in a series that I had come to think of as a delightfully light and charming read. The charm is still there, though the lightness is not so much in evidence. I've always held out hopes that Nefret would evolve into a much more intriguingly eccentric character given her exotic background and the story would play off the juxtaposition of her unconventional upbringing and her present status as a rich, young Englishwoman. But, alas, she has always fallen just short of what I had hoped. In this story, she even takes a few steps backward by making a reckless and drastic decision that did not ring true to the character I thought I knew. I hold out the hope that the very talented Ms. Peters knows what she's doing with this wonderful series and these much-loved characters and will surprise and please us with plot twists and turns in the next book (let it come soon!) that satisfyingly illuminate and explain why Nefret acted as she did. Even with my few quibbles about motivation, I loved the story and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Nefret is such a silly goose. Why did she go off and get married? I think Elizabeth Peters should show more of her feelings about things. I liked how she showed some of her feelings but I want more of them shown. She better hurry up and write that new book I can't kept waiting in supense any longer. Also I think she should wrap everything up in her next one or two books."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"The amazing and bullheaded Amelia is back. But of even greater significance, so is her son Ramses and ward Nefret. As usual this book entertains the reader, but there is even more intrigue when Ramses is getting in on the act. If you loved the other Peabody mysteries, this one will have you enthralled as well."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Falcon at the Portal was a new type of Amelia Peabody book for me. Very different to others in the series I have read, I did feel somewhat let down by it. The mystery storyline we have come to expect is, in this book, only incidental. Family drama is what Peters has given us instead. In the hands of a less accomplished writer, I would be tempted to call it melodrama. The difficulty for me is, The Deeds of the Disturber is the most recent book in the series I have read before this; so what may make sense in the context of the whole series came out of nowhere for me. The two-star rating is partly because, as well written as Falcon at the Portal is, this book is not what I've come to expect either from Peters or from her series.The book opens with the wedding of Amelia's niece Lia to Egyptian family friend David - and the revelation that David is suspected of trading in stolen antiquities. This gives the whole Emerson clan a new mystery to look into when they travel to Egypt for their annual archaeological dig. The usual roll-call of old friends and new characters appears once the action shifts to Egypt - and one of them ends up dead at the bottom of the shaft in the pyramid the Emersons are excavating. So between the need to clear David's name and the need to explain the fate of the murder victim, there is a great deal of scope for Amelia's usual feisty investigations, backed up by Emerson's temperamental but kind-hearted assistance.But sadly, Peters provides little of this. The bulk of the book is actually taken up with the romantic drama between Ramses, Amelia and Emerson's son, and Nefret, their ward. Ramses has loved Nefret for years, and seems finally to have won her heart - until circumstances intervene, when Nefret repudiates Ramses and takes precipitate action, the repercussions of which will be felt for a long time to come.I did not like the impulsive and unreasonable Nefret. I have never liked Ramses. Peters' treatment of him comes dangerously close to hagiography, and I find all his noble suffering tedious. That said, I might feel differently had I read the other books that introduce Nefret and deal with Ramses as an adult.I read the Amelia Peabody series for mystery and adventure, and especially for Amelia and Emerson. I'm not really interested in their children and all their carryings-on, and so I would be very glad for the series to return to its original focus. However, this is a matter of personal taste. Others like different things from the series, and Falcon at the Portal is undeniably a well-written book, with some powerful scenes.So if you want a family drama with all your favourite characters, you may be satisfied by this - but you will have to read Thunder in the Sky afterwards. If you want a proper mystery novel, you should perhaps look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I loved this book. This book has everything. It keeps you interested from the beginning to the end. It all starts with the Emerson's usual trip to Egypt. David and Lia have just gotten married and Ramses is in love with Nefret but she does not know this. Someone is framing David. Quite a few forgeries have showed up tracing back to David. The Emersons are certain that it is not David who did these. Mean while a young American girl seems to have fallen head over heels for Ramses. She is doing her best to win his heart over. Time goes by fast and soon it is Christmas. Ramses recieves a gift from the American girl. The next day at the site the emersons are working at her body is found. Ramses in blame of her death. To find out what happens buy this book. I assure you, you will love it."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Excellent and full blown story line with interest inspiring differences from previous novels by Dr Peters. The next book is eagerly awaited and required reading to close the circle on the actions involving adult characters I've known since their childhood."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Long time fans of Amelia Peabody are destined for disappointment in this installment. Not even the pleasure of seeing our old friends again can make up for the fact that Peters has come close to destroying this series. This plot is so labored and forced it creaks and groans at every turn. It is really painful to watch Peters struggle to make it work (it doesn't) by making everybody (even Amelia!) behave as stupidly and unnaturally as possible, and by filling most of the first half of the book with dull and plodding explanation.It seems obvious that this book exists only as a bridge and set-up for the next one. (Frankly, I had expected Peters to treat her fans better than that.) Its motivation relies heavily on flashbacks to unlikely events that occurred years before the time of this book, but after the conclusion of the previous one. Whole chapters are spent on a vain attempt to turn Ramses into Lawrence of Arabia (who appears as a dinner guest in this book). Nefret's behavior is a predictable, trite, clich&eacute;, and worst of all Amelia and Emerson have lost all of their detective abilities and require help from the Vandergelts to make the most obvious deductions. Characteristic Peters humor is almost nowhere to be found.A sad and sticky demise for a once delightful series."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I'm sorry to say I found this book manipulative and depressing. The characters I've grown to know and care about are flattened into brittle cariacatures of themselves, behaving rigidly according to the dictates of a forced and melodramatic plot. The identity of the villain is obvious early on, making everyone's blindness to it quite tiresome, and no real attempt is made to explore him; he's just a prop. Instead, we get to watch the younger Emersons behave like emotionally crippled morons while their elders fail to notice anything amiss.Halfway through the book, one of three voices that have been telling the first-person tale suddenly vanishes, leaving the reader completely in the dark as to that character's bizarre actions from that moment forward to the unpleasant ending, which is clearly NOT an ending--merely a cliff-hanger designed to make us eager for the next installment.Where is the freshness, the delightful surprise of getting to know interesting and fully-fleshed-out characters, of the earlier Peabody mysteries? My dear Ms. Peters, it was never the crimes or their solutions that drew us -- and you have never before resorted to keeping us on the hook from one book to the next."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I am extremely disappointed in the turn this series has taken. My enjoyment in the previous books came from the wit and the adventure and the fun. It's gotten too serious. If the previous books had been &quot;serious&quot; I would never have continued reading the series. I could always count on a Peabody mystery for a good laugh and sense of fun and excitement. These last few have left me feeling rather depressed. After reading the past two installments I can't even go back and reread the earlier Peabody novels with the same enjoyment I had before. It's ruined. Many reviewers say that Amelia and Emerson are acting their age...well, one can get older without getting dull and serious...many people do - in real life as well as fiction. Perhaps Ms. Peters is mellowing with age and losing her spunk. The introduction of Nefret marked the decline in this series. Ramses (always my favorite character) has lost his charm. Amelia has lost her quick wit and spunk. I feel betrayed. It feels like a kick in the stomach. I will purchase and read the next in the series but if it continues in this same melodramatic vein (which, by the way, is what Emerson always detested) it will be the last I read."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Elizabeth Peters is my long-time favorite author. I have read this particular book, Falcon at the Portal, in hardcover several times, and loved it. It is one of my favorites. This is the first time I read it in e-book form. Had I not first read it in print I would have had difficulty with the text. There are so many transcription errors, typographical errors, missing phrases, misplaced and missing punctuation. The transcription appears to have been done with no proofing whatsoever. The name 'Selim' regularly appears as 'Scum' (!), 'r n' appears as 'm', and the like, to say nothing of phrases missing altogether.Peters is the BEST - but do not buy this ebook unless the errors are corrected. I am sending a letter to the publisher to that effect. To be fair, this is the only Amelia Peabody ebook so far to be so terribly full of errors. The rest look good."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I think this was a great book. Nefret did seem to be acting oddly toward the end (besides being depressed), but she had reasons. Now I'm just afraid Elizabeth Peters will die or have a horrible stroke before finishing the next book and leave us all depressed and curious. I like Nefret and Ramses and David better than Amelia and Emerson. Why complain about having them in the book more?"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I am very surprised at the negative comments made about this volume of the Amelia series. Quite frankly, I admire the fact that, instead of sticking to a &quot;formula&quot; for the Amelia books, Ms. Peters actually allows her characters to grow and develope -- just like real people. And just like real people, these characters do things that are unexpected and, sometimes, unflattering. Personally, I find the characters fascinating because I know that I don't yet truly know and understand them. The most interesting people are those who don't always act predictably. I, for one, hope that Ms. Peters continues to surprise us in the Amelia books -- it is what keeps me constantly anticipating the next installment."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"This is actually an amazing book. It continues the adventures of the Peabody-Emerson clan, which has just become exponentially larger with the addition of David Todros' family after David's marriage to Lia Emerson. Ah, but things are never that simple in this world, and someone soon accuses the honeymooning David of forgeries. Needless to say, Amelia, Emerson, Ramses, and Nefret are hot on the case. However, things never go easily for this clan, with Nefret and Ramses' budding relationship and the evil Percy Peabody getting in the way of the investigation and the excavation (much to Emerson's dismay).I know many people had problems with everyone's favorite girl from the oasis. However shocking this was, it was not all that surprising to me. Nefret is a girl bound to act on instinct and then regret later. So she doesn't make some of the best choices, but then we know everything she doesn't, eh?Overall, this book was fantastic and just builds up the tensions that will all come to a head in the the emotionally charged &quot;He Shall Thunder In the Sky,&quot; my favorite Peabody novel to date. Another great addition to a magnificent series of books..."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I'm not sure how she does it, but Ms. Peters/Michaels has created yet another sparkling addition to the Amelia Peabody series. The action is swift, the dialogue witty, and the mystery intriguing. Oh, yeah, and there's the Ramases and Nefret thing. Acctualy, I believe that one of the promos for HE SHALL THUNDER IN THE SKY was &quot;Nefret and Ramases; will they or won't they?&quot; How appropriate! But I can't say anything more; you shall just have to purchase the book and line Ms. Peters's pockets with more well deserved green backs."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Both my mother and I have read about Amelia's adventures since the very beginning. When reading this book during vacation last summer(each installment marks the true beginning of summer for us), we were both surprised and slightly disappointed at the turn of events, especially those concerning Nefret. As such a strong-willed young woman, it was quite shocking to see her seemingly fall apart at the seams and become weak...After re-reading the book, however, we both decided that Elizabeth Peters was not &quot;copping out&quot; to a soap opera format as some readers feel...rather, she was giving us yet another of her twists that usually occur within one story. This time she's just letting it go to the next installment.True die-hard fans of Amelia Peabody and her family will reserve judgment until the next book...happily, we will not have to wait much longer :-)"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I have just recently become a fan of the Amelia Peabody series, but I am definitely hooked. I purchased The Falcon at the Portal almost the day it came out in hardcover. This installment kept my attention as always. Amelia never fails to make me laugh out loud, and Ramses is quickly becoming my favorite literary character. This series has made me laugh and made me cry, and I can't wait for Ms. Peters to write the next book."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"As usual, another wonderful book, and gripping until the very end. The central characters are developing, and changing with age. I like that Amelia is showing some frailties, that Nefret isn't perfect, that Ramses is less wooden, that Emerson's character is appearing to gain some depth (the one criticism I've ever had of Ms. Peters' series of thoroughly enjoyable, escapist literature is Emerson's lack of dimension), and that the emphasis is gradually shifting to the younger folks (but please don't allow Amelia to become any less the strong heroine in her best years!) The only downside to this wonderful read is that there is unfortunately not even the semblence of a conclusion to the dilemnas of the Emersons this time around. This I wouldn't mind, if I knew that Ms. Peters had a follow-up novel ready to go so we know that Ramses and Nefret will be OK in the end!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I found this book extremely challenging to the emotive senses. Peters has masterfully developed her characters, sculpting them with precision. Nofrets impetuous actions live up to her character description, her world was shaken, thus she reacted. I have too much respect for Peters to distrust her. The book was fantastic, and I cannot wait for the next (and last) of the four-book inner series, He Shall Thunder in the Sky. I wish I could give it 6 stars."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I was so excited when I knew that I would have a new Peters book to take with me to the beach for the Fourth of July weekend. Her books have always epitomized great summer reading to me--witty, light yet well written, with plenty of suspense and romance. Plus, as an added bonus, they contain two of my favorite literary characters of all time--Ramses and Amelia. Imagine my shock as I read, not a light hearted adventure story, but as heart-wrenching and involving a drama as any I have read. This book is clearly a departure from the rest of the series, but I have to say I loved every minute of it. This is the deepest and the best of the series so far. The exploration of the deep love and understanding between Ramses and Amelia that was hinted at in the Ape that Weighs the Balance is explored more fully. In my opinion, this was a much overdue character development, and the best part of the book. I was always a little frustrated by Amelia's pretense at maternal indifference toward her son. She never fooled me for an instant, especially after she went into berserker mode in the Mummy Case but I was glad to finally have her admit openly her love and pride in Ramses.As for the other plot development, well, all I can say is that I hope that Nefret's silence through the last third of the book indicates that all is not what it seems with her inexplicable marriage to Geoffrey. Hopefully Peters will reveal new twists and turns that will make this character's appalling lack of judgment explainable, perhaps some particular trauma she suffered during her years in captivity. The hints sprinkled through the last two books, especially of Nefret's nightmares, indicates that perhaps Peters plans to explore something of what happened to Nefret during that time. I can only trust in Ms. Peter's , who has never let me down before, that she will not betray her characters by leaving unexplained such a strange character departure.My rating is conditional however--if it turns out that Nefret is really as much of a goop as she seems, I will retroactively remove a star from my review!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Up until now I have loved every one of the Amelia Peabody mysteries. They were clever, funny and upbeat, more comedic than dramatic. I found that the first half of this book was true to form but once Ramses and Nefret finally understood each other it took a definite turn for the worse. What I expected to be a light hearted book turned into a tragic, unbelievable drama. Nefret behaved completely out of the character that had previously been developed for her. I was very disappointed that a series I have always enjoyed reading for escapism should take such a harsh turn to reality. If I want to read about lovers separated by misunderstanding I will read biographies! I won't read another one in this series until and unless Elizabeth Peters returns this series to its roots."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"How could this happen? I have been a loyal follower to this series for a long time and then this? I have always loved Ramses and reading this book broke my heart over and over again. He deserves love and happiness too. I was completly shocked at how Nefret behaved in this book like some spoiled selfish brat. At some points in this depressing story I felt like crying or throwing the book up against the wall. After I finished the book I couldn't sleep at all, the cliff hanger left me excited for the next book but also sad because what this series has become. Hopefully the next book will be what many have come to expect from the Peabody Emerson gang, action, suspense, crime, togetherness, and most of all a happy ending."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"The Amelia Peabody mysteries are always a treat, and this is another satisfactory addition to the series. My sole criticisms are that the pace was unusually slow up to about the last quarter of the book, and I would have enjoyed a happier ending. Obviously, the ending of this book is meant to set the stage for the next book in the series, but a bit more positive closure in certain relationships would have been welcome."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I am a lover of the Amelia Peabody series. However I found this last book disapointing not only because The ending was not what I wanted. I think they we the readers need to hear Neferet's point of view as while as David and Lei. If we knew that it would be much better. On the plus side I can't wait for her next book to come out. I hope she picks the story up in switzerland, and that she keeps the faimly together."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I have loved Amelia and her parasol from the first book in the series, Crocodile on the Sandbank. However, the latest entry falls curiously flat. All the familiar characters are present -- Emerson, Selim, Nefret, Ramses, David, etc. And there's an Egyptian mystery to be solved. But it never works the way it should. Changing from Peabody's first person to Manuscript H to Nefret's letters becomes tiresome. If Ramses and Nefret are to carry the series, let them tell the whole story, and allow Peabody to sit back. Or just let Peabody and her parasol take charge the way they should. I'm looking forward to the next book because there were too many loose ends in this one. And I hope the next installment returns to the quality of the earlier books."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"In 1911, Egyptology Professor Radcliffe Emerson is disappointed with his assignment. While other teams luxuriate amidst the fabulous Giza strip, he works at two losers in a remote area. Still, Radcliffe, his wife Amelia Peabody, and their usual entourage travel from England to the two pyramids he is to excavate.The seemingly dull dig takes several spins. As close friend David Todos marries their niece, his archeological reputation is being ruined as he is accused of selling forgeries. Amelia plans to rectify that problem without informing the happy groom that his credibility along the Nile has sunk beneath the surface. She plans to expose the real forger. However, while Amelia works that trick, accidents and murder threaten to destroy the Emerson dig as well as the two families close ties. Amelia knows she has a lot of work to do if she is to uncover the culprits and save her beloved extended family.The Amelia Peabody mysteries have been some of the best early twentieth century novels on the market during the past decade. The newest addition, THE FALCON AT THE PORTAL may be the top tale in the superb collection. Elizabeth Peters paints a multi-plotted story with much human emotion that cleverly ties into a wonderful work of historical fiction. Amelia and her clan remain an exciting brood, whose changes throughout the previous books appear genuine and augment the various stories. Already, highly regarded as an exemplary historical mystery series, this particular novel stands out as the best of a long run of excellent works.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I must admit that I have not read as many of the Amelia Peobody Mystery's as others, but I was very disappointed in the way this book moved along. I found it hard to discern the direction this book was taking as well as what the mystery was. I was disappointed in the ending and kind of sickened by it. Not that I don't think I have figured out what happened, but that was the only interesting part of this book. I was very disappointed to see that there were no happy endings. I hope her next book is much better...."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I eagerly picked up the book with the expectation of a good reading, and was sorely disappointed. I have read all the previous volumes, enjoying the light tone, the banter and the eccentricity of Amelia and Co. This last effort is stilted and artificial, with too much melodrama; it reads like a cheap soap opera. It seems like Ms. Peters has tried to increase the emotional content of her work, with the result of making the story unbelievable and unpalatable.E. Peters stories are enjoyable because they don't have the high pressure of a story &quot;a la Stephen King&quot;, and certainly a more pleasant athmoshpere. I agree with some of the other reviewers in considering this book a terrible faux-pas. Conan-Doyle had Holmes disappear in the waterfall...maybe Amelia should have been crushed within a pyramid?I am very sorry that I did not wait for the book to be in the library, but instead bought the hard-cover. For the next one, I'll wait until it will be on the shelves of our local branch."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"In her most recent Amelia Peabody books, including this one, the author has used an annoying literary device of breaking the momentum of the narrative to insert &quot;Manuscript&quot; and diary segments from other characters. Why she doesn't just spin the next generation of characters into another series, instead of diluting the otherwise still-alluring plot and setting, is a mystery. I bought this book, as all the others, in hardback. The next book will either be borrowed from a library or purchased at a paperback exchange, and my money will go for another more deserving new mystery writer."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"The Amelia series used to be unique in that it was fresh, witty, and fun to read. I couldn't find any others like it. I eagerly awaited each new book and reread previously published ones over and over. Now it's just another book on the shelf just like all the others. The reason I loved the Amelia series was because it WAS so different. I hate the turn this series has taken...just like I hate all the other books on the shelf and the soap operas on TV. We don't need another series full of dull, flat melodrama and &quot;sexual tension&quot;. There are PLENTY of those on the shelves already. PLEASE, Ms. Peters, go back to your original fresh and witty style. The new story plots are too nauseating. I don't buy and read other authors' books PRECISELY BECAUSE they write books like these last few Amelia books. I didn't like this book and I won't be buying any more if they continue in this manner."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Amelia Peabody's mysteries are on of the best, in fact they are the best! Elizabeth Peters, you have done it again! I congratulate you!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Some reviews have already given away too much, so I don't think that I will summarize the book any further. I think that this book would best be enjoyed if you read The Ape that Guards the Balance first. What luck! It has just been released in paperback.

I hate books where everyone is goody two shoes and everything is always rosy all the time. I think Elizabeth Peters has done a fine job with her characters.I also thought her mystery this time around was much better. A few of the last books left me kind of bored with what was going on.

I've read all of this series, her other books under this name, and her books as Barbara Michaels. Three qualities are present in all her books: humor, realism, and deep compassion. The complexities and griefs in the later Amelia Peabody books have always been present; that's why the reader becomes so involved. The only problem with &quot;Falcon&quot; is Nefret's relentless golden adorability, and Peters is reining that in by giving her compassion based on direct knowledge, and letting her learn to suffer the consequences of her impulses.But it's a LONG time until May 3rd and the release of the new book!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Having read all of the Amelia Peabody Emerson stories, I have to say this was outstanding. The action is gripping, but also very disburbing and poignant. The characters continued to evolve, especially Ramses who has become extremely interesting! The challenges they faced- criminal, professional and personal- were very surprising and handled beautifully by Elizabeth Peters.

Hopefully, all will be revealed...I can't wait for the next installment."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Wow! Ms. Peters(Mertz) has certainly outdone herself with this one. I saved this book an entire month because I wanted to read it while vacationing at the beach.

I trust the next book will have a MUCH happier ending. Please hurry!!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I give this outing of the Amelia Peabody Emerson novels five stars simply because it was a heck of a good story, a thrilling ride, and the ending came out of blue. As with the last few books in this series the violence directed at the Emerson family becomes more dangerous than it ever has been. People are being shot, prostitutes are murdered, and members of the Emerson clan are put in extreme, dangerous positions. What the author seems to be doing is showing what a family living in and working in Egypt might have to deal withat this point in history: Egyptian nationalistic movements, British prejudices, and the rumblings of WWI (minus the mystery high-jixs and Master Criminals, of course). The one annoying factor in this novel was Nefret. The author has chosen to take a once strong and intelligent young woman and turn her into a petty, childish, lovelorn twit who not only makes bad choices that put the family in greater danger, but also breaks the heart of nearly every member of the family. Ramses also had his annoying moments. He has always been a favorite character, but since attaining adulthood he's become a brooding, self-righteous, and insulting young man with a real \\"superman\\" syndrome. Again, I'm allowing myself to become too invested in the lives of fictional characters, but that's the hallmark of a great author. One of the bright spots and little used aspects of this novel is David and his new wife Lia. Much of this novel revolves around accusations against David and his late grandfather, Abdullah, so I wish he could have played a larger role, but he does become a major focal point of the novel near the end. I just wish the author would allow this character to step into the limelight more instead of being little more than Ramses' shadow. Overall, this was an exciting and thrilling edition of the Emerson clan adventures and I strongly recommend the novel."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I liked this book because it finally exposes Ramses REAL feelings. It gives the family a chance to really support one another in a way they never have before. Having said that I don't think anyone should read this book without its companion,He Shall Thunder In The Sky. Trust me on this."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Nefret is not my favorite character in these books, and all of her few mitigating qualities completely disappear in &quot;Falcon.&quot; I am hoping that some of the events in this story will give her a heart and soul to go along with her beauty and wit. Ramses deserves more than the former, rather cruel and self-absorbed Nefret. Unlike many of the other comments here, I like the direction that Elizabeth Peters is taking. It's sort of like The Emersons: TNG! I see only exciting possibilities for Ramses in the future...I think he's deserving of a series of his own with Emerson and Peabody as wonderful secondary characters. He could be a British/Egyptian government agent, or a war spy, or a private detective with David as his sidekick, or, with Nefret, the next Nick &amp; Nora Charles! I have a mad pash for Ramses. He has supplanted John Tregarth as my fictional object of desire. Anyway, Falcon was a more emotional book then most in the series. I liked the addition of a new character (Sennia), but the &quot;mystery&quot; element was weak - I knew who the villian was pretty early on. I'm looking forward to finding out what will happen in Switzerland - and although I love the Egyptology and archaeology, maybe a change of mise-en-scene will give the next book an extra oomph!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Falcon, while not my favorite A. Peabody book, was quite interesting. In defense of Nefreet, I feel certain that we will see why she took her rash action. By comparing herself to Sinuhe, both to Ramses and Amelia, she gives us glimses into the next installment (&quot;he was in on the conspiracy up to his neck but she forgave him&quot;). No doubt the evil Percy will pop up again, probably as the source of Nefreet's drastic action (blackmail, maybe to insure his spy was on the scene to oversee the dig?) Whatever the source, I feel certain her actions will be explained to her credit in the future. We have seen Ramses pine away for years. Now it's Nefreet's turn. Someone will seek to endanger or discredit Ramses, Emerson , and Amelia, using Nefreet as a tool. Percy will again manifest his hatred of Ramses and Amelia. I reread several passages and found several clues (only after I realized her actions were probably not what they appeared). Ms Peter's hasn't let us down before. She is maturing both Ramses and Nefreet so that when they do (finally!) get and stay together, it will be after mutually proving their loyalty."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I've always been a fan of Amelia Peabody, and I've been anxiously awaiting the next installment of the books. I've come to enjoy the Ramses/Nefret intrigue in the past several books, and I'm glad that it finally went somewhere. However, I was disappointed with how it ended. I don't like having to wait an entire year to see what is going to happen next. Ms. Peters should definitely make this her first and last cliff hanger."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Very well written but unfortunately leaves to much un-resolved. Suggest waiting for this novels sequel before starting to read this one."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"RAMSES AND NEFRET NEED TO BE TOGETHER. I LOVE THESE BOOKS, AND RAMSES IS PRECIOUS, AND HE ISN'T ALLOWED TO BE UNHAPPY BECAUSE IT IS WAY TOO SAD!!!!! :o)"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"The Falcon at the Portal is both rewarding and frustrating - rewarding because we gain more insight into Amelia's true feelings about her family and close friends (gone is the Amelia who told the readers what she wanted us to believe, rather than what she was actually feeling). The book is also rewarding because it does advance the story of the fascinating and lovable Emerson clan, and takes us in some new and intriguing directions. (What exactly were Nefret's intentions? From the middle of the book onward, we don't have much insight into the reasons for her actions, and that is surely intentional on Ms. Peters' part.) The book is undoubtedly frustrating because it leaves us with a lot of unanswered questions. As some long-time readers have suggested, this seems to be a &quot;bridge&quot; novel - and it will be quite impossible to wait another year for &quot;Thunder,&quot; which we hope resolves the dangling issues. Yes, it's true: there is less humour, less archeology and fewer and shorter appearances from some old friends like Evelyn, Walter, Howard Carter and even Cyrus and Katherine. But still, there is lots of Amelia, Emerson and Ramses, and this reader, for one, can never get enough of those three! Read Falcon and trust Elizabeth Peters."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"As a writer, I hate it when I have just finished a story, sweated over it, edited it to pieces, and then posted it, and the first comments I get are &quot;When's the next one coming out?&quot; &lt;g&gt; But Elizabeth Peters set herself up for this one. As a romantic, I was dying for Ramses and Nefret to get together, and I cheered when they finally made those all important moves toward one another. Short lived joy! The next scenes read like all those old Mills &amp; Boons that I threw away years ago. I must admit, I was waiting to find out that Geoffrey blackmailed Nefret into marrying him, or even pretending to be married to him, with some vile threat towards Ramses and the family. I don't like unfinished stories, especially ones I have to wait a year to read. One a happier note, Sennia is delightful, and I fell in love with Ramses all over again as he interacted with her. Now I am going back to read an earlier book in the series, and I recomend you do the same. THE MUMMY CASE is still my favourite, Ramses at five is so sweet. I might go back and read the first one with David. I personally would have preferred a romance between David and Ramses (they certainly were passionately devoted to one another in those first years together) We wouldn't have needed the rather dull Lia, and Nefret could have joined them later. :) David &amp; Ramses! Let's hear it for the boys!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Once again, Emelia pulls off another mystery with the support of that incredibly handsome husband, Emerson. The Falcon at the Portal brings more of the adventures of Ramses, David (along with his new bride, Lia) and Nefret. They are now adults, and are as much involved in the adventure as Amelia and Emerson. I found myself feeling so bad for Ramses. I'm sure that we would all love for him to finally marry Nefret and end all of our frustration. Once again we get the input of Cyrus and Katherine, but their visits are short lived. We are again cursed by the presence of Amelia's miserable nephew, Percy. He is an evil presence, and you never know what to expect from him, nor do you know what his intentions are. Elizabeth has out done herself again. I always find myself learning more and more about Egyptian history when I read an Amelia adventure. I think Elizabeth is one of the greatest historical mystery writers. She brings life to a period of time that none of us lived through."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I've thoroughly enjoyed every one of Elizabeth Peters' mysteries, however, the Amelia Peabody books are my favorites. If this isn't quickly followed by another book, readers will be sorely disappointed. The ending, while tying up the mystery, surely didn't satisfy all the sub-plots set up by Ms. Peters, and I wanted to know more, right then. Excellent dialogue and characterization, along with the familiarity of the characters, produce a fine read. My only problem with Ms. Peters is that I wish her books were longer, with even more time spent on her intricate details. I can't get enough of reading her work and hate to wait for the newest book."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I love the Ameila Peabody books and this one was no exception. This book was more sad than the others and way more serious. I don't think I can wait a year for the next one! This book had so many lose ends. This is a must read for any Elizabeth Peters fan!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I found this book very different from the others in the series.The reviews I've read are amusing.Either very good,or a great dissapointment. Seems to me that Ms.Peters has us all hanging at the end of our ropes.We can't wait to see if Nefret and Rames work out their problems and finally get together. We are all concerned for Amelia,but face it she is getting older and is acting her age.As for Emerson he to is more mellow as he ages.Are not we all? My problem lies in waiting how long ,for the next book? I've written the next one in my head several times, I can't wait to find out how close I am to Ms. Peters thoughts on the Emerson's. Please for the sake of our sanity make it soon!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I have loved every one of the Amelia Peabody books. I loved this one too, though it ended up being almost painful to read at times. Seeing a wonderful character like Nefret turn into an empty-headed, silly shell of her former self was hard to bear. I trust, however, that her nearly unbelievable character change will be explained in the next book (Good Gad, not another year to wait!) Just one request -- could the next adventures of Amelia, Ramses, and Co. be a little more upbeat?"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Frustration, abrupt changes of personality, new ways of seeing characters we think we &quot;know.&quot; Can't wait for the resolution...and am sure it will be a surprise and a joy. As a &quot;middle-age&quot; woman, I LOVE Amelia and Emerson, and wish them well as they head off for another &quot;good&quot; adventure in their &quot;good&quot; life! It isn't easy for an author to make characters whom we enjoy and who are essentially good human beings come to life in book after book; but, Dr. Mertz continues to do this. When a 24 year old and a 59 year old can enjoy and laugh at the same characters, an author is doing a tremendous job!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Emerson is beginning to sound a bit like Amelia in his pronouncements to Ramses and David on the key to a successful marriage. Ramses has the same intellectual curiosity &amp; covert activities as when he was five, but now the consequences are not so comical. Amelia's dreams are the comforting thread in her inner monologue; something she would have pooh-poohed as fanciful in the first book. Ramses is even more like Amelia; the intelligent child with an eccentric and scholarly upbringing. Amelia's story began with the social outcast Evelyn, and this latest development seems in that realm again.Frankly, Nefret has been one of Ms. Peters' weakest characters for me. Nefret has never been consistent; I keep waiting for the unusual background she grew up in to somehow make her more unique. Instead she is shallow, trendy (of her time) and mercurial. I know Ramses finds this adorable, but I found it no surprise when these lightening changes of emotion led to disaster in this book. Every time she perches on Emerson's chairarm and coos, &quot;Professor darling&quot; I keep hoping she'll be an evil plant from the Master Criminal. And thank goodness that awful Horus got what he deserves!If the mystery and archaeological detail seem familiar, well, it was an insular period, with the sole focus on the artifacts binding most of the characters. Peters' creativity has been to open up the point of view over the last few books, with the additional &quot;manuscript&quot; contributions in third person or letters from Nefret. Yes, we know who the young classical scholar &quot;Lawrence&quot; is. Seriousness escalated in the series for me in the London-centered book, fifth in the series. When Percy first entered the plots and the understanding between Amelia and Ramses became evident. I've read that the next book may be the last. Peters may surprise us again."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I keep waiting in vain for Elizabeth Peters to disappoint me. This was a well written, carefully plotted adventure with an amazingly successful villain.The period and atmosphere are skilfully evoked by this past mistress of her craft. Amelia is as delightful as ever as she holds high the banner of female emancipation. I hope that trailing romantic ends will be neatly tied in the eagerly anticipated sequel to this book. Why doesn't the key romantic protagonist admit that he doesn't understand women and ask for someone's advice?"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I have loved the Amelia Peabody stories since I read Crocodile on the Sandbank in the mid-80s. All of the books have fascinated me, and fueled my interest in ancient Egypt. I think of all the books, however, I enjoyed The Falcon at the Portal the most.It is no easy feat for a writer to create characters and have them grow over the course of 20 plus years. You could do as some writers do, and have the stories happen every six months or so, and have the characters remain the same, of you could take the track of Mrs. Peters, and have them grow and change, as they have done.For those who are angry over the changes in the Falcon at the Portal, I ask you to consider real life. Maybe Nefret's reaction to Ramses' &quot;surprise&quot; (which, of course was not his surprise) was out of character as some have said. But what woman, or man, on finding themselves in love with a person does not react differently to things than they might have in the past, before they realized their love.Mrs. Peters has created a book that kept me fascinated from the front page to the last ... and left me thirsty for more. I can hardly wait for the next book. Keep up the good work!!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Like most reviewers, I, too, have read all the Amelia titles and most of Peters' other novels. What keeps me returning to this series (as with the Vickie Bliss books) is the ongoing development of the characters. I greatly resent the incompleteness of The Falcon at the Portal. Yes, I am among those hoping for a requited love for Ramses, but I don't blame Peters for getting the most out of this romance. Romantic tension is great for fueling readers' interest. I find fault with the number of loose ends within the mystery itself. Maybe I'm doing some very wishful thinking, or I'm WAY off the mark, but I suspect Peters has set us up for a VERY complicated sequel. I suspect we will find that Nefret really didn't act like a Victorian twit. If she had, then her feelings at the end of the story would be out of place. Aside from her immediate reaction to Ramses' uncomfortable situation, she must have taken the action she did with another end in mind -- perhaps with the hope of truly helping the Emersons and David. Or, maybe I'm just trying to save a character that I love from seeming stupidity! In any event, I believe all the twists to this plot and the introduction of so many side-lines(i.e. nationalist movement, drug-trafficing etc.) pave the way for an expansion of the total &quot;mystery&quot; that is only begun in this book and will be wrapped up in the next. That is where I find the &quot;rub&quot;, and why I give 4 stars instead of 5. Yes, &quot;Falcon&quot; is an emotional roller-coaster for readers. Yes, the obvious villian is easy to guess. And, yes, the tendrils of this tale will reach into the next. But, since when do we read historical mysteries that come out, maybe once a year, as we would read a monthly sequel in a magazine?!? I have faith in Elizabeth Peters. I have faith in her characters (though David and Lia could use a shot in the arm). I applaud her historical detail and her ability to educate us in the fields of archeology and ancient Egypt. I am, however, disappointed in her treatment of this series as a &quot;cliff-hanging&quot; serialization. She is worthy of more and we are worthy of more."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I, too, could not put this book down and by the time I had finished, I had run the full gauntlet of emotional reactions. I agree with the seemingly unfairness regarding the situations the younger Emersons, et al, have been put in. I think we all wanted to see Ramses and Nefret together in the end and we're heartbroken at what actually happened (and Geoffrey? A dull lad.) But if everything had worked out perfectly, then we would have been complaining about the lack of suspense and intrigue, drama and mystery. Ms. Peters surely knows what she's doing to these characters and let's not forget what a wonderful person Ramses has turned out to be. He is the true hero here (David is wonderful too but he's taken). Ms. Peters has promised to solve all the cliff-hangers and plot twists in her next book and I for one can hardly wait. If you're frustrated and/or disappointed, admit you've been reeled in. Wait for the next one. Stop giving away plot twists for those who haven't read it yet. Besides, without all the twists and turns, it be too much like the humdrum of real life."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Hi Peabody fans! I found this book disturbing. After so many years of jolly adventures wrapped up neatly and happily at the end of each book, we get hit with major punch in the stomach. When was the last time a mystery book stirred up your thoughts for days and weeks after you finished it? I applaud the author's talent in making us care about the characters so much that their pain is our pain."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I can't believe this book! It was really good... extremely suspense. It totally put me in a mood swing while reading it. I can't believe what Nefret did! I love this series and I can't wait for the next book!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"My first reaction is to scream, read ahead to see the ending and throw the book away. How could she? How could she do this to me? I don't remember a time other than Curtain (which was decades ago when I was 8-years-old) where I felt this raw emotion over a damn book. It's not suppose to be this way. I wish that I had stick to my original plan to buy the book next year. I am now subjected to prolonged torture of suspense.Falcon makes an excellent reading for new readers, but for those who have let the Emersons into our heart it is heart breaking. But, Ms. Peters need not apologize for Nefret's action. The charm of this series is prompted by the unconventional characters, and were Ms. Peters to explain all the motives behind the action the story would have been conventional. I believe that Falcon will stick out from the rest precisely because of its haunting nature. And all of us did buy the novel under the mystery section did we not?I tend to agree that Nefret's &quot;decision&quot; has more to it than we know, but if it is not the case then so be it. The mystery of human nature never could be easily explained. The mood of the series has indeed change, I state that as a fact not a criticism. But if it hasn't than Ms. Peters could just froze the Emersons at a time period. Imagine Ramses forever 5. I feel a tender spot for the lad when he was the commical child genius, but little children do grow. And I believe it is Amelia that says the youth of today is not impervious to the pain of tommorow -or something along that line more or less.So tread along Ms. Peters, do not stop the humanity of the Emersons just to keep the series of being a light one. An author that can entertain, educate, and touch us -though not really in the way we want her to this time, really posseses a magical charm about her."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I love Amelia and her family, even when their enemies are confused, disorganized or downright silly. However, I feel that a really devious villain strengthens the plot, just as maturity strengthens the characters. This is the best since, THE SNAKE,THE CROCODILE &amp; THE DOG,I think. The only disappointment was to my greed, as I'm dying to know what happens next!I won't rehash the plot here (I do wish people would NOT say so much about the plots of mysteries -- spoils the fun!). I particularly liked the development of Ramses &amp; Emerson's characters as they relate to Sennia, and the deepening of Amelia's relationship with Abdullah (OK, so he's dead -- you think a little thing like that could stop either of them?). I enjoy the use of letters and other narratives to tell the story, and in this book I felt I finally began to understand Nefret's apparent blindness in her relationship with Ramses.Kudos to Peters for exploring the development of the Egyptian Nationalist movement, for developing a most excellent villain, and, of course, for bringing back the ineffable Percy! Readers who love outrageous plots, eccentric characters who defy stasis and the jolt of story lines turned inside-out will go for this. Readers who don't...won't!"},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I don't understand what the fuss is about. The book is superbly written as always. Have we become so stagnant that we cannot accept change? Change is not only inevitable but also necessary for growth. I applaud Ms. Peters for not clinging to a staid formula. I don't doubt that her fans and critics would eventually complain that she doesn't write anything new. And please, let's not exaggerate. The &quot;soap opera&quot; part takes up a mere fraction of the book and does nothing to detract from its progress. I, for one, enjoyed the book thoroughly and was incapable of putting it down. Future readers - do not be put off by narrow minds. The book is an excellent read."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"The Falcon at the Portal picks up some years after the painful events of The Ape Who Guards the Balance (painful for me because I didn't like the book, and painful for the Emersons personally). David and Lia are finally to be married, Nefret and Ramses haven't sorted themselves out yet, and Amelia and Emerson are still themselves. All sounds well enough, but when David is accused of forging artifacts, and Emerson submits to blackmail to keep the accusations secret, the Emerson family detection machine goes into action to keep the newlyweds happy and safe. The mystery follows the family on their seasonal expedition to Egypt, where Amelia has a chance to excavate a (shabby) pyramid. Then the usual annoyances-- sprays of gunfire, near-fatal 'accidents,' despicable family members-- pop up, and before too long the Emersons find a very dead body at the bottom of a pyramid shaft.I will be brief: I loved this book. The snappy dialogue and vibrant characterization I want from a Peabody book was there. The interaction between the 'kids': Ramses, Nefret, David, and Lia-- was delightful. Lia, an annoyance in the previous book, was redeemed here, and the chemistry between David and Ramses sparkles as usual. Cyrus and Katherine Vandergelt, my favourite recurring characters, also have some wonderful scenes. I don't necessary read Peabody books for the mystery, I read them because I enjoy being immersed in the atmosphere that the characters generate. This installment of the series was as richly atmospheric as any: the scenes between David, Lia, and Ramses on board the Amelia, or the &#34;war-room&#34; scene where the Emersons finally break the forgery story to David's family and to the Vandergelts-- great stuff. I'd love to see it onscreen. I enjoy the &#34;mental&#34; aspect of this book, as I watch considerable minds of these characters puzzle out the messy situation they're in.I don't want to say more about the plotline. The storyarc is a devastating one, though I don't find the &#34;soap-opera&#34; label warranted. This particular novel is likely to upset fans of the series (judging from other reviews, it sure seems to). I loved it, and I feel it makes a perfect companion piece to its sequel, the magnificent He Shall Thunder in the Sky. This book ends with the fabric of the Emerson family unraveled, and &#34;Thunder&#34; takes those threads, mingles them with other threads from throughout the series, and weaves them into something grand.(I will add that I read &#34;Thunder&#34; first, and so got the catharsis and closure *before* I read the traumatic stuff. I read them in proper order later and still liked them.)It's still a fantastic series; it's just not the lighthearted romp it once was. The changing tone of the series fits the changing backdrop of &#34;current events&#34;-- genteel Victorian travellers &#62; tourist infestation &#62; the Sudanese war &#62; tourist infestation &#62; native unrest and the premonitory twitches of World War I.I would give this four-and-a-half stars if possible."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"I know a lot of people had problems with this book...er, actually with Nefret's actions in this book. I however, loved it! The intense pain and hurt that came from those actions were so real...I felt Amelia's shock and pain. I think it changed the characters in a world that was rapidly changing around them. No one could stay behind as this Great War began to sweep a world along with it.On another note, I absolutely adored the story of Sinuhe. The parallels to Nefret were astounding...I think that she still is making her journey as Sinuhe at the end of this book. One can almost see the pain that she feels, still searching for her way &quot;home.&quot; Elizabeth Peters is the grand master of the extended metaphor, but this time she truly outdid herself."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Normally I am a die hard Stephen King fan, now don't get me wrong I love him still but this past christmas my grandmother got me hooked on Elizabeth Peters &quot;Amelia Peabody&quot; series!

After the first reading, I had to read it again, just to calm down enough to relax and stop worrying at it in my mind. Be warned. If you are a fan of the series, this book will bother you. I'm finally reassured that Nefret had her reasons for what she did and is not (as other reviewers have worried) a 'Victorian goop'. As a younger person, I find the actions of the 'children' most interesting, and I'm looking forward with almost unbearable anticipation to the next installment."},{"Title":"The Falcon at the Portal (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)","review":"Just finished. . .yet not finished at all!!

More than that, it is an extremely important book, given the paucity of materials available to English speakers about Lithuania generally and the women of the nation in particular.Each chapter was written by a different scholar and the resulting variation in voice is refreshing. Because all of the contributors are Lithuanian, the reader can be certain that the picture given is an accurate one and truly reflects the present-day realities of the culture as experienced by its women. The book is very readable and addresses a wide range of topics including family life, women's employment, reproduction, women in the academy, and the concerns that Lithuanian women have with American feminism. LaFont's Introduction along with the first two chapters (focusing on the role of women historically) help to make the reasons for current conditions more easily understood. The book is filled with interesting statistical data as well as informative personal accounts and histories.LaFont's volume contains a wealth of information. It will undoubtedly be appreciated by those with an interest in the lives of women in Eastern Europe."},{"Title":"Women in Transition: Voices from Lithuania","review":"Women in Transition edited by Suzanne LaFont is the only book about Lithuanian women that I have been able to find printed in English.

I am certain that to some degree Lee is mythologizing these actions of comic creation, but I really have no idea where to draw the line on how much credit he gets in all this and am not ashamed that my copy of this book is autographed. The main thing about this volume is that at a time where reprints were few and far between, &quot;Origins of Marvel Comics&quot; gives you the first appearance of classic super heroes along with what in 1974 were more recent stories as well. For &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; we get issue #1 where they take on the Moleman and #55 &quot;Where Strikes the Silver Surfer,&quot; both of which are drawn by Jack Kirby. &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; offers more Kirby art with issue #1 (with the Hulk still grey on the cover) and #118 where he fights the Sub-Mariner drawn by Herb Trimpe. &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 provides the first story with Steve Ditko's Spider-Man while #72 of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; features &quot;Rocked by...The Shocker!&quot; drawn by John Romita. Kirby again draws both stories when &quot;Journey Into Mystery&quot; #83 introduces &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot; while issue #143 has Thor, Balder and Sif taking on the Evil Enchanters. Finally, there are a trio of stories with Doctor Strange, Master of the Mystic Arts, drawn by Ditko and Marie Severin. Of course the origin issues are of more interest than the others and do not really add anything significant. There are other volumes in this &quot;series,&quot; providing more of the same."},{"Title":"Origins of Marvel Comics","review":"I originally owned this book when I was 11 years old, and actually bought it by mistake, thinking it was the sequel - SON OF ORIGINS OF MARVEL COMICS - which my cousins owned and which I had read years before. I even remember the trip we took to the local comics shop, specifically so I could get this volume. Far from being dissappointed, I was entrhalled at the chance to become acquainted with the background of characters I already knew and adored.Stan Lee's imagination was the Big Bang from which the Marvel Universe sprung. While other more detailed and thoughtful volumes have since been published which detail the evolutions of The Fantastic Four, The Incredible Hulk, The Amazing Spider-Man (that's \\"Spider-HYPHEN-Man\\"!!!) and company, there's something to be said for reading the history as described by the man who was there. Yes, the descriptions are relatively brief and full of hyperbole and superlatives -- but honestly, what else would one expect from Lee?I realize now that the text pieces reflect the style and humor of the author as much as the reprinted stories they are interspersed between. ORIGINS OF MARVEL COMICS demonstrates perfectly how Stan Lee's personality above all else shaped Marvel Comics for decades to come. Indeed, the authors who followed in Lee's footsteps on most of the titles represented directly copied his style (admittedly, this might have been an editorial mandate -- but I have yet to read many complaints about it), and even now the original stories retain much of the power and charm they had then.What's also now interesting about ORIGINS is the stories originally included to give a more \\"contemporary\\" feeling for the characters. These stories, which were first published less than a decade after their respective origin tales, are now equally as dated and serve in hindsight to represent a broader overview of MARVEL at the height of its inventiveness. A time when every other story was a CLASSIC -- and the vast majority of them were written by the same person.An immeasurable debt is certainly owed the artists who also brought Dr. Strange, Thor, et al. to life (and Lee pays tribute to them all in his adverb-filled manner), and even a casual read demonstrates the diversity brought to the Marvel Bullpen by Kirby, Ditko, Romita Sr. (who illustrated the original printing's cover), Trimpe, and others. But the flip side of diversity is cohesion, and that magical element was supplied in abundance by the Editor Emeritus.ORIGINS OF MARVEL COMICS is as much about Stan Lee as it is about his creations. It's a fun book, as well it should be. And it's the tip of the iceberg...so don't stop here. Go pick up SON OF ORIGINS and BRING ON THE BAD GUYS and THE SUPERHERO WOMEN OF MARVEL COMICS and the ESSENTIALS collections.But start somewhere...start HERE. 'Nuff said!"},{"Title":"Origins of Marvel Comics","review":"&quot;Origins of Marvel Comics&quot; is one of those books you pick up and simply cannot put down! Great commentaries by the Excelsior himself, Stan Lee, the reader discovers what inspired the creations of such heroes as The Incredible Hulk, The Amazing Spiderman and The Fantastic Four, to name a few. Not just for Baby Boomers, &quot;Origins of Marvel Comics&quot; is recommended reading to anyone who loves comics books or to those whoever wondered where popular culture came from. Read on!"},{"Title":"Origins of Marvel Comics","review":"ORIGINS OF MARVEL COMICS is a trade collection that's almost four decades old, having first come out way, way back in 1974, right around the time the wheel was invented. If you didn't know - and how come you don't? - Marvel Comics, back in the early '60s, introduced a hipper, grittier form of comic book storytelling, mostly by portraying its protagonists as these flawed (and, therefore, more interesting) characters. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby (maybe comic books' most dynamic artist ever) did most of the heavy lifting. But let's also not forget Steve Ditko.Honestly, this trade is worth it alone for Stan Lee's ever loquacious introductions as he waxes on and on about the inspirations behind this first wave of modern Marvel superheroes. Maybe my favorite bit is Stan's musings about his creative process regarding Dr. Strange. He comments on how this Sorcerer Supreme absolutely required that extra oomph. Regarding the theatrics of Strange casting a spell - like, maybe he needs to transport a villain to another dimension - Stan writes: \\"You can have him mutter, 'Split to another dimension, man,' but that may leave a little to be desired in the department of melodrama.\\" Instead, Stan came up with awesome phrases such as \\"By the all-seeing eye of Agamotto!\\" and \\"In the name of the eternal Vishanti\\" and \\"By the hoary hosts of Hoggoth!\\" I actually use that last one as my very own personal expletive, never mind the weird looks I get.ORIGINS OF MARVEL COMICS reacquaints us with the origins of the Fantastic Four, the Hulk, Spider-Man, Thor, and Dr. Strange. As a bonus, there is also a later issue included per title of which intent is to demonstrate how the characters have evolved.Stan Lee makes no bones of the Justice League of America being the inspiration for the Fantastic Four. Except that Stan took the old and dusty superhero team dynamics and upended that by presenting his group as this quartet that spends as much time bickering with each other as fighting crime. The Thing, surly and bitter and self-loathing, was easily the breakout character of the bunch. Stan Lee's writing in the FF, with its more grounded, more realistic approach, quickly turned heads and generated tons of fan mail. It became Marvel's cornerstone title and quickly lived up to its braggy billing as \\"The World's Greatest Comic Magazine!\\" Marvel took note of the Thing's popularity and repeatedly returned to the mold. More heroes with feet of clay, please. Anywho, FANTASTIC FOUR #1 chronicles how the FF came to be. FF #55 features a battle royale between the Thing and the Silver Surfer, whom the Thing believes to be making time with his girl Alicia Masters.\\"Don't make me angry, Mr. McGee. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.\\" Before the TV show, the Hulk rampaged thru his own comic book which dates back to 1962. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde... pretty much distills the essence of the Hulk. But Frankenstein's monster was also pivotal in Stan's fleshing out of the ill-tempered green giant. How's this for a hook? An intelligent, sensitive scientist trapped in an unending cycle of horror, rendered helpless as his primal, brutish side emerges time and again to smash all puny things in sight (like humans). This wrenching dichotomy made the Hulk a big hit; the Hulk's childlike innocence made him appealing. THE INCREDIBLE HULK #1 details Dr. Banner's exposure to gamma rays and the cr@pfest that unfolds from it. Issue #118 (with art by Herb Trimpe) features the Hulk's underwater rumble with the Sub-Mariner. They probably could've picked a better issue to show the Hulk's development as a character.Next is my favorite superduper of all time, and that's Spidey, brother! AMAZING FANTASY #15 was meant to be the final issue of the sci-fi/fantasy anthology series, and so for shucks and giggles Stan experimented with a little somethin' somethin' called the Amazing Spider-Man. Stan wished to pen a story in which the teenager isn't the sidekick but the actual lead hero. For extra pathos, he'd make this kid endure some serious teen angst, be the perennial lovable loser, someone who may beat up on super-villains now and then and yet his personal life would remain as messed up as yours and mine. So, of course, we can't help but relate to the poor sap. AMAZING FANTASY #15 chronicles the web-slinger's origin and gives us that immortal maxim: \\"With great power there must also come great responsibility.\\" Steve Ditko's art perfectly captures the lonely awkwardness of Peter Parker and the macabre grace of his friendly neighborhood alter ego. In a less seminal moment, AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #72 re-introduces the villainy of the Shocker. It also reinforces that old Parker bad luck. More importantly, it showcases the sleek artwork of John Romita, who draws the best ever version of Gwen Stacy.Time to brush up now on your thees and thous and verilys. JOURNEY INTO MYSTERY #83 features a crippled doctor holidaying in Norway. There, he sniffs out an alien invasion and stumbles onto a gnarled wooden stick which transforms him into Thor, the indomitable God of Thunder with the archaic diction. Next is THE MIGHTY THOR #143, which expands the canvas of Thor's universe and amps up the pageantry. It's neat, though, to see this story start off with Thor chillin' in a packed malt shop, sipping his soda, whilst schoolgirls moon over him in droves.And, finally, Dr. Strange. To be honest, Dr. Strange, nowadays (or, really, ever), doesn't quite fall in the same league as the other famous cats in this collection. Still, no one can master the mystic arts quite like the aloof Dr. Stephen Strange, a once insufferably haughty surgeon humbled by fate and forced to assume a new calling. STRANGE TALES #110 has Dr. Strange's first appearance, #115 his origin story, and #155 his sorcerous duel with the unspeakable Umar, sister to the Dread Dormammu. Back in the '60s, Steve Ditko's artwork was so trippy that it probably served as ample substitute for them college students what ran out of their stash, if you know what I mean. Note, however, that issue #155 exhibits artwork by Marie Severin, whose illustraty stuff was never of the hallucinatory persuasion."},{"Title":"Origins of Marvel Comics","review":"I found this book to be very interesting.

Way ahead of its time."},{"Title":"Origins of Marvel Comics","review":"an absolute classic that any comix reader must read"},{"Title":"Origins of Marvel Comics","review":"I marvel at the origins of marvel comics. This man is such a liar!Does Stan Lee have no shame? If you really want to know how Marvel Comics came to be,read some background on one Mr.Jack Kirby.For Stan Lee to say that he would come up with an idea then pass it along to Jack Kirby is not only ludicrous but also peposterous.Stan Lee also fails to mention many artists who where also working at the Marvel bullpen at the time.Many artist who where working at Marvel at the time have gone on to state that Stan Lee never wrote a single story!! The way the artist of the day would go about writing a story would be by writing it along the borders and making it up as they went along.If this is true,then Jack Kirby created the entire line of characters for Marvel Comics.Many of the more important ones any ways.The Incredible Hulk,Captain America,The Fantastic Four,Thor,The X-Men,And The Avengers to name a few.And also not to mention the cover to Amazing Fantasy #15.When Stan Lee states very proudly that the idea for The Fantastic Four was all his ,it upsets me.If you are really a true comic book fan then you would know that the Fantastic Four are just recycled characters from Simon and Kirby's Challengers Of The Unknown.Which , I might add was published for D.C.Comics and not for Marvel.Jack Kirby was an artist and an idea man when he and Joe Simon collaborated together.These two men came up with many characters and many ideas together.At least Mr. Simon had the decency to admit it.But the same cannot be said for Stan Lee,he and he alone wants to take credit for the creation of Marvel Comics most memorable heroes.This book is filled with nothing but self glorification and staight out lies put to paper by Stan Lee.Excelsior my foot,how about expell yourself?Very little is said about Simon &amp; Kirby's creation of Captain America for Marvel comics in the forty's. Stan Lee didn't even work for Marvel Comics at the time that Captain America made his comic book debut!! Origins of Marvel Comics also speaks very little about Steve Ditko,Don heck,and John Romita Sr. some of comicdoms most famous artists.This book fails to aknowledge the contributions they also made for Marvel Comics.But then again I guess that's the way Stan Lee wanted it when he wrote this book.I belieive this book did very much damadge to Jack Kirby's carreer.To this day he is not given the proper credit he so rightly deserves.The way Marvel Comics treated Jack Kirby can be compared to the exile of Moses from Egypt in wich his name must forever be stricken from it's books and never be spoken again! I wouldn't recommend purchasing this book but if you do,go right out and buy some material to compare notes and then make your decision about the Origins Of Marvel Comics . Pick up The art of Jack Kirby for refference because there was never really a &quot;Marvel Age Of Comics,&quot;there was only a &quot;Jack Kirby Age Of Comics.&quot; If you wish to send me your comments or opinions send them to 3019 s.

So in the sense of saving you some trial and error, there's valuble, time-saving help here. However, I think you'd get the same benefit just fumbling around and making mistakes on your own.If you already play the game fanatically (as I do), then you may just enjoy the book as a good read and an opportunity to pick up some useful gameplay tips that might have eluded you for some time.This is especially true when the book covers the real-time tactical combat aspects of Medieval:Total War. Here the author includes statistical information on all the troop types from peasant militia to chivalric knights (i.e., he doesn't just give you the useful, but somewhat vague, comments that the game does: &quot;Has irresistible attack,&quot; &quot;vulnerable to missile fire,&quot; &quot;strong defence.&quot;)There is also an extensive discussion of both how to maneuver your troops, commentary on the strengths and weaknesses of various soldier types (for example, how peasant militia should not be lightly disregarded, as they can serve as cannon-fodder, spear-carriers, etc. Yeah, sounds harsh, but they're only electronic images, remember?).Most valuable to me was the explanation of how the real-time game mechanics worked, how the animations gave extra battle clues, and so on. For example, simple information on how &quot;loose&quot; formations were vulnerable to direct melee assaults because enemy formations could surround individual troopers, but were valuable for allowing skirmishers to withdraw through the formation with less delay. Or how staying in formation, rather than &quot;engaging at will&quot; increased unit morale and effectiveness, as soldiers support and encourage each other.There's also building information and statistical information on their value, as well as a collected list of such things as the effects of various personality &quot;quirks&quot; that your king may develop over time like being &quot;addle-brained&quot; or &quot;impetuous.&quot;You could get all this information on your own if you are willing to spend quite a bit of time at the TotalWar.com forums, but the book saves you that time. If you're on a budget, or simply a careful person, don't buy the book, it's fun but not crucial.I'm glad I bought it since I'm fascinated with the game and want more. The book is fun to read, thought-provoking (in that, when I disagree with the author, I try to think of my own alternatives), but it doesn't have as much charisma as I would have liked: I'd have liked vivid drawings, more opinionated gameplay advice, more...exuberant writing. It was the age of knights, castles, religious wars, diplomatic marriages, and more - so live it up."},{"Title":"Medieval: Total War(TM) Official Strategy Guide","review":"Strategy guides for video games tend to be... well, horrible. Particularly for a game such as medieval total war, a truly grand strategy game with vast scope and depth, strategy guides tend to be more the manuals that the game SHOULD have shipped with. That's because game manuals tend to be absolutely useless now-a-days. Total war, is an exeption in both cases.This strategy guide is simply a must-have for any true fan of the game. Sure, you can get by without it. The manual for total war is actually pretty good as far as video game manuals go. But the strategy guide expounds on every aspect touched by the manual and offers a more comprehensive look at the finer points as well as some aspects that are completely absent from the manual but are quite helpful.If nothing else you'll want to shell out the money for this simply for the unit specs. The guide gives you a detailed look at every unit in the game (this guide predates the expansion pack though, so only the original units are shown). This is a GODSEND! You get the exact combat values for each unit, along with information on how to effectively use each unit type. There's also a nice look at the TW combat system and how it works to use these numbers, as well as bonuses and other modifying factors such as terrain, woods, etc etc. If that wasnt enough they also take a look at morale and all the variables that play into it. This is pretty detailed and nitty gritty (hopefully they didnt leave stuff out!).Now anytime you fight a battle you thought you had in the bag and lost for reasons unknown you can take a look at the intricacy of the TW combat system and find out why! This is a game that NEEDS a strategy guide as there are many complex elements and strategic and tactical variables. Things like morale, command, vices and virtues, weather, terrain, fatigue, weapons, armor, formation and more can greatly impact the outcome of a battle. Remember one things that seperates TW from an RTS is that even a group of lowly peasants (the weakest unit in the game) can defeat a group of Royal nights (the strongest) if other factors are just right (I've seen it happen myself). That's what makes this game so amazing and so deep - and that's why u need this book if you ever REALLY want to know the game well (the game itself only gives you very vague ideas of a unit's abillities EX \\"strong charge, weak defense\\").There's also some nice walk throughs for the historical battles, some useful tips, a full list of vices/virtues and thier effects, a list of titles, a quick overview for basic strategies to playing each faction in the full campaign, and some other goodies.Could it have had more? YES! I would like have seen a more comprehensive look at the combat system and an indepth assesment of each unit in addition to the stats. Also the tips and tactics are pretty simplistic. They could have gone into a much better analysis of battle tactics and formations. They never go as far as they could, but as strategy guides go, this is one of the better ones. Kudos to Brady Games for thier work and one can only hope the upcoming guide for \\"Rome: TW\\" from Prima will be as good.I also reccomend you go read Sun Tzu's \\"The Art Of War\\" And either \\"On War\\" or \\"The Principals of War\\" by Carl Von Clauswitz. These will help you improve your tactics and generalship greatly as the designers made the game to mirror many of the real world concepts laid out in these works."},{"Title":"Medieval: Total War(TM) Official Strategy Guide","review":"I orderd this guide two weeks ago only to be advised that it is NO LONGER Available.

As is stated in the forward of my Virago edition \\"No Signposts in the Sea is not a great novel.\\" It has a lot hat could be improved - none of the characters are fully fleshed out; Edmund too often slips into self-pity; the main characters are glib stereotypes - the Edmund is the stiff upper-lip buttoned up Brit, Laura is a cool still-waters-run-deep unattainable perfect woman; and the Colonel is a hard on the outside, soft on the inside military man - all characters we have seen before; and if by halfway through you haven't guessed the ending, there is something very wrong."},{"Title":"No signposts in the sea (Eagle books)","review":"Vita Sackville-West had a colorful, interesting life. It might have been a better idea for me to read her autobiography, if she ever wrote one. Some people say that this novel is indeed quite autobiographical, but I would reply, \\"only in a limited way.\\" This novel features some rather stuffy Victorian poetry, Orientalist descriptions of places that never existed, but are rather tutti-frutti composites of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, all seen with a naturally condescending eye, and the whole unpleasant gamut of upper class English manners and attitudes. Her characters are so careful not to intrude, not to reveal their own ideas or preferences, that they miss love, they miss life itself. The two main characters long for human contact-more especially, Edmund Carr, the chief protagonist, who is suffering from an invisible but terminal illness-but their carefully cultivated aloofness prevents it. I include this sentence as a single example---\\"....she added, as though fearing that her question might have been too personal, too indiscreet, and also that my answer might involve her into betraying her own opinion...\\" These are two people falling in love ??While NO SIGNPOSTS IN THE SEA is cleverly constructed, it is ultimately too sentimental, too Hollywood-ish, and too marked by class prejudices to rate as good literature. I would call it light-weight romance by a woman who should have been capable of much better. Three stars is pretty generous, I believe."},{"Title":"No signposts in the sea (Eagle books)","review":"Though this book is no stylistic masterpiece on a par with anything by Woolf or Bowen, I think it does encapsulate what Sackville-West was all about as a writer. Though it is not her best work, it is autobiographical and contains some of her most illuminating insights on love and marriage. Some very good period poetry is included throughout the novel, which is written in the style of a diary/journal composed by the protagonist, Edmund Carr, who is dying of cancer I believe.The writer of the introduction, Victoria Glendinning, observes that there is an error in the characterization of Edmund Carr because there is no credible connection between the person he was as a controversial and influential columnist, and the person who is composing the journal. I have to disagree with her here. I think that the novel rather showcases the person that Edmund Carr has become and is becoming after learning he has only a few months to live. This \\"new\\" Edmund violently contrasts with the Edmund Carr who was the aggressive columnist unafraid to state matters plainly and realistically. Once on the journey, we see an Edmund Carr full of poetry, and in love with a woman. I think this was rather insightful of Sackville-West, and I hold it to be the mark of a great writer to know that a round character has a personality that is not static, but that can change and change quickly, no matter what the expectations.Edmund himself often comments on how he has changed, particularly when he considers the very philosophical thoughts he is entertaining while on the ship, thoughts he never entertained before. English reticence and manners do interfere with this love he is feeling for Laura. He is unable to tell her what he is going through, unable to share the burden, which would have made the story more poignant, and perhaps less painful or at least more merciful for Laura, who has to break it to Edmund that she has fallen in love with him too. Edmund had blinded himself to that possibility, although to the reader it is rather obvious. The very next day after her admission, Edmund has died and nothing else is possible. One is left feeling very awful for Laura, and rather disgusted with Edmund to keep such a thing from her, the woman he professed to love so much in the pages of the book.The novel contains some very valuable insights on love and marriage, and what these things meant to Sackville-West. It struck me that what comes through in this novel is the personality that Virginia Woolf loved so much. After reading this book, I could see why Virginia Woolf loved Vita Sackville-West.Tip: This is an excellent book to read after a romantic break-up."},{"Title":"No signposts in the sea (Eagle books)","review":"This is the first Sackville-West that I've read and I think that it's unfortunate that I began with her last book. It tells the story of a journalist who discovers he only has a short time to live and decides to take a sea voyage in the company of a widow. The book felt rushed and a little slight-- one can't help but think about the fact that Sackville-West died the year following publication-- but there were so many good things in it that I will be going back to pick up an earlier work."},{"Title":"Hyperion: A Romance","review":"I'm horrible at writing reviews, but apparently there aren't any of which I could find for this title, please bare with me on the review... If you are familiar with books from this era, they are usually published in segments and later put into one full book, (such is this case). Details on the four sections of this book are as follows:Book 1 & 2: Story of a man named Paul Flemming, who lost a loved one and is on a journey through Germany. This is almost entirely thoughts on philosophy discussed between himself, his good friend Baron (who departs at the end of the second book), people he meets, people telling stories and sharing opinions, most of which is naming and contemplating the works of other famous writers, poets, artists, musicians, songs and so on, and reflecting their own sentiments of the works.Book 3: Much of the previous, now in Switzerland, but with an introduction to a good friend Mr Berkley and Mary, who shares similar interests and he quickly comes to love. But in telling a story, he embarrasses himself and decides to leave with his friend, Berkley, to continue his travels.Book 4: Now with a more negative outlook, Flemming travels with his friend when a storm follows and Paul falls ill. After a few weeks, he begins to feel better, and Mr Berkley reads to him. Soon fit to move on, the story continues. Paul is more on the subject of life and death, and with, (at least to me,) an unhealthy interest in graveyards. I guess he's in a transitional period. He meets more people and is inspired by their stories. At the end, he hears the voice of his Mary in the next room and dreams of her. But instead of seeing her, he leaves to continue his travels.Mostly theory and observation, but not enough practice. Given his circumstances, I'd imagine he'd be going through changes. Some interesting introspection and thoughts on life; though, if you're looking for a story with a definite feeling of beginning, middle and end, this is more of a philosopher's book told through the heart of a young man in the midst of a deep existential crisis.PS. I'm under the assumption, also, that Longfellow chose the name Hyperion from the uncompleted epic poem of John Keats (as Longfellow seems to be a fan), since the poem talks about despair of the Titans and their fall to the Olympions. Keats temporarily gave up because it felt too Milton-esk (which Longfellow seems to also be a fan) and from tending to his brother who succumbed to death from TB in 1819. Later Keats attempted continuing the poem (The Fall of Hyperion: A Dream): \\"framing it with a personal quest to find truth and understanding\\"..... Of course, for all I know, Longfellow mentioned this in the Introduction, which I did not read...Ah, as for aesthetics, this is a lovely little edition."},{"Title":"Systems of formal logic","review":"An excellent reference.Shows the properties of a great many formal logic systems (such as standard PC and intuitionist PC) by building them as extensions of simpler systems with more easily proven properties."},{"Title":"Sticks & Stones & Ice Cream Cones, The Craft Book For Children","review":"I raised three children with this book and used it more often than Dr. Spock's. The recipes are easy and fun and the crafts were simple, clever and easy for moms and kids. My children were crazy about it and pulled it out anytime there was &quot;nothing to do.&quot; In over ten years of use, it never let us down. My copy is old now and totally worn out so I'm glad to see it's still around. I want a new one for my grandaughter!"},{"Title":"The End of Evolution: A Journey in Search of Clues to the Third Mass Extinction Facing Planet Earth","review":"The End of Evolution is a survey of geologic time presented through the research and viewpoint of a successful and well-respected paleontologist. Dr. Peter Ward presents in depth analysis of each period of the earth's past as revealed through the fossil record and modern scientific theory. The book focuses on the events leading up to and following the two major mass extinction's of the past, and presents detailed arguments that point towards human impacts as the cause of a current third event. Ward's first hand experience and knowledge of the constantly changing and highly debated scientific theories of evolution and extinction are combined with an extremely presentable writing style. The book begins with a background of evolution throughout the Paleozoic era (570-245mya) ending at the Permian-Triassic boundary in which climatic change and the lowering of the earth's ocean levels brought about for the first time a collapse in the pyramid of life. These changes resulted in the extinction of 90% of the earth's inhabitants and left the world open for new species to evolve to greatness in the wake of disaster. Ward presents ideas, theories, and many views of a variety of respected scientists. One such debate deals with the second mass extinction 65 million years ago, also known as the KT boundary. Ward reveals information about the great discoveries of evidence convincing scientists of a second great climatic and oceanic change. These changes followed by an untimely asteroid impact led to a new hope for mammals and a tragic end for possibly the world's most successful rulers, the dinosaurs. Finally, Ward brings together similarities of earlier extinction's and provides extensive evidence proving that a third extinction is currently underway. Siting research from many scientists regarding the great mammalian extinction's of North and South America and the tragic impact of human habitation on the ecosystem of Hawaii. The book's contents are at times presented in a reference style, while at other times as stories and warnings. The End of Evolution is a primer of biological and geological thought and Dr. Ward maintains a respectfully unbiased approach at presenting a highly debatable and sophisticated topic."},{"Title":"The End of Evolution: A Journey in Search of Clues to the Third Mass Extinction Facing Planet Earth","review":"The End of Evolution is one of the best books I have read. As a geologist, I appreciated the attention to detail and his ability to draw corollaries between past extinction events and the current global situation. The message in this book is clear and well presented, whereas our planet has seen a host of extinction events, the one we are currently in the midst of is different. The difference being that this one is largely anthropogenic in nature. I think Peter Ward did a great job of sounding the alarm and providing a compelling case for reassessment of how we interact with our environment. I have recommended this book countless times over the years, and continue to do so. It may be tedious to the non-earth scientist, but is a great read none-the-less.An interesting linkage can be made to scattered comments by Stephen Hawking on why we have not yet found compelling evidence of life on other planets. His thesis is that perhaps the 'human intelligence' we so highly prize, may actually be a non-beneficial evolutionary development. That is, our self-awareness and ability to mold our environment may actually lead to degradation of the environment (to a lethal level) and a subsequent self-inflicted extinction. Could it perhaps be that PW has given us documentation of the path to this end on Earth?"},{"Title":"The End of Evolution: A Journey in Search of Clues to the Third Mass Extinction Facing Planet Earth","review":"END OF EVOLUTION MASS EXTINICT &amp; BIODIVERSITY by WARD,PETER is a brilliant look into the history of planet Earth and the life that once inhibited this planet. Throughout the history mass extinctions have occured resulting in the destruction of old world also resulting in the evolution of a new world. Throughout the book Dr. Ward describes these mass extinctions and warns of another mass extinction that may take place if Human Beings are not careful.
