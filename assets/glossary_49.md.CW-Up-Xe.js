Mrs. O'Beirne does a great job outlining the case against feminism. Her research, at times overwhelming, identifies the excesses of the feminist agenda. Her wry sense of humor makes the sometimes disturbing information easy to read. Her listing of statistics, reports and observations that counter the feminist movement are impressive. It also raises the question as to why the media has not given this information the same coverage as the reports supporting the feminist agenda gets.The extremism of the feminist is also highlighted with examples as current as the recent Harvard furor over differences between the sexes. Viva la difference!

Truth be told, it is actually individuals who write books like these who are \\"making the world worse.\\" Please, do not even bother to misinform, frustrate, or baffle yourself with this drivel.

Finally, there is a book that succeeds in peeling away the rhetoric and giving readers just what they need: the real facts about gender in America. It is true that O'Beirne has an argument to make, but she lets the facts make it for her. This extremely well researched and clearly written book puts the facts first and lets history, science, and the statistics speak for themselves. And speak they do.O'Beirne mixes sometimes amusing, and often alarming anecdotes with stats and studies that support her conclusion. And, while making many convincing points, the author lets her sense of humor come through and helps the reader approach the issues discussed with a healthy amount of common sense and skepticism. What she succeeds in proving is that most of the supposed controversy surrounding \\"gender issues\\" comes from the steady stream of misinformation we have been fed by the Feminist movement.All in all, the book is a not only a pleasure to read (I laughed out loud at parts), but also incredibly informative. I now feel well equipped to rebut the typical feminist propaganda be it in the workplace, parent teacher meetings, or wherever else it appears.

It raises the issue for discussion. Women have been sold a bill of goods by feminist ideology. It has taken us from one set of no choices to another set of no choices. It has benefitted men and corporations primarily and has hurt our nation's kids. If one doubts what I'm saying, simply examine the culture over the past 30 years. Who has benefitted most? Women decided to proclaim their \\"sexual freedom\\". Who's gained most by that? As Dr. Laura said, now men don't even have to pretend to like a woman or buy her dinner. All they have to do is show up to get sex. That says a lot for women's self-respect, doesn't it? Corporations have benefitted by having women out in the workforce to be exploited, right along with the guys! Children are raised in impersonal day care centers, indoctrinated into the current cultural value system. It's harmed the economy, family life and community life. It has cheapened marriage.Ms O'Beirne's book raises the issues in a fairly conversational tone.

As someone who knew Betty Friedan quite well and who helped her with her second book by giving her my perspective on the men's view of the women's liberation movement over lunch at Bobby Van's in Bridgehampton (lunch lasted three hours, I was obliged to pick up the tab and she never gave me a credit in the book), I wanted to strangle her on several occasions. I advised her on ERA, but she blew that entirely. The same was true with Bella Abzug, one of the rudest people I have ever met. As for Gloria Steinem, I'm not sure O'Beirne is aware of her C.I.A. connections. The C.I.A. funded the organization Gloria worked for that sent students to youth festivals around the world to disrupt the Communists. One of them was Allard K. Lowenstein, whose biography I wrote (The Pied Piper-Allard K. Lowenstein and the Liberal Dream.) Lots of these liberal types had C.I.A. connections, including Lowenstein, because the Agency feared that the Communists would take advantage of the disaffection amongst groups of people with serious gripes. Friedan did not have these connenctions. To the contrary, the radical unions she wrote for sent her for training at the Highlander School in Tennessee, which was run by Communists. The myth of her being a fed up housewife in the suburbs was a cover for her radical agenda. What happened was that the legitimate need for reform to give women more opporunity turned into a man hating, feminist ideological form of fascism. McKinnon's Feminist Theory of the State, is nothing more than female Marxism, totally tyrannical and oppressive. What we need is some balalnce. By going in the opposite direction, perhaps O'Beirne can generate a swing back to the center. Let's hope so. On the issue of abortion, let's be honest. This was about letting a middle class white woman who got knocked up over a college weekend not to have to force the guy to marry her. Doctors routinely performed these abortions for serious fees. Women not so lucky were mutilated by abortionists in back alleys, their lives ruined. Abortion was never meant to be a substitute for birth control. Even Ruth Bader Ginsberg says Blackman probably went too far in Roe v Wade. The point is not to throw the baby out with the bath water. Sure, expose the excesses, but don't go so far as to obliterate the needed reforms that got adopted. Friedan was right about a lot of stuff. We should give her credit for that, even if she was also often wrong."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"I just finished it and can't say enough positive things about it.

[...] O'Beirne seeks to bring this ideology down with modern examples, which, if people would take the time to get the right message from the book, she manages to achieve.Many people have criticized the author for not being more thankful for her roots - such as the right to vote, to be in a position of privilege to write this book etc - which shows these people have totally missed the point. The early feminists were pioneers, fighting the obvious injustices that should not exist against either sex. However, O'Beirne addresses the ugly face of modern day feminists, not the pioneers of the early half of last century which nobody can discount as fighting for fairness and equality.This book shows todays self professed feminists are anything but, [...]. Todays feminist seeks more to demean men than promote women, though the book will show how many of these icons believe women should have rights, status and privileges that no man would ever be allowed, thus making the world worse - if your the wrong person. Its a two pronged attack which leads to many of the double standards in todays society and many of these are discussed in the book, although as stated more direct evidence and quotes would have given the issues/opinions more credibility.The book can get a little anti-female in some of it statements, but thought provoking on the basic issues is enough of a step forward for me. The book doesn't cover all aspects of how feminism is negatively affecting our world, and specifically the U.S., but it is a good example of some of the more extreme cases.Recommended."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"Rather than generally describing the feminist movement's destruction of the American family, O'Beirne provides specifics --both in terms of characters and behaviors that have influenced our culture.

How exactly she is so tuned in to the thoughts of people is unclear, since their recorded statements in the media bear little in common with Kate's presentation.The book is filled with misrepresentations of facts, and out right lies. Though at least she has a lot in common with the Bush Administration on this one.Her grasp of Statistics is non-existent. So her whole chapter on income disparity is moot. (You can't just pick a few random occupations and average the salaries together!)Kate is apparently stuck in the 1950s, in an I Love Lucy rerun, and wants the rest of the USA stuck in there with her.

She assembles a comprehensive argument about how ladies -- namely, liberal ladies -- have mucked up pretty much everything. She persuasively argues that liberal women and their left-wing agenda are forcing children to accept an androgynous America and destroy men in the process. Abortion, gay marriage, cable TV -- Mrs. O'Beirne adopts a \\"take no prisoners\\" philosophy, and wins.Why only three stars? She fails to go far enough.

She quotes Robin Morgan, a founder of MS magazine, saying that \\"We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage\\" (P 2). Fast forward about forty years, and what are the consequences Robin and friends have wrought?An illegitimacy rate not seen before in recorded history, the collapse of stable marriages, and children awash in problems of drugs, STDs, and suicide.

Kate O'Beirne provides an amazing insight into the biased world of feminism in which men are considered oppressors and women, especially those who don't tow with the party line, are considered tools (both meanings of the word).O'Beirne's analysis of feminist policies, ranging from schools to the military, demonstrates just how far feminists have gone from the \\"equality\\" feminism supposedly represents.In just over 200 pages, she masterly illustrates how feminists contort statistics and studies, manipulate the sympathies of the public, and policitize issues like women in the military not for the sake of the women involved, but for the perpetuation of their politicial agenda. And to O'Beirne's credit, she does so not only by systematically walking the reader through the entire situation from its beginning, but by quoting various outrageous statements made by the feminists themselves.Having actually read the book, I definitely would recommend it to anyone who is interested in a critical analysis of modern feminism and the current political atomosphere surrounding men's and women's issues."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"The groans and shrieks from the Left in response to Kate O'Beirne's new book are signs that she has hit a vital nerve. Good going, Kate, especially for your all too accurate account of the sociosexual and familial \\"ruin\\" wreaked by the feminazis, who dominate women's studies and continue to indoctrinate countless Americans.If the institutions upon which we depend for survival are to endure, it is necessary for the public to realize that radical feminism has decimated marriage, child-rearing, military readiness, and the education (especially) of boys.If O'Beirne can be faulted, it is because she understates the perverse and self-defeating hatred of men which many feminists propagate, and which has resulted, according to Lionel Tiger, author of The Decline of Males, in males becoming \\"out-laws rather than in-laws.\\" Similarly, as New York Times columnist David Brooks concludes, \\"the big problem [with \\"time-warp feminism\\"] is not the women who stay [in the kitchen] but the men who leave.\\"So let us welcome the frothing of the mouth at such revelations.

It is ironic that all the people who give 1-star reviews attack this soft spoken reasonable woman with the filthiest bile you can imagine and still have the nerve to call HER hateful.I consider myself well informed and wasn't going to buy this book because I know who the screaming fanatics are who make the world worse.

Really, the biggest downside to an excellent survey of the unintended (mostly) and unanticipated consequences of the 20th century feminist movement is that it often only brushes the surface. I nearly always believe O'Beirne, even if I don't always agree, but I'd often like more on the given subject.

Either five stars or one? Is it really that polarizing? I read this book, cover to cover, and can honestly say that it's got some good points, some bad points, and some controversial points. One reviewer claims that the scholarship is poor, which is patently untrue; it has copious endnotes and each direct quote is scrupulously documented. Some of the arguments, such as in the wage gap chapter, ARE a bit weak. However, the logic of the Title IX chapter (that non-sports-playing female monority applicants are actually disadvantaged by Title IX in favor of those seeking positions on sports teams) is extremely compelling and should make anyone who is serious about academics uncomfortable with our university system.Whether you agree or disagree with the premise of this book, PLEASE at least take the time to read it. Most of the reviews here are uninformed polemics and don't help to further rational dialogue."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"So many people who rate this book as one star claim that Kate is attacking those women who, in the not so distant past, fought rightly for women's equality and that somehow Kate is \`stuck in the 50s'. They have not read the book, or refuse to acknowledge the facts, continuing their hypocritical argument that modern feminism is about equality.Modern day feminism, of course, has nothing to do with equality. It seeks more to elevate women's privileges, rights and interests above and beyond that of what men receive. None of Kates topics are from a time period anywhere near the 50s and I felt the book, and some of its reviews, show how some women are becoming worse than men ever were. These women blatantly discriminate, think they have a right to do so, and are proud of it. There is a big gap between the women's rights movement of the 40s 50s and 60s and of modern day feminism. The negative reviews this book receives has shown how many feminists continue to link today's movement with yesteryears and, somehow, that makes them automatically righteous. These women deserve their own chapter in Kates book \`Women who make the world worse'.It is not difficult to see the effect that these women have had on society. Kate structures her book well and tackles each example with solid, researched information. Government legislation, biased family courts, ignorance towards lagging performance in schools of boys and the feminization of the military, sports, workplace and justice system. The idiocy over the Harvard \`incident' was my favorite chapter, illustrating how some women will not accept that men may be better at some things than women, but applaud women who excel beyond boys in a women focused education, work and political system. There's lots of money and jobs out there for women who cry foul when they don't get their own way. Kate is able to highlight just what modern feminists have to lose should men ever get equality. Harvard has been forced to put forward $50 million to fund a new equality department which, headed by a staunch feminist no doubt, will justify it own existence and secure its own funding based on perpetuating female oppression, whether it occurs or not.Kate does not tackle all of modern feminisms double standards, there certainly are plenty more of them out there, but she does an excellent job of identifying and analyzing the ones that have the most effect on our society. I am glad that some women have a good grasp on the facts of modern day feminism and are able to separate the differences between feminism and equality so effectively. Kate is highlighting not how far women have come, but how far some women have gone. It gives hope for equality....some day.There is a saying amongst mens rights groups. \`Reverse a gender issue and see if it would still be tolerated'. Would women tolerate the treatment men receive in society today?Of course not. That would be discrimination, wouldn't it?"},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"Judging by the many one-star reviews, this book has touched a very sore nerve. It is a sad fact of current society that such a well-written, well-researched, and reasonable book elicits emotional attacks from many who seem not to have actually read it. Many people dislike unpleasant facts that contradict their chosen dogmas. Modern feminism is in many ways a secular religion whose adherents abhor anything critical(factual or otherwise)of their raison d'etre. O'Beirne exposes them for what they are. If you are interested in a fact-based exposition of feminism, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"insightful, what a girl needs to read.

Women who are held by some in virtual icon status are examined, dissected, and exposed for all to see as the flailing insect-intellects they are.What is exceptional about the book is its explanation of how these charlatans have been able to do so much damage to society with so little personal cost to themselves. There is a brilliant insight here --that the truly evil acts of those who are \\"politically correct\\" are done at great cost and harm to others, and society at large, but the perpetrators are never held to account.A book like this is a good start. It has been interesting watching the squirming denials and rebuttals from the left, all of which ring as hollow as the craniums of the women on parade in O'Beirn's novel.A great read, and well worth the time."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"For far too long, Feminists have had a blank slate to make whatever nauseating, outrageous, unsupported claims they pleased aided by the mainstream media.

Whatever your opinion on women's rights, she is articulate. If the book had a less insulting cover, maybe more people might check it out and agree with at least some of her views. The gist of her argument is that men and women are meant to complement one another. She does not want to see hostility between the sexes, but rather peaceful and harmonious coexistence. Certainly, there has been no shortage of abuse of women all over the world and over many centuries. However, there are many good and worthy men deserving of respect.The author centers on the more radical theorists among feminist academics to illustrate her point. Many of these women attack men in the classroom and berate \\"the patriarchy.\\" She argues that, since women have the ability to bear children, they have to make choices that men do not. This carries into some interesting discussions about comparable worth and whether women have made strides in their careers and compensation versus men. O'Beirne interviews women who were devoted to their careers and others who were more family oriented. She believes that the only reason women, on average, make less than men is because they choose to leave the work force to bear children."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"I almost didn't buy this book because of the most recent reviews. (I hadn't gone back to the previous reviews, if I had I would have not hesitated in purchasing it.) Someone said that it was poorly researched without supporting documentation of information or quotes - wrong. There is research data galore, 19 pages to be exact. Another reviewer accused her of attacking the women (feminists) who made her success possible - wrong again. Women have had a long history of writing and publishing before O'beirne's targeted group joined feminist forces, probably before they were born. Other women, as well as men, were responsible for the changes there.What O'beirne has done is shown were feminism has gone wrong. That's where the \\"radical\\" (from another reviewer) comes in. I have read enough feminist information to know that O'beirne is not portraying that group inaccurately, but she does disagree and proves the foundation of why she feels so and why it should be important to society as a whole.I thought this book was going to be about bashing particular women which I wasn't interested in (that was one of my hesitations, aided by the illustration on the cover.) This wasn't. It was researched and documented like any other topic would be. She used others, males and females, words, examples, and experiences to support her point of view. That is the right way to do it.PS. Why has Amazon chosen to put 2 one-star (negative) reviews in it's \\"Spotlight Review\\" when the overwhelming reader reviews for the book show 4 - 5 (positive) stars? Interesting."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"Apparently, a huge number of people, in an attempt to artificially degrade this book's overall rating in Amazon's reader review section, have submitted one-star ratings for \\"WomenWho Make the World Worse\\" without reading the book - in fact there are websites that recommend this tactic. Once again the Left, when it can't win in an honest debate, resorts to deceit and manipulation, a point which Kate O'Beirne brings up in her book. It's legitimate, and understandable, especially given the author's combative style, for liberals to refuse to read her book - there are plenty of books by left-wing writers that I couldn't stand to read myself. What is not acceptable is for them to abuse the forum that Amazon provides for honest criticism. Don't read the book - fine. But if you want to review the book, at least read it first. Don't poison the marketplace of ideas.O'Beirne's withering contempt for radical feminism is obviouson almost every page but with the mountain of well-documentedevidence and historical fact she marshals, that contempt is richly deserved. Her chapters on institutional day care, theradicals' anti-family agenda, women in the military and collegesports and other key issues are well worth the read, but what should be especially eye-opening was her demonstration of how modern-day feminists have systematically lied about the ideas and goals of their early 20th-century forebears in the service of their pro-abortion, anti-family agenda. One can, as I do, be in favour of a woman's right to choose to end a pregnancy (subect to reasonable regulation). But we are also obliged to engage the issue honestly and fairly. Moreover, those who oppose abortion on principle deserve a lot more tolerance from the pro-choice side than they've gotten up to now.The radical feminists' bad-faith caterwauling aside, the lifechoices of all women, whether to become traditional homemakers orleaders in business and public affairs, should be respected andhonoured. No one has made this case better than Kate O'Beirne."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"Is there much more to say? The arguments she raises are fatally flawed and completely unfounded. Unless, of course, you get your data from Focus On The Family or the 700 Club. I wish I could explain why she dislikes her fellow women of the world so much."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"In WOMEN WHO MAKE THE WORLD WORSE, Kate O'Beirne takes to task the entire radical feminist movement that she accuses of twisting external reality until it conforms to feminist dogma. O'Beirne considers the effect that feminism has had on a wide range of American culture: the family, day care, employment, schooling, sports, the military, and abortion. She sees a common thread linking them. In each case, O'Beirne suggests that radical feminists examine the interplay between the genders as being based on and influenced primarily by cultural and learned phenomena rather than on inherited traits. In essence, O'Beirne resurrects the old nature versus nurture argument, with feminists rallying behind the latter and reality behind the former. Neither O'Beirne nor the many radical feminists whom she cites are willing to admit that the truth may be some uneasy and hard to measure combination of the two. Yet of the two diametrically opposing views, I think that O'Beirne's is the more nearly correct. It is hard to imagine that in every culture since the dawn of time, that men and women have been on a level playing field only because of learned behavior. Feminists cry out that this learned behavior creates the many perceived gaps between the genders. It seems more reasonable that learned behavior simply sprang from the real and observable differences between men and women, and that if both genders rationalize sex-defined roles, these roles are more likely to be the result of hard-nosed pragmatism rather than ephemeral stereotyping. A number of reviewers have justly complained that O'Beirne has been shoddy in her documentation of who said what and when and where, and these lapses have hurt her case that feminists twist reality rather than reflect it. But yet, the preponderance of her examples is convincing in its depth and breath. For feminists who wish to refute O'Beirne successfully, they will have to do far more than just take cheap shots at women like Kate O'Beirne who dare to argue that there are differences between the genders and that the failure to acknowledge them is no more than a futile exercise in self-delusion."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"So sad that the left had to stage a mass technological book burning.The book was an enjoyable read, with BTW not ONE reference to Sex and the City as the leftist brownshirts here claim.

Usually, they have a target selection on many books. Indeed, Kate O'Beirne's book is very straightforward and very clear; it is a good book for one thing overall. It raises the issue for discussion and it can make a good cocktail conversation as well as a good college study and discussion (women studies). Women have been sold a bill of goods by feminist ideology. And in many ways Kate O'Beirne is right. A fine book and well researched. Anyone who has children should read this and take heart to the author's insight of the current state of gender bending. Also the fact that many liberal and feminist women have impacted current social issues to American\`s women detriment.Indeed Kate O'Beirne pulls no punches and takes no prisoners in her uncomplimentary indictment of modern feminists. Since the Feminine Mystique was written, Feminism started as a sensible idea to give women equality and dignity. But along the years that have changed, becoming more of a political bill board with an oblique and catastrophic agenda, impacting society and causing a dysfunctional modus operandi in families, corporations, sports, the armed forces and schools.Kate O'Beirne's book is a waking call for the many innocent women out there who still believe in the true essence of feminism without understanding the repercussions of the future."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"Wonderful book; gets right to the truth of many of the leading women of the Left & exposes them for their utterly ridiculous views.

She is merely an accessory, an arm trophy, and I suppose when the seasons change and the little woman is dumped for a newer model, well, that's ok too.Why do books like this get published at all? How come decent writers struggle all the time to get in print, and this sort of mendacious bilge can make its way into the culture. It does not speak well of us at all.And as for Kate, well, I hope her fondest dreams come true and she gets what she so desperately wants: complete subjugation.

Her position in this book reminds me of the legion of closeted gay GOP politicans who constantly pass repressed, hate filled judgements on homosexuals (and spiteful laws), while secretly being what they most despise in life.Ms O'Beirne's self-loathing of herself and strong thoughtful women leaps from the pages like someone who has lit her hair on fire and then trys to put it out with a hammer.The Lace Curtain Lady sounds as if she is dispensing missives and imagined wisdom to the pitiful Shanty Towne Chattel of the delicate sex who should be grateful for her Pious Prattle."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"&#65279;&#8220;Traditional values&#8221;?

I honestly don't know how a woman can say things like this, or that they have any respect for what a woman truly is. Even more upsetting are some of the comments made in the reviews...To my fellow MO reviewer, saying \\"he is more qualified to review it than those who gave it 1 star because he actually read it...many of them gave information that backed up them saying they had read it. I like how he thinks he is \\"more qualified\\" because he agrees with the author. And, unsurprisingly, it was a man that wrote it. Another reviewer says the book takes aim at some well-deserved targets. This is one of the most ignorant things I have ever heard. People whose opinions differ from our own do not deserve to be targeted for scorn because of it. Our right to free speech and opinions is supposedly what makes everyone want to come to our country. People who say things like that reviewer said disgust me, and it is they who are a threat to our rights. People don't seem to realize that you don't have to be one extreme or the other.

It's not women who are making the world worse---it's the idiots currently in charge of the government, starting with the president and vice-president and continuing through Rove and DeLay and a herd of congressmen. I'm sorry that the conservatives think women should stay home and raise families and not poke their heads out of the kitchen or nursery. I'm sorry they believe gutsy women are the cause of all the ills in the universe.

Had this book been written by a smart, informed woman with rational views (and research to really back up her point) and not the same old garbage, perhaps this book would have been a worthwhile read.O'Beirne should get down on her knees and ask forgiveness for all the trees she's had senselessly slaughtered to have this book come to print. The irony of course is that it is because of the impact of the women's movement that women like O'Beirne can write their silly, misguided opinions.And for those of you reviewers confusing mainstream feminism with radical feminism, it's quite obvious you've no idea what you are talking about. If you don't even know what feminism is and how complex it can be, then you really shouldn't talk.

She has a highly exaggerated view of the innate differences between the male and female of the species. And she's got an axe to grind with feminists--a term which she seems to define as \\"women who lack maternal instincts and hate men.\\" (Note: My words, not the author's.)O'Beirne's arguments aren't particularly strong: She's so quick to blame feminists for a wide array of social problems that she can't seem to see any *other* contributing factors. At several points, she dismisses arguments with which she disagrees by calling them \\"ludicrous\\" or flatly stating \\"they're wrong.\\" And there's many a sociologist who would take her assertions to task. But the book seems tailored toward two specific ends; namely, to make feminists (of both genders) see red, and to make people who already share O'Beirne's views feel vindicated.

Young women need to read this book to learn that they can follow their own path and not one dictated by a few outspoken feminists who still (mistakenly) think they speak for all women.

The feminist movement is not without fault because it is made up of human beings who are not perfect. But it is not responsible for the state of our society. We, all of us made this mess together. We are all in this mess together. However, some elements of our society bear more responsiblity than others.People like the rich and successful Kate O'Beirne would like you to blame everything on certain targets (scapegoats) like feminists and liberals (oooo shiver, shiver) so that her class escapes any scrutiny or responsiblity for the mess.The feminist movement is not responsible for fleeing jobs and lack of adequate funding for schools. Boys don't usually fail in school when they have involved and concerned parents, ie parents who have the energy to be involved. Most women are working outside the household because there is a lack of good paying jobs. It takes more than one breadwinner these days for a family to get by. Latchkey kids are the result. Feminism didn't have a thing to do with that. The stress on the American family has far more to do with the economy than feminism.This is the reality Kate O'Beirne would like you to ignore. Oh, no, focus on those high profile elite \\"liberal\\" feminist women as the source of all your woes.Oh, and one last thing. Do the accomplishments of American women athletes diminish the accomplishments of the men? Title ix doesn't really represent a whole lot of money in the grand scheme of things.

Primero, muchos cubanos han contado o pueden contar historias verdaderamente escalofriantes sobre su vida en Cuba, pero muy pocos de ellos pueden contar lo que vivi&oacute; Jorge Masetti, y que nos cuenta en este libro. Segundamente, en el mundo pueden haberse publicado muchas novelas de espionaje, pero pocas son historias reales - esta, de hecho, es una historia muy muy real, que tiene lugar en la Cuba de hoy, a noventa millas de la Florida.

Pigs can carry some deadly diseases, and male circumcision prevents certain cancers & is ideally done on the 8th day. He concluded that behind such medical advice must be God's direct wisdom. Thus he pitched his book into the apologetics arena.While some regulations, such as quarantine & hand washing, overlap with medical wisdom, I doubt that their rationale was primarily medical. Eg, pigs can be safe enough if cooked well, while some foods on the OK list can be unsafe enough (cf. Gordon Wenham, The Book Of Leviticus (Eerdmans), 1985:167f.). More to the point, the NT removed the regulations. Should we conclude it lacked God's wisdom?

Her work appears on the Health Network and she enjoys developing gluten-free products for manufacturers. She also counsels patients who are allergic to gluten. Carol's journey began with a case of chronic sinusitis. When she stayed away from wheat, she finally found relief.Celiac disease now afflicts 1:133 Americans and is now the nation's most common inherited autoimmune disorder. Celiacs have to avoid gluten because it prevents the absorption of nutrients in food. This causes a cascading problem and can lead to anemia, osteoporosis and other health problems like rashes, stomach aches and general fatigue.When I went to the store to find a Gluten-Free Flour Blend, I found the GF Garbanzo and Fava Flour blend by Bob's Red Mill. Apparently, Carol developed a gluten-free line for Bob's Red Mill. She also gives the recipe for her Sorghum Flour blend in this book.Today I made the most delicious Banana Muffins using Carol's recipe from page 73. It is a quick bread recipe and you can make a Banana Bread variation. I did use cup milk instead of the recommended -1/3. So, if you choose to buy a premixed flour blend, you might need to slightly adapt the liquid quantities. Overall, I was very impressed with the recipe and made 24 delicious and healthy banana muffins for breakfast. I'll freeze the leftover muffins for future banana muffin cravings.Last week, I decided to try the Basic Bread recipe in my bread machine and then sliced the bread thinly and dried it out in the oven for 20 minutes to make crackers. They are the best crackers I've ever tasted. So far, I've only found rice-based crackers at the store, so this was a wonderful solution. You will need to look for items like potato starch, Xanthan gum, guar gum, soy lecithin and cider vinegar. I used rice wine vinegar and another flour in place of the potato starch. So, these recipes can also be adapted to taste. Most of the ingredients are now readily available at your grocery store on the natural foods isle. If you can't locate these in your town, Carol gives plenty of online sources.This book is simply fascinating because the author is so knowledgeable and even suggests that you stay away from some flours you would never suspect. Her alternative list of flours for Gluten-Free baking will also be useful when you are shopping and reading labels. If you normally use wheat as a thickener, you might want to try Agar, Arrowroot, Cornstarch or Guar Gum. There is a handy substitute list on page 23.If you decide you are serious about the gluten-free lifestyle, you might want to go through this book and make a list of the special ingredients. Once you have rounded up about 5 main ingredients, you can easily put together a number of healthy recipes. Xanthan gum, gelatin powder, tapioca flour, potato starch, soy lecithin, guar gum, sorgum flour, tapioca flour and a choice of corn flour, almond flour or bean flour are needed for this cookbook. It is nice to know that if you are allergic to nuts, you can also use bean flour or corn flour.Recipes I'm dreaming about trying:Breakfast PizzaGranola with Rice FlakesPeanut Butter Cookies - I'll use Soy ButterChicken Fried SteakCinnamon Coffee CakePersonally, I have a ton more energy when I stay away from wheat products, so this recipe book is helping me to adapt my lifestyle.

If you are one of the millions of people with celiac sprue or other sensitivity to grains, this book will serve you well. The author has a very good understanding of the problems of avoiding wheat and gluten. She lists the commercial ingredients such as modified food starch, hydrolyzed vegetable protein that may be wheat in origin. She tells you how to read labels, and gives advice such as avoiding oatmeal which, though it has no gluten, may be processed in wheat facilities or have been grown with wheat and thus somewhat contaminated. The section on alternative grains like amaranth, quinoa, rice, wild rice, milo and sorghum is comprehensive.The recipes are for everything from pizza, breadsticks, foccacia to cakes, cookies, and other foods. The breadstick recipe tells you how to extrude the breadsticks from a hole in a plastic bag--a novel method easier than rolling dough for those tasty, crunchy snacks. The recipes frequently call for a flour mix recipe included in the book that substitutes for wheat flour. Even bread machines are covered.The book is well-written and an excellent resource for people with wheat and grain dietary restrictions. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Gluten-Free 101: Easy, Basic Dishes Without Wheat","review":"With this great cookbook, no one will ever guess that there's anything &quot;missing&quot; in the food.

The recipes are good if you are on a traditional American diet, but I do wish that she had at least discussed non-dairy and non-refined sugar substitutes.

One of my favorite recipes is the banana bread. I add more bananas and skip the raisins, but even my picky toddlers LOVE this sweet treat bread! The chocolate cake on page 121 is pretty good, too!

Scott Christensen's research was thorough on the subject of the Northern Shoshone and the massacre as well as well written. His book is engaging and its important. Its the story of more than Sagwitch. Its the story of a terrible time in U.S. history. Its also the story of a few dedicated men who tried to make a difference for the Northern Shoshone at significant personal cost and effort. I don't recall having heard of such an effort between a Native American tribe and white men working together to make a mutually desirable difference. It was an effort that preserved dignity. The experience speaks well of Sagwitch's band as well as the few white men who gave much. Washakie, the town they ultimately built no longer exists however Scott Christensen documents some of the success of the experience demonstrated in later generations. Such success is a tribute to Sagwitch, his people, George Washington Hill and others who contributed. Reading this account of this little known history is of value to me. A few people tried something that made a difference. I got more than I thought possible from the read."},{"Title":"A Study of Numbers: A Guide to the Constant Creation of the Universe","review":"Although this essay from a much younger Rene Schwaller, it none-the-less provides hours of contemplation on the metaphysical meaning of numbers. His ideas on numbers as they relate to cycles of (on-going)creation are rooted in a scientific background. He even goes so far as to demonstrate his ideas in a practical example of salt-crystal formation. If it weren't for the content involved, the book could be read in one evening as it is a slim volume. However, it IS philosophical and not casual reading by any stretch of the imagination. A book for anyone interested in the metaphysical side of numbers, sacred architecture, numerology and even the aspects of the Tarot may be better understood from this essay.As noted by the translators, one of whom is Robert Lawlor, Schwaller left emphatic instructions about how this work was to republished in accordance with his later studies on the Egyptian mysteries. Without going into great detail this book should probably be read after at least reading The Temple of Man by Schwaller.The Theology of Arithmetic by Iamblichus, Robin Waterfield (trans.) provides an excellent foundation to the Study of Numbers by Schwaller. Actually this text or one like it might've been Schwaller's inspiration in this study."},{"Title":"A Study of Numbers: A Guide to the Constant Creation of the Universe","review":"Frater Lubicz was a student of the \\"Hard School\\" of esoteric thought. In \\"A Study of Numbers\\", he continues his very unique style of linking everything to early Egyptian Metaphysics which he mastered in conveying to students during his lifetime. This time the subject matter is numbers and the entire book is based on the singular, novel, and facinating idea that manifestation in reality begins not with the \\"ONE\\", but with the \\"TRIUNE\\". Such a revelation should immediately appeal to Masonic and Rosicrucian students WHO KNOW THE LAW OF THE TRIANGLE from their respective studies and reveals the esoteric nature of Christendom. This book should be required reading for all serious esoteric students!"},{"Title":"A Study of Numbers: A Guide to the Constant Creation of the Universe","review":"This is a book that can be read in one day - but the seeds will cultivate in your mind for decades. In our age, it would be unthinkable to concider deities demonstrated through numbers and equations. Yet even the most ardent Bible reader must admit that there is no escaping them. Especially in our Christian legacy. Unfortantly, very few people show interest in learning about the spiritual dimension of numbers. Even though nature express harmony through mathematical proportions and archetypes.I'm not suggesting that this book will enlighten you on the Bible. Just that author was of a far higher caliber than we are used to dealing with. He focuses on the task at hand: how numbers determine hamonic relationships, and how the Egyptians and Greeks used this knowledge to infuse harmonic principles into the objects they made.I gave the book four stars because the author express himself exclusively in right-brain \\"mode of thought\\", and some people will not be able to endure that for more than a few pages.

It gives the outline and brief explication of a theory of all things, described in terms of numbers.It starts with the abstract and concrete basis of numbers and then goes on to identify cycles in their unfolding. Not a single word is redundant here, as usual in Schwaller's work; it cannot be comprehended without deep contemplation, and to be quite clear here, I didn't know if I ever would comprehend it upon first reading, but somehow somewhere sometime it starts a boomerang-like learning process - it messes with your head - until you are, let's face it, addicted."},{"Title":"A Study of Numbers: A Guide to the Constant Creation of the Universe","review":"This is a helpful book to read if you want to learn how nature works.

Generally speaking, glossy page magazines publish two kinds of articles, some imparting genuine how-to information, the second kind is thinly veiled advertisement masquerading as editorial. Unfortunately, Charlesworth's writing in this volume and his Volume II falls into the latter category, highlighting the difficulty of the task and describing the pieces of shiny kit to help bridge your lack of proper apprenticeship and an acceptable workman-like result. On the other hand, it is exactly as it purports: a reprint of successful and popular magazine articles.

In the years since, our world has become much smaller, we have been introduced to the \\"axis of evil,\\" terrorism has penetrated our own borders, and a vocal anti-globalization effort has gone mainstream. Now, the chief rabbi of the British Commonwealth has proposed that we borrow values from Judaism to avoid the clash of civilizations, seeking an alternative to religious coexistence through his notion of the ethics of globalization.Much of the Jewish media's coverage of Sacks' book has focused on his criticism of Israel's stance in the current conflict with the Palestinians. However, looking past this critique (only a short section of the book treats this subject), one finds a novel argument about how people of different nationalities and faiths can coexist in the new world. Sacks argues that religion does not have to lead to a clash between rival civilizations, but rather can be used to generate tolerance. In our politically correct society, we often look for ways to put our differences aside and search out our commonalities, and we feel the need to be all-inclusive in our dialogue efforts. Sacks challenges us by asking whether this \\"dialogue\\" is doing any good, or if we would be better served to embrace our differences. Monotheism doesn't mean there's only one way to God, he argues, rather, it's the belief that the unity of God creates diversity.Our global borders have clearly shrunk, as evidenced by African children eating McDonalds and sipping Coke while wearing Nike shoes and watching MTV; and, we must now ask what the implications of globalization are to us as Jews. Sacks ingeniously looks to the Torah for insight into the great debates about globalization, the clash of civilizations, and the campaign against terror. He divides his book into seven moral principles (all beginning with the letter C) needed to make world harmony a reality: control, contribution, compassion, creativity, co-operation, conservation, and conciliation. We, in the Jewish community, have a long history of striving to attain these core moral imperatives, labeling them as acts of tikkun olam, repairing the world.In this post-September 11 world of great uncertainty, we must not be too quick to label globalization, which Sacks argues has compromised human dignity, as wholly positive or negative. For every story of a Jew living in a remote part of the world once removed from Jewish existence and now able to participate fully in Jewish life due to vast technological advances, there is a story of how globalization has infused a community with American/Western values to the point that its own identity and cultural differences are forgotten.As American Jews, there are many issues that drive our feelings about globalization and anti-globalization (most notably Israel), but we must not fall prey to oversimplifying the arguments of those in either camp. At a time when religious values seem to be dividing us, this book is a fresh perspective that charges us to use those values for good. With the current state of world affairs, the very least we could do is try."},{"Title":"Dignity of Difference How to Avoid the Clash of Civilizations New Revised Edition","review":"I bought this book because I had heard some controversy about it, and took it upstairs for bedtime reading. Mistake! I couldn't put it down, and, reading on sleeplessly found my emotions deeply touched by what this man has to say. His vision is as beautiful as it is complex, being that he is himself an Orthodox Jew speaking about the unity and diversity of religion. Yet, as one, he is uniquely qualified to beg all peoples of deep faith to find a way to see a spark of the divine in each other, even in the stranger's eyes. The inspiration and urgency of his writing, which seems to have erupted from his pen after 9/11, is profound. I checked around the web and found that this book is reccommended on liberal and conservative websites, and had favorable reviews from many, including a several Christian and one Moslem reviewer. Alas, as he mentions in his foreward, only hostility and lack of understanding gets media attention today....So I imagine that this wonderful book will continue to be mainly neglected here in the US, where its eloquence and vision is truly needed. I intend to remedy this by buying as many copies as I can afford and giving them to friends and family, on the condition that they promise to read it. But not at bedtime!"},{"Title":"Dignity of Difference How to Avoid the Clash of Civilizations New Revised Edition","review":"A stunning stunning book.Beautifully written. Inspirational and accessible, incredibly thought-provoking and sometimes challenging. Overall it's the best book I've read in a long while. It takes the world we know we live in, and causes us to think really carefully about how the pieces fit together, and how we are each one of those pieces.Like Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point, this is a book that will be passed on from reader to reader in the next few years."},{"Title":"Dignity of Difference How to Avoid the Clash of Civilizations New Revised Edition","review":"I am an American who teaches overseas, and I think that this book clearly illustrates the problem facing our various countries today: as the author states, we \\"narrowcast,\\" meaning that we seek out those who are like us, communicate with those individuals, and then pronounce ourselves correct without ever truly seeking a diverse opinion.The political faultlines we walk today are a perfect example of what happens when we stop talking to each other and only desire positive feedback. This book, however, is not for any standard reader: it appeals, I believe, more to moderates than someone of a strident ideological background. If you blindly follow an extremist path in a political party or religion, I think this book could radically change your mind about said path, but you need to approach the book with as open a mind as possible.I write this only a few days before the next U.S. presidential election, which has been the ugliest since I came of voting age in '92. I wish both candidates and their quislings would read this fine book."},{"Title":"Dignity of Difference How to Avoid the Clash of Civilizations New Revised Edition","review":"This attempt by the British Chief Rabbi to turn religion into part of the solution rather than the problem has inadvertently illustrated the complexity of of religious fundamentalism: Under pressure from Orthodox traditionalists, Rabbi Sacks has asked the publisher to stop selling the book until he can ammend &quot;offensive&quot; passages in which he argued that Judaism was not the exclusive path to God.For those of us looking for a model of religious faith that doesn't lead to jihad, well, we better hope to get the first edition."},{"Title":"Dignity of Difference How to Avoid the Clash of Civilizations New Revised Edition","review":"This book is less one complete book than it is a set of essays on a wide range of topics- sometimes insightful, sometimes less so. Generally, I found the book to be most persuasive when it explains the appeal of traditional religion, less so when it sets out an independent argument for the way things ought to be. A few of the issues covered:*The growth of religious fundamentalism. Rabbi Sacks writes: \\"The power of conservative religious movements has been precisely the fact that they represent protests against, rather than accommodations to, late modernity.\\" In other words, right-wing religion is successful because it appeals to the dissatisfied; the satisfied by definition aren't going to be as motivated to switch religions or even to invest as heavily in their own.*The value of religion generally. Why are religions so much more successful in attracting adherents than, say, philosophical systems with similar visions of the good life? Sacks points out that religions don't just have points of view, they \\"embody [their visions] in the life of the community. They make it vivid and substantial and prayer and ritual, in compelling narratives and collective acts of rededication.\\" By contrast, a philosophy without ritual, or even a religious movement that lacks a lot of ritual, may not seem as \\"vivid and substantial\\" to some people. I completely agree; I grew up Reform and have moved towards a more ritual-oriented form of Judaism, and the reason I find traditional Judaism more appealing has less to do with ideology than the felt reality that the latter seems a bit more, well, \\"vivid.\\"*The value of religious diversity. Rabbi Sacks argues that the very fabric of creation supports diversity: just as God is glorified by the \\"astounding multiplicity\\" of the millions of species, and of the hundreds of human cultures and languages, the multiplicity of ways of approaching God are equally valuable. Sacks writes that \\"God has spoken to mankind in many languages through Judaism to Jews, Christianity to Christians, Islam to Muslims. But just as God is greater than any language, God is greater than any one way to relating to God.\\" Makes sense to me- but maybe that's just because I am a non-haredi Jew. But what would Sacks say to the haredi Jew who says \\"But there's a difference- our revelation really happened and theirs is fictitious\\"? Or to the Christian or Muslim who argues that their way of relating to God presupposes the universality of their religion? I did not see how Sacks really addresses this tough issue.*Economics. Rabbi Sacks correctly points out that Judaism has sought to steer a middle course between pure capitalism and socialism, by endorsing a market economy combined with mandatory charity. But is the view of Judaism relevant to a secular society? That is- should public policy reflect the voice of Torah, or should it follow the libertarian view that people can express their religious values with their own money rather than using the government to address poverty and related issues? Rabbi Sacks doesn't seem to me to focus on this issue, perhaps because he comes from a society where a generous welfare state is taken for granted to a greater extent than in the USA.*Environmentalism. As Sacks suggests, there is quite a bit of justification for environmentalism in Jewish tradition. Sacks does address one strand of tradition that I was unaware of before reading this book: Jewish support for preserving endangered species. Sacks writes that according to the medieval sage Nachmanides, the Torah's prohibition of seizing a bird and its mother at the same time exists to prevent Jews from culling species to the point of extinction- a kind of early Endangered Species Act. Of course, translating Jewish environmental values into public policy is even more difficult than translating Jewish economic values into public policy, for the simple reason that environmental issues often involve not just values, but difficult factual questions that most nonscientists don't really understand. For example, I might have a rational opinion that global warming is caused by human activity, if I think there is a scientific consensus behind this view. But that doesn't mean that I know what policies will actually be effective in reducing global warming, let alone whether those policies are cost-justified."},{"Title":"Dignity of Difference How to Avoid the Clash of Civilizations New Revised Edition","review":"Rabbi Sachs is an intelligent and astute political thinker. His moral values his concern for the dignity of every human being his desire for peace in the world are felt strongly in the text.His overall prescription and hope is that the major civilizations of the world can through tolerant recognition and acceptance of each other bring great benefit to mankind as a whole. As an ideal prescription and formulation ' The Dignity of Differences' makes great sense.But as a realistic assessment of where Mankind is and what precisely is going on within these Civilizations there is something lacking here. Any consideration of the present world situation which aims at providing some new and better direction has to look realistically at the character and goals of the major civilizations. The value of recognizing and tolerating others which Rabbi Sachs so rightly promotes is at this historical moment not the note which Islamic Civilization is ready to hear. In Huntington's Clash of Civilizations he spoke about an arc of confrontation in the world in which Muslim countries in thirty some odd places are engaged in aggressive violent behavior against neighbors. Islamic fundamentalist terrorism denies the fundamental premise of all that Rabbi Sachs is trying to teach. There is an assymetry between the Civilization which has to be recognized if there is going to be real progress toward a better world. Rabbi Sachs has made a valiant and admirable try here in offering a better way for the world. Unfortunately this does not address the ' threats' of the moment , threats of terror and violence, also by states which can bring disaster to Mankind. Let us hope and pray that Mankind will get in some years time into the position where all civilizations will recognize and tolerate the legitimate place of others."},{"Title":"Dignity of Difference How to Avoid the Clash of Civilizations New Revised Edition","review":"Making world harmony a reality is a tall order and alliterated principles: control, contribution, compassion, creativity, co-operation, conservation, and conciliation are perhaps a bit \`forced\\". But the deep and sincere thinking is much better than this might suggest. The title is more to the point; accepting the \\"dignity of difference\\" is entirely possible but for politicized extremists of every stripe (Faith) who ignore not only common principles but exclude any room at all for legitimate differences thereby proclaiming only they know divine will (the sin of \`shirk' in Islam) and therefore there is no room for negotiation or compromise. This exclusivity is not unique to any faith or civilization except in the most delusional and arrogant self perception.Perhaps empathy (compassion), a real sense of justice, and the space for what is essential to each faith are most important. The spirituality and morality of men of all faiths usually can provide toleration and conciliation - it is the politicians, ethnics, opportunists - and usually less spiritual individuals - who stop such developments.This is a wonderful, even inspirational, book for people of good faith. But reactions, most of all from within the Rabbi's own faith so far, show the difficulty. Maybe psychology (as studied by books like \\"Blind Trust\\") needs to be integrated for a more actionable effective plan.Now, a comment on limitations is required. Sacks remains idealistic and sometimes a bit superficial. He has not even reasonable agreement within his own community. There is little indicating real understanding of Islam in particular (perhaps this is much to ask in a short book). The discussion of education is lively but inadequate regarding quality versus quantity and the difficulty of opening minds. (The largely uncritical reading of \\"Clash\\" is itself an indication of limits of education.) It begs questions about why the oldest of the three faiths remains by far that with fewest adherents, and why a persecuted people now persecute others. The moral case for a market economy perhaps avoids too many of the negatives and how democracy evolves towards oligarchy without economic democracy. The critique of elements of globalism identifies but does not explain the role of that same capitalist \\"Washington Consensus\\". Greed and materialism more than empathy and generosity are characteristic of the present market economy. In general analysis is better than resolution of problems. Good will is not alone enough."},{"Title":"Dignity of Difference How to Avoid the Clash of Civilizations New Revised Edition","review":"\\"The Dignity of Difference\\" should be read by all four of the folks running for President..if they followed its dictates the world would be a safer place.

First, it takes about two minutes to read each daily segment and I re-read each piece many times throughout the day to fully understand what the passage is saying. Sometimes I felt like I was reading Greek with the first reading, but when I went back several hours later and read it again it all made perfect sense.Second, I am not the same person I was when I started this book. I feel a satisfaction and peace now that I was always looking for before but could never quite find or hold on to. Where there was unrest and feelings of angst before, I now have feelings of love, joy, and contentment. I feel more capable, more in control of my life and my feelings/emotions, and a general sense of wonder about my life that I haven't felt since I was a child.This book is not for those who are still emotionally tied to traditional church dogma. An openness to new ways of thinking about God, Christ, and spirituality in general is required. The more you ponder the ideas presented in this book, the more you will get out of it.

His main argument regarding personal liberty is the harm principle, meaning as long as the individual's actions do not harm other individuals, they shouldn't be restricted from that action. However, Mill doesn't only focus on the philosophical aspect of the role government should have in the individual life, but he also tries to answer more specific issues such as government policies concerning drugs, gambling, prostitution, public education versus private education, the importance of freedom of speech and more. If you're interested in such questions, this book is for you."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"As stated by Mill the topic of On Liberty is the role society should take in interfering with the liberty of an individual, that is, the amount of power that society may legitimately exercise over its people.The sphere of Mill's inquiry is the system of a democracy, where the main danger to individual liberty is that of the \\"tyranny of the majority,\\" in which minorities are subjected to the whims of the majority such that the \\"weaker members of the community\\" are \\"preyed upon by innumerable vultures.\\" Mill's argument is that \\"self-government\\" is not \\"the government of each by himself, but of each by all the rest.\\"Mill's main thesis is that society and the governing bodies have no right to interfere with the liberty of thought, action or individuality in any person save when those liberties may cause harm to others; that \\"over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\\" This is to say that society is unable able to interfere with individuals unless they're harming somebody, not including themselves - a person has every right to do harm to themselves and society may not intervene simply for the good of the individual.Apart from this, Mill also believes that keeping away the \\"tyranny of the majority\\" is good not only for the individuals and the minorities, but for society itself as well; that the argumentation/discussion which leads from freedom of thought is pivotal in the development of the society and truth. It is only in this that societies can avoid stagnation and people can truly learn; they must be able to see both sides of the argument (from people who truly believe them) and the ideas must be allowed to clash, thus, \\"genius can only breathe freely in an atmosphere of freedom.\\"In arguing for freedom of expression Mill argues that because the opinions of the individual may be true (or at least contain some portion of truth) and because human fallibility makes it so there are none fit to judge whether the opinion is true anyway, full freedom must be granted; not only this, but because there are none fit to judge, [according to Mill] there is no absolute certainty.This is all to lead into a sort of Hegelian system which Mill puts forth, noting that both sides of any argument generally only contain a portion of the truth and that it is only by bringing these two ideas together that the full truth can be found; a balance must be found between the ideas. The ideas must clash and in this clashing the synthesis between them will be found.Overall Mill's text is a good read even for people today. The ideas being presented are just as relevant now as they were during Mill's time, such the fact that the voice of third parties is all but crushed in the US's two party system or the discussions over gay marriage, abortion, or even something as small as free speech zones on college campuses. All of these feed back into the issue being discussed by Mill, that is, how much power society should be able to wield over its members and just what is the nature and extent of our liberty.Memorable Quotes:-\\"The liberty of the individual must be thus far limited; he must not make himself a nuisance to other people.\\"-\\"He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that.\\"-\\"If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one person were of contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.\\"-\\"What was not wanted was that the rulers should be identified with the people, that their interests and will should be the interest and will of the nation. The nation did not need to be protected against its own will There was no fear of tyrannizing over itself.\\"Specific CriticismsFrom a secular standpoint I'm not sure how much can be critiqued of Mill's ideas. From a Christian standpoint there are two chief issues which may be taken.The first issue that may be taken is with the idea that \`over himself the individual is sovereign.' This is exactly the mindset which Scripture rails against and sets up as the original sin, to think that we are our own sovereigns, to usurp the sovereignty of God over his creations.The second issue which may be taken is with lack of any solid judge for truth. Simply put, the Christian would argue that God is the standard against which we measure truth, and due to his immutability he stands as a very good standard by which to judge. There is still the factor of fallibility which Mill notes, however this is not to say that truth cannot be discovered or that no statements can be set as entirely false.More reviews at ellipsisomnibus.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"Good and Fast . ... ....... ... .. ..... ........ ...... ....... .. ....... .... .... .. ...... ... ....."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"This is the only version of &#34;On Liberty&#34; that I own.

While the Russians were carrying out pogroms against Jews because of their intolerance, Mill was able to provide an intellectual defense for tolerating the emerging Latter Day Saints (despite his obvious dislike for them). The beauty of this book is that the arguments are still relevant and directly applicable to the issues. Whereas Marx required armies of Soviet intellectuals in order to stay relevant, you can pick up On Liberty and fully appreciate the arguments. While it can be tempting to accept some infringements on liberty, I think it's necessary to have a philosophical framework through which to understand what limitations on liberty are justifiable and which aren't.Jorge"},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"When J. S. Mill published ON LIBERTY in 1859, he was then but the latest in a very long line of liberal theorists that stretched back to Plato and continued intermittenly for the next two millennia. These theorists as did Mill attempted to ascertain what if any was that fine line between the rights of the individual to live unimpeded from the caprices of a ruling state and the duty of that state to maintain the civil order necessary for those rights to exist. That we today still have not defined this line is a testimony to the never ending struggle of thinkers like Mill to present arguments of which each succeeding generation must be made aware.From the day it first appeared in print, readers have been entranced by the clarion call for unrestrained liberty. Mill wrote ON LIBERTY in such a manner that to argue against it suggests that to do so renders one as either a tyrant or a boor. Further, those who question Mill must walk a fine line between not supporting the very tyrannical state against which Mill rails and carrying out the the logical conclusion of accepting his definition of liberty at face value. I question Mill's underlying if unnoticed logic even as I applaud his cheerleading.Mill sees society as a perpetual repressor of the liberty of its citizens. For him, liberty consists of the ability to think and do as one pleases. Barring certain exceptions this liberty is the very foundation of any society that dares to call itself free. Society, then, must bend over backwards to ensure that all possess it. The chief stumbling block in this quest lies less in the individuating traits of people and more in the the tendency of rulers to rely on the heavy hand of custom to maintain its own existence even at the cost of denying liberty to their subjects.Mill sees \\"custom\\" as a dirty word that is all that is wrong with society. Nowhere does he concern himself with any positive connotations. He limits its use only to describe that which has the potential to stamp out every last smidgeon of creativity that might otherwise emerge. He fears that it will be the ruled, and not the rulers, who wish to crush dissent. To protect individuals from custom, Mill states that only those who are daring enough to defy society may do so. He calls such dissenters as \\"eccentrics.\\" For him, it is a term of praise that brings to mind heirs of a very long line of liberal thought from ancient Greek days. Just as Mill ignores the reality that custom has two divergent senses so does he similarly ignore the same about eccentrics. Clearly, if history proves anything, it is that those who have differed in ways that are bestial are about as numerous as those that are beneficial. When Mill champions the absolute right of eccentrics to challenge custom, he opens the door to tear down the bonds of society and not erect anything of a compensatory nature. When he argues that liberty must not be used to harm others, he is using a red herring to divert attention from the grim realization that to be different means far more than than saying so."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) was interested in the nature of Civil Liberty, and the limits to the power that a Government can legitimately exercise upon its citizens. He believed that some worrying tendencies could be observed in the England society of his time, and tried to warn others about them.The author basically explains his ideas regarding the preservation of individual liberties, not only due to the fact that they are rights owed to everyone, but also because they benefit society as a whole.For example, when he says that liberty of thought and of discussion must be preserved, he tells us that &quot;Wrong opinions and practices gradually yield to fact and argument: but fact and arguments, to produce any effect on the mind, must be brought before it&quot;. How can mistaken beliefs or actions be proven wrong, if dissent is forbidden?. The loss for society is clear: &quot;If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth; if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error&quot;.In order to preserve the liberties included in the concept of Civil Liberty, the author points out that there must be limits to the action of the Government. He says that &quot;The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others&quot;. Any other reason is simply not good enough. Thus, Stuart Mill highlights the rights of the individual, but also the limit to those rights: the well-being of others.&quot;On Liberty&quot; is not too long, and I think you are highly likely to enjoy it, if you can get past the first few pages. The problem is that even though the ideas in this book are quite modern, the language is somehow dated. But then, we must remember that &quot;On Liberty&quot; was written a long time ago...Notwithstanding that, do your best to read the first pages, and you will realize that after a while it will be much easier. This book is well-worth the effort you need to make at the beginning, because it is even more relevant today than when it was first published, in 1859.Are individual rights important?. Why?. Do they have a limit?. You will found the answer for these questions, and much more, in &quot;On Liberty&quot;. What else can I say?. I believe this is a book that will help you to reflect on many important issues... I certainly can't think of a better reason to read it. All in all, recommended :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"This Kindle edition has an introduction written more than a century ago that offers no insight into Mill's essay and deals almost entirely with the relationship between Mill and Harriet Taylor. It is therefore primarily of general rather than academic interest.\\"On Liberty\\" is one of the most important books on political thought of the nineteenth century. Fortunately for the 21st century reader it is also one of the most accessible. Mill was a libertarian who chose not to base his defence of liberty on natural rights but on his own revised version of utilitarianism:\\"I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions...grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being.\\"This enables Mill to argue that freedom is needed if man is to be able to explore all the avenues of human development that allow the human race to progress. Total freedom is impossible so what determines the legitimate boundaries of freedom? Mill distinguishes between self-regarding and other-regarding actions. The former should never be interfered with and the latter subject to limitation only if they harm the legitimate rights of others.For Mill free thought is a self-regarding action which should not be curtailed, and free thought is virtually useless without free speech. Mill then proceeds to add a utilitarian argument in favour of free speech: if an opinion is silenced then mankind is necessarily the loser whether the opinion is true or false. He advances a number of arguments to support this, concluding with the claim that a climate of freedom is essential for \\"great thinkers\\" and \\"it is as much, and even more indispensable to enable average human beings to attain the mental stature they are capable of.\\" He has no truck with paternalists seeking to guide people's thoughts in the \\"right\\" direction. He was equally hostile to the idea that people had the right not to be offended; hence he opposed the blasphemy law. The single case Mill gives of an acceptable limitation of free speech is the case of corn-dealers and an excited mob. An opinion expressed in a newspaper that corn-dealers are \\"starvers of the poor\\" is legitimate, but the same view stated to an angry mob outside the corn-dealer's home may be limited if it \\"is a positive instigation to a mischievous act.\\"Mill concedes that actions cannot be as free as speech and seeks to establish the proper limits of freedom of action. Mill proposes that \\"the sole end for which mankind are warranted...in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.\\" Because he rejects paternalism he opposes all interference with self-regarding actions. Mill would not have prevented people from taking drugs and he would have led the opposition to seat belt legislation. Mill even rejects state interference with liberty for the sake of crime prevention, e.g. poisons can be used for criminal purposes. Mill was willing to accept a register of their sale but not the banning of them. Mill believes we must not interfere with the \\"rights\\"of others but these are narrowly circumscribed and Mill makes it clear that \\"rights\\" are not the same as \\"interests\\". Hence cut-throat laissez-faire is legitimate. As for moral decency arguments Mill does say that sexual intercourse in public is unacceptable, and though fornication and gambling are acceptable he is in two minds about whether pimps and casino-owners should be allowed to operate. Mill says it is a difficult case that is on the borderline, but adds that in general we must resist attempts to limit behaviour for \\"moral\\" reasons because any such action is likely to be the thin end of the wedge.Though Mill is a very determined anti-paternalist he makes three exceptions: children, primitive societies and the disabled. Children must be guided until they reach maturity and they must be given compulsory education - something not given legislative force when he wrote. As for primitive societies, we must resist the notion that Mill was a typical Victorian believing in the \\"white man's burden\\" or inherent differences between races. He simply observed the reality of the world in the mid-nineteenth century but made it very clear any intervention in backward societies must be temporary with the aim to bring about self-government as soon as possible.Hence Mill was a much more determined libertarian than most modern writers on the subject. There is just one example where, at first sight, Mill may seem reactionary to modern readers. He wished to restrict the right to have children to those who could prove that they could support them. However, those who today wish others to be allowed to procreate at will do so on the grounds of human rights. Mill based his theories on utilitarianism, and not on rights. There was no welfare state when Mill wrote \\"On Liberty\\" and he was concerned with the well-being of children born to people without the means to support them.In view of the alleged growing restrictions on freedom in many democratic countries this is a book well worth reading. In particular I like Mill's argument that every restriction on freedom is the thin end of the wedge, providing a justification for further restrictions."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"In his classic essay \\"On Liberty\\", John Stuart Mill deals with the issue of \\"civil liberties\\" -not the metaphysical issue of \\"free will\\". While most attacks on civil liberties have historically occurred from the right within the context of a tyrannical or an aristocratic rule, Mill deals with threats against liberty from within the institutions of democracy itself. The issue is especially relevant at a time when widespread domestic wiretapping and surveillance violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.The aim of early libertarians was to limit the power of the ruler over those governed; Mill, however, identifies a need to limit the power of elected governments and officials as well. Mill is not merely addressing the issue of \\"who should rule?\\", he seeks to establish limits on the power that government may exercise over minorities and individuals. His work is more relevant now than ever.While \\"government of the people\\" is an ideal to be aspired to, Mill argues that such an ideal is often not the case in fact. He argues that those exerting the power of the government -elected officials, bureaucrats, the judiciary -often develop their own interests. They are sometimes influenced by those constituencies in ways that are at odds with the interests and liberties of individuals or other groups.Mill makes no distinction between a tyranny of one and a tyranny of many. A tyrannical majority running roughshod over the rights of individuals and minorities is no less a tyrant because it is a majority, because it is elected, or because it is elected by a majority.While society may not tolerate criminal behavior, for example, society may not legitimately interfere with or suppress all non-conforming behaviors indiscriminately or because a majority may not approve. What then are the powers that society may legitimately exercise over the individual? Mill answers:\\"The only purpose for which power can be rightly exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.\\"-J.S. Mill, On LibertyJames Madison -called the \\"Father of the Constitution\\" -may have anticipated Mill's ideas in his draft of the Bill of Rights -the first ten amendments to the Constitution. Implicit in the Bill of Rights is the recognition that the power of the state is a blunt instrument. Abused, it can oppress and repress individuals and minority groups alike. The Bill of Rights addresses this issue by guaranteeing \\"due process of law\\", limiting state power over individuals and groups, guaranteeing that groups and individuals may speak freely, worship freely.The Fourth Amendment specifically is a promise that our government made to us in its very founding:\\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\\"-Fourth Amendment, Bill of Rights, U.S. ConstitutionLet's make something abundantly clear: there are no \\"inherent powers\\", \\"Implicit\\" authorizations\\" that would, in any way, overturn, limit, or repeal the Fourth Amendment. Many politicians are not only wrong about that, they may have deliberately lied about it. Moreover, Congress may not overrule the Fourth Amendment with statutory law. Constitutional Law is supreme and provisions in the Bill of Right are valid until amended as set out in the Constitution itself. Widespread domestic surveillance is illegal whatever is done by Congress ex post facto -and until the Constitution is amended, it will remain illegal. At last, ex post facto laws, themselves, are expressly forbidden by the Constitution.Mill is all the more remarkable for his insight into issues that remain contemporary. In every literate criticism of \\"special interest groups\\", PAC's, the gun lobby, the tobacco lobby, the Military/Industrial Complex, one sees the lasting influence of John Mill.On Liberty is essential reading for anyone interested in law, the principles of government, political science, political philosophy, indeed, freedom itself. It is also essential reading for anyone interested in learning about the intellectual underpinnings of Anglo-American civil liberties."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"This edition is subtitled \\"Optimized for Kindle\\". I was therefore quite surprised that it lacked a table of contents. What does \\"optimized\\" mean in this context?"},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"This book deserves to be studied closely; I cannot praise too highly the man or his work. As Mill writes in his AUTOBIOGRAPHY, his education under his philosopher father James was perhaps the most tortuous experience imaginable for a young child, leaving the adolescent John with the impression that he was something of a facsimile of his father. Nevertheless, after much difficulty in assimilating what he was taught and defining who he was, the adult Mill respectfully stepped out from under his father's shadow and went on to make staggering intellectual contributions of his own. In this book, ON LIBERTY, Mill tackles the problem of \\"the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual.\\" With some reflection, it can be seen how important this question is, for its implications touch every part of our social and private lives. Unfortunately, few recognize its importance, and the question is more often decided by unthinking custom or self-interest than reason. With scrupulous rigor, and impeccable intellectual honesty, Mill asserts the absolute necessity of dissenting opinions, of diversity in all things, and the dangers of concentrated power, be it in the form of a dictator or a democratic majority. The problems treated in this short book are just as relevant today as they were in Mill's time. Perennial political issues such as education reform, gun control, abortion, freedom of speech, taxation, the role of government, etc., are addressed either directly or indirectly; the book abounds with other, more personal, lessons on life as well, not the least of which was later encapsulated by Wittgenstein as: \\"If you want to improve the world, improve yourself.\\""},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"In On Liberty, Mill attempts to define when the authority of society can rightly limit individuality and the &quot;sovereignty of the individual over himself.&quot; He writes that people are not accountable to society for actions that only concern themselves. The only means society has to express disapproval of such actions is through &quot;advice, instruction, persuasion, and avoidance by other people if thought necessary by them for their own good.&quot; He also writes that the individual is accountable for actions that hurt others, and society can punish a person socially or legally as is deemed necessary for such actions. Mill observes, though, that sometimes when an action causes harm to others, such as when a person succeeds in a competitive job market, the general social good is positive, and there is no right to punish people for the harm caused. Throughout On Liberty, Mill's argument proceeds with a discussion of the appropriate level of authority that society should have over the individual, along with particular examples and applications of the theory, to clarify the meaning of his claims. The examples are just as relevant today as they were in Mill's time. Continuing political issues such as education reform, gun control, alcohol, freedom of speech, taxation, the role of government, etc., are addressed either directly or indirectly. Mill was ahead of his time. His book was insightful, thought-provoking and ahead of its time. The questions and viewpoints Mill argued are the same issues in political debates today. When reading On Liberty, I found myself reading the same paragraphs over again to understand his main issues and points. Also, in parts of the reading Mill never really comes across and answers his own questions he argued, but his ideas and arguments leave the reader thinking."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"America's defense department should take some of the billions spent on the stealth bomber or the B1 and spend it to make Arabic and Farsi translations of this book in the hundreds of thousands. We could pack the bomb bays of a squadron of stealth bombers with the translations and carpet the cities of Muslim countries with this treatise on freedom. This is The Book, folks. You cannot read this little book without it changing your life. It is an extended argument about freedom, about true morality, about freeing your mind, about untrammeling the possibility of peace and prosperity in the world. This is the book that lays out the path for treating other human beings with respect and opening the way toward progress in any and all societies. For the discussion of the \\"harm to others\\" principle alone, this book merits the world's attention and praise.Perhaps the most famous aspect of Mill's extended argument about liberty is his discussion of the \\"tyranny of the majority.\\" His argument grows from the long history of religious persecution suffered throughout Europe that led to book bans, bigotry, and even torture and burning at the stake for people who did not conform to the majority superstition, namely the dominant form of Christianity wherever one lived. Mill lived in a time when even the staid and relatively moderate views of the English Church forced people to conform their lives or face public humiliation and financial ruin, and sometimes lynching. The resulting dynamic was that free thought was thus discouraged and progress thwarted. Mill's point is that in such a psychological milieu, people are not mentally free to seek a better way. They are rather trammeled to superstition and the concomitant tyranny of the majority, the majority being emotionally dependent and mentally ham-strung by religion and religious fears and prejudices.America today is witnessing the truth of this dynamic through the virulent and underhanded tactics of the fundamentalist X-tian political right who seek to thwart medical research and impose a legislated theocracy in parts of the country. The effort to put dark-age arguments about \\"intelligent design\\" on a scientific par with evolutionary theory is a perfect and alarming example. Mill's argument in On Liberty was prescient in demonstrating what can happen when people allow religion to influence political life. The brand of literalist religion we see in America has been the bane of societies throughout history and respresents a true pragmatic evil on a scale far worse than any imagined \\"Satanic\\" sinfulness that Christians associate with popular and secular humanism. Fundamentalist religion, especially in the forms of Christian and Muslim extremism, is a societal cancer when viewed through the lense of reason and of Mill's enlightened utilitarianism. No society that allows religion to make in-roads to politics can flourish. Proof is in the failed Middle East, where no country can manage to pull its people out of poverty and squalor in spite of sitting on the world's richest oil reserves. Mill's argument in this small book speaks volumes about why Muslim countries are doomed to failure and why the Christian right in America (the blood cousins of Islamic radicals) represent the biggest and most un-American evil in our country's history. If America represents freedom, there can be no room for the \\"ten commandments\\" in the county court house.Highly recommended as a must read for everyone."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"I agree, how hard is it to put a table of contents in, it is very frustrating trying to navigate through this book."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"John Stuart Mill, author of On Liberty, defines the nature of civil liberty, and most importantly, the harm principl. He aims to give readers a better understanding of the nature and limits of power that can be exercised by society over individuals. The purpose of this book is to inform interested individuals about the rights of individuals and the limitations of the government. This book of philosophy was written almost 150 years ago. By reading the book, the reader is able to apply Mill's message and examples to our lives in America today. The ahead-of-the-times ideas that are in On Liberty can be related to our world because it discusses controversies that are still seen in our courtrooms today. Mill is able to accomplish his purpose because he uses many examples, thoughts, and theories about individual and social rights. He works through each of his ideas, looking at both sides of the issue to enable the reader to make their own informed decision about each matter. This book has a practical meaning because it allows the reader to develop and reason ideas about government power and when that power should be exercised over the people. Unfortunately, this book does have one draw back. Mill was a very educated man and wrote very well for his time. Yet today, our style and writing techniques are not the same as they were in the nineteenth century. This makes On Liberty a difficult book to read. His book is very decriptive, yet his wording is not easily understadable and some paragraphs have to be read two or three times to fully understand what he is writing about. Aside from his writing style, John Stuart Mill has put together an essay full of educated ideas about society and individuals. John Stuart Mill wrote an informative book geared towards an educated audience. He has achieved his purpose for the essay through the use of situations and examples that can be applied to real life cases still today.

Mill's primary concern was to address the potential problem of the \\"tyranny of the majority\\" posed by the emerging democratization of society. His concern was prompted specifically by de Toqueville's account of the USA. Mill is concerned not just with the way government could impose conformity to majority views but also with general social pressures for conformity. In opposition to the dangers of majoritarianism, Mill proposes 2 versions of the Harm principle; the first the basic idea that whatever doesn't cause harm is permitted. The second and more restrictive version emphasizes violation of duties to others. Mill argues his case very well, addressing both general principles and specific problems of contemporary British society. In line with his utilitarian approach, he argues vigorously that human improvement requires the type of freedom and tolerance implied by his Harm Principles. This is also in a real sense the weakness of On Liberty. Mill's version of utilitarianism is not the hedonistic utilitarianism of Bentham and his father, nor preference utilitarianism, but a more vague assertion of what is needed for human progression. Well written, and often quoted, this is one of the accessible major texts in the canon."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"The modern age is a dangerous age, an age in which we might be alienated from that individual independence in work and in mind which defines our humanity. Confronted by this crisis, Karl Marx and John Stuart Mill offer the world diverging solutions: annihilate the existing world and march toward communism, or guard against the dangers of the existing world as we further embrace liberal democracy. Despite these divergent paths which arise from differing views on the driving force of history, both systems aim to rescue the supreme interest of our individual humanity-for Marx, this interest lies in reaching absolute prosperity for the material man, and for Mill, it lies in the search for absolute truth for the idealistic man.With its emphasis on individuality and diversity, Mill's theory is in a sense more encompassing than Marx's. Mill's theory, however, is fundamentally flawed in comparison to Marx's because of its ignorance of property as a danger against human liberty.Marx sees in the industrial age the death of the property-less class. This death is brought by the industrial age's five qualities: division of labor, accumulation of capital, competition, financial crisis, and monopoly. In this age, machineries and the division of labor reduce the skillful artisans to the proletariats who merely work on one monotonous element of production. The capitalists who own the machines enlarge their capital by exploiting the proletariat's labor, leaving them only with enough to eat. Competition forces capitalists to lower prices, but this is good only until each factory produces more than demanded and a financial crisis emerges. The small capitalists are reduced to the property-less as millions of workers are swept into deeper hell. Only the biggest capitalist survives, and he becomes the monopolist who can lower wages and raise prices at whim, destroying the lives of all. (Part 1, Bourgeois and Proletarians, Manifesto of the Communist Party)The above scenario is unavoidable because the accumulation of more capital is the only end of capital. If the capitalist stops investing capital for gains he ceases to be a capitalist, and becomes a mere consumer of goods, enjoying the fruits of old exploitations. Tragically, capital can only increase when it exploits the difference of what labor costs and labor produces, as Marx writes,\\"The modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.\\" (Marx p484)The rich man sitting in his patio who has inherited a million pound and who lets others manage his money has not done anything to deserve profits, indeed, since he himself did not work, his profits must come from the works of others who he exploits. In the capitalistic system, there exists no pity, only keen self-interest, \\"all are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use...\\" (Marx p479)The workers might die, but before their body ceases to be exploited, their mind is already died-capitalism has alienated them from their humanity which is defined by their creative productivity. This alienation from our humanity was Marx's greatest worry. Animals make nests and produce goods just as we do, however, as Marx writes,\\"...a bee would put many a human architect to shame by the construction of its honeycomb cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is that the architect builds the cell in his mind before he constructs it in wax... Man not only effects a change of form in the materials of nature; he also realizes his own purpose in those materials.\\" (Chapter 7, Das Kapital)In order to freely produce as the creativity of his mind directs him and as his productive ability allows, the material man must be endowed with control over the means of production. In the world of private property, however, the workers have turned from the master of production to the slave of the machine-they are reduced to programmed animals that produce merely for the end of survival.The proletariat can only reassert his humanity by violent overthrowing the capitalists and through the \\"abolition of private property\\" (Marx p484). Once in communism, the workers will own the means of production and enjoy the full produces of their labor. He will be motivated to constantly transform the world into a more prosperous kingdom. As Marx writes, \\"In communist society, accumulated labour is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of the labourer.\\" (Marx p485) The abundance of material goods will allow man to work not for survival, but for his own enjoyment. In this society, there will be no family and nor religion, everything is made for the love of all and enjoyed by all. Any vestiges of private interest would result in the return to capitalism with all its evils.To Mill, the modern life is also threatening because the voice of the majority might alienate men from their individuality. The differentiation of society is essential for the vitality of the society, and this vitality empowers men on their search for truth.Political debates, according to Mill, have been about striking the balance between the ruler and ruled. It is necessary for the ruled to have a ruler in order to preserve peace and law, yet the elected or unelected ruler's power must be restrained so that he does not abuse it against the ruled. In contrast to Marx's class struggle, this \\"struggle between liberty and authority\\" (p59) from Mill is more amiable. In the current era of democratic nations, however, since the ruled are also the rulers, the opposition no longer exists. People feel that all actions taken by the people's government will be good for the people, and hence they lose the old vigilance against the invasion of public power into their private spheres. The voice of the majority becomes the equivalent of the truth and justice.Mill is worried that this majority voice will obstruct man's search for truth, the attaining of which is the goal of life. Truth is not reached once and then preserved for eternity, it is an organic being with a thousand facets whose survival requires continued inputs of each person's active mind. This truth is the individual treasure of each being, fitting perfectly to his taste and preferences; yet it is also a truth for the whole community, since it is only through the struggles of different truths that humanity as a whole reaches a higher truth-a higher level for the activation of the mind. As Mill writes, \\"There is always need of persons not only to discover new truths and point out when what were once truths are true no longer\\" (p71) If the majority religion is the only religion and taste the only taste, then people will no longer think but simply follow; society will be bogged into the swamp of mediocrity with a mind that is dead. Marx also feared the death of the mind, the mind of the creative worker. Despite the differences, both philosophers are concerned about the destruction of man's defining qualities.To counter this, Mill proclaims that the only defense for \\"interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.\\" (p68). The government must be restrained in the sphere of public affairs, and individuals shall live as free as they want to following their individual passions.Marx and Mill both want to regain humanity. In one case, the enemy is the benumbing effects of majority rule, and man's mind for truth is debased forever into mediocrity, in the other case, the enemy comes from the benumbing effects of subjugation to the machine, and the man is turned from the master of production into the slaves of capital.The core difference between the two theories in practical operation arises from their different views on individuality (both systems serve individuals as their ends, however, individuality, allowing people to be different, are treated differently). For Mill, we must preserve individuality to bring truth (Chapter 3, On Liberty), but for Marx, the destruction of private property is the only task. The communistic society will be a union in which man can \\"...hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner...\\" (The German Ideology). This free life of a communist in communism is all good until one day the comrade does not want to be a communist anymore-but he must be one, there is no choice. In Communism, one does not have the individual liberty to have families, nor try to build a little store of private wealth.On the other side, if someone in Mill's world decides to be a communist, he has the full right to do so. He can even segregate himself away with his friends and enjoy the life of a commune. In another word, Marxism can not destroy Mill's democracy-it will just be one of the many ways of thinking allowed by the system-but Mill's cry for diversity will destroy Marx's world within a second.Confronted with the above, Marx would reply like he did in the Jewish Question, that the so-called liberty and freedom of the capitalistic world are nothing other than man's desire to keep himself a self-sufficient nomad. As he writes, all the rights of man are simply \\"the right to enjoy one's fortune and to dispose of it as one will; without regard for other men and independently of society.\\" (Marx, p42) Marx will say that only seeing the superficial political liberation is not to see the deeper human liberation which could only be achieved with the abolition of private property. Marx might not be completely right, but he does stand at a higher ground than Mill in this analysis of property.Mill in On Liberty is focused solely on avoiding the abuse of power through government, but he ignores the abuses that property owners are capable of against the property-less. In an agricultural society where everyone is equal and land unlimited, the government might be the only thing capable of suppressing individual liberty, but when one sees child-labor and 12 hour work day in modern industrial society, there is no doubt that capital could be a pitiless monster. Even when one ignores the industrial age, and tries to give Mill credit for drawing the best possible life for the pre-industrial man, one still can not avoid noticing the subjugation of the slaves, the suffering of the serfs, and all the other dark stories of the property-less in all the ages previous to the industrial one which Marx gives a full account of.Marx and Mill were faced with the same modern phenomenal, the danger of been alienated from the defining quality of humanity in the face of a new economic and a new political system. Marx might not have made the best analysis, but he did have a deep understanding of history and the problems in history. He stood at the level of the common people and tried to solve their problems caused by their material desperation. Mill did not stoop to the common people, he looked up into the sky of truth and tried to preserve the march toward truth first embarked on by Plato."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"On Liberty by Locke was very interesting and analyzed how humans see the world.

Someone may dislike homosexuals, but has no right to harass them or pass ethical judgements on them for what is their choice, of no harm to anyone else. Those are opinions of an indeterminate validity. Socal intervention may only be used to protect someone from restriction of their liberties. What Mill lacks in rigour, he makes up for in persuasiveness. He has some great lines in defense of liberty, a pre-dominant value of human life. Although, it is to be noted that the book can be somewhat tedious in areas which it is repetitive. This book also illustrates what can be seen as a fault in utilitarianism. Utilitarianism takes no notice of other values, or of a conflict of values, such as liberty of existence over the majorities happiness, in which ethics slides into absurdity."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"Mill's inconsistent treatment of liberty is so schizophrenic that is seems to be written by two different people, a Dr. Jekyll and a Mr. Hyde. His flashes of brilliance are marred by his incongruous forays into authoritarianism. It is incredible to me how anyone can read this book and come away viewing it as a legitimate defense of liberty. Mill is clearly guilty of wanting to have his cake and eat it too, and the resulting work is a litany of completely irreconcilable rules for civil society.The brilliant:\\"If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.\\"How elegant. But Mill is a double-edged sword:\\"Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end.\\"And:\\"Though society is not founded on a contract, and though no good purpose is answered by inventing a contract in order to deduce social obligations from it, every one who receives the protection of society owes a return for the benefit, and the fact of living in society renders it indispensable that each should be bound to observe a certain line of conduct towards the rest. This conduct consists, first, in not injuring the interests of one another; or rather certain interests, which, either by express legal provision or by tacit understanding, ought to be considered as rights; and secondly, in each person's bearing his share (to be fixed on some equitable principle) of the labors and sacrifices incurred for defending the society or its members from injury and molestation. These conditions society is justified in ENFORCING, at ALL COSTS to those who endeavor to withhold fulfilment.\\"Mill at once complains about expected group conformity, then turns around and suggests that community scorn is a justifiable weapon to be used against non-conformists. He talks of liberty, then of the duties we owe for the \\"general welfare.\\" On Liberty could as just as well have been written by a Marxist theorist."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"John Stuart Mill was a liberal's liberal or a socialist's socialist- ahead of his times (or just hanging on Karl Marx's coattail.)

I don't find it a coincidence that Mill was described as a \\"very ladylike person.\\" That seems to explain a great deal of his writing style, which bespeaks a certain dizziness of the mind.Roger Kimball summed up Mill well:Together with Rousseau, John Stuart Mill (1806-73) supplied nearly all of the arguments and most of the emotional weather - the texture of sentiment - that have gone into defining the Left-liberal vision of the world.Mill's peculiar brand of utilitarianism - a cake of Benthamite hedonism glazed with Wordsworthian sentimentality - accounts for part of his appeal: it provides a perfect recipe for embellishing programmatic shallowness with a cosmetic patina of spirituality. It is a recipe that has proven irresistible to those infatuated with the spectacle of their own virtue.Another large part of Mill's appeal rests on his \\"feminism\\" - his conviction, put forward in The Subjection of Women, that differences between the sexes were accidental and that, as Leslie Stephen put it, \\"women could be turned into men by trifling changes in the law\\". Both are indispensable elements in the intoxicating potion that constitutes Mill's appeal and makes much of his thinking seem so contemporary.Mill's arguments and pronouncements about man as a \\"progressive being\\", the extent of individual autonomy, the limits of acceptable moral and legal censure, the importance of innovation and (perhaps his most famous phrase) \\"experiments in living\\" are all familiar to the point of invisibility. Likewise his corollary insistence on the poverty of custom, prejudice and tradition. Mill's contentions on these subjects are nowadays less objects of debate than of reverence. But the public success of Mill's teaching (especially in his manifesto On Liberty) says nothing about the cogency of his arguments. In fact, Mill's central arguments are open to - and have from the beginning been subjected to - serious criticism. Yet they have raged like wildfire through the Western world, consuming everything that stands in their path. Which means, among other things, that they exert an appeal quite distinct from any intellectual merit they may possess.As for the nature of Mill's arguments, consider, for example, his famous plea on behalf of moral, social and intellectual \\"experiments\\". Throughout history, Mill argues, the authors of such innovations have been objects of ridicule, persecution and oppression; they have been ignored, silenced, exiled, imprisoned, even killed. But (Mill continues) we owe every step of progress, intellectual as well as moral, to the daring of innovators. \\"Without them,\\" he writes, \\"human life would become a stagnant pool. Not only is it they who introduce good things which did not before exist; it is they who keep the life in those which already exist.\\" Ergo, innovators - \\"developed human beings\\" is one phrase Mill uses for such paragons - should not merely be tolerated but positively be encouraged.The philosopher David Stove called this the \\"They All Laughed at Christopher Columbus\\" argument. The amazing thing about the success of the Columbus argument is that it depends on premises that are so obviously faulty. Indeed, as Stove observes, a moment's reflection reveals that the Columbus argument is undermined by a downright glaring weakness.Granted that every change for the better has depended on someone embarking on a new departure: well, so too has every change for the worse. And surely, Stove writes, there have been at least as many proposed innovations which \\"were or would have been for the worse as ones which were or would have been for the better\\". This means that we have at least as much reason to discourage innovators as to encourage them, especially when their innovations bear on things as immensely complex as the organisation of society. In On Liberty, Mill presented himself as a prophet of individual liberty. But if liberty was always on Mill's lips, a new orthodoxy was ever in his heart. There is an important sense in which the libertarian streak in On Liberty is little more than a prophylactic against the coerciveness that its assumption of virtuous rationality presupposes. Mill hoped that liberty would replace the reign of prejudice with the reign of reason. In fact, it has had the effect of camouflaging prejudices with rational-sounding rhetoric. The effort to unseat customary practice and belief has resulted not, as Mill predicted, in encouraging a drift towards unanimity but in increasing chaos.Nor is this surprising. As Mill's great critic James Fitzjames Stephen noted, \\"the notorious result of unlimited freedom of thought and discussion is to produce general scepticism on many subjects in the vast majority of minds\\". Such \\"paradoxes\\" (to put it politely) show themselves wherever the constructive part of Mill's doctrine is glimpsed through his cheerleading for freedom and eccentricity.Mill claimed a monopoly on the word \\"rational\\". So long as that monopoly remains unchallenged our paralysis will be complete. The antidote to the moral helplessness that Mill's liberalism generates is not to be found by digging deeper in the trench of liberal rationalisation. On the contrary, it begins with the recognition that no \\"one very simple principle\\" can relieve us of the duties we owe to the inhabited world that we, for this brief while, share with many others.See Kimball's excellent November 1998 article in The New Criterion entitled \\"One very simple principle\\""},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"I don't really like the fact that Mill wasn't religious- I don't believe you can have a just person who doesn't believe in a higher power, but the economics in On Liberty and the politics are amazing.

In other words: government needs to get out of our bidness!"},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"I'm not here to comment on the validity of JS Mill's ideas. The book is certainly helpful for those studying philosophy or attempting to gain a better understanding of political tradition. However, this edition is very poor. The footnotes are mixed in with the body of the text, so there's no way to know where they end. The description on the back sounds like it was written by a young student, which makes me suspicious about the quality of the printing. The text is difficult to follow because of its arrangement on the page. The printers divide words whenever possible and use hyphens instead of dashes.My complaints may sound minor, but I have not seen problems like this anywhere else--certainly not from a company that calls itself an authority on \\"classic books\\" or advertises \\"beautiful\\" production. The low price is the only benefit."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"J.S. Mill is a cornerstone of the Enlightenment and modernism, which itself is the foundation of democracy, of which the United States is the first example.It is extrememly interseting, therefore, that Mill's \\"On Libery\\" was listed by Online Human Events, the National Conservative Weekly, as a bad book that perhaps should be baned if not burned. The rest if their list is undeerstandable, but to lump Mill with Marx and Engels is to say you slept through your Western Civilization classes.Mill is a must read for anyone who wants to know how modern Western Civilization got where it is today, the roots and fruits of a free democratic society; and those who oppose him and it."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"JSM's On Liberty certainly stands among the classic works of the Age of Reason. Mill's encyclical is a perfect example of the tendency of the Enlightenment to believe something to be reasonable if it is couched in the proper language.Mill walks a tenuous path between Locke &amp; Bentham, taking up a defense of liberty, but unwilling to risk his utilitarian street cred. Thus, we have beautiful assertions such as &quot;the unchallenged idea is that which is in most danger&quot;, along side a perverse and logically twisted injection of &quot;duty&quot; into what is otherwise a syllogistic approach.Mill insists on a Lockian sphere of rights approach, then qualifies it in the cases of children (up to whatever age the law defines them), as well as in those societies that aren't developed enough for liberty (by Mill's definition?). Liberty is also to be restricted in such cases as a man might &quot;sin by omission&quot; and &quot;fail to help his Brother.&quot; These wonderful sentiments are followed by more cognitive dissonance, various ad hominem attacks on Christianity (particularly those sinister Catholics), and a lot of hand-waving about polygamy.As an aside, I imagine that G.K. Chesteron had Mill in mind when he wrote &quot;The worst judge of all is the man now most ready with his judgements; the ill-educated Christian turning gradually into the ill-tempered agnostic, entangled in the end of a feud of which he never understood the beginning, blighted with a sort of hereditary boredom with he knows not what, and already weary of hearing what he has never heard&quot;Throughout the work, Mill's passions and prejudices skew his arguments. It is a fascinating display of intellectual agility, to watch him extolling freedom while restraining it; to see him preach tolerance, and even go so far as to tolerate intolerance. Note that this last feat reminds me of the Kobyashi Maru Strategy - win the unwinnable game by changing the rules. The typical cultural relativist will divide by zero when approached with the self-contradiction of the tolerant society. Mill side-steps the issue and goes along his merry way, proclaiming not a full page later that &quot;there is always hope when people are forced to listen to both sides.&quot; It's refreshing to hear a champion of responsible liberty who's ready to practice coercion.Ultimately, Mill produces a monumental work that speaks volumes about more than its subject. His observations are supremely valuable, even when they are irrational, but most of the time he manages to define a system in which the interests of the state and the interests of the individual are balanced to his particular tastes.As a final note, unlike the introduction for Clausewitz' On War (another Penguin Classic), the Introduction here has value. Gertrude Himmelfarb thoroughly ties together Mill, his physical and intellectual parents, Mill's wife, his society, and peers, and manages to wrap the whole thing up in 42 pages."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"This Kindle book was clearly created from a text file and little, if any, editing or formatting was done for the Kindle.Paragraphs are fixed width, so unless you size your screen to the paragraphs, you will have lines breaking all over the place.

Mill explains his vision on the \`Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen' adopted by the National Constituent Assembly in Paris in August 1789 on a proposition by the marquis de La Fayette.The individual (liberty, sovereignty, responsibility)The individual is sovereign over his body and mind. His liberty concerns thought, opinion, sentiment, taste, pursuit and combination (freedom to unite and to trade).The limit to his liberty is based on one very simple principle: the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others.He has also responsibilities: it is a moral crime to bring a child into existence without a fair prospect of being able, not only to provide food for its body, but instruction and training for its mind.SocietySociety has jurisdiction over any part of a person\`s conduct which affects prejudicially the interests of others. Also, everyone who receives protection of society owns a return for the benefit (e.g., bearing one's share in defending one's country).But, the (majority of) people or the government has no right whatsoever to control the expression of opinion (media). Any doctrine, however immoral, has the fullest liberty to be professed or discussed.A culture without freedom never makes a liberal mind. A genius can only breed in an atmosphere of freedom.Philosophy (utilitarianism), religionJ. S.

Restrictions on trade (also of opium) are indeed restraints; and all restraint is an evil.We saw, lately, the havoc tree trade could inflict on the world economy. Without governmental intervention, the whole free trade system would have collapsed.J.S.

Mill's argument is very strong - convincing not only as an inherent right but also as a practical advantage to individuals and society. This is probably now his most famous work, and it is very easy to see why; his argument is not only compelling philosophically but widely applicable and, at about 140 pages, easily read by nearly all. Everyone from pure philosophers to political theorists to practical politicians to general readers can find something to like and learn."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"\\"On Liberty\\", by John Stuart Mill is one of the most important works in political philosophy. Many of Mills' words have passed into common usage in the years since the book was published in 1859. To quote one famous example: \\"Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\\"Mill writes in a florid, orotund style that often defies the rapid reader. One frequently has to plod through an over-punctuated verbal and syntactic thicket twice or thrice in order to extract the meaning of a passage. In this respect, Mill was perhaps no worse than other philosophical writers of his day - or indeed of any day.However \\"On Liberty\\" is definitely worth persevering with; not only for its exposition of the subject, but also for some wonderful passages of writing. Mill has a gift for simple exposition of complex philosophical questions.Liberty is always under threat, even in countries perhaps best known for valuing and promoting individual liberty - at least in the rhetoric of political leaders, if not in their practice. That might sound incredible, but one has only to reflect on the encroachments on liberty occasioned by the \\"war on terror\\" and the general support of the majority for such encroachments. In this case both governments and governed conspire to deny others liberty; the former by diktat, demagoguery and secrecy and the latter by strident bigotry.But, if I might be permitted a facetious remark, perhaps those countries have taken Mill too much to heart where he asserts that \\"despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided that the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end.\\"Such a patronising, indeed ignorant, view is repugnant to libertarians today, but it was a commonplace view among officials and churchmen in the high noon of the British Empire. But lest we feel too smug about the superiority of our own age, I will observe that we can see echoes of similar odious attitudes today in foreign policy, and the same will no doubt be true of future dominant powers yet to come onto the world stage.However, to be fair to Mill, his passing comment on \\"barbarians\\" is only one very minor part of this great book. More to the point, he asserts strongly in the book that views which are considered to be settled truth in one era may often be rejected in another. He goes on to say that conventional wisdom should always be rigorously tested and not merely assumed to be true on the authority of others.There are also large parts of the world where freedom of expression, and indeed freedom of thought, are suppressed. It is to be greatly hoped that \\"On Liberty\\" will one day be as influential there as it has been elsewhere. Mill himself states eloquently (but perhaps optimistically) that while the truth may be suppressed many times, it will ultimately prevail.After an introductory Chapter, Mill discusses liberty under four broad Chapters that I will touch on briefly below.In the Chapter on liberty of thought and expression, Mill has a swipe at the Christian faith. Some believers may be offended by this discussion, but why should they? The truth should be able to withstand the assaults of opposing views - indeed (as Mill says) it should welcome contrary views both as a means of strengthening the truth, and as a means of rooting out error.Moreover, Mill was writing in the middle of the 19th century, just before the publication of Darwin's theory of evolution, at a time when Christianity in England enjoyed many advantages and official protections. He quotes the example of a man who went to prison for writing an anti-Christian sentiment on a gate - an exemplary message to others who might be tempted to express their true thoughts.In the Chapter on individuality Mill maintains that liberty of thought and expression must necessarily lead to the desirability of people living as they choose, providing that they do not infringe the liberty or well-being of others. However, the arguments in this chapter are less well-presented than in the former chapter. Mill also makes an assertion that most people would reject today: \\"No government by a democracy.....ever did, or could, rise above mediocrity.\\" However it is important to remember that Mill wrote shortly after the extension of the voting franchise in Great Britain, when fears about democratic government were widely discussed, since experience of democratic government in modern industrial societies was quite limited at that time.In the Chapter on the limits to the authority of society over the individual, Mill makes the point that while the individual is sovereign over himself, the society in which he lives and from which he derives protection and other benefits also has rights over the individual. The individual is not accountable to society for his actions if they affect him alone; but as soon as one person's conduct adversely affects the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it.The wide-ranging implications of this principle are discussed comprehensively and lucidly - with good reason, because the allocation of rights and responsibilities between the individual and society is the most important business of coherent groups of human beings.In the final chapter, Mill discusses the practical application of his ideas, accepting that this is not always an easy matter."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"In many ways, one is tempted to think that there is no such thing as liberalism alive in America today. It would do many well to read the work of the Englishman Mill in order to understand much of what is called both \\"liberalism\\" as well as \\"individual liberty.\\" In addition, one of the growing issues of the contemporary political landscape in America is a polarization which is wholly unnecessary when analysis is applied the current plane of consideration. The reason for this conspicuous lack of reason for polarization is made obviously clear when one reads a work on liberal thought like that of Mill's. For Mill, individual liberty is a question both of social and political proportions, demanding a lack of interference by both government and social pressures. Additionally, he is keen in his analysis of the need for humility when it comes to humanity's apprehension of the Truth, thus necessitating free speech as a vehicle for the continual realization of those parts of the Truth which man so often forgets because of personal bias.However, the analysis is weak insofar as it also denies the need for structures to educate humanity in a fallen world. His criteria for legal and social sanctions does overlook the necessity to draw on tradition to properly shape those in the world (while maintaining individual dignity). While he acknowledges that it would be preposterous to deny the necessity of interrelationships and sharing of experience, Mill remains somewhat weak on the necessity of tradition and community as related to individual liberty. However, on the whole, the work presents a decent overview of the need to acknowledge individual dignity through the liberty of the individual. Indeed, all communal criticisms aside, On Liberty does indeed serve as a corrective against crass traditionalism which propagates itself without true individual consent and embrace. Therefore, even in its weakness, it remains strong as a key text on the primacy of the human individual as the recipient and follower of the Truth. In a day when liberty is shouted by groups who have no interest in talking to each other, such a small text would do well to make all groups realize that our American (and indeed Western) goals aren't that different, that we are united in trying to express human dignity through the individuals."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"Unlike the clueless and completely contradictory rantings of &quot;white_anglo_saxon_muslim&quot;, this book is entirely in favour of the freedom of the individual - personal freedoms that are entirely opposed to the thoughts of socialism and the notion of a government or body removing those freedoms in favour of a &quot;greater good&quot;.This book argues that it is not the role of anyone else to decide what is best for any one person, but that person's decision. Liberty - this book is ON LIBERTY.Anyone who thinks this book is in favour of socialism is completely misguided and confused."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"It is surprising to me how many people assume that \`On Liberty' was written before or during the American Revolution - Mill was certainly influenced by the spirit of American liberty, which was variously romanticised and adapted in Britain and Europe during the nineteenth century. Published in 1859, \`On Liberty' is one of the primary political texts of the nineteenth century; perhaps only the writings of Marx had a similar impact, and of the two, in today's world, Mill's philosophy seems the one that is triumphant.One of the interesting ideas behind \`On Liberty' is that this may in fact be more the inspiration of Harriet Taylor (later Mrs. J.S. Mill) than of Mill himself; Taylor wrote an essay on Toleration, most likely in 1832, but it remained unpublished until after her death. F.A. Hayek (free-market economist and philosopher) noticed this connection. Whether this was the direct inspiration or not, the principles are similar, and the Mills were rather united in their views about liberty.\`On Liberty' is more of an extended essay than a book - it isn't very long (104 pages of the text in the Norton Critical Edition, edited by David Spitz). It relates as a political piece to his general Utilitarianism and political reform ideology. A laissez faire capitalist in political economy, his writing has been described as \`improved Adam Smith' and \`popularised Ricardo'. Perhaps it is in part the brevity of \`On Liberty' that gives it an enduring quality.There are five primary sections to the text. The introduction sets the stage philosophically and historically. He equates the histories of classical civilisations (Greece and Rome) with his contemporary England, stating that the struggle between liberty and authority is ever present and a primary feature of society. He does not hold with unbridled or unfettered democracy, either (contrary to some popular readings of his text) - he warns that the tyranny of the majority can be just as dangerous and damaging toward a society as any individual or oligarchic despotism. Mill looks for a liberty that permits individualism; thus, while democracy is an important feature for Mill, there must be a system of checks and balances that ensures individual liberties over and against this kind of system. All of these elements receive further development in subsequent sections.The second section of the text is \`Of the Liberty of Thought and Discussion'. Freedom of speech and expression is an important aspect here. Mill presents a somewhat radical proposition that even should the government and the people be in complete agreement with regard to coercive action, it would still be an illegitimate power. This is an important consideration in today's world, as governments and people contemplate the curtailment of civil liberties in favour of increased security needs. The possibility of fallibility, according to Mill, makes the power illegitimate, and (again according to Mill) it doesn't matter if it affects many or only a few, people today or posterity. It is still wrong. Mill develops this argument largely by using the history of religious ideas and religious institutions, in addition to the political (since the two were so often inter-related).The third section is perhaps the best known and most quoted, \`Of Individuality, as One of the Elements of Well-Being'. It is perhaps a natural consequence of Enlightenment thinking that individuality over communal and corporate identity would dominate. Our world today goes back and forth between individual and communal identities (nationality, regionality, employment, church affiliation, school affiliation, sports teams, etc.). Mill's ideas of individual are very modern, quite at home with the ideas of modern political and civil individuality, with all of the responsibilities.Mill states, \`No one pretends that actions should be as free as opinions.' He recognises the increased limitations on individual liberty given that we do live in communal settings, but this does not hinder the idea of individuality and individual liberty, particularly as it pertains to thoughts and speech. Mill explores various ideas of personal identity and action (medieval, Calvinist, etc.) to come up with an idea of individuality that is rather modern; of course, this is political personhood that pre-dates the advent of psychology/psychoanalytic theory that will give rise to a lot more confusion for the role of identity and personhood in society.The fourth primary section looks theoretically at the individual in community, \`Of the Limits to the Authority of Society Over the Individual'; the final section looks at specific applications. Mill discounts the idea of social contract while maintain that there is a mutual responsibility between individuals and community. Mill looks at the Temperance movements and laws as an example of bad laws (not only from the aspect of curtailment of liberty, but also for impractical aspects of enforcement); in similar examples, Mill looks at the role of society in regulating the life of the individual, calling on good government to always err on the side of the individual.Mill puts it very directly -- Individuals are accountable only to themselves, unless their actions concern the interests of society at large. Few in the Western world would argue with this today; however, we still live in a world where \`thought police' are feared, and \`political correctness' is debated as appropriate or not with regard to individual liberties.Mill wrote extensively beyond this text, in areas of philosophy (logic, religion, ethics). The particular text I use here, the Norton Critical Edition, has a good annotated text of \`On Liberty', a copy of Harriet Taylor's essay, \`On Tolerance', and a criticism section, including five essays written against Mill's ideas and constructions, and four essays in favour. There is also a useful bibliography and index.This should probably be required reading in civics classes, if not in the pre-university years for students, then certainly in the early university years."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"J.S. Mill has written the best promulgation of classical liberalism in his book &quot;On Liberty&quot; (OL). Although a socialist himself, many of the ideas in OL are actually tenets of modern libertarianism (also called classical liberalism). Mill states that the only reason that force can be used on any man is to prevent harm to others. I consider &quot;focre&quot; to be either social or economic. Mill saw it as only social, which explains his socialism.Not to detract from Mill or OL, the book is a resounding defense of civil-liberties. OL completes modern democratic theory as promulgated by John Locke in his &quot;Two Treatises of Government.&quot; While Locke argues for some kind of democracy reminiscent of Athens, Mill qualifies Locke's point by protecting the minority from the majority. This book should be read by Americans who want to know more about freedom, and by our elected officials.Sadly, it's our elected oficials who probably won't get it."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"Few works argue as forcefully and eloquently for individual liberty as this one book. Written by one of England's greatest humanitarians, philosophers, and social scientists, this is one of the great classics in Western political philosophy. This book uses plain reason, clear logic, and objective reasoning to argue that the freedom of speech and its related freedoms such as freedom of assembly, press, petition, and religion, are ultimately beneficial to not only the individual, but to society as well. The latter argument goes as such; society is composed of individuals. Hence the knowledge and wisdom of a society is composed of the contributions of every individual. In order for a society to determine the truth, or best opinions on any particular topic, it must be allowed to see/hear all the opinions possible, which is only possible if everyone is allowed to voice their opinion.This reviewer read this book in high school, and was quite impressed with it back then.

This is a vibrant and passionate defense about the thinking and expression liberties, a vehement apology of the tolerance and respect beliefs or dissident minorities, a fearless recovery around the human spontaneity and singularity against the exerted oppression by authorities, costumes or public opinion.Under the lucid perspective of the elapsed years, this was a visionary text whose importance perhaps still has not been evaluated in all its wholeness."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"What J.S Mill proposes in \\"On Liberty\\" is still now convincing and interesting and I believe it should draw more attention than is the case today. True, Mill's ideas are not easily applicable to practical problems and his arguments are sometimes so defective as to be justifiably called \\"fallacies,\\" but still his fundamental principle is noteworthy and defensible: You can think, speak and do, as you like, unless you do any harm to others. Mill claims that this freedom, rather than spoiling our society, contributes to the progress of human beings in the long run, and this in the sense that so long as we humans do not achieve absolute infallibility, it is nothing other than human diversity that prevents us from falling into limited attitudes and courting fatal consequences. I agree from the bottom of my heart with this idea of his, and hope more attention will be paid to the book and its philosophy."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"A very definite view of legal rights, in that no interference from government should be permitted, save for when the actions of one harm others. This, of course, brings in questions about what constitutes 'harm', but all in all, a forceful argument for absolute free speech, unhampered by any law. I think this is interesting given the later restrictions placed on free speech. I was also interested to see how this book is rated on the high end of the 'difficult to read' scale, because I found Mill easy to follow and quite straightforward."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"Have you ever tried to read that fun twentieth-century philosophy, especially the Frenchy-continental strain that is so loaded with jargon and neologisms that you feel as if it was deliberately created to make you feel stupid? The alternative is that the arc philosophy from structuralism through postmodernism is obtuse because there is nothing left to say so you have to hide behind \\"Being-in-itself\\" and you have to drink vodka until being becomes nothingness.Mill's masterwork is nothing of the sort. It is a short, structured argument written in defense of a premodern libertarianism as \\"liberty\\". I won't gloss on it too much here, since others more qualified can talk about his ideas. My copy is marked up with individual passages highlighted and !!!ed, but it is not in isolation that these passages have strength. Mill is able to define his conception of Liberty very directly, and he is not utopian since he senses the limits of Liberty as he defines them. These limits necessitate a state structure that in my reading, is incompatible with the modern conception of Libertarianism. The problems were evident 150 years ago, and I read it as more against bureaucracy per se than as against Government as a whole.Overall, readings and interpretations can vary across readers and across time, but this is a very important and interesting book to help build or challenge a world-view."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"An advocate for the development of individuality/ human potentials for social progress, the author believes and emphatically promotes liberty as essential foundation for freedom of conscience, free will as well as diligent exploration of diverse and opposing/contradicting ideas. He warns against mental complacency/laziness/conformity in many forms of public opinions, custom, doctrines and religioius dogmas with underlying notion of infallibility. He calls them \\"despotism\\" that hinders human advancemen and also quotes \\"slumber of a decided opinion\\" as dangers of uncontested ideas. Reading intoductory biography also helps to understand the personal background that influenced his political philosophy. His beliefs in liberty of one's actions are qualified in the sense and context of individual responsibility for self and \\"others\\", for example, he calls it \\"moral crime\\" against the offspring and society to \\"bring a child into existence without a fair prospect of being able to\\" provide education. In our current culture where McDonald (not individuals or parents) is blamed for obesity and some people claim entitlement about having multiple children even when they are being born into an environment that will most likely cause suffering and cycling through welfare system, John Stuart Mill's ideas of responsible liberty sadly cause feelings of disorientation. A psychologist once said, (perhaps, Rollo May?) we have to choose between \\"neurotic necessity and responsible freedom\\" This was a great read."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"\\"On Liberty\\" is one of the most important books on political thought of the nineteenth century. Fortunately for the 21st century reader it is also one of the most accessible. Mill was a libertarian who chose not to base his defence of liberty on natural rights but on his own revised version of utilitarianism:\\"I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions...grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being.\\"This enables Mill to argue that freedom is needed if man is to be able to explore all the avenues of human development that allow the human race to progress. Total freedom is impossible so what determines the legitimate boundaries of freedom? Mill distinguishes between self-regarding and other-regarding actions. The former should never be interfered with and the latter subject to limitation only if they harm the legitimate rights of others.For Mill free thought is a self-regarding action which should not be curtailed, and free thought is virtually useless without free speech. Mill then proceeds to add a utilitarian argument in favour of free speech: if an opinion is silenced then mankind is necessarily the loser whether the opinion is true or false. He advances a number of arguments to support this, concluding with the claim that a climate of freedom is essential for \\"great thinkers\\" and \\"it is as much, and even more indispensable to enable average human beings to attain the mental stature they are capable of.\\" He has no truck with paternalists seeking to guide people's thoughts in the \\"right\\" direction. He was equally hostile to the idea that people had the right not to be offended; hence he opposed the blasphemy law. The single case Mill gives of an acceptable limitation of free speech is the case of corn-dealers and an excited mob. An opinion expressed in a newspaper that corn-dealers are \\"starvers of the poor\\" is legitimate, but the same view stated to an angry mob outside the corn-dealer's home may be limited if it \\"is a positive instigation to a mischievous act.\\"Mill concedes that actions cannot be as free as speech and seeks to establish the proper limits of freedom of action. Mill proposes that \\"the sole end for which mankind are warranted...in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.\\" Because he rejects paternalism he opposes all interference with self-regarding actions. Mill would not have prevented people from taking drugs and he would have led the opposition to seat belt legislation. Mill even rejects state interference with liberty for the sake of crime prevention, e.g. poisons can be used for criminal purposes. Mill was willing to accept a register of their sale but not the banning of them. Mill believes we must not interfere with the \\"rights\\"of others but these are narrowly circumscribed and Mill makes it clear that \\"rights\\" are not the same as \\"interests\\". Hence cut-throat laissez-faire is legitimate. As for moral decency arguments Mill does say that sexual intercourse in public is unacceptable, and though fornication and gambling are acceptable he is in two minds about whether pimps and casino-owners should be allowed to operate. Mill says it is a difficult case that is on the borderline, but adds that in general we must resist attempts to limit behaviour for \\"moral\\" reasons because any such action is likely to be the thin end of the wedge.Though Mill is a very determined anti-paternalist he makes three exceptions: children, primitive societies and the disabled. Children must be guided until they reach maturity and they must be given compulsory education - something not given legislative force until 1871 in his native country. As for primitive societies we must resist the notion that Mill was a typical Victorian believing in the \\"white man's burden\\" or inherent differences between races. He simply observed the reality of the world in the mid-nineteenth century but made it very clear any intervention in backward societies must be temporary with the aim to bring about self-government as soon as possible.Hence Mill was a much more determined libertarian than most modern writers on the subject. There is just one example where, at first sight, Mill may seem reactionary to modern readers. He wished to restrict the right to have children to those who could prove that they could support them. However, those who today wish others to be allowed to procreate at will do so on the grounds of human rights. Mill based his theories on utilitarianism, and not on rights. There was no welfare state when Mill wrote \\"On Liberty\\" and he was concerned with the well-being of children born to people without the means to support them.In view of the growing restrictions on freedom in many Western nations this is a book well worth reading again. In particular I like Mill's argument that every restriction on freedom is the thin end of the wedge, providing a justification for further restrictions."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"This is Mill's statement of the ' one very simple principle' he wished to establish in ' On Liberty' \\" The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion or control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. The principle is that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively , in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do, or forebear because it will be better for him to do,because it will make him happier, because , in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise or even right... The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society,is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself , his idnependence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.This is in a nutshell the creed of Mill's faith in ' On Liberty ' Gertrude Himmelfarb in her brilliant introduction explains how that faith developed in part out of the personal situation in which Mill found himself after years of close friendship with the - then married Harriet Taylor after her husband died, became his wife. One great controversy relates to the vast credit Mill gave her with being a full partner in every way in creating this work. The social isolation both suffered as a result of their relationship is an important element in Mill's fierce defence of the individual's right to be free of social coercion, and opinion. Another central element in the development of Mill's thought is his reaction to the Utilitarianism his father John Mill and Jeremy Bentham instilled in Mill from childhood. 'The greatest happiness for the greatest number principal' is rejected by Mill as first basis for social action. Mill in effect says that it is not society's business to be a Grand Inquisitor and bring it bread and circuses to make it happy. Happiness is not the first principle any longer in Mill's thought rather individual liberty is. The sole curb on such individual liberty is when it leads to the harming of others. This faith of Mill can be recognized today as part and parcel of the fundamental ideology of democratic societies.This work is thus one of the fundamental political classics which form the Western political tradition. And it is one of those works which should be part of the curriculum of any true liberal arts education. The question of the excesses of this principle and whether Mill in his thought has provided sufficient check to it by consideration of other human values isa very real and debatable one even today."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"In the Introduction to \\"On Liberty,\\" Currin Shields, an English egghead, bemoans the fact that Mill's most \\"famous\\" essay is \\"more talked about than read.\\"I'm surprised it is even talked about, and I am very much NOT surprised that hardly anyone reads it. Mill takes about a hundred and twenty pages to say what could be (and was) summed up in an epigram: People should be free to do whatever they want, as long as it does not harm anyone else.Not only does Mill subject the reader to pages and pages of supererogatory writing, but his prose is the epitome of Victorian verbosity, with more modifiers, clauses, footnotes, and parentheticals than there are alcoholics in Butte, Montana. (And there are a LOT of alcoholics in Butte, Montana.)I guess if you're studying philosophy, you're gonna have to read this thing sooner or later...likewise if you're an autodidact."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"This book represents the beginning of the peversion of classical liberalism (Algernon Sidney, John Trenchard, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry) into the tyranny of modern day liberalism (socialism). Mill is the originator of the thoughtless confounding of liberal and socialist ideas that led to the decline of the living standards of the English people. Mill is the great advocate of Socialism. All the arguments that could be expounded in favour of socialism are expounded here. Marx, Lasalle and Engels are scarcely of importance. The blood of 100 million ultimately dripped from his pen (see the black book of communism). Liberty means freedom from taxes, too many laws and respect for property rights not the right to welfare or necessarily to vote. It is no surprise to see neo-con Himmelfarb enthusing over this book considering the Kristol family are fans of the tyrant Trotsky.Of course as an agnostic he advocates that socially, individuals should be privately able to do whatever they like. Unfortunately in order for a society to be free from too many laws the people must abide by unwritten laws and that means the laws of the Abrahamic God. If a village does not want to tolerate homosexuals then they should be free not to and be able to drive them out, it's called the social contract. As George Washington wisely put it 'in order to be a truly free people,we must be a religious people'. J.S. Mill, not a very good thinker and an appalling one on the nature of liberty."},{"Title":"Kids say the darndest things!","review":"when I was 10 years old, I found this gem in a large pile of books at my Grandma's house.

I was so excited to be able to purchase a new copy. My children are grown now and I have shared this book with them. My husband and I just laugh over the anecdotes in this book. We quote them to each other quite often. We just reread the book out loud to each other and often we would have tears rolling down our faces from laughing so hard. It also would remind us of some of the funny things our own kids would say when they were growing up. Overall I would say this is just a fun book that will brighten your day.

Solzhenitsyn sub-titles his book 'An Experiment in Literary Investigation.' As the reader plows through the author's strange mixture of compelling narrative in parts and excessive fascination with names, dates, and places in others, the reader begins to see that this investigation is a new genre. It is part autobiography, part novel, part polemic. Solzhenitsyn tries to guide the reader through a half century of the evolution of the Soviet prison system, the Gulag, by using his sewage disposal metaphor. A good idea, but the wrong metaphor. Since his work so often uses bodily phrases like 'cancer' and 'metastasizing', perhaps he might have switched to an organic one. He describes the very beginnings of the Gulag system as the core foundation for post-Revolutionary communism. It was to the gulags that waves of multi-generational opponents of first Lenin, then Stalin, were sent. Solzhenitsyn makes it clear early on the very first leaders of communism saw in the gulags a long term solution to reshaping a multi-stranded Russian society into a mono-stranded Soviet one. No one knew it then, but such an effort was doomed to fail. It is remarkable that it lasted as long as it did when Yeltsin stood atop a tank to topple the communist regime. The gulag system was a self-perpetuating bureaucracy, swallowing in huge gulps entire waves of segments of Soviet society. What is astonishing is that he reveals that most often there was no logic to the call to rounding up the usual suspects. In Soviet Russia, everyone was a usual suspect. Even members of the secret police, first called the Cheka, then the NKVD, finally morphing to the KGB, were expected to place their necks on the chopping blocks when called to do so. It was routinely assumed that if the police did not come for you today, well, tomorrow was another day. At the start of the book, 'today' occurs for Solzhenitsyn, when he is arrested for writing subversive letters. He is accosted by security officers and hustled off to a gulag where he remained for decades. While incarcerated, he learns, he thinks, he remembers a vast waterfall of details that later goes into the writing of this book. A minor criticism I have is that I wonder how, without detailed notes, he was able to retain accurately this overwhelming flow of data.He calls Part II 'Perpetual Motion.' By this he means that Russias gulags were constantly on the prowl, ever seeking new victims. Perhaps an unspoken assumption is the circular direction of this movement. It began in lawlessness in 1918 and ends the same in 1991. Evil seems to exist for as long as it takes good men like Solzhenitsyn to be able to cry out in the night to stop the madness."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"I always knew about the Nazi camps and knew that Stalin had been hoarding prisoners, but the Gulag Archipelago opens your eyes to the crimes that most of us ignore or don't ever even learn about.

Though Solzhenitsyn's experience of the Gulag took place under Soviet rule, the phenomenon does not seem to be uniquely Communist but is symptomatic of totalitarianism in general. This is why this \\"experiment in literary investigation\\" is so relevant right here, right now. The potential for something like Gulag in the age of the eternal \\"war on terror\\" is terrifying. (And as the author notes, many of the evils committed in Gulag depended upon the perpetrator believing that what he did was not only necessary, but actually moral.)Yet Solzhenitsyn's indefatigable sense of humor and generosity of spirit keep this book (at 615 pages, the first volume of three) from being a work of torture in itself. Instead, he mocks the pretensions of the Soviet penal code and revels in the small joys (i.e., sleep, reading, comradery) he experienced in Gulag. In fact, at times, Solzhenitsyn conveys the sense that Gulag was a potentially redemptive experienced for those who made it through, since it winnowed away the chaff of life from the wheat and revealed the nobility we may find in our darkest, deepest hour."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"The author spent 10 years in one of these prison camps, this work is going to be biased.

How far are we in America from this sort of thing? It happened in modern Russia and in modern Germany, and it is still happening around the world.

It is a very personal and at times moving account of lives forgotten by the world but now remembered. At times the constant repetition of the countless stories does get a bit tiring, not because it's boring but because it seems impossible that such things could happen in this modern world.I came away from this book learning a lot of personal lessons about life, lessons that, thanks to Solzhenitsyn, I have avoided learning the hard way. For example, that when we hold on to things too tightly we sometimes cause unnecessary suffering by worrying about them. It would be better to be less tied up in our material possessions and give more thought to the weightier matters in life such as our relationships... it sounds clich&eacute;d I know, but when you are told this lesson by someone whose idea of a possession was one item of clothing on his back, then you begin to gain some perspective.The style of writing is not very inviting at first, it's almost as if it was stream-of-consciousness writing so at times he may be longwinded and reminisce about one incident for a long time and then suddenly jump to something else that seems completely different. It took me awhile to get used to this, but I promise you, after you get half way and get used to this style of writing, you will be glad you persevered. I would highly recommend this first work to anyone interested in the history of the Soviet Union, a different (human) perspective on Communism or just a great autobiographical work."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"This book makes me want to never complain about anything ever again.The Gulag Archipelago details the suffering faced by countless millions in the U.S.S.R.'s prison and labor camp system.

If you want, I'll spell it out for you right now. Do no pursue what is illusory - property and position: all that is gained at the expense of your nerves decade after decade, and is confiscated in one fell night. Live with a steady superiority over life - don't be afraid of misfortune, and do not yearn after happiness; it is, after all, all the same: the bitter doesn't last forever, and the sweet never fills the cup to overflowing. It is enough if you don't freeze in the cold and if thirst and hunger don't claw at your insides. If your back isn't broken, if your feet can walk, if both arms can bend, if both eyes see, and if both ears hear, then whom should you envy? And why? Our envy of other devours us most of all. Rub your eyes and purify your heart - a prize above all else in the world those who love you and wish you well.

It describes the dispair and horror of stalin's russia. If you want an insight as to why the USA is so staunchly and fanatically anti-communist, read this book! Stalin and his communists tried to build their workers paradise through slavery. Millions were arrested and sent to labor camps because the commies needed slaves, so they arrested them and condemned them for at least 10 years ('a tenner').A stunning, very well written, page turner that shows there are things worse than death! They crammed 40 people into cells designed for 2 people. Torture, arbitrary doubling of your sentence (from 10 to 20 years), sadistic guards, all for no crime whatsoever! Makes the West look like heaven on earth.And Solzhenitsyn keeps it interesting, even humorous. Like when a crowd was applauding Stalin, and everyone was afraid to be the first one to stop applauding because they knew they would be arrested! So the applause went on for 1/2 hour, with nobody daring to stop! Finally, a brave soul stopped, and he was arrested and sent away the next day.It's a great book.

The sheer number of innocent lives that were thrown away for the sake of paranoia is astonishing and enraging. It is a pattern that is constantly repeated in countries where there is one leader who eventually succumbs to paranoia and imprisons the whole country. It was the exact same thing with Mao's China, he started off with good ideas but eventually ended up throwing the country back to the stone ag.Solzhenitsyn used an amazing writing style, he conveys what started off as simple interviews into an almost poetic style. Intertwined in his writing were many open ended questions, some of which he answered and some which he left for us to think about. This makes the book all the more engaging and fascinating. The fact that he used interviews was pure genius, he could've simply given us a plethora of facts, but he chose not to. He chose to use the words of the people, people who had lived through this torment (he too was one of the people). It was their stories of torture, arrest, interrogation, imprisonment, labor and exile that truly help us realize how much of a madman Stalin was.This is an amazing piece of work told in the greatest writing style imaginable.

A better book on the state of Russia from 1918-1956 has ever been written-period! This book takes time and patience to get through but it is well worth the effort. If you are interested in the history of Russian Communism, seen through the eyes of a staunch-supporter-political-prisoner-turned-dissident, then this is the book for you!

This book, written by a constantly watched and persecuted dissident - bent but not broken by the brutality of Stalinist work camps, shares the author's (and his other inmates') personal experiences falling into this dark, usually fatal, abyss. Solzhenitsyn's original work was published in 1971 and produced an absolutely damning indictment of communism in Russia. Indeed, the stunning quality and importance of his writing earned him a Nobel prize.Besides his own experiences, Solzhenitsyn collected personal stories from hundreds of his fellow inmates. The sadism of interrogators, the cruelty of guards, the indifference of neighbors, the paranoia of the public, the betrayal of stoolies, and the true comradery of innocent inmates are presented in vivid, factual detail. In addition to this, the author also presents an encyclopeadic knowledge of the entirety of the gigantic Stalinist security apparatus (normal labor camps, special labor camps, transfer camps, railroad transfers, prisons, holding cells, interrogation cells, NKVD, SMERSH, commissars, exile communities, and still more).But at the heart of it all, the book remains an unforgettable journey through man-made hell. Stalin meant to destroy every man, woman, and child arrested, regardless of their innocence, and he largely succeeded. But survivors like Solzhenitsyn did truly 'tear down the wall' and made this world a far better place to live in. We all owe him a huge debt of gratitude!"},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"For any who have any nostalgia for the Soviet Union, this book should put it to rest. This book is hard to categorize; it is more than one man's opinion, but less than an objective history. It is, as Solzhenitsyn puts it, \\"an experiment in literary investigation\\": a combination memoir and dissertation on the evils of Communism and its inevitable product, the forced labor camp. Some have criticized Solzhenitsyn as an anti-Communist/pro-Western polemicist, but that is not an accurate description. He is a realist, showing not only the faults of Communists, but also those of the West and Western leaders. This should be required reading for European and world history classes. Volume 1 (of 3) describes the arrest and interrogation procedures, as well as life in the Gulag."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"How thin is the veil we call Civilization!! This book is indeed a tedious read by virtue of its length. However, Solzhenitsyn's history is written with the prosaic style of a Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky.Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was a Captain in the Soviet Army as it charged through Nazi occupied Poland when he was arrested on trumped-up charges in February 1945. Thus began his odyssey through Gulag, \\"the country within a country\\". The perpetually weak economy of Communism could not survive without the forced labor of millions of is own citizens who became prisoners for one reason or another, or no reason at all. Solzhenitsyn relates his own experiences as well as those of other prisoners with whom he became acquainted while incarcerated. He relates how ordinary Russians were arrested and charged with fraudulent charges (if charged at all), interrogated, tortured and forced to confess under extreme duress, and sent off to labor for the good of the Motherland.Throughout the book, Solzhenitsyn asks the reader incredulously, \\"how did we let this happen?\\" That is no doubt one of the most important questions posed in all of human history. If we study history in order to prevent the repetition of our mistakes, then Solzhenitsyn's work should be required reading of all residents of Planet Earth."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"It is hard to measure how profound a book like this is, because it covers such a wide range of subjects almost subtlely. The things that you are likely to remember are the descriptions of torture, the small amounts of food, and so forth. What you remember is the things that made you cringe, and realise that you probably would have given up had you been placed in the same situation.But as Solzhenitsyn tried repeatedly to bring out, it was the so-called \\"little\\" things that really either killed you, or gave you hope. As an example, many people might recall the sticking of hot metal up certain areas of the human anatomy; but as Solzehnitsyn said, this was most often not necessary. Seemingly mundane (relatively speaking) things like sleep deprivation was enough to drive even the most stable men insane. It was not the hot flash of pain that would get most people, but the exhaustion of wakefulness. Monotony could be every bit as much your enemy as freezing temperatures; and it was just as likely to send you to your death. These are but two examples, Solzehnitsyn gives up many more.If there is any book that can and should be read by everyone, it is this book. One need not be interested in communism, political theory, or such things for this book to have meaning. This book is above all about the human condition. It is a biograpy and autobiography about every man who has ever suffered greatly, and it is a lesson to every man who has never suffered greatly."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"I have the full three volume set of the Gulag that I read years ago. It is the greatest book ever written. In portraying Communism, as he described as man's inhumanity to man, Solzhenitsyn has an exceptional ability while depicting the excessively cruel treatment of human beings in the Gulag to demonstrate his dignity and the dignity of those who suffered at the hands of their oppressors. The entire book is full of stories of the courage of human beings in the face of such evil. In that way, while depicting the horrible conditions of the Gulag, the book ultimately provides an uplifting message that peace and kindness are enduring human traits that can and do shine through despite overwhelming attempts to erase them.

Though it is very difficult to get into - in the original v1 there is a long abstract section on gulags as a sewage system in turbid prose - once the reader gets swept into thos narrative of suffering there is no other reading experience like it.Solzhenitsyn spent his youth as a gulag prisoner for having criticized Stalin on a postcard. V1 covers his arrest and interrogation and transport into despair and disillusionment. What he experienced, from his start as a strong and idealistic young war leader, can only be described as hell on earth. Only Hitler's death factories could compare, and yet Stalin's slave labor camps were being held up as marvels of social policy and redemption. The cruelty of treatment, the insights into the astonishing characters around him, and the compilation of other people's stories - Solzhenitsyn describes his experience as only one gulp from an ocean of bitterness and shattered lives - are unequalled in the modern literature on totalitarianism. My experience was to be utterly transported into this realm, to look at my life and values and think about what mattered most to develop within myself. No other book ever had a deeper impact on me. That makes this, in my opinion, essential reading to understand the last century at its very very worst.The second volume follows Solzhenitsyn as he becomes a hardened and grief-stricken prison slave, indifferent to whether he is killed by a stray bullet during riots and abandoning his faith in communism. A central pert of the book is his religious conversion - the only one I ever read about that I truly understood on an emotional level - at the deathbed of perhaps his greatest freind. V3 covers his relesase from prison and his attempts to rebuild his life.All three volumes offered to me the experience of living totally outside of myself and in the reality of a totalitarian state. I first read these in EUrope when they appeared, and the debates on the merits of the communist sytem were very much alive at the time. Now they are only of historical interest, but I still think they are must reading for anyone who wants to understand the worst of one of the most tumultuous centuries in the history of mankind.Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"\\"A stone is not a human being, and even stones get crushed.\\"This was an absolutely brutal, yet enlightening read. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was a young, decorated Red Army officer who served bravely during the war, only to be arrested, tortured, and sent to the Gulag Archipelago (the forced labor camp system) to do a ten year sentence, followed by permanent internal exile. This book is a combination of his own personal experiences, and a general history of the gulag system which he has gathered from research as well as other personal stories sent to him by other inmates.For privately criticizing Stalin, the author was clearly guilty of being a dangerous \\"enemy of the people\\" worthy of torture and death,(Solzhenitsyn writes with a brilliant sense of sarcasm) but the fact is, many were arrested quite arbitrarily, many simply because of a need to fill quotas. I'm reminded of a quote by Stalins right hand man Molotov, when speaking about the randomness of arrests, years after the war: \\"a man could have been a right-winger, and not realized he was a right-winger. We had to be sure.\\" Or something to that effect. These enemies of the people would feed the \\"sewage disposal system\\" of the Soviet state.In his sarcastic, metaphorical writing style, the author describes all the horrors of the system, beginning with arrest and torture, *ahem* interrogation, and all through the stages of the camp system where death and cruelty became the only certainties. Ruthlessness, Solzhenitsyn writes, was the measure of a Bolsheviks worth. The more single-mindedly cruel he was, determined his dedication to the state. Any form of kindness toward the accused was seen as a sign of weakness and lack of zeal. Most disturbing was his descriptions of the torture, he claims that there were 52 different methods at the interrogators disposal, to ensure they don't become bored of course! 14 hour work days in subzero temperatures with inadequate clothing and pitiful food rations were also the norm. People were often beaten, terrorized and shot out of hand for the smallest infractions, or occasionally for the mere amusement of the guards. Such is life in the Archipelago!Although some have accused Solzhenitsyn of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, i.e. condemning communism as a whole because of Stalinism, he is absolutely right when he claims that the brutality and terror were started under Lenin and Trotsky. While one can split hairs and argue that things might have turned out differently without Stalin, I see no reason to believe that things would have been THAT different. He also makes a consistent point of comparing the Soviet state to that of the Tsars, claiming that whatever their faults, life in Imperial Russia was never even close to this harsh. I specifically appreciated how he pointed out how easy the Bolshevik revolutionaries had it when they were arrested under the Tsar. Two, maybe three years in lenient exile for trying to overthrow the state! Yet under the Soviets, you would get 10, maybe 25 years of hard labor for practically nothing, which you would probably not survive anyway. All in all, this is a disturbing but brilliant and essential read for understanding the Soviet state. 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"So much has been written about this particular work that little I say here will have any great meaning nor any great insight. When finishing the reading of a work such as this, it is tempting to go into line after line of pontificates..this I won't do. I will say though that this work is important. Not only do we learn, as if we did not already know, the horrible things men can do to other men, it also gives us a great insight to the cold war, why it was fought, and what the outcome could have been if the wrong side had won. For me, and I have given this work several readings over the years, this is one of the more important books written in the past 100 years. I is some comfort to me to know that I and my family were able to live in a relatively free society and while that society might not be perfect, it is certainly better that that delt some people in this world. Unlike some of the reviewers here, I would recommend that the statistics quoted in the book be ignored. They are somewhat meaningless.

Solzhenitsyn gives voice to the millions of voiceless victims of Stalin's Soviet Russia. Unfortunately this is one of histories lesser known crimes, and the power of this man's voice helps to rectify this. This book is powerful and brutal. Solzhenitsyn forces his readers to stare into the face of evil and see the horrors that can happen when tyrants are allowed to run roughshod over a people.This book is so tremendously important as a warning for all people to take care that tyranny does not get the opportunity to capture a people. It illustrates the inhumanity that man is capable of, and he shows readers the terrible price that dictators impose.This book needs to be required reading because it has the affect of so eloquently exposing readers to the reality that people all over the world face. This is why this book is so powerful. It is the universal nature of this work that shows the reader what happens to people in this situation. This book forces the reader to be empathetic to the plight of suffering people the world over. What this work shows is that this type of oppression becomes so pervasive that it is almost impossible to overcome. The people don't want this nor do they simply acquiesce to this tyranny. What happens is that a society becomes totally corrupted to the point where there is nothing left.This is an extremely important work that needs to be read."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"I read this work while doing research in preparation for my senior Western Civilization presentation.

Solzhenitsyn reminds us that Reagan was absolutely, precisely, CORRECT! The Left in the West told us all through the Cold War that the Russians were just like us, that they were being lied to about us and we were being lied to about them, that they didn't pose a threat, that they were just afraid of us, etc., etc. Solzhenitsyn proved that they were absolutely WRONG! That's why he was accepted when he was a harmless, cute, dissident, but he refused to shut up and the response from the Western Left was almost as virulent as that of the Soviet regime that imprisoned him for criticizing Stalin in a personal letter. Read this along with First Circle and thank God that we were the ones who won the Cold War."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"I read this book (this edition is only Vol 1; I highly recommend reading through at least Vol 2) 25 years ago in the wake of this work becoming a political slogan and football bandied about so much during the Reagan years, as it turns out by people who obviously had not read it. While intially approaching that task with some skepticism, I quickly concluded that it was very well written and informed, being worth the time spent in reading it.\\"Gulag\\" is an acronym in Russian for an agency that was known as the Central Administration of Corrective Labor Camps which the author, a former Red Army officer, entered in 1945 as a \\"zek\\" or prisoner. The book(s) is a very absorbing chronicle of the history of this system in general and through the personal stories of specific individuals that became known to the author. While Solshinitsyn is very explicit, obviously, in making his bitterly and well earned anti-communist outlook known, this work is not a hysterial rant or screed, but a serious memoir and work of historical literature, one that is neither boring nor tendentious. Moreover, while the author's affinity for Russia's Orthodox traditions shines through, a certain social-revolutionary sensiblity that has also been a hallmark of that culture during the last century and half of upheaval also emerges. As Herzen observed about Bakunin, who endured his own stuggles with Russian Tsarist tyranny and Siberian exile in the previous century, it seems that the Gulag's author was not born under any ordinary star, but a comet.The forced labor camp system set up by Stalin was designed to purge his political opponents, set up a system of cheap forced labor to subsize his economic development and industrialization programs, and as a vehicle for the implementation of his own peculiar take on ostensible Marxist-Leninist class struggle, social cleansing, and transformation. Thus the first section is entitled \\"The history of our sewage disposal sytem,\\" detailing how a quarter of \\"Leningrad\\" was \\"cleaned out\\" in the political and psuedo legal context of the newly adopted Soviet Constitution (Article 10 as I recall) that criminalized the formerly privileged classes and \\"socially hostile elements.\\" In the camp context this meant that the common criminal element, \\"the socially friendly\\" (the title of a chapter in Vol 2 as I recall) that may have been present was pandered to while being incited against political enemies of the state, parts of this story being reminiscent of MacKinlay Kantor's fictional descrition of POW life in \\"Andersonville\\", although in this context it was a concious policy pursued as part of the \\"institutionalization of the dictatorship of the proletariat.\\" And how does one recognize the socially friendly? The presence of tatoos on their bodies, for one thing, the author astutely observes.The first camp that was set up was in the Solovetsky Islands during the era of the Bolshevik Revolution in the early 20s in the wake of the Civil War was not particulary egregious by prison standards of the time. The theme was set by the slogan on the Herring Gate which stated the theme, \\"For the Workers and Peasants!\\", a context in which one not atypical prisoner arrived garbed in a tuxedo. Later, in the days of the Great Purge and thereafter, privileged seeming arrivals would be jeeringly greeted at the Kolyma by the socially friendly with comments like \\"Welcome to Vorkuta, Fascist Gentlemen!\\" At this point, however, the definition of socially privileged was dramatically lowered to include \\"kulaks\\" or landed peasants; the campaign of the Soviet state against whom was an unmitigated moral and economic disaster.The Gulag system in its maturity was set up under the leadership one Neftely Frenkel, a former Turkish businessman who oversaw the creation of a large network or \\"archipelago\\" of camps all over the Soviet Union, reaching to the remotest parts of Eastern Siberia. He supervised this vast fiefdom from his personal railroad car in which he traveled where he willed in the manner of a robber baron.Solshenitsyn describes the pathological paronoia that set in during the era of the Great Purge and the arbitrary predations of Stalin's petty \\"Chekist\\" hacks, whose own subsequent demise provides some sweet irony to the author. All this actually weakened Russia, from the destruction of its officer corps to the inefficient and shoddy projects completed by convict labor, such as the Belamor Canal which Stalin forced to be built by hand and which turned out to be too shallow. Given the meagre rations that were based on Frenkel's concept of the \\"differentiated ration pot\\" which meant that, in theory, food was given out on the basis of labor expended, but in reality meant the socially friendly and others with relative privileges got more, survival meant getting out of \\"general assignment\\" into some special assignment outside of working in the main labor project. This the author managed to do by getting a job in camp administration based on his education. Otherwise he would have faced the prospect, leaving execution aside, of slow starvation after he fell out as one of the camp's \\"last leggers.\\" Although executions are described in these camps, including en masse, they were not death camps on the Nazi model, as Stalin's regime, for the most part, didn't wait to ship people off it had already marked for death before killing them. In this connection, the abuses of the \\"differentiated ration pot\\" are discussed, a theory by which people were fed according to the amount of work they did, but more often in reality according to who was in favor leading to the weak and dissident elements being worked and starved to death.While the author disparges Marxism and atheism, he gives some grudging respect to Bolshevik and revolutionary traditions when linked with the struggles of the common folk and Russian patriotism. Thus we have the story of the Cossack who pole-vaulted over the camp walls to join the front line fight against the German invaders and Volume 2 concludes with the story of the Red Army veteran in 1945 who walks off a job cleaning up war rubble in protest of not having any shoes. When confronted by a cop with a threat of arrest and deportation to camp, he responds angrily that he is veteran of the war and a Bolshevik, willing to make further great sacrifices, but insists on at least having shoes. The cop backs off. Thus the theme is returned to that opened the work when the author, indignantly informs those arresting him, for writing comments critical of Stalin in personal letters, of his status as a Red Army tanker. Then of course there was his angry implication in reponse to the students that heckled him at Harvard in the late 70s that those privileged socially hostile elements could perhaps use some corrective labor.I am surprised that Solshentisyn has not emerged more as a public figure in post-Soviet Russia. It seems that he would have a lot to contribute. I encourage people to read this work. It fully deserves the awards and accolades it has achieved."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"Solzhenitsyn gave the world a glimpse of man's darkness in the twentieth century far better than any fictional dystopia Orwell could dream up. Although this is an abridged version, it generally flows well and still hits with a punch. The book is a powerful testament to the best and worst qualities within the human race (mostly the worst). I must commend Solzhenitsyn on his brilliant combination of personal experience, history, dark humor, and at times optimism.Solzhenitsyn isn't the first Christian author to portray the nightmare of totalitarism. Corrie Ten Boom's \\"The Hiding Place\\" and books by the Wurmbrands are quite powerful in their own right. I suppose one key difference is that Solzhenitsyn seems to be a more talented author (both an advantage and a disadvantage[sometimes personal experiences are better conveyed in more straight forward writing]).Hopefully, readers (who weren't already aware) will realizes the tremendous harm and suffering political communism brought on the world. I get a little tired of the fact a certain dead communist revolutionary is considered \\"cool.\\" Okay, so this book is about the U.S.S.R. and not about Latin America.

One can fault Solzhenitsyn's monarchial views but his courage and stamina cannot be disputed.He has given us a penetrating portrait of another time and another place - somewhere unimaginable to those of us accustomed to freedom. Remarkably, he has enfused it with a humanity that shines brighter than the frozen landscape or the continual cruelty. In the pages of this book (written and secreted out in parts) the inmates lose their anonymity and take on a life of their own as we find ourselves shivering, crying, rejoicing and even laughing with them. Tears in a Hades of Ice.Solzhenitsyn is more than a national treasure, a historian or an author. He is the modern-day reflection of the ancient Jewish prophet, preaching to the unbelievers. The portraits of his beloved Russia reflect the greatness that he feels Russia is not only worth but due. This should be required reading for all high school students."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"This book is a must read for anyone interested in the world's history. This book is the first of three volumes (with the total work being split into 7 parts; Volume one contains parts one and two), the later two were significantly more difficult to obtain in hard copy when I was ordering them about a year ago,The Gulag Archipelago, Volume 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, 1918-1956 [GULAG ARCHIPELAGO V02] andThe Gulag Archipelago, 1918-1956: Volume 3: An Experiment in Literary Investigation [GULAG ARCHIPELAGO 1918-195-V03]. This Volume can be obtained for free (and legitimately I gather) from a link on the wikipedia.com entry for this title.Irrespective though, this is probably one of the most readable books on such a grim matter possible, and largely this is based on the books biggest flaw: stylistically it is written as a conversation, with Solzhenitsyn's voice being as though he is writing as he is remembering and remembering as though he is having a mutter mostly to himself, while at the same heckling the events he's recalling. And although that sounds like a terrible thing, especially considering the length of the volume, it makes it for a great and very engaging read. The downside though is that occasionally he does digress, but it is always relevant and always interesting. I called this a flaw though really it is not: it makes the account feel human and gives it so much greater impact than if it had been written as facts and figures, nevermind that it makes it so much more readable by not being dry.The subject is the Russian forced labor prison camps, and more particularly how people got there, as in what they did wrong / why they could not remain free [part 1] and transportation [part 2]. I had assumed that this title would give more of an insight into the purge's themselves as well as Lenin / Stalin's motivation / goals, but this is not the case. The area of this title is very much personal experience of Solzhenitsyn and the people he met and heard about, and he does not put it into context because it seems unlikely anyone truly could.Although this isn't a scholarly work which lines up cleanly with records, this is not the intention of the work, rather it is to tell the human side of what went on, and it succeeds like few books can. That is not to say that the book is fictional, but rather that given the conditions under which it was written, there was only so much Solzhenitsyn could do, and this should not be held against this work.I could go on, but 1) I could never do it justice, and 2) only one thing matters: This truly is one of the greatest books ever written, and everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"Applebaums recent work 'Gulag' has used much more recent data and 'the Black Book of CUmmunism&quot; is a good resource as a compendium to reading this classic book on the horrors of communism.

Communism enslaved its own people, worse then the Tsar had done, and used them to create a 'socialist paradise'.

If you want to read a true insanity nightmare, this is your book!But the big weakness:Solzhenitsyn throws out the baby (The Russian Revolution, Lenin, and the ideals of true socialism) with the bathwater (Stalinism and reaction to the Revolution). He builds a long, tangential, and overall stilted case for lumping them all in together and pasting on top the label of evil - Evil Communism. If he'd only stuck with writing about his own experiences and those of his fellows, and not been so heavy-handed with the historical background information, this book would have been a knockout. Funnily enough, I think a modern editor could easily tease out this wheat (60% of the book) from the chaff (40%).But in part I let Solzhenitsyn off the hook, because he was a tortured, innocent Soviet prisoner in the 1940s, and clearly has residual bitterness. To use an imperfect analogy, can I understand why a raped woman might hate all men? Yes. But do I agree with her assessment of my gender? No."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"1. This book is an artifact of the cold war, so you can't trust everything what is said in it. Moreover, the author is not a professional scientist, he is simply one of ex-prisoners and a writer. This means, he had no access whatsoever to the facts, and his book is based on his reflections and fantasies.2. If you want to \\"open your eyers\\" and believe that the bad guy Stalin asassinated millions of people without any reason then you should read this book. However, if you want to know the truth or something close to the truth, you should read professional research (e.g. Zemskov) or spend your time with the archives, which are open now.3. There are plenty of lies in this book, indeed. For example, Solzshenitzyn claims that the number of victims is counted in tens of millions. This is certainly not the case (i.e., Gulag has never had more than 2 million people even in the years of s.c. purging; compare this to the number of prisoners per capita in the USA or modern Russia and be ready to get surprised).The total number of those sentenced to death is near 700,000 over 25 years, many of them were murderers or terrorists, and some of the sentences were not executed, while Solzshenitzyn names 15, 43, 60, and even more than 100 million in his various speeches and books. This is certainly nonsense, because it does not fit any demographic data.4. The fact that Solzshenitzyn received a Nobel prize does not mean that he is a good writer (there is political agenda behind his nomination). Only a few of his books are worth reading. Judging by a translated work is not sound anyway.5. Solzshenitzyn is not sincere as well. He is not a \\"freedom fighter\\", the reason why he ended in Gulag is that he was escaping the military service. He knew that political convicts were not send to the front, so he did it. At that time, Russia was facing the Nazi Germany in a few kilometers from Moscow."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"This is a book of the kind of testimonies that pushed the Reagan Revolution into Europe.

Throughout the book, the author whines incessantly about getting a bum rap. He believes that he was wrongfully imprisoned (That's a new one).According to the author, he was imprisoned for criticizing the Soviet government in a letter that he wrote to a friend. But his story is not believable to me. I'm sure there is something that he isn't telling us.He also complains a lot about the unpleasant conditions in prison.Newsflash: Prison isn't supposed to be fun. People who are in prison should do their time and not complain about it.There are three huge volumes in The Gulag Archipelago saga. I only read the first (unabridged) volume.

It is somewhat difficult reading, but it contains so many valuable lessons about life. The book made me think of Buddhism, although it was never mentioned. It is filled with descriptions of the torture the inhabitants of the gulags went through; on looking back on reading these I concluded that it was important to laboriously read and think about all of these painful experiences in order to genuinely feel the insights the author gained. Here is a condensed quote: \\"It was granted to me to carry away from my prison years... how a human being becomes evil and how good... it was only when I lay there on rotting prison straw that I sense within myself the first stirrings of good...And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil... good is retained.

The writing, even in translation and even under the adverse conditions under which it was written, is extraordinary: his tone is informal, even slang, yet compelling -- as if someone was grabbing you by the lapels and shouting at you.

It is absolutely perfect - Solzhenitsyn gives us an experience of history through stories of hundreds and hundreds of affected lives, there is nothing dry about it and of course it's biased but yet the author's raw passion about the subject would disarm anyone. 40 million lives slaughtered and crippled in the period of over 30 years - a fact not known or simply ignored by too many people. I just find it so enraging that 30 years have passed since this book was published and so much is revealed and we can talk about it freely - yet no one cares! Especially in Russia and former Soviet Union - a country whose own people were abused, butchered! A country forever scarred with one of the biggest crimes in human history (with some survivors still alive!) - widespread indifference.Gulag Archipelago is not a simple account of historical facts, it's an exercise questioning the quality of the nation, whose people allowed this, the quality of humanity itself. In a case of such absurd, unimaginable cruelty, where one is denied a right to justice, a right to the very status of a human being, how will you react? Will you rebel or become a slave, \\"kill today to live tomorrow\\" - Who is to blame where hundreds murder millions and the rest remains aware but passive?\\"You are the only one to blame that people are killed! You alone are responsible for my death and you will live with it!

A political prisoner from 1945-1953, the author recounts the hard labor he experienced, plus torture, beatings, and killings that he witnessed. His descriptions how the dangers of unbridled power, government-controlled media, and secret police - specialities of communism and other systems that promise idealism but deliver something very different. Solzhenitsyn was serving in the Red Army when he was arrested for criticizing Stalin's leadership in a private letter home (thus earning a ten-year sentence). Consider his description of a Communist Party dinner during the purges. When a speaker mentioned Stalin's name all rose to applaud, and none dared stop for endless minutes until one brave soul finally sat down - not surprisingly all others immidiately sat down, and that brave soul was arrested within hours. This is a rough book with tales of torture and abuse that seem endless; perhaps that was the author's intent.Solzhenitsyn was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1974, lived in the USA, then returned to his Russia after Soviet Communism collapsed. The author came to criticize the USA for greedy materialism, but of course, nobody arrested him for it. This book is a testament to the dangers of communism and other forms of totalitarian rule."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"Solzhenitsyn's Archipelago was for me, a page-turner that I couldn't (or didn't want to) put down.

It details the terrifying prison system in the Soviet Union and puts the lie to the Leftist academics that praised the alleged \\"worker's paradise\\" in that country. In reality, Soviet communism oppressed its people mightily, arrested them on a whim and kept them confined and working in Siberian temperatures and work conditions. Above its historical importance, Solzhenitsyn's epic shows how the power of the state can so easily terrorize the citizens if not adequately controlled. This powerful book should make all free peoples fall on their knees and thank God that such tyranny was not their fate and then we should strive to make sure of our liberties and thus prevent this from happening to us."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"I thought this was a pretty good book. The abridged version (this one) is just under 500 pages & most of the time it really does feel like the author is just scratching the surface. In those 500 pages I felt like I was missing a lot, but I have no urge to read the 2000 page unabridged version. The book does seem disjointed in parts but the author explains that much of the reason for this is that at no one time was the entire text together in one place. It was spread all over the place because he was afriad of being caught with it all by Soviet authorities.The author was very brave to tell the truth as he knows it & to expose the brutal Gulag system. I thought the best parts of the book were where the author describes the intimate details of someone's escape plans or how they were punished but just when you start to get interested in this one person's story you would turn the page & there was nothing else about it. This happens several times in the book. That gets frustrating at times. Besides that I thought it was a great work on a chapter of history that very little was known about before Solzhenitsyn wrote his book.The book was put together from Solzhenitsyn's personal experiences & over 200 fellow prisioners. In my personal opinion I would enjoy reading a 500 page book about any one of the 200+ people who contributed to the book than one little paragraph (or page) from each of the 200+ people - that is just the type of book I enjoy reading more. As a description of history the book does it well.On another note, in response to the \\"1 star\\" review below by \\"BANE\\" from Dec 7,2005 he claims the numbers killed in the Gulag were more like 750,000 people & tries to discredit Solzhenitsyn's claims of millions. From the January 2006 National Geographic issue it has a section on Genocide in the 20th century. It puts the numbers murdered in the Soviet Union between 1918 - 1953 at 20,000,000 people (most under Stalin's regime). The source for National Geographic's data was Barbara Harff, Strassler family center for holocaust & genocide studies, Clark University.

I think it is essential reading for people of all cultures. It is blunt, brutally honest, eye-opening, non-apologetic and confronting. It educates and enlightens the reader. The author gives a voice to many who had been silenced either by death, torture or fear of both. In exposing a leader, a system and a regime, he also exposes humanity everywhere. In his description of what occurred, he is putting the spotlight on the inhumanity and cruelty that humans are capable of inflicting on each other, and have done again, since the collapse of the Soviet system. Whilst the setting is Soviet Russia, history shows that people elsewhere, and in other styles of regimes have been just as cruel and life-destroying, in their own, or in similar ways. Despite the despair, the anger, the tragedy of it all, the author also shows that there is hope, survival, and a light at the end of the tunnel. The human spirit is capable of overcoming seemingly impossible hurdles. Despite being exiled for the book, and believing that he would never see it in print in his lifetime, he returned to Russia."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"This book is a courageous act of witnessing. It is one of the outstanding works of twentieth century writing. It is a description in tremendous detail of a world which did everything to keep itself being described. The writing of it was the heroic act done at risk to his own life of a former inmate of the Gulag who told the truth of Stalin's nightmare world and portrayed the suffering of millions. This ' breaking of silence' had historical as well as literary significance and may have been a key element in the fall of the Soviet Empire.There is a point where Solzhenitsyn apprehended by the KGB and taken to the Gulag asks himself why he did not scream out. He says that he wanted to scream not so that one or two would hear. But that he wanted to scream for the millions so the millions would hear.In this tremendously moving work he does this."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"hello,i am just 18 years old and this book have change my life.

The Gulag Archipelago is a disturbing account of what happened inside the Gulag prisons. This is an account about the things hidden from the public and the things the Marxists wanted to keep hidden. And how he gave a first person account of prison life, well that was just amazing! His vivid descriptions about the kinds of arrests that took place I thought was very interesting and an amazing brainchild of a distorted Soviet Union!How Stalin could turn an innocent gesture of two long lost friends being reunited into an arrest is beyond me. The Gulag Archipelago is an excellent book that unveiled an entirely new side of the Soviet Union and its perverted system of justice. It's a great book for historians and World War II buffs, or even if you are trying to find out more about the Soviet Union. The Gulag Archipelago is quite possibly one of the best books I've ever read! I would recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in the Soviet Union.

It is an amazing story that any human being has experienced this and lived, and smiled. I find it incredible that Solzhenitsyn still loved his Russia despite his imprisonment. This is an excellent book, difficult to read at times, but well worth the effort. It should be on the required reading list for every high school-aged child.

Solzhenitsyn says that they amounted to only about 10% and, in any case, had helped create the system that ended up ensnaring them too.It is not a personal account of his years in the Gulag although he writes about it in passing but about what happened to the millions of prisoners whose lives were ruined - and in many cases ended - by the Communist system.He compares the incessant cruelty of the Communist regime with the milder form of Tsarist brutality. Russian soldiers captured by the Nazis were regarded as traitors and imprisoned and executed under Communism yet those captured during the Napoleonic Wars when serfdom existed were not.He also writes scathingly about the security forces and interrogators who made a good living torturing their fellow citizens and felt no remorse. He is particularly angry at the soft treatment they were given compared with what happened in Germany after the war when thousands of Nazis were persecuted.The style is low key, bitter, sarcastic and marked by the kind of black humor Russians and Eastern European revel. For example, there is a scene in which a district meeting of the Communist Party turns into a farce as a mention of Stalin leads to a standing ovation that threatened to go on forever as none of the Communists present was foolish enough to be the first to stop applauding.Finally, one of the members of the platform sat down after 11 minutes of clapping and cheering and the meeting resumed. That night he was arrested and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment with the advice: \\"Don't ever be the first to stop applauding!\\"All this must sound like ancient history today and The Gulag Archipelago is not an easy read - this is an abridgement of the trilogy - but it is a work that shows how a writer with a bee in his bonnet has infinitely more power than an academic historian.*I don't read Russian so cannot comment but I checked and found that this translation was authorized by Solzhenitsyn himself."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"This review refers only to Volume 3 (Sections 5 thru 7)This amazing volume chronicles Solzhenitsyn's years in a Siberian labor camp for political prisoners and later in exile, a limbo status, where the state's support of physical needs is withdrawn, but the prisoner's reentry into mainstream society isn't allowed because of his status as a former prisoner. The final section takes place after Stalin's death in 1953, when both those in power and in prison were trying to figure how what to do in the absence of the mastermind of the Soviet Union's system of internal terror.Soltzhenitsyn describes with alternating wit, pain, sarcasm, challenge the life of a zek (this story is also presented in his much shorter \\"A Day in The Life of Ivan Denisovich\\", which in the years after the death of Joseph Stalin was actually accepted by the Soviet government for awhile). For awhile common criminals were mixed with politicals - their sentences were generally shorter than the \\"quarters\\" (25 years) given to the politicals, and they were useful to prison management as stoolies.Often soldiers recently released from German prison camps were imprisoned for political offenses. After his release from political prison, Solzhenitsyn surreptitiously collected information from other former prisoners about conditions in other camps and about ethnic cleansing programs around the Soviet Union. Their tales are harrowing. Detainees in one camp actually managed to take it over from its local management, who showed sympathy to their plight. Upper level Soviet officials visited the camp for \\"negotiations\\", after which they \\"agreed\\" to meet all demands. You can guess what happened next.The Soviet Union may have lost 20 million citizens in combat, but Stalin's program of political terror must have killed at least as many more.Of any man who lived, Solzhenitsyn probably did the most to expose the brutal nature of the Soviet regime, particularly that of Joseph Stalin, who in the rest of the world enjoyed status as Papa Joe, leader of part of the Allied forces that defeated Nazi Germany. His efforts to publish the Gulag Archipelago were always in jeopardy. As such he never had the entire manuscript in one place, making of the great political documents of the 20th century that much more remarkable.Despite its length (Volume 3 alone runs to about 600 pages in hardback) and grim subject matter, I found Gulag Archipelago relatively readable. Solzhenistyn's personal style - much is written like he was telling you the stories face to face. Five stars for all readers, if only to highlight the dangers of a totalitarian government that spies and imprisons its citizens for their political and religious beliefs in name of ideology."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"Often when one reads about an outrage of history the account is dry, numerical, and one sided. What is truly unique about Gulag is that it takes us inside the the minds of the victims and the perpetrators, revealing the central yet unspoken theme of the book. This is a story of human nature, revealed in the most extreme circumstances imaginable. As you read ask yourself, \\"What would I have done?\\" The answers may horrify you.On the political side of things Gulag reveals that the Soviet system elucidated the evil in people. Gulag is a call for us to see politics in a different way. Beware of those advancing class envy/warfare. The Soviets adjusted their definition of \\"rich\\" down as the people became poorer. The freedom possessed does not seem near as valuable as freedom lost.Gulag demonstrates that faith is the only useful possession that can not be taken. Gulag cites many examples of superhuman courage, toughness, and triumph by those of deep religious devotion.

Given the inherent limitations of this superb albeit shocking fictional work, still the author writes with stunning clarity and unimpeachable style about the many horrors for the Soviet everyman caught in the unbelievable grips of this brutal nightmare world.The work is both massive and comprehensive, dealing not only with the ways in which the Gulag came into existence and then thrived under the active sponsorship of Lenin and Stalin, but also with a plethora of aspects of life within the Gulag, ranging from its laws, customs, folklore, and morality on the one hand to its slang, sexual mores, and cuisine on the other. He lovingly and yet unsparingly looks at the prisoners themselves, caught up in an insane world, and how they attempted to cope and survive, to interact with each other, and what the relationships between the prisoners and the many sorts of guards and jailers that kept them imprisoned were like.What forced the Gulag into becoming a more or less permanent fixture within the Soviet system was its value economically in producing goods and services that were marketable both within the larger Soviet economy as well as in international trade. As it does in China today, forced labor within the Gulag for the Soviets represented a key element in expanding markets for Soviet-made goods ranging from lamps to those prototypically Russian fur hats.The Gulag came into being as a result of the Communist elite's burning desire for purges of remaining vestiges of bourgeoisie aspects of Soviet culture, and its consequent need for some deep dark hole to stick unlucky cultural offenders into to remove them semi-permanently from the forefront of the Soviet society. Stalin found it useful to expand the uses of the camp system to enhance industrial growth, and the camps became flooded with millions of Soviets found wanting in terms of their ultimate suitability for everyday life in the workers' paradise.Thus, the Gulag flourished throughout the 1920s and 1930s and even through the years of WWII, when slave labor provided an invaluable aid in producing enough war goods to help defeat the Axis powers. By the peak years of Gulag culture in the 1950s, the archipelago stretched into all twelve of the U.S. S. R.'s time zones, although it was largely concentrated in the northernmost and least livable aspects of the country's vast geographical areas.One of the most interesting and certainly more controversial aspects of the book can be found in its expose of the existence of the Gulag itself by detailing the ways in which it was operating, albeit it fictionally. Yet both the existence and horrors associated with the Gulag have been greeted with something short of horror by the West. Compared to the much more extensively and discussed Holocaust of Europe's Jewish population perpetrated by the Nazi Third Reich over a twelve year period, until the publication of this masterful work almost nothing was known or published about the nearly seventy reign of the Gulag.Given the recent demise of the Soviet state, and the dawning availability of data revealing the particulars of the existence of the Soviet system of political imprisonment, forced labor camps, and summary executions, one expects this massively documented, exhaustively detailed, and memorably written work of fiction will remain the standard in understanding the moving and horrible experience the Gulag posed for ordinary Russians. This is a terrific book, and although it is a work of fiction, it is one I can heartily recommend to any serious student of 20th century history. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"I can think of no other book, fiction or nonfiction, that has so captured the evil we faced from the Soviet Union. Orwell accomplished much with 1984 and Animal Farm, but here we have something much more valuable: genuine life experience. Solzhenitsyn doesn't just pen an autobiography with the Gulag Archipelago. He recounts, examines, and criticizes the entire Communist/Socialist/Marxist worldview, and the reality that came from the theory. The last century cannot be properly understood without reading this book. It is my belief that socialism will rise again - not in our lifetimes, but somewhere down the road when intellectuals agree that \\"Well, mistakes were made, but we're so much more advanced now.\\" The movement will return under another name. This book is the cure.There are so many anecdotes, statistics, personal experiences, and cited resources in the Gulag Archipelago that a single review cannot hope to capture the breadth of this work. The saying is correct: great atrocities have been committed in the name of social justice. So it was with the Marxist worldview. The Soviet Union once shot 40,000 of its own citizens in a month of peacetime for 'counter-revolutionary' actions. They would herd thousands onto aging, floating barges and tow it out to the middle of the ocean, where they would sink the barge to kill the people. Some (Western intellectuals, mainly), try to forget this sort of thing happened, but Solzhenitsyn shows this was a logical progression of Marxist and socialistic philosophies. The entire worldview is wrong and malignant, and history has shown it to the dustbin for now. What remains are the fumes of Marxism. One example is political correctness, which is Soviet propaganda writ small. The intention of PC is not to persuade, but to humiliate dissenters into silence. It's a brilliant ploy, really, because by keeping your mouth shut and going along, everyone becomes 'just a little guilty'.Anyway, the Gulag Archipelago should be buried in every time capsule, recommended to friends, and airlifted to every university in this country. The reason? I'll let Solzhenitsyn explain. \\"Everyone knew, of course, that arrests were being made every day and every hour, but no one was to be horrified by the sight of large numbers of [prisoners] together. In Orel in 1938, you could hardly hide the fact that there was no home in the city where there hadn't been arrests, and weeping women in their peasant carts blocked the square in front of the Orel Prison just as in Surikov's painting The Execution of Streltsy. (Oh, who one day will paint this latter-day tragedy for us? But no one will. It's not fashionable, not fashionable...)\\""},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"Gulag provided for me a powerful and shocking history lesson I had never been taught in high school or college. So much has been taught on Hitler, but barely anything of substance on Soviet Communism. After reading this book, you'll understand the reasons for the so-called paranoia of McCarthyism. Ronald Reagan had it right when he called the Soviet Union an &quot;evil empire.&quot; I found this book so compelling, though heart wrenching, that I went on to read &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot; as well as a recent biography on Solzhenitsyn by D.

It is somewhat difficult reading, but it contains so many valuable lessons about life. The book made me think of Buddhism, although it was never mentioned. It is filled with descriptions of the torture the inhabitants of the gulags went through; on looking back on reading these I concluded that it was important to laboriously read and think about all of these painful experiences in order to genuinely feel the insights the author gained. Here is a condensed quote: \\"It was granted to me to carry away from my prison years... how a human being becomes evil and how good... it was only when I lay there on rotting prison straw that I sense within myself the first stirrings of good...And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil... good is retained.

Solzhenitsyn gives voice to the millions of voiceless victims of Stalin's Soviet Russia. Unfortunately this is one of histories lesser known crimes, and the power of this man's voice helps to rectify this. This book is powerful and brutal. Solzhenitsyn forces his readers to stare into the face of evil and see the horrors that can happen when tyrants are allowed to run roughshod over a people.This book is so tremendously important as a warning for all people to take care that tyranny does not get the opportunity to capture a people. It illustrates the inhumanity that man is capable of, and he shows readers the terrible price that dictators impose.This book needs to be required reading because it has the affect of so eloquently exposing readers to the reality that people all over the world face. This is why this book is so powerful. It is the universal nature of this work that shows the reader what happens to people in this situation. This book forces the reader to be empathetic to the plight of suffering people the world over. What this work shows is that this type of oppression becomes so pervasive that it is almost impossible to overcome. The people don't want this nor do they simply acquiesce to this tyranny. What happens is that a society becomes totally corrupted to the point where there is nothing left.This is an extremely important work that needs to be read."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"I cannot stop admiring the courage of the author and his belief in art as the most powerful and necessary form of preserving memory of history and humanity.

A very gifted writer. This is the story of his journey.After I read books I don't have space to keep them all so I give a lot of them away.However I have hard cover issues of the Gulag Archipelago books as well as my all time favorite 'The First Circle'.

It's so huge, so sprawling, so detailed that on a certain level it must be taken in generally, just as an impressionist painting must be viewed from a distance rather than each paint stroke. Here's my own impression, filtered, of course, through my own political and moral prism.You read about the massive Gulag system and the first thing you think of is \\"Wow. Practically any crime can be gotten away with if it's done in the name of the people.\\" But it's so much more than that. It's not just hoodwinking, propagandizing or frightening the populace into allowing a system of political prisoner camps 20 million strong to exist for decades. Stalin could never have done what he did without the tacit consent and approval of the Russian people. I don't believe they were too cowed or ignorant, just like I don't believe the Germans were too cowed or ignorant to know what Hitler was doing during WW II.And the same mindset that produced the Gulag continues to the present day. Humanity hasn't changed. Stalin's murderous reign of terror is now purposely overlooked* or even celebrated throughout the world. This is a testament to the inner sickness extant in every human being, not just those who lead or carry out the evil themselves. People like Stalin would never have been able to get away with what they did if it weren't for that secret, sometimes unconscious desire for death and destruction of others and of oneself that exists in the human soul, the \\"death instinct\\" referred to by Freud and present in many people and groups, from Palestinian suicide bombers to American university professors.* Have you ever seen an anti-Stalin Hollywood-produced movie?"},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago, VOLUME 2: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Section III-IV (Part 1 of 2 part Cassette Library Edition)","review":"Up to 60 million people died as a result of the Soviet prison system.

The author was serving in the Red Army during World War II when the secret police (NKVD) arrested him for daring to criticize Soviet dictator Stalin in a private letter. Solzhenitsyn got eight years in Siberia, where inmates enjoyed forced confessions, mistreatment, beatings, and worse. The author describes labor camp conditions, political propaganda, and the struggle to survive. The author also examines the Soviet political system with anecdotes like one about a party gathering when none dared be first to stop applauding after Stalin's name was mentioned - naturally, the first that finally stopped clapping was arrested the next day. This book reminds us of the blessings of freedom, the dangers of police states (including right-wing ones), and the reality that communist governments exist via an odious combination of secret police, controlled media, and the outlawing of political opposition.This book has a powerful message but is stiff and repetitious - as if the author wished to pay tribute to every victim he encountered. Solzhenitsyn won the Nobel prize in 1970, lived in the USA from 1974-1994, and he returned to Russia after the fall of communism a critic of Western pop culture - but appreciating its free speech. Sadly, too many people that condemn communist oppression are blind to oppression from the right - and vice versa."},{"Title":"Introducing Speech and Language Processing (Cambridge Introductions to Language and Linguistics)","review":"I've been using this as the textbook in my speech technology course at SJSU, with generally good results.The book assumes that the reader is aquainted with basic acoustic and linguistic concepts such as glottal excitation, frequency spectra, fundamental frequency, and IPA transcription. The book is therefore not suitable on its own for a class of true beginners. For such an audience, instructors will want to supplement Coleman's book with a gentler introductory book such as Ladefoged (1996) or Johnson (2003).By far the best feature of this book is its focus on concrete implementation, in source code, of the concepts discussed. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a working C program is worth a thousand more. Coleman deserves our thanks for including actual speech processing code with his textbook.The focus on explicit source code is one of a number of features that differentiate Coleman's textbook from the Jurafsky & Martin textbook that I use in other courses. Coleman's book is slimmer and less ambitious in its coverage of topics compared with Jurafsky & Martin's massive tome. Coleman's textbook also contains far fewer typos and other errors.On the other hand, some parts of Coleman's book are frustratingly brief, incomplete, or opaque. An example is Section 4.2 on spectral analysis. The mechanics of the Hanning window are introduced, but without motivation---we never learn what the window is for, or why we need it. The results of the Fourier transform are displayed but no hint is offered as to how it works. Overall this section compares quite unfavorably to the masterful presentation of Fourier analysis in Chapter 10 of Ladefoged (1996).Finally, it is important to note that there is a simple bug that infects most of the C programs supplied with the book. The variable \\"length\\", used to store the size of an input file, is declared as type \\"(int *)\\". This should be changed to type \\"int\\", so that memory is allocated to store the input size. Consequently, subsequent references to \\"*length\\" should be changed to \\"length\\", and \\"length\\" to \\"&length;\\". Once this bug is fixed, the code compiles fine on any platform, not just on the compiler supplied with the book."},{"Title":"Introducing Speech and Language Processing (Cambridge Introductions to Language and Linguistics)","review":"John Coleman is an expert in his field, and he has produced the only introduction to this area for beginners.

I used to do this when I was younger when I wrote letters to my grandmother. She always told me that my mind was working faster than my writing.

Pure romance and nothing too spicy.It is the story of Abbie Donegan an heiress who is responsible for various step siblings. (daddy was a tom cat) Abbie is independent and a bit of a tomboy. She needs to marry to regain control of the family home and business. She sets her sights on Rio a cowboy of Indian descent who is in danger of his ranch being taken from him. They marry, but Abbie doesn't tell him the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Rio always seems to be one step behind Abbie's machinations.Abbie was a fiesty heroine, who while well intentioned got herself into one scrape after another. Rio was always a step behind her having to rescue her from her folly. The bad guys were over the top in skullduggery.I haven't read this author's work before, I thought the heroine was a little lacking in character and a bit over the top in some of the things she did, but the hero caertainly made up for it.If you like a feel good, western romance with a sexy hero and a fiesty heroine then you may well enjoy this ebook."},{"Title":"About Life and Uganda","review":"Fred has written a very good little book about the experiences of a short term missionary in Uganda.

It also shared many principles of life and faith that are helpful in my daily walk with the Lord."},{"Title":"About Life and Uganda","review":"Having visited Uganda a number of times in the past 10 years, I highly recommend reading \\"About Life and Uganda\\" by Fred Lybrand. If you're looking for a tourist guide that enumerates the sites to see, skip this book. But if you'd like insight into the beautiful people in the many villages of the Pearl of Africa (Uganda), how they live their daily lives and how they are just like people all around the world, you'll cherish this book. It taught me much about the people of Uganda, but even more about life. The jewels within it shine far beyond the boundaries of this amazing East African country.To conclude that the author knows nothing about Uganda is to stand firmly on the side of ignorance and error. We have even used the book as a shared resource with our Ugandan translators on our mission trips. It resonates with African and American hearts alike."},{"Title":"About Life and Uganda","review":"While reading \\"About Life and Uganda\\" I felt as if I were there again, taking in the sights, sounds, and smells.

The book is not only about the country and the people, but about practical as well as deep spiritual lessons learned. The book is absolutely inspiring."},{"Title":"About Life and Uganda","review":"This book wonderfully explains what it's like to be a short term missionary in Uganda. Reading it reminded me of all the \\"Oh, yeah!\\" and \\"Aha!\\" moments I've had while helping to plant churches there over the past 10 years, and during my journey these 20+ years with the Lord. As I'm preparing to return again soon, it was great to reread it and be reminded of one of Mr. Lybrand's points: Limits Yield Intensity. I highly recommend this little book to anyone considering a short term missions opportunity to Uganda or elsewhere, and who is interested in having their thinking stretched."},{"Title":"About Life and Uganda","review":"Great book to read in preparation for a mission trip to Uganda.

In this novel, against a background of violence and fear. When I first read 'Fair Stood The Wind For France' as a schoolboy, I was attracted by the story of the heroic RAF bomber pilot shot down behind enemy lines in France, and his efforts to escape back to England. As I read it I realised that war was not heroic and glamorous, but filled with fear and disfigurement. Hardly an unique epiphany to be sure! But what brought it home to my fifteen year-old mind was Bates' simple illustration of his hero contemplating his inability ever again to open a bottle of wine and pour a glass. A banal task whose infinitesimal pleasure is usually lost against the noise of our lives. Bates brings home the happiness we can glean from the everyday, through his ability to conjure beauty from the mundane. Read this book for the beauty that Bates can evoke.

However, I was never quite blown away by the stories. I think I was expecting too much.According to the introduction, Moore was one of the first (or the first) to write sci-fi from a more emotional perspective. \\"Her early stories were notable for their emphasis on the senses and emotions, which was highly unusual at the time.\\" -Wikipedia Also she is lauded for her very alien aliens and her use of romance.While I appreciate the stories for how groundbreaking they were, I must admit I was not that impressed by what they are. I've read too much that took her work as inspiration and spun off into further realms. I find these stories good, even very good, just not amazing. And I was really hoping for amazing.The first two stories star her space outlaw, Northwest Smith. Each story is solid, creepy, well plotted, but the themes are so similar that I think they suffer by juxtaposition.There are a selection of other sci-fi stories on various subjects: potential futures, time travelers of multiple stripes, cyborgs, alien worlds, and more. There's an odd spin on the Lillith story, and my favorite story was \\"Daemon\\", a unconventional fantasy piece about the nature of souls.I don't fault Moore that I am born too late to fully appreciate much of this volume. I am thankful that I have read so many great books inspired by her work. Nowadays almost all work integrates the emotional into the SF, but I suppose it didn't have to be that way.

The scripts also cover over a half-century of films, from 1940's &quot;The Great McGinty&quot; by Preston Sturges to 1992's &quot;Unforgiven&quot; by David Webb Peoples. You also have two very different scripts co-written by Billy Wilder with &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (with Charles Brackett &amp; D. M. Marshman, Jr.) and the film noir classic &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (with Raymond Chandler). As collections of script go, this one is pretty hard to top. The scripts are presented in two columns to a page rather than in proper &quot;script&quot; form, so it is more like reading a newspaper than anything else. If you are interested in learning from the masters, teaching a class in playwriting or film studies, or simply love several of the films included herein, this collection will be of value to you.

I then lost or gave away the book to someone, and forgot about it. But then years later as a researcher, I had to look up some information, and browsed through many electronics books out there, without ever finding a satisfactory reference which would teach me what I'd forgotten after so many years. I bought a new copy recently and reread Fortney, and I am blown away at how good this book is. It makes full use of the complex phasor notation, digs into all kinds of circuits with op amps, BJTs, FETs, and various digital circuits, and presents a detailed analysis with all the equations required for a thorough understanding. For almost each \\"transfer function\\" of a given circuit, he plots the frequency response so you know exactly what the circuit is supposed to be doing. Excellent for learning, or relearning electronics. This book is written for physicists, however, it presents all of the basic engineering concepts you'd need. Engineers may prefer a more comprehensive book such as the encyclopedia of electronics, as it contains more tables, and practical information about commercially-available devices. However, for physicists who want to build basic circuits for lab experiments, this book is the best out there."},{"Title":"Principles of Electronics: Analog and Digital","review":"I used Fortney to learn electronics as a Medical Physics undergrad, and it was an invaluable tool in grad school and industry beyond that. Couple it with a copy of \\"The Art of Electronics\\" and the Lab Manual for \\"The Art of Electronics\\" and you have everything you ever wanted to know about electronics and then some. (and it's excellent for self study and hobbyists as well!)"},{"Title":"Principles of Electronics: Analog and Digital","review":"I find this book to be by far the best for actually getting an intuitive grasp of analog circuits. In particular, the explanation and discussion (and subsequent use) of transfer functions and the frequency domain is excellent. If you just want to solve problems and get good grades or whatnot, then you should probably look elsewhere, but if you want to set yourself up for being able to think about circuits and design then I think this is the only book. I highly recommend it to everyone interested."},{"Title":"Managing Six Sigma: A Practical Guide to Understanding, Assessing, and Implementing the Strategy That Yields Bottom-Line Success","review":"Since I am on the Six Sigma deployment team for my company, I have done a lot of reading on Six Sigma in the last two months. Mr. Breyfogle, as a companion to his book Implementing Six Sigma has really created a useful consultive book that fills in the blanks for planning and deploying a six sigma program. He even shares &quot;how to's&quot; in the areas such as project selection and team chartering.It is concise and clear. I recommend it to anyone who is thinking about or preparing to deploy Six Sigma in their organization."},{"Title":"Managing Six Sigma: A Practical Guide to Understanding, Assessing, and Implementing the Strategy That Yields Bottom-Line Success","review":"Breyfogle and his co-authors explain that this book was written in response to numerous requests for a book which would \\"help management decide if they should implement Six Sigma\\" and then \\"guide them through the process.\\" In Breyfogle's previously published Implementing Six Sigma, he introduced Smarter Six Sigma Solutions (or S4). Were I to provide a copy of that book to the CEOs with whom I work, few (if any) would read it. Perhaps a few would pass it along for someone else to read. After that, who knows? (Many of the CEOs I know confuse dumping with delegating.) It is not damning with faint praise to suggest that this is an excellent book but one which has a much narrower focus and provides much less content than does its predecessor.\\"The purpose of this book is to build awareness of the wise application of Six Sigma tools and how they can be important to the \`big picture.'\\" The authors achieve that purpose. The material is carefully organized within four Parts: Why Six Sigma (How Six Sigma Compares to Other Quality Initiatives, Six Sigma Background and Fundamentals, and Six Sigma Needs Assessment); Six Sigma Metrics (Numbers and Information, Crafting insightful Metrics, and Performance Measurement); Six Sigma Business Strategy (deployment Alternatives, Creating a Successful Six Sigma Infrastructure, Training and Implementation, and finally, Project Selection, Sizing, and Other Techniques; and Applying Six Sigma (manufacturing Applications, Service/Transactional Applications, Development Applications, and finally, Need for Creativity, Invention, and Innovation). The Glossary and References sections follow and are first-rate.Because I am a non-technician, I found the concepts and applications discussed in this book easier to grasp than those explained in its predecessor, Implementing Six Sigma. My guess (only a guess) is that the same would be true of senior-level executives who are also non-technicians. The authors quite carefully help their reader to understand how Six Sigma differs from other quality initiatives while correctly noting that Six Sigma should not replace other initiatives. Rather, it is and should be perceived as \\"a tactical methodology to determine the best approach to a given situation/process.\\" In Chapter 1, they go on to observe that the success of Six Sigma \\"is linked to qa set of cross-functional metrics that lead to significant improvements in customer satisfaction and bottom-line benefits. Organizations do not necessarily need to use all of the measurements listed (often within typical Six Sigma programs). It is most important to choose the best set of services for a situation metrics that yield insight into a situation or process.\\" I provide these brief excerpts to indicate the precision and clarity of the authors' writing style as well as to attract attention to several key points they emphasize.One of the book's greatest value-added benefits is provided from a series of Tables. They range from \\"The Ten Myths of Six Sigma\\" (Table 1.1) and \\"Deming's Fourteen Points\\" (Table 1.2) through \\"The 21-Set Integration of the Tools\\" (Table 1.5) and \\"Six Sigma Needs Checklist\\" (Table 3.2) to \\"Personality Traits of Creative Individuals\\" identified by Sternberg and Lubart (Table 14.3). The authors end their book as follows: \\"As global competition increases and the rate of technological change accelerates, there will be tremendous social turmoil; as the uneducated and unprepared secede from the expanding economy. Those with the capability and desire to keep pace with radical change will find virtually limitless opportunity, growth, and prosperity.\\" Frankly, I was surprised when reading these concluding remarks because, at so many points throughout the book's narrative, the authors seem almost wholly preoccupied with explaining strategies which leverage various technologies to maximize ROI. Then I reviewed what I had read and what I had learned, realizing that even a system as cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective as S4 is certain to fail without sufficient \\"human capital.\\" That is, those to whom the authors refer. People who are advocates, indeed evangelists.Heaven knows, the authors of this book are highly analytical but they are also passionate about the difference they can help to make in organizations which need \\"a practical guide to understanding, assessing, and implementing the strategy that yields bottom-line success.\\" I commend them on what they achieve in this book...also, and of greater importance, on what their book can help others to achieve."},{"Title":"Managing Six Sigma: A Practical Guide to Understanding, Assessing, and Implementing the Strategy That Yields Bottom-Line Success","review":"This book is primarily a marketing book for the author's first book. In every chapter, critical items are refered back to the author's first work. If you've read that book, you'll find this one interesting in regard to deployment.

I know I do."},{"Title":"Managing Six Sigma: A Practical Guide to Understanding, Assessing, and Implementing the Strategy That Yields Bottom-Line Success","review":"If you plan to &quot;do&quot; with 6 sigma, this book is probably not for you. Until now, I bought any John Wiley &amp; Son, Publishers book on the premise that they always published quality....this book will make me more wary of what they intend the book to achieve (sales of more books or education of the reader). The books title leads one to expect it to be about managing 6 sigma and it may come closest to that objective, to use it's term, from 30,000 feet. Otherwise, it is mainly a marketing piece for a prior book by Breyfogle (Implementing Six Sigma). Dozens of times and sometimes two or 3 times on the same page the reader is treated to this: &quot;EWMA techniques can be combined with engineering process control(EPC)to give insight into when a process should be adjusted. The mechanics of conducting an EWMA and EPC are described in Chapter 36 of Breyfogle (1999) Implementing Six Sigma.&quot;The glossary and list of symbols are inadequate. The problem with the glossary is murkey unclear definitions.Finally, the book is redundant with regards to listing repeatedly the &quot;21 steps&quot; it suggests to implement Six Sigma projects.

This book touts itself as an executive guide to learning about 6 Sigma, compares itself to other quality initiatives like TQM and Demming, points out the differences and does so in executive speak. It does also make a statement that it will refer to the Implementing book so it makes no bones about that up front.When you need more information, it points you to the section in the 1200+ page Implementing guide for the details. This book, however, gives you what you need to make an informed decision of whether 6 sigma may help you and your company out. I use it as a quick reference for the larger volume and quick hits. Besides, it fits in your briefcase and you can carry it on the plane instead of the Implementing book that is way too bulky to carry around with you.

Until now, I had to give them a list of books that would come close if they read them all. This is THE one. This book clearly establishes it's objectives and nails them. This book is also useful to companies that have already deployed Six Sigma.

Two of the wing nuts went on fine, but two wouldn't twist on. I tried supporting the screw with a screwdriver while I turned the nut, thinking it might help get past its stuck point and then make it easier to twist on. I was pretty surprised when the entire nut just broke in half. It was from my hand pressure alone... it's not even like I was gripping it with any big, crazy tools. I tried putting on the second nut and it cracked and split, nearly to the point of falling off, and without even being fully twisted onto the screw yet.If I want to give this to my daughter, I'll need to go to the hardware store and buy new screws and nuts first. It kind of defeats the purpose of ordering one, however. If I had wanted to go to the hardware store, I would have gone there in the first place and made it myself.While I give the press points for being a cute, mini size that's handy for small children, the manufacture of this press is simply not passable and I'd worry that someone else might have the same problem.

This is sort of the Romeo and Juliet of ancient Briton.I know the story mainly from the books by R. Miles - but Nancy McKenzie has a style of writing that is second-to-none. She spins a new twist on the story and ties it beautifully to her earilier book \\"Grail Prince\\". I couldn't put this down - the descriptions of their feelings for each other - their love - their desperation - their heart-wrenching separations and breath-taking reunions...McKenzie takes you there. You feel it with them and if you've ever been in love you feel it with every beautifully woven detail of the story. McKenzie continues to craft masterful works centered around the Arthurian legends and this one certainly did not disappoint!"},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams: A Tale of Tristan and Essylte","review":"I don't know why, but I tend to get stuck on some stories and search for every book written about them. I obsess over Elizabeth I's relationship with Robert Dudley, faithfully search out tales about and of Sharazard, and lately, I want to know everything about Tristan and Isolde. That's why I picked this book.This is the story of doomed young love. Tristan, a young knight whose birthright to the high throne of Britain was taken by his Uncle (with his help actually, he gave it up) is sent by the same Uncle (Mark) to fetch his bride from Wales. She is fifteen and will marry over forty Mark. Her name is Esselte.Of course-you know the story. This is a pretty good re-telling of it but for a few details-the poisoned sword wound that Tristan received is just stupidly healed and treated. Tristan has a gay Uncle (nothing wrong with that) who lends nothing to the story but pops up now and then. Esselte's mother is absurd in her hatred of Esselte and Branwen's actions-she delivered the love potion to our lovers and then agrees to sleep with Mark secretly in Esselte's place-are confusing.This book has also fallen to a classic mistake that comes with retelling this story. Mark of Cornwall is stupid, mean and downright evil at times. This is supposed to be a triangle of love, respect and duty between a devoted nephew, a wife doing her duty and a king. Instead Tristan constantly bemoans that he cannot save Esselte from the evil Mark. Clearly he could have at any time. His excuse of it taking down the British alliance is stupid-Mark's own actions in this book cause that.In short the romance in this book is far better than in the other version I read recently, the White Raven by Diana L. Paxton, who focused solely on Branwen's tale. But it's still not very romantic. This book is also far better than Rosalind Miles series-which I'm sorry but was so boring I almost died.I have to say that the recent movie did a far better job of making three likable characters for the triangle, and the dialog was perfect-not too sappy romantic stuff-but real words from people in a horribly desperate situation.On its own this book gets 3.5 stars, but I'm still looking for a novel retelling of this story I can love.

The fates are against these two lovers from the beginning but they try to make a valiant showing throughout the book. Essylte's maidservant, Branwen, is not what she seems and she brings about many of the circumstances Essylte and Tristan endure. King Markion, who is now high king of Britain is Tristan's uncle and wishes to wed the Welsh Princess to bring unity to Britain. Unfortunately, his scope is very limited and Tristan and many others only support him because there is no one better to do so. Except for Tristan, of course, however, he does not desire the high kingship, only Essylte, someone he is never destined to have.It is a wild ride with much intrigue and many interesting twists that will keep the reader enthralled from beginning to end. I highly recommend this novel to anyone interested in &quot;The Matter of Britain.&quot;"},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams: A Tale of Tristan and Essylte","review":"From his youth, Tristan of Lyonese seems destined to love who he can not have. First, he gives his heart to lady Esmeree, a beautiful and abused woman who nurses him back to health after a terrible wound nearly kills the young knight. He longs to free her from the husband who beats her, but can not. The rules of the ancient Celtic world are strict, especially for kings.After Camelot fell, King Markion, Tristan's uncle became High King, but had no heir from his queen. Hoping for a son, he is advised to remarry, and sends Tristan to fetch Esslyte, a Welsh princess, as his bride. In one move, he will forge a peace treaty and a dynasty. The union is not without opposition, and Tristan is forced to dual for the right to take the girl to England. Though he wins, he is injured, and given into the Essylte's care. The two fall in love, though she is promised to another. With the help of her half sister Branwen, they are able to share a unique love, but it is under the shadow of a curse.**** Tragic romance has always won readers' hearts. Tristan is almost too noble to be true. Of all the women in his life, Esmeree is the most like himself. At times, Esselyte seems whiny and unworthy of his love, and Branwen a schemer. Despite this, the story is bittersweet and pleasing. ****Amanda Killgore"},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams: A Tale of Tristan and Essylte","review":"I have finished Prince of Dreams and had to go back and read it again. My favorite King Arthur story is of Tristan and Essyite (a.k.a. Isoldie among other names) I love how the author breathes new life into this tale as well as seamlessly blending it into her other two books at the same time. A feet not easily done. The character she seem to go more in depth and fleshes out the story for a modern day audience to really get a feel for the characters. I know people who would read her books would be more likely to go a read the other King Arthur series after reading this book as well as her others High Queen of Camelot and The Grail Prince."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams: A Tale of Tristan and Essylte","review":"Though it's no &quot;queen of camelot&quot; or &quot;grail prince&quot; it's still a captivating story. I just had problem with Essylte's whininess and selfishness but that is part of the qualities that holds Tristan's heart, unfortunately. Talk about pure obsession to the point that one cannot breathe without other is really heartbreaking and terrifying. Anyhow, I love Nancy's writing, you can see in front of you as you are witnessing it at the moment, you can smell the smells, you can feel the pain, touch. She's amazing, I hope she keeps coming up with more stories, they don't necessarily have to be in the Arturian legends, anything will do!"},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams: A Tale of Tristan and Essylte","review":"Don't get me wrong. Nancy McKenzie's prose evokes a distant time. You can hear the storm pounding against the castle walls, smell the blood of Saxon battles, and feel the anguish in Tristan's heart as he longs for a woman he loves but cannot have. And yet...despite the beauty of the language and the vivid characters, I felt a mounting frustration with the doomed Tristan and Esseulte.These are not an English set of Romeo and Juliet. The Shakespearean lovers only destroyed one other person besides themselves. Tristan and Esseulte manage to destroy friends, family, unborn babies, and kingdoms by their obsession with each other. They refuse to give the other up despite numerous separations, yet neither one will sacrifice all their supposed obligations to other people to be together. It is this refusal to totally commit that involves others in their destructive orbit. Tristan comes off as poetically self-destructive while Esseulte whines.If you like your romances large in scope and filled with doomed lovers, then you may enjoy this book. Otherwise, it may be an exercise in screaming frustration."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams: A Tale of Tristan and Essylte","review":"&lt;u>Queen of Camelot&lt;/u> is one of my favorite pieces of modern Arthurian fiction- I absolutely loved it. Though I actually prefer how the story was originally published, as two separate books (&lt;u>The Child Queen&lt;/u> and &lt;u>The High Queen&lt;/u>) which were later consolidated into one volume and some slight changes made.I therefore was prepared to love this book, as the tale of Tristan and Isolde is one of my favorites. I can't even begin to explain how very disappointed I was as I struggled through this book.It literally was a struggle to finish. I think the crucial difference is that in &lt;u>Queen of Camelot&lt;/u> you truly get to know the characters- they have depth, and life, and you feel as though you know them personally and become very invested in what happens to them. In &lt;u>Prince of Dreams&lt;/u>, that depth is very much lacking. She skips from place to place and shoots forward in time so often than you never feel as though you are watching them live their lives; you're just skimming through a summary.Which is why, to me and obviously to others, Essylte often comes across as a whiner. I didn't care about her because I knew virtually nothing about her- she was just a shell, and her problems didn't touch me at all. The children (who are arguably the biggest victims of circumstance) are treated very dismissively, so it's hard to care about them either. Tristan has a bit more warmth and depth and we spend more time with him, but he doesn't manage to save the book as his nature- self-destructiveness and all- isn't explored and he generally ends up coming across as just being selfish.The only real interest stirred in me at all was caused by Branwen, Essylte's maid (among other things); I spent a good portion of the book anticipating her next move and wondering what surprises she might have in store that might not necessarily follow traditional tellings of the story.All in all, a very disappointing read from an author I expected greater things from. I'm sure that many people will be able to read and enjoy it, but after the richness and depth of &lt;u>Queen of Camelot&lt;/u>, this book falls far short of my expectations."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams: A Tale of Tristan and Essylte","review":"This book is amazing! I loved it. Nancy McKenzie has remade this tale into a masterpiece. I loved every word of this book and couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams: A Tale of Tristan and Essylte","review":"This retelling of the age old Tristan and Isolde tragic love story was beautifully done as only Nancy McKenzie can do. Although it is not listed as a trilogy or series, this book does follow Queen of Camelot and Grail Prince even though in this telling it is about 25 years after Arthur's death. This legend/story has it's origins in the 12th century so has been altered and changed through poetry, opera, books, and movies. The premise remains the same of the Knight Tristan who is nephew to King Markion being sent to bring back the future Queen to be Mark's bride and falling in love with her. Their love is often said to be the result of a potion in some stories and in others this is left out. The result is the same in all stories of a couple passionately in love who can not be together without betraying Tristan's uncle and completely unable to stay apart.Nancy McKenzie has spun some different twists on the story placing it a generation after Arthur and retaining some of the same characters that are in the previous book, Grail Prince. What makes this book special? After reading the three books, I have found this author has an ability, not only to bring characters to life, but to allow the reader to see clear into their souls. I fell in love with Tristan on the first page of this book. There was pouring down rain, tired soldiers moving through the mud with their captain sitting on his horse with his hands raised to the sky, \\"as if to embrace the storm, the black night, the soaking wet, and to gather them to himself. Through the din of the downpour they heard his cry.\\" This warrior leading his men home from a successful battle is 16 years old and in the word of a companion, \\"Sings like an angel and wields a sword like the very devil. Born between the stars, as we say in Lyonesse.\\" Thus we are introduced to Tristan who indeed lives a life between the stars of a bard who sings and plays the harp, who loves life and finds joy in wind, rain, and the sea, and then he is a warrior of noble birth who has a legitimate claim to the crown of Britain. Tristan does not aspire to be anything other than what he is and has no ambition to be a king in spite of all who want him to seek this as his destiny.This author has added a character who plays a major part in the story, and that is Branwen, Essylte's half sister although this link is unknown to anyone other than their father (and the reader) until late in the book. Branwen is Essylte's handmaiden and childhood friend. Prophecy and sorcery play a part in the story as we watch the wild uncontrollable passion and love between Tristan and Essylte and their very painful struggle to keep it a secret from her husband, High King of Britain, and the rest of the world.At times I wanted to just tell them to \\"get over it\\" and my heart broke for him. But after all, this is a tale of tragedy no matter who writes it. Branwen is a wonderful character and far more complex than at first meets the eye. The way she is woven through the story is masterfully done right up to the climax of her part in the story of these two lovers.I loved the way Galahad, who was the Grail Prince from the former book is brought into the story with his wonderful wife and his son and daughter. All through the book I wondered what had happened to him because his dear friend from his youth is Essylte's father. It was fitting to find out in this book the real and beautiful ending to the previous story.So what did I not like about this book to give it four stars instead of five as I did the previous two? I think some of it is the subject since it is so frustrating to have characters you care so much about throwing their lives away on a love that can not be. The reading did get a little tedious at times in the middle of the book although it quickly changed tempo in the last third or so. For anyone who loves this legend, this is a really beautiful telling of it and by far my favorite portrayal of Tristan himself."},{"Title":"365 Quick Cross Stitch Christmas Designs","review":"I have used many of these designs for friends and family.

Having said that, Daryl Smith has written one of the better volumes in the series with this book on CFIT.Smith discusses many scenarios of CFIT (Controlled Flight Into Terrain) and includes many real-world examples with generally disastrous endings. Most of these accidents boil down to low Situational Awareness (SA) or complacency, but a wide enough cross-section is examined to keep the reader interested.One critique (a problem in the other volumes as well) is there are numerous grammatical, spelling, and especially subject-verb agreement/tense errors in the book. I am seriously wondering who proofread these volumes. Some of them are fairly innocuous (such as calling an L-1011 an L10-11 starting on page 26), but many are truly glaring.Smith covers the United 173 (UA 173, Portland) and Eastern 401 (EA 401, Everglades) accidents in particular detail, and for good reason. Not only are they vivid examples, but they both ultimately became the parents of Crew Resource Management (CRM) years later. I have no real complaints with the UA 173 accident coverage, but the EA 401 accident coverage does contain some technical errors (I have a type rating on the L-1011, and although most of the details are insignificant, a few are truly misleading) that I noticed, particularly in relation to Autopilot mode (Command vs. Control Wheel Steering [CWS]), as well as a few other systems inaccuracies.Smith does tackle the interesting results of the Milgram Obedience Study (page 116) including the concept of \\"Destructive Obedience\\" that can truly be a killer in the cockpit. Although I was familiar with the study, this was the first widely distributed aviation book I have seen it discussed in.Smith presents a good overview of the American 965 accident in Cali, Columbia, but here (and elsewhere in the book) he makes several generalized and incorrect statements regarding Flight Management Systems (FMS), and doesn't really correctly explore spoiler retraction during a go-around (GA); note that spoilers are automatically retracted in GA mode on the L-1011 and some Airbus aircraft, though not on the B-757.I personally do not revere Chuck Yeager, but Smith discusses Yeager's dedication to knowing his aircraft thoroughly, and I think that is a model that all pilots should follow. I salute Smith (and Yeager) for making this point so eloquently in the book.Starting with the premise than most CFIT accidents begin with loss of SA (normally related to terrain proximity), Smith undertakes an excellent introduction to the different types of altitudes pilots must be aware of (MEA, MCA, MVA, MOCA, MORA, MSA, etc.) starting on page 210. This is an excellent review for all pilots, and should be studied repeatedly by new instrument-rated pilots, especially. On the down side, Smith makes an erroneous statement concerning Backcourse Localizer approaches in most HSI equipped aircraft on page 242. This goes back to Yeager's doctrine of knowing your aircraft: different information is presented in many ways in different aircraft; know how yours works before you go fly (especially in IMC).Overall, I was pleased with this book; it has many good lessons, and despite a few obtuse technical deficiencies, the points it makes are all on target. For that reason I recommend it to pilots of all experience levels, especially new instrument pilots."},{"Title":"Controlling Pilot Error: Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT/CFTT)","review":"Controlled Flight Into Terrain is well written. Daryl Smith was an aviation psychology instructor at the Airforce Academy. Although his book would be primarily of interest to pilots, many of the principles he describes can be applied to daily life. It is full of case studies as illustrations of situations pilots, drivers and pedestrians find themselves in all too often. If the title sounds too technical, the reading is easy and the writing is done is a lighthearted and sometimes humerous style.

The book mainly deals with CFIT and how to refrain from CFIT and CFTT. It enables us to learn from case studies like Flight 173 into Portland(crashed due to fuel starvation) and Eastern Flight 401 over the Everglades, DC-10 over Antartica. Moreover, every title in the book has a reference at the end, for further study.The Finale chapter tries to build a framework in a pilot's mind: How we can form a proper attitude and comprehend the unprofessional behaviour and the habit patterns which would turn out a disaster.

Morton (b. 1892, d. 1979) was one of the best travel writers of his generation, which perhaps constituted the golden age of English travel writing. A STRANGER IN SPAIN is his account of his tours in Spain in or about 1954. He visited all of the major and some of the minor cities in the country. But the book is much more than a travelogue, as Morton intersperses the account of his journeys with stories about the central events and personages of Spanish history, all of which are told with charm and intelligence. He emphasizes the surprisingly many historical relationships and associations between Spain and England, so the book probably is of more intrinsic interest to a Brit than to an American. Still, I can't conceive of a more pleasurable way of learning the basic outline of Spanish history from Ferdinand and Isabel through the end of the 18th Century and Napoleon's invasion of Iberia. I read the book before a recent trip to Spain and doing so provided an excellent foundation for my all-too-brief time there.If, through some trick of time travel, I were an Englishman writing this review in 1955, I certainly would give A STRANGER IN SPAIN five stars. Fifty years later, the book is somewhat dated as a travelogue and, as noted, it was written for a British audience. Hence, the four stars. Still, it is an exceedingly well-written book, well worth keeping in print and well worth reading by anyone interested in Spain."},{"Title":"Stranger In Spain, A","review":"\\"The stranger who wishes to approach Spain with sympathy and appreciation, must do so through its history.\\" Wrote H V Morton, and he certainly does so in this book, and shares not just that history but the attitudes, mannerism and even religion on the Spanish peoples he meets. A Stranger in Spain was a \`sponsored' book, undertaken with the fullest support by the tourist board of Franco's Spain, although Morton, quite rightly does not mention this, or let his escorts, guides and official chauffeurs intrude on his splendid narrative. Readers will find that same erudite, educated and friendly author's voice that Morton deploys in all his works. A created personality that differs so much, according to his biographers, to the real H V Morton that this likable traveling companion should be considered as one of his most creative works.The book is written as though Morton was wandering, alone, through a continuous tour of Spain within a normal trip's timeline. Sometimes though, the prose does not paper over all the cracks, at one stage Morton \\"recovers\\" a car we did not know he had from Madrid - a distance of 134 miles - to continue his journeys. The passage in fact marks a brief return to his home, by then in South Africa, and a return trip at a later date, but the craftsman in Morton keeps us continuously beside him without interruption of our now joint journey.In his discussion of the locality of the foods of Spain - always excepting those delicious shellfish that seem to be always freshly available wherever one eats in Spain - his descriptions are just mouthwatering ... he even attempts to offer the reader a little recipe or two! His very detailed and frank descriptions of the celebrated, cruel and gory bullfights would satisfy the curiosity of any reader who had not seen one and had already been quickly and fully sated. Yet Morton balances this with the obvious Spanish love of animals and he describes the charming - and seemingly happy - little \\"burros\\" he meets. And being Morton he, of course, finds cats everywhere in including one of his own loved breed, a lonely Siamese.The politics of Franco, which we could understand from his biographers probably sat easily with Morton, are not totally avoided, being integral to history, and the anticipated return of Spain to a Constitutional Monarchy is mentioned whenever he met it. (King Juan Carlos I resumed rule two days after General Franco's death in 1975).A masterly tour, a great read and entirely typical of this authors skills, \\"Often imitated but never bettered\\" as fellow travel writer Jan Morris wrote."},{"Title":"Stranger In Spain, A","review":"Fun book written in the 1950's about a Brits travels through spain.

Just as the American literature of the early 20th century reflected the idea that the Native Americans would soon vanish, and writers in Australia and New Zealand pontificated on similar lines on their aboriginal neighbors, so in Japan, the aboriginal Ainu have long since been labelled \\"mysterious, but vanishing\\". To tell the truth, I thought they had already gone by the 1980s. I was wrong. Here is an autobiography, written by Kayano Shigeru, an Ainu of around 60 when he originally wrote, that informs us that the Ainu are far from gone. Kayano is personally responsible for building up a collection of Ainu artifacts, for preserving a great number of \`yukar' or epic poems, for writing an Ainu-Japanese dictionary, for helping establish Ainu language primary schools in Hokkaido, and working in the political sphere to improve the lot of Japan's only aboriginal people. This memoir tells in very simple, matter-of-fact style about his early years of grinding poverty, the hardships suffered by all his fellow villagers, about being a draft laborer, about life hunting, fishing, and logging in the deep forests of Japan's northernmost island. Kayano's life is not specifically \\"Ainu\\", it is life in a mixed world of changing conditions. Japanese, Ainu, and even Western cultural strands mingle, but the author never tries to separate them. Whatever Ainu people of his generation faced, that, for him, is Ainu life. This is very effective in a way, though foreigners without much knowledge of Japan will be hard-pressed to figure out what is unique here. Kayano tells a straightforward tale, but natural reticence and perhaps lack of higher education mean that he does not delve much into psychology, he seldom develops other characters. A few sentences at most suffice. He often reports events with little comment. His feeling for his land and for his people's condition come straight from the heart, though. Nobody can remain unmoved by that.OUR LAND WAS A FOREST reminds me very much of Native American memoirs, though in this case there is no attempt whatsoever to play up \\"mystical\\" aspects or try to be a \\"wise, traditional guru\\". The Ainu experience has been close to that of other aboriginal peoples from Siberia to Sydney, from Boston to Buenos Aires. The harmony of their life in nature was disrupted by the coming of greater numbers of more organized, materialistic peoples. The book is easily read and contains a number of useful black and white photographs. If you need much background knowledge on the Ainu, this might not be the place to begin, but if you are looking for an interesting book on a little heard-from people, choose this one."},{"Title":"Our Land Was A Forest: An Ainu Memoir (Transitions--Asia & the Pacific)","review":"Shigeru Kayano gives candid and passionate voice to an aboriginal people. The breath of the Ainu pour from each page as he narrates his life ...from the snow on his skin as small boy playing in his native homeland of Ainu Mosir (lit: Peaceful Land of the Ainu), to his grandmother's lessons and father's disillusionment, through naive comments of tourists at bear-sending ceremonies, and finally to his political ascent as the first Ainu elected to the Japanese Diet.More then a memoir, Kayano records Ainu traditions, language and sentiment along side of the oppression that sucked the lives of able bodied Ainu into 'draft labor' and almost drove the Ainu culture into forgotten unwritten history.Our Land Was a Forest is the courageously humble saga of an aboriginal people written by the harbinger of traditional revival."},{"Title":"Seaworthiness : The Forgotten Factor","review":"&quot;Seaworthiness&quot; is a daunting but important classic.Tony Marchaj, an avid sailor and independent aerodynamics consultant, theorizes that the &quot;increased casualities amongst contemporary yachts&quot; is due to modern sailing yacht design, which, he feels, often sacrifices safety speed.In this book, the author attempts to objectively consider &quot;the design features&quot; which contribute to a sailing yacht truly being seaworthy.Though the equations are kept to a minimum, they are still there, and--to my poor mind, at least--they are forminable. But Marchaj does a fine job of not only helping you to intuitively grasp the nature of whatever he's speaking about, he uses numerous of graphs.Also, he offers lots of literary quotes and allusions. This certainly helps those of us who have a more literary bent, but who also revel in the beauty of boats and the sea.Some of the book's chapters include &quot;Seaworthiness and Safety at Sea,&quot; &quot;The Effect of Rating Rules on Yacht Design,&quot; &quot;Rolling Induced by Waves,&quot; and the very helpful &quot;Survival Tactics&quot; (which includes a section on &quot;Strategy of Sailing in Storm Conditions&quot;)."},{"Title":"Seaworthiness : The Forgotten Factor","review":"This is just one of the many Mr. Marchaj has written on boat design theory.

There is no substitute for &quot;the experience&quot; except the experience to recognise and avoid the experience and this book is every bit as important in picking a boat for your use or applying good seamanship to a boat that is on the edge of it's design envelope.

If you want to understand what effects a boats motion and stability in a seaway, buy this book. It is not a light read, but is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Seaworthiness : The Forgotten Factor","review":"It is quite clear, as implied in the title, that Marchaj has a serious problem with the very light displacement, low wetted area, high cg, and high aspect ratio hulls of many offshore racers of the 1970s and 1980s. Or rather he would say that the sea presents a serious problem to these boats in any less than ideal conditions. He then uses the tools of basic naval architecture to present his case in the strongest possible way. The mathematics is all at the level of basic fluid mechanics and is presented in a way to be accessible to anyone not totally intimidated by formulae. The graphic illustrations are clear, well referenced and well integrated in the text.Perhaps the most contentious part of the book is the discussion of keel aspect ratio since long dagger like keels are seen on the highest performance (in fair weather) boats. I think he could have been even more clear at discussing the role of bound vortices in allowing high angles of attack on low aspect ratio foils by showing the wing of the Concorde. In addition the book shows it's age with little reference to Computational Fluid Dyanamics (CFD) which lends itself in it's latest versions to the analysis of quasi-random inputs typical of the confused and steep seas of a building storm. Also, I think Marchaj could have emphasized a bit more the difficulty of scaling model testing to real world behavior by a review of the laws of dynamic similitude and the matching of the significant dimensionless ratios such as Reynolds number and others with the geometric scale ratios.In the late 1980s the combination of static stability analysis and model testing used in this discussion represented all that could be reasonably used to communicate to an interested audience. Now, the use of CFD tools can, if and only if carefully validated to model tests and real world behavior, much more clearly show the type of behavior differences that Marchaj describes.In the absence of such a by no means inconsiderable effort, there is really a lot to learn about boats and the sea in this volume and it is rather a treat to read. It just may not be the last word on the subject."},{"Title":"Falange","review":"Primo de Rivera is the great fascist leader of the Spanish Civil War. Captured, judged and sentenced to death by the Republicans in 1936, Franco shrewdly turned him into a martyr for his rebellion. Franco, however, was really only a pragmatic arch-traditionalist. In fact, many thought (or hoped) that, at the conclusion of the Second World War, Spain would fall into another civil war, this time between fascists and traditionalists. Of course, this never happened. But why? Brilliantly, during WWII, Franco sent traditionalist students to the seminary and young fascists to die with the Germans on the eastern front fighting the Soviet Union. Speaking of the Spanish troops fighting in the USSR Payne says, \\"Here disappointed Falangists could once more shoulder arms against atheistic Bolshevism [...] By no means all members of the Blue Division were enthusiastic Falangists, but a great many of them were [...] and scores of promising young Falange leaders never returned to Spain.\\" (p. 233-234) Thus at the end of WWII there weren't enough Spanish fascists (or, at any rate, fascist leaders) left alive to oppose Franco!The neutrality of Franco during WWII can also, I think, be nicely explained by his traditionalism. All the contending ideologies (i.e., communism, fascism, nazism, and, to a lesser extent, liberalism) in the Europe of the thirties (and WWII) were self-consciously trying to create a new world. Even in America one had the New Deal. But Franco I think fundamentally wanted to go back; it was of the Reconquista and the Church that he dreamed. Thus the refusal of the alliance with Hitler wasn't merely the result of some shrewd Machiavellian balance of power assessment. (Though it was, of course, in part that.) It was a genuine reflection of Franco's world view. All the contending powers in Europe wanted to go forward - Franco wanted to go back! See the first paragraph of chapter XVII (p. 239) where the author speaks of the change in 1943 and the Spanish insistence on peace with the Anglo-Saxon powers and war on Japan based on Christian principles(!) if there was to be a Spanish-Nazi alliance. Note that Franco also refuses to hand over Jewish refugees on Spanish territory to the Gestapo saying repatriation of refugees could wait until the end of the war. In effect, this of course meant that in order to get his hands on Jews in Spanish territory all Hitler had to do was conquer the world!Now, were the Nazis, on their part, aware of this disconnect between their Ideology and Franco's traditionalism? This passage in a book by David Irving nicely catches the ideological distance between the Nazis and Franco in the pre-WWII period: \\"Early in November 1937 Hitler told his staff that an outright Franco victory in Spain was not desirable: \`Our interest is in maintaining existing tensions in the Mediterranean.' That Franco was fighting the Communist-backed Republicans was of only secondary importance. In April 1938 Hitler would muse out loud to Reinhard Spitzy, Ribbentrop's private secretary: \`We have backed the wrong horse in Spain. We would have done better to back the Republicans. They represent the people. We could always have converted these socialists into good National Socialists later. The people around Franco are all reactionary clerics, aristocrats, and moneybags - they've nothing in common with us Nazis at all!'\\" (Irving, \\"Hitler's War\\", p. 60-61) Of course, Hitler was only kidding himself if he actually thought the Spanish Republicans could be converted to Nazism. From a much later period, Goebbels, in his diaries, writes, \\"Tokyo is denying most energetically that atrocities have been committed against Spanish citizens in the Philippines as the Spaniards maintain.\\" (\\"Final Entries\\", p. 220, March 24, 1945.) \\"The Spaniards have made a further sharp protest in Japan. The British maintain that the Spaniards intend to sever diplomatic relations with Japan.\\" (March 25, 1945). The state of the war at this time (1945) I think speaks loudly for Franco's shrewdness, although his 'Machiavellianism' can be overdone if it is thought to be the overwhelming character of his regime.From beginning to end there was a gulf between Franco's Spain and Nazi Germany that has been all too often papered over. Franco was a sincere traditionalist who understood the grave limitations to Spanish power. The mausoleum that Franco built to honor Primo de Rivera was a stone rolled over his grave to prevent fascism from rising again. This shrewdness allowed his rule to outlast those of Hitler and Mussolini by thirty years."},{"Title":"Falange","review":"A real page-turner until the unfortunate death of Jos&eacute; Antonio Primo de Rivera, the playboy fascist whose colorful and violent rhetoric was balanced by good sense, style and charm. Payne's account of fascism in Spain before Franco is matter-of-fact and free of moralizing. The later chapters deal with the Franco regime through WWII, who the historian portrays as more of a capable, moderate opportunist than a dynamic fascist Jefe. Recommended as an introduction to the 20th century Spanish incarnation of fascism."},{"Title":"Falange","review":"This is an early work by a master historian of Spanish politics. The history stops in 1961. Falange, in theory, died with the death of Franco (1975) But the 14 years not covered by Payne do not detract from the value of his work because not much did Falange accomplish in those years. Well documented, well researched, an excellent piece of work."},{"Title":"Dance While You Can","review":"Wow...I just finished the unabridged audio version of this book...it has to be the most heartwrenching story I have ever read/heard/watched. I am really uncertain about my rating because I am uncertain how I feel about it. I may have a weak heart...but there was so much heartache and pain, almost to the point that I felt like continuing to read it was masochistic. I did stop listening to it at times because I couldn't take anymore. There were few, fleeting moments of joy (mainly at the beginning), lots of twists and turns, so many complex, almost crazy characters. I don't think there was one healthy relationship in the whole story (except maybe for Henry and Caroline). I'll never forget it. It's almost more of a pyschological study of the torment that people put each other through. I don't understand why Alexander stayed with Jessica all that time. Guilt can only go so far...she was a coniving, lying, manipulative, demented, miserable person -- theirs was a codependent relationship if ever there was one. I know reality has worse, sadder stories but I read to escape from reality. The love between Elizabeth and Alexander was very special and real but I didn't think either of them did right by that love...they let circumstances control them time and time again, instead of taking control of their lives. ENDING SPOILER: I needed to know this and couldn't find it anywhere so here it is...they DO end up together...whew!...but that's with a whole heck of a lot of torment to get there. At the very ending I expected it to hold true to form and finish tragically but it didn't. I just wish we could've enjoyed their happiness with them in an epilogue."},{"Title":"Dance While You Can","review":"I read this book a while ago but I see no one has done a review for it yet.

I am reading her latest one at the moment &quot;Chasing Dreams&quot; which I see isn't on the list of her books here. She writes really well. May be after you have read seven or eight of them like I have, like many authors, a lot of her books and characters tend to become rather too similar to each other but her books are always a very enjoyable read and I would definitely recommend this book. Her books have got romance and intrigue, mystery, sometimes murder. She always has an interesting plot and nothing is ever quite what it seems. There is often a twist at the end of her books.

The book starts out with the aftermath of the destruction of the Christian church by Holme. He leads other thralls in an uprising for freedom, which ends in disaster. Once again, Holme is in trouble and must flee again. Holme goes to see the sympathetic king, and becomes his personal blacksmith. Holme's wife Ausi and daughter Tora move onto the king's settlement as well.The family who originally owned Holme and Ausi is down to its last two surviving members - the old chieftains wife and their son. The old woman still wants vengence, meaning she wants to own Tora and Ausi once more. She's too afraid to want to own Holme again...he's far too dangerous. However, the son Svien has other ideas. He loves Tora and wants her to be his bride of her own free will. Svien works things out with Holme and things go well with Svien and Tora.The clash between Christians and the worshippers of the old wooden gods comes to a head, and the battle between thralls and freemen continues. This is a very untraditional tale for the genre, written throughout with virtually no dialogue. Fridegard is a first-class storyteller, and infuses beautiful descriptions of wildlife and settings like a true master. The trilogy is a truly brilliant work of artistic literature."},{"Title":"Invitation to Social Work","review":"This book is out of print but if you want to get a general overview of the social work profession this is a place to start.

I am happy to have it on my shelf."},{"Title":"The Devil's Domain","review":"This is one of a series of great Medieval mysteries (set around the time of the late 1300's in London) by Paul Doherty, aka Paul Harding. In this series our protagonists are a Priestly Friar named Brother Athelstan, and that Falstaffian great Sir John Cranston, who is the Coroner of London.The two are greatly different- Athelstan is thin, studious, and abstinent, while Sir John is fat and a notorious imbiber (An early Nero Wolfe perhaps?). But they are united by a love of justice and a nose for a mystery. In some ways they have a Holmes-Watson relationship, but Sir John is no dummy, he has a sharp mind hidden under that flagon of ale.What makes this series great is the relationship between the two characters, and the cast of fools, villains and knaves that they encounter. Also well done is the setting- London in the 1380's is no garden spot, there is great suffering.Those who like historical mysteries should try one of the books in this series"},{"Title":"The Devil's Domain","review":"Paul Doherty makes the 1300's England come alive.

Buck's \\"The Patriot\\" came out in 1939. From the very first, the novel riveted me to the characters. Reading the book almost 70 years later, we of course have the historical perspective of Mao Tse Tung's communist revolution that came to rule China in 1947. The portrayal of Chiang Kai-shek who was eventually forced to Taiwan as a shrewd politician who takes over as a revolutionary only to oppose the communists was extremely interesting background. I also greatly appreciated Buck's examination of the difference between Japanese and Chinese culture. The romantic love story between I-wan and Tama created the sweetness in the book. [Before I discuss plot, those who would prefer not to see spoilers should stop at this point.]The story begins as I-wan is a young adult. He is thrown into jail for reading revolutionary literature where he meets En-lan. Because I-wan's father is a wealthy banker, he is able to secure his own and En-lan's release. The backstory from En-lan of the Chinese prisons and the routine executions of young men for political reasons is chilling. I-wan becomes involved in the revolutionary movement as his older brother I-ko becomes involved in the fast life of gambling and women. The house maid or slave Peony is told about I-wan's politics. I-wan's political activities put him on a death list which results in his banishment to Japan, while I-ko must be exiled to Germany for stealing from the bank.This sets up Part Two of the book where I-wan is taken to the house of one of his father's associates, Mr. Muraki, who gives him board & room and starts him off in their family business. Muraki's daughter Tama graduates university and is prepared to marry an unattractive General Seki, just as I-wan realizes he has fallen in love with her. Tama's older brother Akio who is very businesslike has refused his father's request of an arranged marriage and lives with his girlfriend. I-wan hopes that Tama will refuse to marry the old military man. War intervenes in China. Tama's brother Bungi serves and returns home a changed man. One drunken night, he reveals his secrets to I-wan. This also serves to open I-wan's eyes that the Japanese papers do not report objectively about what is happening in China. After Akio's suicide, Tama also makes it clear to her father that she will not marry General Seki. I-wan and Tama's marriage is arranged through the traditional channels and begrudgingly blessed by his family. Two sons, Jiro and Ganjiro soon are playing about I-wan's home. But increasing war rumors circulate. I-wan meets I-ko at the harbor in Japan. I-ko urges him to return home and fight for his country. This is one of the most interesting parts of the character I-wan who loves his wife and children, but regards his Chinese nationality as important. It leads to his decision to depart for China to fight the Japanese.Part Three reunites I-wan with his school buddy En-lan and the now revolutionary Peony who married En-lan. They fight in the mountains as communists against Chaing Kai-shek. An agreement is reached that puts them all on the same side to fight the Japanese. Differences in war strategies come to the fore as the Chinese adopt a more traditional guerilla war. I-wan comes to appreciate the sense of order in Japan which results in less chaos and criminality. The novel concludes as Chaing Kai-shek informs I-wan that he had I-wan's brother I-ko executed for a criminal. We get hints of how I-wan will bring his family to China to live in his family's land in Western China.This is the first novel I've read by Pearl S. Buck. Her command of story, character and the broad universal themes of war & peace, chaos & order, duty to country vs. duty to family, makes this a breathtaking adventure. Buck is a master storyteller. \\"The Patriot\\" is an extremely satisfying reading experience.

The author begins with the technical aspects of lighting. Included in this section are chapters on the nature of light, color theory, reflection, refraction, electricity in the theatre, and the use of dimmers to control the light. The process of translating this information into an appropriate lighting design is the topic of the second half of the book. Material includes the creation of the design, working within the setting, and creating cues for the show.The book does suffer from age, new lighting instruments and computerized dimmimg systems have revolutionized professional stage lighting. But for the scholastic or community theatre designer, this is an invaluable tool."},{"Title":"Lighting the stage;: Art and practice","review":"The book is from the 60's, the lighting instruments and boards are no longer used, but the philosophy and ideas that Mr Willard Bellman present in this textbook are timeless.Building off of the lighting philosophies of Stanley McCandless, Mr. Bellman explores what it means to be a lighting designer, and why we design light for the stage.

Lafferty. Set between 1920 and 1928, it deals with a group of Catholic schoolchildren in Tulsa, Oklahoma--though, in true Lafferty fashion, these children also represent the eternality of the Church.Unlike most of Lafferty's work (which fits uncomfortably within the science fiction and fantasy genres), this is a work of mainstream fiction. There are strong fantasy elements, but they fall more under the heading of \\"magic realism\\" or tall tale than under fantasy proper. As such, newcomers might find \\"My Heart Leaps Up\\" to be more accessible than more outlandish novels like \\"Fourth Mansions\\" or \\"Arrive at Easterwine.\\" (Though, truth be told, the book is only as \\"easy\\" as you make it; scratch the surface, and it is as complex, disturbing, and finely-tuned as anything in the man's oeuvre.) In fact, I can imagine that with the proper distribution and promotion, this novel could have helped to establish Lafferty as a major American novelist.Frustratingly, \\"My Heart Leaps Up\\" is only the first installment of a much longer series. The other volumes--\\"Grasshoppers and Wild Honey,\\" \\"Deep Scars of Thunder,\\" and \\"Incidents of Travel in Flatland\\"--were written but have yet to be published. Hopefully we will see those books someday. But incomplete or not, \\"My Heart Leaps Up\\" is still an impressive work by one of America's very greatest, though least known, writers.[\\"My Heart Leaps Up\\" was originally published in the 1980's as a series of five chapbooks, each containing two chapters apiece. The first two chapters of \\"Grasshoppers and Wild Honey\\" were also published in the early 1990's. You should still be able to obtain these books at their original prices, so beware any used booksellers offering them for exorbitant amounts.]"},{"Title":"TOMS, COONS, MULATTOES, MAMMIES, & BUCKS - An Interpretive History Of Blacks In American Films","review":"I use this book as a supplemental text for my classes in psychology.

It is of a time when women wore gowns and dresses and men wore suits, ties and uniforms. Where families had servants and maids and gardeners -- and slaves. A girl from the south whose father was killed on his way to rescue a wounded Union soldier now nurses back to life the same soldier. To perhaps fill the hole left by the death of her father, Lora weds her charge, Wade Tyler. He takes her to his family's home on Staten Island to be a mother to his young son whose own mother had mysteriously died in a pool of water. Other characters enter into the story. Her husband's mother, Amanda Tyler, rules her roost with an iron fist and Lora's husband, Wade Tyler, is his mother's dutiful son. Lora tries her best to fit in this dark household but finds herself surrounded by rules and limitations she does not understood or agree with. As Lora meets some of the neighbors and visits with them she feels there are many hidden secrets -- not the least of which concerns the death of Wade's first wife, Jemmy's mother. Was she killed, or was it suicide, and who knows something but is not telling?

He reveals that this was not an accidental sortie but a well planned venture breadboarded in the Confederate Naval Headquarters and played out step by step to its conclusion. It is interesting to wonder what would have happened if more ships had been available to the South for this war. Also interesting is the fact that even though the South did not win the war the efforts of the C.S.S. Shenandoah and the C.S.S.

This, in itself, is a fascinating story. A huge tract, covering parts of ten counties and spanning much of the western panhandle of Texas, was given in payment by a cash-poor state in the wake of the Civil War. The ranch became a major player in the ranch culture of the southwest as well as on the cow trails from Texas to Montana.Hailey documents the history of the ranch through first hand interviews with people directly associated with the ranch as well as using historical documents. The book was originally published in the 1920s, when many of the workers were still alive. Their stories provide a powerful antidote to the image of cowboys as gunslingers and romantic heroes, as portrayed by Hollywood. Their lives were intensely difficult as they worked to overcome a cruel and unforgiving environment plagued by drought, fire, ne'er-do-wells, and wolves.This book is a great read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The XIT Ranch of Texas and the early days of the Llano Estacado (Western frontier library)","review":"Another excellent book by Mr Haley about the settling/civilization of the Texas panhandle and the men who made it their lifes work.Explains alot of how the longhorns were phased out and the English bloodlines were introduced into the country.

The Llano Estacado was yet to be conquered by white ranchers looking for free and easy grazing. With the coming of barbed wire, the smaller ranches were absorbed by the larger operations, mostly funded by foreign money men. The cowboys are the ones I found the most interesting part of the ranching history. They each led a soulful life, their best friend was their horse, with occasional visit to neighboring ranches or fandangos at nearby villages. It was a harsh enviornment, but the men who worked it was also harsh. Most of them learning from older cowmen, most of them young.The XIT is well written and researched. A good history read."},{"Title":"The XIT Ranch of Texas and the early days of the Llano Estacado (Western frontier library)","review":"J. Evetts Haley is a historian of the school that believed the facts of history were worthy of accurate historical narrative. This book is masterful: Haley laboriously documents the sources that he needed, some of them obscure and in dusty minutes, but the XIT ranch fills the Texas Panhandle's early history with a stirring and memorable quality seldom accorded modern history writing.Haley's thesis is: The XIT history as told from original sources. Unlike most modern historians, who propound a thesis that is alien to the subject, Haley lets the materials of the XIT guide his writing. I heartily commend this book to the serious reader.I learned why the XIT was named, the meaning of \\"Lobo\\" and a myraid of other interesting facts.Longdrycreek Ranch, Shamrock, Texas"},{"Title":"Noodlehead Stories","review":"I really enjoyed reading all the stories in this book. The introduction defining what a noodlehead is is a great way to begin the book. Reading each story makes you laugh and realize that you too sometimes do noodlehead things. My favorite story was \\"Next Time I'll Know What To Do\\" which is about a boy whose mother has him go out and get a job. So he goes off and finds a job. After his first day of work he earns a coin. Being so proud of himself he shows everyone on his way home, unfortunately he drops it the water while crossing a bridge. His mother, disappointed, tells him he should have put it in his pocket. So the next day he received two slabs of butter for working. On his way home he put it in his pocket, like his mother said but by the time he made it home the butter had melted. This continues on each day, somehow losing what he earned by bringing it home the way his mother had told him. Now anyone with common sense would know that the butter would melt but Jack was following his mother's instructions. This continues on until he receives two bags of gold because he made the rich man laugh by trying to carry his donkey over his shoulder because that was what his mother had told him to do, onlyshe was referring to carrying the meat over his shoulder.This story was fun to read, along all the others. Each story comes with great little illustrations that represent the characters in the story. At the end of each story there are tips for ways to tell the story along with a little added information about the story. Also at the end of the book there is a section describing great techniques for story telling as well as follow up activities to do after you've read the story, such as creating a new stories from a few characters, each from different stories. Each story in this book is from a different country, offering us a little cultural information as well.

We anticipated that this collection would be a real treat and it is!My kids always ask where this book is; someone always has it off the shelf. These stories keep my children busy for hours. They read to themselves, to each other, and then they tell them. These stories made them roar with laughter. A perfect humorous compilation of Folk Tales for children.In the beginning there is a world map to illustrate where these stories originate. At the end they offer General Tips for Telling Stories. These tips are the next best thing to having Hamilton & Weiss in person to do the coaching. They even offer Follow-up Activities to expand the lesson plan or teaching possibilities this book has to offer."},{"Title":"Noodlehead Stories","review":"This book really spoke to the children in my classroom. They all enjoyed hearing stories about the archtypal fool, and it paved the way for discussions on our treatment of others, since we, too, are often &quot;the fool.&quot;Hamilton and Weiss have a great storytelling style: it's easy to read AND easy to tell. The illustrations are absolutely wonderful, too. I think other teachers, librarians, parents, etc. would all enjoy sharing this book with their children."},{"Title":"Noodlehead Stories","review":"What a fun collection! My kids and I laughed a lot while reading these stories. I like the way the authors never use words like &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;dumb&quot; and emphasize that the stories are told in the spirit of laughing at the \`noodlehead' in all of us. Even though the stories are all about fools, there is a great variety to the kinds of tales. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"HTML Style Sheets Design Guide: The Web Professional's Guide to Building and Using Style Sheets","review":"Don't be seduced by this book's lavish cover or large-format, its 60-page color section or the considerable writing experience of the three authors. This book's potentially timely and valuable information is crippled by the publisher's decision to get this book on the shelves without benefit of the least editorial proofing.Page after page of obvious problems completely undermine your confidence in the technical content. Statements like &quot;The Times font is probably the most commonly used font written in languages using Arabic letters.&quot; (p114) surely won't convince you that the authors have something to teach you in the way of fontfaces.Poorly thought-out and unimaginative illustrations have only a tenuous relation to text. Sometimes they have no relation. On p105, the authors &quot;illustrate&quot; the block nature of a list-item with a picture of Felix the Cat in a non-browser window labelled &quot;Animated Gifs&quot;. Another example shows us Lotus Notes instead of Netscape.It is clear that technical facts have not been thoroughly checked. This is very important in an area where published standards are not completely implemented and there are wide variations in the type of implementation across browsers and platforms. We are told that &quot;font size (sic) and font weight (tsk tsk) are abbreviated using the slash (12pt/14pt).&quot; No, font-size and line-height are abbreviated that way.The book is poorly indexed, but that is normal for computer books. What is abnormal is that the color section, about one-third of the book, has not been indexed at all! Especially amusing was the 5 full-color pages gushing about Time Magazine's exemplary use of style sheets *without one line* of code to back up the authors' esteem.No, this is one beautiful book best admired from afar."},{"Title":"HTML Style Sheets Design Guide: The Web Professional's Guide to Building and Using Style Sheets","review":"With the introduction of the Microsoft and Netscape 4.0 series Web browsers new and exciting Web development design options have arrived on the scene.

Crowe's &quot;The Extraterrestrial Life Debate, 1750-1900&quot; is one of the most intellectually magnificent and philosophically enthralling books I have ever read, a supreme work of scholarship. It perfects the sensitive art of quotation and distillation, and the chronological arrangement of the encyclopedic material turns all of history into a common dialogue upon one of the very greatest ideas and problems there is to perplex and fascinate the mind and surround us with the mystery of natural possibilities that are both crazy and sublime. The book itself is like a universe of stellar minds contemplating the inverse puzzle of why there is life on Earth or any life at all. Despite its magnitude, I came to its last page with a melancholy regret that there was not more and more and more of it, but at least this was true of the jeweled depths it probed and illuminated, and which it etched in my memory."},{"Title":"Foghorn Outdoors: New England Hiking 3 Ed: The Complete Guide to More than 380 Hikes","review":"There's something wrong, and slightly frightening, about the review written just before mine. I guess this fellow decided it would be a good idea to travel into the woods with a book that contains no maps. BAD IDEA. Nothing can replace full page maps. To think someone with, or even without, experience would wander into the woods with a BOOK is completely assinine. Michael Lanza, an editor for Backpacker Magazine, has compiled a wonderful list of hikes here. If you don't want to go through the trouble of buying a trail guide for every place you'd like to hike, then here's your book. There are no little maps like those in the 50 Great Hikes in...series. Those are practically useless anyhow. You should always go through the trouble of picking up a USGS quad or 250,000 map if you're hiking in unfamiliar country. Everything else you need is here though - directions, park regulations, trail descriptions, camping spots. He even mentions where to get maps and where to register for your hikes. There's a lot of ground to cover in New England, and Lanza does it stylistically and thoughtfully."},{"Title":"Foghorn Outdoors: New England Hiking 3 Ed: The Complete Guide to More than 380 Hikes","review":"Nicely organized and categorized. However, the details provided in this book on the walks I've taken are rather vague in some spots. Based on this book, I've spent a few hours wandering around the woods searching for trails that aren't where they're supposed to be, landmarks I can't find and blazes that aren't there.I've spent a great deal of time in the woods, on my own, with others, with nothing but a water bottle on up to complete packs with GPS, compass, topos and anything else one could need. I've bushwacked cross-country and followed well-marked trails like the AT.But with this book as a guide, I was as lost as I've ever been. Which is to say I had a reasonable idea I could find my way around and get back home, but not entirely sure where the trail was. When you go into the woods on your own or on some public blazed trail - that's what you count on. When trying to follow some of these trails in the book, it's the book you count on - to see if you can replicate the path as laid out there.Yesterday, I was in Dogtown on Cape Ann in Massachusetts trying to follow the author's trail. Moses perhaps had a similar guide in wandering his way through the desert for 40 years. I got the feeling that Mr. Lanza wrote up this trail after reading some Chamber of Commerce guide or map to the area. In one section, the directions read &quot;...the trail turns left and crosses the railroad tracks and reaches the rough dirt Old Rockport Road...&quot;. It doesn't. Straight across the tracks is a pond (a dried up marsh at this time of year). I tried crossing the marsh, tried going 100 yards left, and then finally found a way across 25 yards to the right, across a drainage culvert. This led to a series of interlocking paths that generally trended in what seemed the right direction. Based on other directions in the book, I think I ended up where I was supposed for the next landmark, but it made no sense because I was about 1/2 mile away from where I theoretically should have been.Most of the day was like that. I pretty much had to make up my own trail. By the way, that railroad you have to cross twice is an active AMTRAK commuter line, and those trains came by pretty fast. Watch out and don't linger on the track.The book is ok, and is reasonably classified, though it has no maps (another problem) - but bring at least a compass and a topo for backup and be prepared to navigate on your own."},{"Title":"LOVE NOTES (NANCY DREW FILES 109)","review":"As a fan of the Nancy Drew computer games from Her Interactive (wonderful things, by the way), I decided that I should start reading some of the books.

Phillips explores this in her Orhpic Tale. It is the story of the young, independent Eunice who leaves a privledged life in San Francisco to find herself and the blues she believes is a part of her. She finds what she seeks in the diamond toothed aging bluesman Blacksnake and it is quickly apparent that as she enters his world, her life will be forever changed. Phillip's writes, &quot;She had never fought for existence; now she would have to.&quot; Phillip's shows a woman's experience with the blues through literature, much in the same manner it might be played out in a blueswoman's song. As content, the novel insightfully explores and gives reference to vodoo, the Orpheus tale of Greek mythology, as well as gender issues of female independence and male dominance. When Eunice arrives in Raleigh, North Carolina she is an independent and courageous woman who speaks her mind and makes choices about her own sexuality. However, she is faced with a dichotomy of her independence opposed against a patriarchal order of male power and control. It is Eunice's transformation, combined with the complexity of her evolving relationship with Blacksnake that gives this novel its intrigue."},{"Title":"Mojo hand","review":"&quot;The power of the blues dominates this tale where voodoo merges with a version of the age-old myth of Orpheus, and where two lovers -- a desperate, light-skinned young black woman who appears to be white and an aging black bluesman battle their fated attraction.&quot; David Henderson - Berkeley Monthly&quot;A work of genius written by a girl of twenty --too rich a mix for the time in which it appeared, with its superb ear of Black street talk, and insider's knowledge of the blues.

So she serached through old newspaper clipping, interviewed people who'd been at the company from the earliest days and managed to get them to open up and reveal details about the wheeling and dealing, the fights, the vanity of some of the people at the utility..and enough insider secrets to satisfy the curiousity of most readers. I certainly couldn't put it down.For anyone interested in local history that isn't glossed over with niceties or ends up being a public relations promotion, this book fills the bill.... and it is becoming harder to find.It is one of the few (if not the ONLY) books which brings up the bizarre incidents, the dilemnas solved, the disasters that were averted and the men who helped form the Indianapolis Water company from its early days (back when it was only an old-time pumping station up through the early 1980s.ALong the way, they faced such obstacles as convincing the public that city water was better and healthier than well water, a battle that they lost in spite of massive public relations campaigns, forcing the waterworks company to be sold in 1881.From those faltering early days, the company would eventually prosper and well water would become a sign of the past (although plenty of people stil use well water in Indianapolis, even today, but the numbers are decreasing quickly). Margie Gates Giffin has done a remarkable job of chronicling the strengths, weaknesses, vanities and oddities of the people who helped make the company what it is today - and, along the way, she has drawn a portrait of Indianapolis history, past and present."},{"Title":"The Spice Ingredients Cookbook","review":"When my beloved wife died in November, 1998, I was confronted with a pantry full of spices, many of which were unlabeled in jars or small plastic bags. I wanted to identify them and use them! In desperation, I sought a book that would help me, and I found this perfect reference. The photography of the spices, in luscious, sharp color, helped me determine the name of each spice,and introduced me to wonderful new spices as well. The book includes great recipes and sumptious arrays of the artistically presented results. I only wish that Sallie Morris would produce a companion volume on herbs, which, understandably, are not covered by this book!Bon appetit!"},{"Title":"Our Marriage: An Anniversary Keepsake Book (Keepsake Books)","review":"I'm giving this journal/album 3 stars because it's a great idea and the quality seems good, but I was disappointed enough with it to return it.First, I'm a fan of the author/designer's other books, and I was absolutely shocked at how boring this book looks -- I expected some neat graphics or design but it's really just like every other generic bride's book out there. If I'd seen the interior I'd have never even bothered.Second, the &quot;my wedding&quot; section is not very useful -- there's not enough room for this to function as your wedding memory album, and if you *have* such an album, you don't need to bother with filling out the section in this book.Finally, while the ideas for what kind of memories to record are nice, there are too many of them and honestly, do I need to write 3 lines about our house *every* year? How much can I say about one house? I would have preferred some blank space each year along with a new suggestion of things to write about.There is very little photo space, and while I am fine with the idea of picking one or two best photos there ought to at least be one page per year for photos and memorabilia (you get 2 pages for every five years).To sum up -- I think some people could love this, but to me it comes off like one of those fill-in-one-million-blanks baby books that no-one ever really fills out. I love the idea of recapping each year, but this book just isn't going to work for that."},{"Title":"Our Marriage: An Anniversary Keepsake Book (Keepsake Books)","review":"This is going to become a staple gift that I give to loving couples and newlyweds. It was truly a trip through time for my husband and me to fill out. In fact, there isn't enough room to include some of our stories (especially in courtship).

This hard-cover book will keep well in the years to come yet I was disappointed by the fact that there were only two pages for wedding photos. I guess I was hoping that this book would have a fat section for wedding day photos and keepsakes such as invitations and special cards received. Also the glue from the velcro &quot;pocket&quot; sections caused yucko grease stains on two parts of the book.

More so than I expected to be after reading some of the other reviews. The idea I was going for was to have a record book to cover the couple's entire life together and not be limited to just the wedding as so many books are. Those always get put away. Very tasteful decor throughout, without a lot of stuff you don't need, with room for a few pictures in each section, and envelopes for mementos, I think this will be a keepsake the couple I chose it for will cherish throughout their life. I also bought \\"The Book of Us\\" to include in the gift, as I thought it would be an excellent companion. Add a pen, some coffee mugs, and maybe some designer coffee ... and VOILA!!! Excellent, unique wedding gift!"},{"Title":"Our Marriage: An Anniversary Keepsake Book (Keepsake Books)","review":"I bought this for my husband for our second anniversary. Every year, we take a brief anniversary trip (at least one night - usually near home) and take time to read about our courtship, engagement, wedding and past years of marriage, fill in the previous year and dream about the future. It is a great reinforcement for us that we have a great marriage and it always keeps that in the front of our mind - especially during the difficult times. Readers should know that this is not a \\"wedding day\\" keepsake book, but a lifelong marriage book. I think the topics the book gives you are great. As on reader commented on the \\"our home\\" section, I actually like this part. Perhaps it works for us because we've lived in 3 places in 12 years, but we usually reflect on the work we've done and look back and laugh as our house is initially described as \\"spacious bungalow\\" then described as \\"cramped bungalow\\" after having kids and grandparents buying tons of toys, then back to \\"spacious bungalow\\" again as we clean up the clutter.

It is fiction, but very plausible, and could vey well have happened. In fact there are many East Germans who did indeed escape from behind the barbed wire.

In fact, it made me appreciate the suffering and sacrifice of military people. It made more aware of the suffering and pain of those individuals who lived under the oppression of Communist dictatorships.This is a moving story in everyway. And by the end it is also thrilling. The people seem very real. Yet Ret. Col. Pocock's writing is very straightforward, even plain. For this story that seems to be a virtue.I actually believed the story really happened. It was almost a biography of a lost period in time. I had to keep reading the disclaimers about the story being fiction. Do yourself a favor, read this book.

I expected a veteran of the 14th, maybe any veteran, would find something to like in the book. I expected to feel nostalgia amd pride, to enjoy the action. I didn't expect an exceptionally good read.Make no mistake about it, Jim Pocock can write. This book has more twists and turns than the road up Pike's Peak, but it never reaches. I found each turn of events not only plausible, but fascinating and entirely real. Don't peek, but do look forward, with anticipation, to the epilogue. It will turn you inside out.Every veteran of \\"cold war\\" border service should have this book. Everyone who loves a story that grabs your attention and causes you to keep reading when you know you should turn out the light, will love it. It has something for the military buff, it is a love story (or two), it is packed full of action, it has great characters that pull you into their lives and it even educates the reader about the \\"Cold War,\\" without trying to being a history book.If you don't buy it for yourself, buy it for your wife.

I understand that they are not written to replace our verticle relationship with God (God on top, we as His subjects) but know they can help with our horizontal relationships with one another. This book blurs the verticle and horizontal and as a result, promotes bad theology.I won't wax on about this but give you one basic example. The author states that, God \\"wants real wealth for you, the wealth of life that is successful in all its aspects: economic, social, spiritual, intellectual, physical.\\"I wouldn't bring up the Bible in this review, but the fact is, the author does and the author speaks for God of the Bible. So where in the Bible does it say that God's plans for us include economic wealth? Are we failing to live up to what God wants for us when we are sick or lonely? No, we aren't. The fact is, God wants you to have a relationship with him through Jesus Christ and it is there where you will be given true and eternal wealth despite your economic status or health.So, the author does an injustice to God by representing him as a God who is obsessed with your earthly riches and wealth. That's bad theology and is not helpful at all.

He makes the application of spiritual principles so real and so exciting to do. This classic is filled with his usual stories of people from myriad backgrounds who bear testimony to the fact that what he teaches works.Chapter 13 is a slight deviation from the main topic of the book, but it loosely ties in. It is about the spiritual forces around us, the mysterious powers we do not fully understand, but occasionally catch glimpses of. This chapter puts some issues on the table to be probed later.The only reason I didn't give this book a 5 rating is because in one place he tries to tie in religions other than Christianity.

I had read The Grapes of Wrath when in high school years ago - it didn't grab me like this one did. A definite \\"must read\\" for anyone who likes history or just likes a great read!"},{"Title":"Glass Slippers Give You Blisters","review":"I don't think this book is your typical \\"junior high tragedy,\\" as another reviewer described it. While it's been one of my favorites for at least ten years, it's also taken on more meaning to me as I got older and had to deal with the issues between my mother, grandmother, and myself - much as Kelly does.Glass Slippers Give You Blisters is told from the point of view of twelve-year-old Kelly MacDonald, who is just starting seventh grade with her two best friends Lisa and Rebecca. When her friends get cast in the school play, \\"Cinderella,\\" and she doesn't, Kelly has to look first at what it means to do a good job and not just try to fake your way into a role, and then to explore who she can be on her own.More than that, though, is the tension between her mother and grandmother. Gram, an artist, ran off to New York to \\"develop as an actress\\" when her mother was eight, and her mother has never forgiven her. As a result, she hates anything to do with the theater, and is less than pleased with the fact that Kelly wants to be involved with a play.In some ways Kelly's work on the play brings her mother and grandmother closer together - and also creates an understanding between her mother and herself. But it's not perfect. When Gram suffers a stroke, Kelly feels responsible, and has to deal with that guilt. She is also the only child left at home, now that her perfect older sister has gone to college, and faces the fact that she's always gotten along better with Gram than her mother - which of course doesn't please Mom.Kelly also has lots of flaws - her tendency to daydream, her temper, her guilt, and the way she has to learn to do a good job without faking someone out. One of the most realistic things is the way she gets angry when she hears the snobby set designer taking credit for her work with the lights. Gram tells her not to go needing approval from other people, which I think is hard for most people. All of Kelly's flaws make her a very real, and humorous, person.Glass Slippers ... is no epic, but it ends happily, and hopefully, with the promise of a truce between her mother and Gram, and Kelly and Mom. Most girls spend their lives looking for that truce."},{"Title":"Glass Slippers Give You Blisters","review":"this book is about Kelly, she and her 2 friends Lisa and Rebecca try out for a school play, of &quot;Cinderalla&quot; Kelly makes a total fool of herself, and then find out what happens next in this book and how she gets in the play!"},{"Title":"Glass Slippers Give You Blisters","review":"Three girls who try-out for the play to be cinndareala .They all have a big fight over gets to be her for the play.The slipers give one of the girls blisters and they hert her feet.They get in fight because there's only one cindarralia and they all want to be it as well as other people.Who whould of thought three girls would get into a fight over a fantasy girl who is not even rell and of course your not going to be her forever and only to be in a play!"},{"Title":"Glass Slippers Give You Blisters","review":"Three girls who try-out for the play to be cinndareala .They all have a big fight over gets to be her for the play.The slipers give one of the girls blisters and they hert her feet.They get in fight because there's only one cindarralia and they all want to be it as well as other people.Who whould of thought three girls would get into a fight over a fantasy girl who is not even rell and of course your not going to be her forever and only to be in a play!"},{"Title":"Glass Slippers Give You Blisters","review":"This is a cute story of Kelly and her two best friends Lisa and Rebecca.

This book consists of: a refresher of Algebraic Expressions and Application in the form of the function (linear, quadratic, and other polynomial), Logarithms and exponents, a review of Analytic Geometry and Trigonometry, Discrete mathematics as it applies to Sequences and Series, Matrices, Combinatorics, Probability, Statistics, Modeling, and Limits and an introduction of Calculus in the form of the derivative.The book states that an emphasis on application is an intrinsic part of it, this, however is not really the case. The book, while showing an appropriate number of application problems in certain sections, lacks that application horribly in others. However, these lacking sections are few enough that it deserves a fair amount of credit in the attempt."},{"Title":"McDougal Littell Advanced Math: Student Edition Grades 9-12 2003","review":"This book fails to give adequate examples at the beginning of each section and provide enough information about the given topic.

Also, the examples that are given sometimes miss key steps and are therefore confusing. This leads to much frustration. The actual problems though can be quite challenging and appropriate if the reader actual understands the basic underlying principles of the problems. However, the book on occasion supplies inaccurate or incorrect solutions to these problems (the odd number problems in the \\"written exercises,\\" the \\"class exercises,\\" and \\"chapter test\\" solutions are located in the back of the book).I happen to have on hand another trignometery book. Although old and coming from a pre-calculator age (never mind a pre-computer age as well), this book at least supplies accuarte examples at the beginning of each section.

The book briefly states what is needed to do the exercises, and the majority of the \\"major\\" theorems in advanced mathematics are proved in the exercises themselves (in fact, that is why so many of the exercises are so challenging). In this way (other books just prove the theorems for you and allow people just to memorize the proof), the author allows you to figure things out for yourself. This book also has a wide scope. However, one tiny fault of this book is that it does not convince you of some of the important facts (and these theorems are definitely not beyond the level of the book), for example the \\"Rule of 72.\\" Also, this book is not for the average person. It requires a lot of critical thinking.

The explanations are clear and the problems start easy but move toward challenges that will make you think. A solution key is available for this book:Advanced Math: Precalculus with Discrete Mathematics and Data Analysis (Solution Key). I recommend it; it's very useful if you're doing self-study or teaching.Some have complained that the book doesn't give adequate explanations, but the reality is that this book is for students who have a good background in mathematics. Too many of today's math courses are easier than they should be and cheat students out of learning real mathematics. This book won't do that. Use it, don't give up, and you'll be surprised at what you learn. If you're having trouble, pick up copies of Brown's algebra and geometry books (all available on amazon) and use them to review.

He shares much about themes like the esoteric teachings hidden within the New Testament, the Fourth dimension, sacred geometry, dreams, yoga, hypnosis, and some of Ouspensky's own travels in search of the miraculous. It is well worth reading both as a preparation for studying the teachings of Gurdjieff and also in its own right. Ouspensky was a deep thinker and had much to share.

Having difficulty relating to pampered multi-millionaire drivers who could not be competitive without computers? Missing the era when YOU could have raced at the top levels of the sport if you had lots of moxie (and bravery!), but when it didn't require hundreds of millions of dollars worth of engineers, computer experts, aerodynamicists, financiers and public relations teams to keep the sponsors happy? Return to those early days of auto racing with this entertaining first-hand perspective on hands-on, gut-level racing at the top levels in the 1920's and early 1930's.For example, does this sound like anything you've read about the sport recently?... Preparing for a race in France, and having worked all night on the car, DePaolo writes, \\"I climbed up into the loft of the barn to get a little sleep. Almost immediately I fell fast asleep, and immediately started to dream. There was 'Mephistopheles' with mustaches that trailed on the ground and became entangled in the wheels of racing cars. I dreamed I was in a wreck and was thrown out on the course. With a start I awoke. A large rat was running across my chest. There was no more sleep for me so I quietly went down the ladder and rejoined the mechanics, helping them work on the car until the job was finished, less than two hours before time for the race to start.\\"Peter saw his first Indianapolis 500 mile race in 1919, where he watched his uncle, Ralph DePalma, win. Peter drove his first Indy 500 race in 1922, placing 4th!Peter DePaolo won the 1925 Indy 500, driving for Fred Duesenberg. It was the first Indy 500 to average more than 100 mph. By midpoint he had pulled out a huge lead but had to pit due to serious blisters on his hands. Duesenberg pulled him out of the car for the next 21 laps to have his hands bandaged - during which time he'd dropped to fifth and had to fight his way back to the win.Altogether, he entered seven Indy 500's and many European Grand Prix races, retiring in 1934 after a bad crash in Spain put him into a coma. In 1935 he was the car owner and team manager for Kelly Patillo's Indy 500 win - which is included in this 1935 book.In addition to covering his uncle, Ralph DePalma, DePaolo also discusses famous drivers and events from the wilder pioneering days of racing - Eddie Rickenbacker, Barney Oldfield, Louis & Gaston Chevrolet, Harry Miller, Jimmy Murphy, Tommy Milton, Frank Lockhart, Ray Harroun, Dario Resta, Howard Wilcox, Fred & August Duesenberg, Roscoe Sarles, \\"Cotton\\" Henning, R.A. Stranahan, T.E.\\"Pop\\" Myers, Rex Mays, Wilbur Shaw, \\"Wild Bill\\" Cummings, and many others...The book is a fun read and full of colorful, insightful comments. Although the book predates DePaolo's involvement in NASCAR racing (as a team owner from 1955 to 1957), it is interesting to note this connection - In fact, the last chapter of this book, titled \\"Knowing How\\", comments on the rules-making bodies and the many contributions to auto racing safety from Harvey Firestone, AAA, and others. DePaolo's comments on safety & rules-making in his era makes this book worth reading even for those whose interest in auto racing history focuses more on the Post-WW2 era.Wall smacker;: The saga of the speedway,"},{"Title":"The Russian Century: A Photographic History of Russia's 100 Years","review":"I echo the views of the other reviewers ... that this book is an outstanding introduction to / overview of 20th century Russian history. It's worth the price for Brian Moynahan's sweeping, lucid narrative alone, but when I first borrowed this book from a friend it was the photographs that kept me rivited for hours at at time over several days. I'm convinced that this will come to be regarded as of the great collections of historic photography ever. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Russian Century: A Photographic History of Russia's 100 Years","review":"Moynihan's book serves as a solid overview of what is painted as a fairly blighted century. From collectivization, to Stalin's brutal purges, to invasion by Nazis, to the dark restless sleep of the soul inspired by Brezhnev, the Communist years were not kind to the Russians. From the tsar to Yeltsin, Moynihan offers a clear mix of history and analysis that makes this a quick read. Still, the chapter on Russia's war with Germany unfolds like the blitzkrieg, and if you're looking for details, this is not your book. Moynihan paints with very broad strokes and does not attempt to get into the minds of the Russian people. Given that they were treated as nothing more than neccessary cogs in Stalin's megalomaniacal drive to modernize a peasant state, it would be nice to know more about their perspective. Nonetheless, this is a lucid narrative of a century's worth of troubles."},{"Title":"The Russian Century: A Photographic History of Russia's 100 Years","review":"Moynahan's journalistic instincts are to the fore in this fast moving account of one of history's great upheavals. The author has plenty of experience covering Russia as a journalist at The Times. The coverage doesn't just take in the politics or revolution. There's social history, art and lifestyle - as well as all the gruesome stuff involving purges, genocide and the death camps in eastern siberia.It also has some wonderful pictures - especially one showing an old woman experiencing voting for the first time. Something that is so familiar to most of us was so alien to her. She was ninety and old enough to remember Tsar Nicholas.The coverage is heavily bent towards the first half of the century since most of the action took place then. Moynahan's big picture style means that you really get a feel for how traumatic and vengeful these times were for ordinary people. The revolutions and the spread of communist power throughout the empire was quite simply government by a gang of murderous thugs. Fiends of the worst possible kind with a liking for violence.The end of the party and the Russian Empire is dealt with only lightly since the book was first written in the early 1990s. (I read the 1994 version and haven't got around to reading an updated version). That, I don't, think is a big issue since most readers will have been around long enough to have a pretty good handle on the Gorbachev and Yeltsin years anyway.All too often, these types of histories are academic (often mind numbing) and/or far too long. This one is short, sucinct and highly entertaining. In fact, anyone wishing to get into the excellent accounts of the revolution by Figes or Pipes should read this one first."},{"Title":"The Russian Century: A Photographic History of Russia's 100 Years","review":"The Russian Century is a whirlwind tour through the last 100 years of Russia's history, with the core of the book dedicated to Stalin and the WWII years. This is a short, fast book that touches lightly on the key events of the century but discusses none in great detail.Moynahan is a journalist and not a historian -- he gives the reader the feel and flavor of the Russian experience instead of a hardcore analysis. It is the sizzle of Russian history without the meat. This is a book where one learns that Lenin disguised himself with a gray wig during the Bolshevik Revolution, and that Stalin once fired a famous jazz singer because her songs were too complex for his taste. On the other hand, the Yalta conference is alluded to in just one sentence and never discussed again. Raisa Gorbachev's shopping habits receive several mentions, while the complex internal politics behind glasnost are glossed over.These are not faults -- just differences.

The author wears his heart on his sleeve most of the time - his distaste for the ideology is always to the fore. He neglects to examine the confusion and fear of many older people when communism collapsed. The pace means that some human interest stories are passed over or only briefly visited - The basement in Ekaterinberg, Stalins body in the mausoleum, Khruschevs' fall from power, etc. But this leaves you with the desire to investigate these areas further. He is especially interesting and illuminating about the events of 1917 - the sequence of events are explained brilliantly.A good read and a good place to start."},{"Title":"The Russian Century: A Photographic History of Russia's 100 Years","review":"It is such a pleasure to read a historical book written in a seamlessly free flowing language. It happens so seldom. Most historians are bogged down in dusty acadmic phrase jargon. Moynahan is mainly a journalist with a keen eye for wondrous detail and bizarr events. Those absurd details makes this book since on the whole it is written with brave, broad brush strokes. It is a perfect first book for people wishing to know more about Russia, wanting to taste its flavour. But because of its magnificent summing up of apocalyptic decade after apocalyptic decade in that country's recent past it is also an intriguing read for slavophiles. It is literary rather than academic and that is the magnificence of it all, Moynahan has turned Russian modern history into poetry and tragedy of Homerian proportions."},{"Title":"The Russian Century: A Photographic History of Russia's 100 Years","review":"I wanted to buy a big-size book with photographs, which make it so fascinating, instead I got a small-size paperback.

The Bolshevik Revolution through Stalin's reign is solid, while the 60s-90s period is given only a brief glance.Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone looking to know \\"just the basics\\" of 20th century Russia.

Not a moment, not a word wasted in \\"Evil Angel\\". In twenty-four fast moving chapters, Larson weaves a web of mystery, horror, love, and passion not to be easily forgotten.Hillary goes to Aspen in search of healing. Jack seeks respite from a violent relationship. The mighty hand of fate throws them together in an unforgettable journey that covers the full emotional spectrum. The author writes with conviction, and authority, as her pen dashes from one end of that gamut to the other. And the ski slopes of Aspen will never be the same, as they become the playground for a game of horror when the Evil Angel comes out to play.With stark, graphic honesty, RD Larson, gives life to characters whose malevolence seem so real, as to raise absolutely no doubt in the reader's mind. Each explicit moment described is vital to their subsequent actions, and we come to know them as they really are.Larson shows endless versatility and deep knowledge of her subject. She gets the reader right into the psychology of her characters. Right into their deepest and darkest feelings. Her range will take us from the purely nave to horrifying slaughter. At the end, her writing genius will not leave us thinking this is a simple question of \`good guys', vs \`bad guys'. Rather, Larson guides us to raise our own questions about the reality of evil minds, misguided souls, and dysfunctional lives.The shear pace of \\"Evil Angel\\" is breathtaking. From the dark moments conjured by the mind of a tortured soul, to the lightness of love, from cruel revenge, to the touch of passion, from mystery to discovery, this book does not stop. Not even at the end, when Larson's magic pen leaves us wanting more.RD Larson is one of my favorite writers. I literally couldn't put this book down.

Well, actually, the foreplay, because Terri Hamilton, the homicidal maniac egged on by her evil angel, is mostly into titillation, and even the saner people -- her soon-to-be ex-husband Jack and his new flame Hilary -- can't get much beyond foreplay before Terri breaks in to spoil their tryst.

Continuing on to Tahiti and the savage Solomon islands, Jack and his determined &quot;Snarkites&quot; encounter natives, tribal chieftains, missionaries, and overcome their problems with incredible persistence and naivete as only some of the first white people to enter these areas could possess.Incidentally, the &quot;cook&quot; on this voyage was the famous photographer and world explorer Martin Johnson who was picked to go on his very first adventure by a letter to Jack advertising his thirst for travel. With his wife Osa, he would years later revisit the Solomons for the purpose of photographing cannibalism before embarking on their epic photographic safaris in Africa and Borneo. Jack only mentions Martin in passing during &quot;the Cruise&quot;, perhaps sensing some literary and photographic competition that he would encounter later.This book is a great shelf companion to Martin's &quot;Through the South Seas with Jack London&quot;, upon which he began his great series of travel books. &quot;The Cruise&quot; gives Jack's viewpoint as the sponsor of the trip, and an established literary giant. Whereas Martin's opinions on the racial makeup of the islanders are quite bigoted and reflect the prevailing views of the turn of the century, Jack is more open-minded, and willing to point out the failings of the white race in adapting to these island paradises.&quot;The Cruise&quot; is a great non-fiction book, among few others by London such as &quot;the Abyss&quot; that tell of his adventures and opinions first-hand as they happen. It truly captures his sarcastic yet hopeful perspective of himself and the whole concept of adventure."},{"Title":"The cruise of the Snark,","review":"If you are travelling to Hawaii or any Polynesian destination, then make this book one of your companions.

Bay being from the Bay area and I truely related to this story and since the Snark was being built by Jack London right before the 1906 quake. It amazed me and invariably he got taken advantage of by the various builders which led to some precarious sailing manuevers since they measured wrong on one side. Which Jack London didn't find out until out at sea. I could picture all the island stops and so enjoyed the old photos that were put into the Snark truly an interesting journey. It was interesting to me hearing of the staph infections were attacking the individuals when the crew would cut themselves and then end up with these sores they knew nothing about and how they had to heal themselves with virtually no medicines on board. This book is a captain's log which he wrote in daily. If your a sailor you'll love it or even if you've been exposed as I have you'll enjoy it, especially if you happen to be from the Bay area. I recommend it as an interesting and enjoyable read though at times I did feel he was just writing to keep his checks coming in to pay for his journey.Sebastopolian Reader"},{"Title":"The cruise of the Snark,","review":"In 1907 Jack London departed San Francisco for a trip around the world. For this voyage he commissioned the construction of a 45-foot yacht he dubbed the Snark. Taking along his wife Charmian, a small crew, a library of books, and a typewriter, he set off for the South Pacific. Along the way he wrote the series of articles that make up this book.I have read most of Jack London's works, and this is one of my least favorites. Given the subject matter, you'd think this account would be loaded with exciting adventures, but much of the book lacks interest. Essentially it's a series of essays about an aging millionaire and his wife who travel around the world on their yacht. Everywhere they go they're treated like visiting dignitaries. It's a far cry from the gritty, perilous exploits one finds in London's fiction. Many of the chapters concentrate on the mundane, technical aspects of the seafaring life. This detracts from the more worthwhile discussions of the exotic destinations that were visited. There are a few good pieces of travel writing here and there. London learns to surf at Waikiki, visits the leper colony of Molokai, and encounters a prototypical American hippie in Tahiti. In the Marquesas he visits the sight of Herman Melville's Typee, but instead of finding a thriving civilization of noble savages he finds an abandoned jungle sprinkled with a few sickly inhabitants. This letdown is indicative of the book as a whole. In The Cruise of the Snark, the romance of the South Seas proves to be a disappointing illusion.If you happen to be a sailor or a boat enthusiast you may enjoy this book more than the average reader. The text is peppered with sailing jargon, and at times London details his nautical maneuvers to the point of tedium. Resolving to teach himself celestial navigation en route, he devotes a few chapters to his trial and error in this arcane craft, which will bore the tears out of the typical landlubber. Sailing a small craft on the open ocean for months on end is a daring feat, but most likely the greatest peril faced by the travelers on this voyage was the possibility of getting lost in the empty seas due to a mathematical error on the part of the author.The original edition contained over 100 photos London took during the trip. Though he was a skilled photographer, in the printed editions I've seen the images are too small and murkily reproduced to be of much value. These photos are absent from the Kindle edition, but they're no great loss.Jack London wrote many excellent books, both fiction and nonfiction. The Cruise of the Snark is not one of them, and should not be high on your reading list. If you're looking for South Pacific adventure, I would suggest his short story collections On the Makaloa Mat and South Sea Tales."},{"Title":"The cruise of the Snark,","review":"I've recently arrived back in the USA from Suva and Nadi in Fiji, one of Jack's stopping points.However, what he describes about the South Pacific is no more.London's South Pacific was affected by European trade and commerce. For one thing, disease, in an era when its prevention was primitive, was rife and the inhabitants of the islands he visited were dropping like flies. Today, of course, the very same network has brought modern medicine and the major health threat to natives in the South Pacific is obesity: the only restaurant on Victoria Parade in Suva, allowed Sunday hours, was McDonald's, while Singh's Curry Shop had to close (I recommend the latter, around the corner from McDonald's on Gordon Street: try the goat curry).London's natives were partly pagan. Today, ordinary people in Oceania are mostly fundamentalist Christian, and, in Suva, there is also a streak of Islam, petering out far to the west of Indonesia but echoing in the afternoon call of the Muezzin in Suva.The fundamentalism means that the yachtsman is well-advised on shore to dress modestly. Of course, London and his wife did this naturally, long ago. I actually saw an Australian man warn a woman in shorts in Suva to put knickers on lest one of the local Methodists or Moslems be offended.But any myth of escape has been so commodified in the South Pacific by tavern owners and tourist companies as to be sour and bitter to the taste.London, while asserting his property rights thoughtlessly at Oakland's wharf, and while assuming he had the right to hire men to work on his boat and judge their hard work in print, also assumed, in the South Pacific, his right to wander at will.Today, as the Rough Guide to Fiji advises the tourist, 85% of the land in Fiji is owned fee simple by chiefs. Sir Arthur Gordon decided not to repeat America's dispossession of the Indians and covenanted with the lads in Fiji in such a way that today, the natives form a land-owning aristocracy.Their fair-mindedness (as on display from Steve Rabuka who backed down from being a military dictator) means that other lads from other mobs have rough civic equality.London was the prototype, however, of the colonialist as rugged individual whose humanity is based on the unconscious deprivation of others' humanity.London was the prototype of the soured Yank who when a lad thought the best of people, without a dime to his name, who now has everything, and thinks the worst of people.London with a grin repeats texts from the hundreds of letters he received from individuals who wanted to sign on to the Snark and so escape their own lives of quiet desparation in an America already unbearable for the average city-dweller. Like him they yearned for a clean-limbed life but unlike London they lacked cash.London essentially uses their texts to pad out a book that was obviously written not from the heart but to raise cash for a silly boat.Any yachtsman knows in his heart of hearts that if the landlubber wants his experience, he has only to stand in a cold shower tearing up 100 dollar bills. The Snark was an expensive lark and, like modern yachts, unconsciously offensive at both its sharp end (where were the natives, giving London gifts and dying like flies) and its blunt end (where were the American laborers whose work London disrespects because it was not finished on his schedule).The South Seas are overrun, today, by people who really ought to be paying more taxes back home. I traveled out there to work at global rates and learned much more about the REAL South Seas than any tourist might, and I'm afraid that Joe Conrad, who also worked for a living, in The Heart of Darkness is more reliable on the tropics than old Jack London.I'm afraid that London saw, what he wanted to see: the Gilded Age struggle of man against man. However, as Hannah Arendt points out in The Origins of Totalitarianism, this defines rather a culture of hatred out of which were form racialist identities. London was for the most part free of any special form of racism but he did believe that Socialism was impossible because Alpha males (like Wolf Larsen) would take what they need.Well, they might, and they do. Nonetheless, in the South Seas and elsewhere, Beta males and women continue some how to achieve more, and of more lasting value, by working in groups. Sir Arthur Gordon is forgotten save in Suva, because unlike Cecil Rhodes he failed to mind his own press-agentry but it appears he did lasting good with his land-tenure scheme.London never learned the limits of his world view and his darkest book, Alcoholic Memories, is a testament to London's limitations.My favorite yachtsman remains good old Tristan Jones, a British sailor who was trained in the Royal Navy and who paid his dues. Tristan would like me arrive back, from the back of beyond, without a dime and go willingly to work while living willingly in a doss-house. Tristan dragged his own boat across the Mato Grosso and talked back to tinpot Fascists in Stroessner's Paraguay.In my experience it is relatively easy to learn the mechanics of a sailing boat but what is hard is endurance, not only of Nature but the Other. London endured Nature but has a tendency to be impatient in print with others, as shown by his insenstive near-mockery of applicants for service on his boat. Jones, on the other hand, mocks only people who deserve it, like customs agents in Paraguay.We lack Tristan Jones' spirit in America with the result that the Third World is overrun with the worst of us, whining yachtsmen and CIA agents and their trophy wives. London I fear was despite his genuine greatness of soul a prototype for the worse that came later."},{"Title":"The Memory Room: A Novel","review":"Most novels are content to follow a basic pattern of beginning, middle, end. Occasionally, very occasionally, a novel will come along that redefines the form. Mary Rakow's \\"The Memory Room\\" is a striking example. Yes, there is a plot, there is a back story, but these things, effective as they are, matter less than Rakow's pure inventiveness with language, thought, image - all the tools at our command with which we communicate.This book takes the kind of risks that reward readers who care about writing. The story transcends its particulars to express a universal desire in us all: the desire to be recognized, to recognize ourselves, and become more whole. If that sounds ponderous, don't be mistaken. This is, as the phrase goes, a good read."},{"Title":"The Memory Room: A Novel","review":"This book is simply brilliant. The author uses poetic phrases to describe a childhood too horrific to remember. But through it all, comes music as a balm for the wounded soul, comes phrases of poetry and the poetry of the King James Bible as she calls on psalms for redemption. The music of Rakow's language is startling and beautiful. The journey she takes with her psychiatrist is extremely moving and very real. At times I found myself re-reading a passage just for the aesthetics of a phrase. Other times I found myself too caught in the pain and so had to leave the book for a short time. Always, though, I returned to find out how Barbara found her way to healing. I tasted the beautiful words through the salt of my tears and remembered Sylvia Plath. This author should receive highest awards for this wonderfully-written story and her memorable characters. Anyone who loves beautiful language will be thrilled with this book."},{"Title":"The Memory Room: A Novel","review":"You've never read a book quite like The Memory Room--how could you? Where could you? It's a novel where every line resonates like a gunshot in an empty house. Pow! Pow! the sheer brilliance. What does this woman not know? Music, art, sorrow, abuse, nature, beauty, love. Terror and redemption. It's not a novel, it's a symphony, it plays the reader like music.A woman, a professor, has a breakdown and through a creative and sensitive therapy, struggles with the growing knowledge of the horrors of her childhood--abuse literally beyond comprehension. Yet what might, in pedestrian hands been a Sybil or Three Faces of Eve, a 'therapy book,' an 'abuse book', becomes in Rakow's a great work of art, couched in this compressed explosive language, and its context of the other offerings of humanity. Rakow's use of holocaust poet Paul Celan's work as a touchstone for her character sets precisely the right tone for this book.What I liked was that it wasn't really the therapy per se which saves the protagonist, but the tools of civilization that the character has at her disposal, her deep resonance with music and art and the metaphors of her Catholic faith. Therapy simply provided the safe-room in which the character could examine and reassemble herself.

I eagerly await her next book."},{"Title":"The Memory Room: A Novel","review":"Although written in a compelling, poetic style, The Memory Room, by Mary Rakow(Counterpoint Press, 2002) is a classic if unintended presentation of how recovered memorytherapy can ruin someone's life. The novel rests on the idea that memories of horrendoustraumatic events can be \\"repressed\\" or \\"dissociated,\\" and that people can then recall themyears later as adults -- a concept that is contrary to the science of memory or common sense,as I revealed in my book, Victims of Memory.In The Memory Room, Barbara's life falls apart as she supposedly remembers how her motherheld her down while her father stuck hot dental tools into her ... when she was four yearsold. With her therapist's help and support, Barbara also comes to believe that she recalledbeing burned by her mother on a stovetop when she was a preverbal toddler. She alsorecovered memories of her father raping her 7-year-old sister and younger brother and buryingher, Barbara, in a hole under the house, allowing her to breathe through straws. She onlyremembered all of this as an adult. Not only did Barbara repress all these horrors, but so didher father! He apparently didn't remember any of it either.Reader, be warned. This is not how memory works, and therapists who believe in suchmassive repression are dangerous. People do not forget years of traumatic events -- theyremember them all too well. \\"It must be that infants come equipped with a code,\\" Rakow'sheroine observes on page 413. \\"Locked in the chromosomes.... Ready to record the marks ofa predator. Timeless. Infallible.\\" This is garbage. People don't remember anything beforethe age of three, and little before five. Memories are not held \\"infallibly\\" in your mind orbody from any age. Memory is subject to reconstruction and distortion, particularly insuggestive therapy (esp. under hypnosis), and we do not remember everything that everhappened to us.It is difficult for me to believe that this endorsement of harmful pseudoscience was publishednow that recovered memory therapy has been thoroughly debunked, and it is extremelydistressing that all of the reviews are glowing. The writing may be good, but the message isridiculous. The only realistic thing about the book is how this kind of therapy harms insteadof heals. Barbara becomes an agoraphobic who destroys her beloved cello, cuts off all herhair, and cannot work. I am surprised she didn't begin to cut herself, which is often aconsequence of such therapy."},{"Title":"The Memory Room: A Novel","review":"I really don't know where to begin in praising this book -- it's simply one of the most moving, insightful, and intelligently constructed works I've ever had the pleasure to read. The author has utilized multiple foundations and techniques -- the poetry of Paul Celan, the Psalms, the structure of the Mass, as well as her own luminous prose and poetry -- to convey the story of her narrator in such a way as to place it inside the hearts and souls of her readers. Combining all of these elements is risky -- but Mary Rakow has pulled it off with incredible skill, leaving us with a work that is both riveting and revelatory, compelling in the deepest way.Despite the title, THE MEMORY ROOM is more about coming to grips with pain -- in one's life and in the world at large -- and putting it in its place alongside the things that are beautiful in this life. There are many images in the novel of this dichotomy -- Barbara, the narrator, keeps a self-bound scrapbook of them to remind her. One of the most poignant is a clipping she has saved showing a photograph of a cellist playing in the street in Sarajevo (from p.32): 'Every afternoon at four o'clock, in full concert dress, mortar and machine-gun fire, his folded chair, silk tails falling to the dusty road. A requiem for the dead.' In the picture, to the left, sits a woman, watching the cellist, holding a baby that she doesn't even realize is dead, the shock and horror of her existence having numbed her to such an extent that she is unaware. In this scene, as in the world, beauty and horror exist side by side.Barbara remembers horrific details -- more focused as the story progresses -- of unbelievably cruel abuse at the hands of both her father and her mother. Her older sister and her younger brother suffered as well. Through the course of the book, we see her grapple with this pain, with the meaning that it has in relation to her life. She is lucky to find a gentle, caring therapist -- one who appears to be in no way manipulative or controlling -- who provides the safe atmosphere which is necessary for her to conduct her healing. Make no mistake about it -- that healing is something that each survivor must do for themselves. There is no magic wand. Barbara expresses time and again that she knows her healing must come from within.There are many frustrations that she experiences along this road. Her faith -- she has converted to Catholicism as an adult -- which was once her foundation, has been found by her to be cracked. She has more of a problem with the Church than with God -- on p.288, she says to a priest, a friend: \\"If the Church fails to address pain, then it is useless to me.\\"Barbara states a truth that many hold, that children intuitively know when they are being abused or mistreated, that their greatest defense mechanism, their subconscious, puts up a wall to protect them, so that they can return and deal with a pain they cannot understand later in life, when they have the tools and emotions with which to confront it. When the abuse is occuring, their mind colors it -- and their world -- in a way they can accept and understand. On p. 182, she says: '...in this way you leave behind the world in the condition you expect it to be. Because, even as a child, you refuse to live where cruelty outnumbers kindness. Because even as a child, you demand a moral order. And you create it if it cannot be found'.Her experiences have left her afraid of almost everything in life -- of love, of touch, of sharing, even of joy. She is uplifted by simple things, each one a potential epiphany. On p.131, she experiences a rain shower: 'I feel the rain cover me, like always, since childhood. It comes down on my bare skin saying, \\"Stop, Barbara. Feel this. Fell how touch can be\\".' Her joy in rediscovering seemingly simple beauties such as this is made palpable by Rakow's writing -- and we rediscover these simple beauties along with her.Barbara is a musician -- a cellist -- who is unable even to enjoy the beauty of music during much of the novel. She destroys her beloved cello by throwing it over a balcony at her home. As her healing and self-discovery progress, however, we see her ability to appreciate the beauty of music, to revel in it, to allow it to balance the horrible things in life, return. She finally reaches a point where she recognizes it as one of the things that can allow her to save herself.There are many aspects of this work that those readers who are survivors themselves might find to be triggering -- but this can be a helpful thing, allowing them to take further steps in dealing with the pain that has made an attempt to control their lives. The book is, I think, ultimately, one of the most uplifting works I have seen on this -- or any -- subject. It is an involving, sensitive, intelligent portrayal of the strength and the triumph of the human spirit.I must respectfully disagree with another reviewer below -- I don't believe that the concept of repressed memory, or of recovered memory therapy, has been completely debunked or rejected by either the medical community or those who have found invaluable help there. I thought that the therapist depicted in the novel was supportive rather than controlling -- and, as I stated earlier, Barbara herself states unequivocably that her healing must come from within, that it must be her own work. I got the impression also from the story that her memory was there before she sought therapy -- her therapist was not portrayed as having coached her or convinced her of anything other than her own strength. It is that universal inner strength that the victim must access in order to become a survivor, to allow beauty and love and trust back into their shattered lives."},{"Title":"The Memory Room: A Novel","review":"The first time I read this book, I was struck by her suffering, I could not bear to read it all. With about a fourth of the book left, I skipped to the end and read it backwards. Glad for an ending that seemed hopeful. This time I read the book normally, knowing what would happen and not as worried for an end I couldn't read.The poetry in this book traces out a past that almost feels like it could be mine. Yours. Any readers. I read a review of this book where the reader complained that memory does not work this way. That the story is ridiculous for it's portrayal of repressed memories. I don't know the truth of that, and I don't care to. This book is not about repressed memories as much as it is about confronting our fears. Reaching deep inside of ourselves, through all sorts of darkness, to find whatever hope and love and beauty that we can.This book is beautiful. It is entirely characterized by this quotation: \\"A conspiracy of language gently bending my perception in a more hopeful arc.\\" I found hope in this book.It reminded me to focus on the things that I love rather than the things that I fear. The first time I read it, I needed that reminder very badly. Today, I'm just glad to once again realize that there is a great deal of beauty in the world."},{"Title":"The Memory Room: A Novel","review":"Mary Rakow alters my mind as few recent writers have done.I am caught in her epic pilgrimage through the nonlinear stations of her protagonist Barbara's psychic crucifixion, and haunted by her ability to ultimately create such a profound whole from so many shards of stained glass.Her journey back to meaning from the state of utter collapse with which the novel begins is heroic from psychological and spiritual perspectives alike.The story she tells, punctuated with the poetry of Paul Celan and the high art of communicating via white space on the page, transcends its manifest content: a woman's personal holocaust and its aftermath.Rakow presents more than words; she deals in moments, in breaths, in the spaces between unconscious experience and conscious recognition.Hers is the search for the unthought known.She has given us more than a book; it is an epiphany."},{"Title":"The Memory Room: A Novel","review":"Nothing makes my interior glow more than discovering great writing or great music all by my lonesome. However, I like to be an early discoverer, not a member of a secret society.\\"The memory room\\" would have been my greatest reading experience of last year, if my list had not included Lonesome Dove and a reread of The Brothers Karamazov. What astounds me, and what I have told my writers group and anyone else who will listen, is that this is the kind of book I should deeply dislike.From a craft perspective, Rakow expertly combines poetry and prose. This is dangerous, difficult territory for a writer and I can't think of anyone that has pulled it off so successfully.What one might suspect of being a long, boring, interior, reflective tome on yet another psychologically battered woman is anything but. It is true that all the male characters are either weak, despicable (the father, the priest), or wholly subservient to the women characters. But in the case of The Memory Room, there is nothing canned, cliche, or disposable about these males. They are properly drawn through the exploration and psychological discovery and trauma work-through process that Barbara has undertaken.Religion, morality, art, and music (Barbara is a cellist) are front and center in this novel. It is almost unbearable what Barbara does with her cello, just as how the priest reacts to her \\"discovery\\" is unbearable. Yet these elements, to me, triumph, albeit in a completely different form.There are passages for interpretation in this book that MFA programs could offer whole course credits for. Two are: \\"The earth exhales music because it wants to be holy,\\" and \\"And in this way, you leave behind the world in the condition you expect it to be. Because even as a child, you demand a moral order. And you create it if it cannot be found.\\"Yet from the unspeakable horror visited on this narrator as a child comes hope and perhaps this is the strength of the work. Hope lives, even within all of the elements that once created despair in this woman's life. The world isn't necessarily a better place for Barbara, but your world is because of her and her creator. It is as if Rakow, through Barbara's work-through and willlingness to undergo the pain involved, is offering a unique sense of salvation to all of us.On the one hand, I want The memory Room to be the discovery I share with my friends. I want the singular reward of having turned them on to this powerful novel. I want this book to remind the people that I know that I make the effort to find treasures like this in darkest recesses of mass-marketed entertainment. It is only for pure selfishness that I can justify why Mary Rakow isn't being hailed as the next great deliverer of extraordinary literary fiction."},{"Title":"The Memory Room: A Novel","review":"Briefly, the beautiful and courageous writing outway theterrifying details and 'memory' the book leaves the reader"},{"Title":"The Memory Room: A Novel","review":"Mary Rakow in the novel,The Memory Room, explores in an amazingly graceful literary style which is both poetic and prosaic, the journey toward recovery of a woman with repressed memory. The main character, Barbara, is a professor of theology, and is experiencing a mental breakdown because of sudden awareness of repressed memories. What I loved is the way Ms. Rakow used the poetry of Paul Celan and the wonderful psalms from the bible to further enhance her wonderful writing. At first glance, I was not sure of the novel's form, as I am not used to reading a novel in both verse and prose forms, though I do love poetry. But Ms. Rakow's style is so accessible as well as compelling, I found it a fast read. I would recommend this book to anyone who appreciates a literary style near perfection as well as a compelling plot. The reader is in suspense until the end. I think Ms. Rakow has accomplished the rare feat of writing a suspenseful novel which is also an artistic gem. reader Los angeles Ca."},{"Title":"The Memory Room: A Novel","review":"I loved this book! First of all, the writing is exquisite -- poetic, compelling, restrained. The novel's pace strikes the perfect note. Rakow's masterful interweaving of poetry and prose, of religion, psychology and art, serves the story well and mercifully prevents the subject of childhood abuse from sinking into the grotesque or sensational. Rather, it brings it to a level of universality, and moves the reader to compassion.This is a breathtaking masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Memory Room: A Novel","review":"I was so surprised by the Memory Room.

I have neither knowledge of nor experience with childhood horrors or abuse such as the narrator survived. Moreover, I have no interest in such subjects. But to read a work as memorable and uplifting as this is an experience I cannot forget. Rakow's work defies classification. Poetry? YesDrama? By all means. A love story. Yes, again. A tragedy transforming what could have been simply a victim's chronicle of evil and unspeakable acts.I was transfixed by the narrator who creates her world all over again; creates a world for herself of unimaginable beauty and hope.I thought of Barbara (the narrator) as the woman of Wallace Stevens 'who knew there was never a world for her, except the one she sang and singing made.' And an unforgettable lyric it is.For Barbara, it is the beauty and power of art, of music, of language--not therapy cliches--that transform her suffering and loss.

It had a good point or two, but also a bunch of negatives.The storyline was pretty interesting. It's very \\"military\\", lots of twists and turns. It was a well-thought storyline, easy to follow and it kept me reading. One issue I had with the whole plot though was what I call \\"author assumption\\": the author assumes we, as readers, should know something, when we don't. She refers to real-life military scandals of the past simply by name, but doesn't summarize them at all for those of us who don't know them. So I was pretty lost on those references.As for the romance...I didn't care for it all that much. It wasn't, in a lot of ways, a very romantic book in the standard sense. Up until they end, I think Ellen and Jim share maybe two kisses. There's a sex scene at the end, but it wasn't written that well, and it seemed kind of plopped in there, and ill-fitting.Aside from that, I just didn't buy into the romance. It was too...pretty. Ellen and Jim are always thinking or saying things like \\"you're so wonderful\\", \\"you bring the sun back into my life\\" and things like that. It was just too perfect and didn't seem realistic. Added to that, Ellen most of the time seemed to think of Jim as \\"Cochrane\\", which just seemed very impersonal.The characters were very two-dimensional. Almost everything about them, and the book as a whole, was about the plot itself. While, yes, the plot is important, but if you're gonna develop a romance, you're characters need some meat.

I also found that Ellen and Jim were a little flat and their romance lacking. Jim was a little too \\"hillbilly\\" for me.

SILENT WITNESS is no different, with its mix of intriguing characters, a thrilling story line, and ever-growing passion.Agent Ellen Tanner is a redhead who likes long denim skirts, loose blouses, Birkenstock sandals, and dangly earrings. She's also a licensed psychotherapist, not to mention employed by the Office of Inspector General in the Department of Defense. Until recently, she's resided in Washington, D.C., but now she's in California-and assigned to work with JAG Lieutenant Jim Cochrane. The Pentagon came up with the idea of using OIG agents to help out snowed-under JAG agents who are short-staffed and buried under work. With her new one-year assignment in California, Ellen is now the partner of Lt. Cochrane-a man who clearly sees her as nothing but the newest pain in his rear end.Jim Cochrane doesn't want help. He doesn't need it. Well, he might need it a little, because he is buried under piles of work. But now that he's saddled with a new partner-who just happens to be a woman, not to mention a civilian-he's less than pleased. As his drawl gets thicker and his height seems to increase, he's determined to do everything within his power to get this over with as quickly as possible. It might have worked, too, if it wasn't for the death of Top Gun instructor Susan Kane.Now Ellen and Jim are working in really close proximity, trying to find a killer. As if Jim's good ole boy demeanor and his obvious disdain of her weren't bad enough, the passion that keeps sparking up between them is driving Ellen mad. Sure, the guy's handsome, but they've got a killer to track, and she has no time-nor desire-to pursue personal relationships. Or so she thought.As these two hard-headed people-one military, one civilian-work together to catch a murderer, the danger becomes more and more real, as does their desire. Will Ellen and Jim find out who killed Susan Kane before the danger gets too close?Ms. McKenna has done an excellent job once again of combining military suspense with romance, and the result is a winner in SILENT WITNESS."},{"Title":"Silent Witness","review":"Lindsey McKenna has written a lively deeply disturbing look at the fate of women in the military.

Thus Jungian psychiatrist Agent Ellen Tanner, whose spouse died just over a year ago, leaves DC to work for one year at the San Diego naval Station. Her senior partner, divorced Lieutenant Jim Cochrane fails to hide his scorn that he does not want to mentor Ellen.They are assigned to assist the SDPD on an investigation into the homicide of Top Gun flight instructor Susan Kane; the brass worries about a media nightmare having their top female pilot murdered. As they enter the crime scene Jim remains hostile to his student until she becomes nauseous upon seeing the corpse; he becomes caring and nurturing. As they work the case together and he teaches her the tools to a successful investigation, they fall in love. However, he still burns from his ex-wife leaving him and taking their daughter with her; while Ellen still grieves her loss. This is one romance that looks like it will never leave the tarmac.The romance takes a back seat to the prime pilot, the terrific military (enhanced by the local cops) police procedural. Jim may pretend to be a Missouri hillbilly, but he is obviously sharp and his educating Ellen, provides the audience with a fantastic insight to the case. Ellen augments his findings with her Jungian psychological skill at classifying people.

Some of the newest concepts have really improved performance and speed in which data can be found and retrieved. Some of this concepts include function based indexes, bitmap index, partitioning, parallel queries, and optimization hints. The basic starting permise is to make sure your system has enough memory and hardware processing speed. Two branches of thought have emerged when focusing on performance improvement: improved system tuning and improved Optimizer decisions. The Oracle DBA must become familar with how to tune operating system performance and database performance. Some of the valuable indicators are data cache hit ratios, Disk I/O activity, library cache, buffer hit ratios, and shared pool memory. Various views, scripts, tools, and data tables give the DBA insight into how the database is performing. It is safe to assume the database will grow and performance will vary from time to time. By monitoring and adjusting parameters the Oracle database can achieve relative performance to growth. If performance drops add more hardware or change object schema designs to reflect the data loads. Oracle has offered two amazing database architectures: dedicated server and Multiple Transaction Server. Each architecture has its advantages. From a developer's view performance of the schema objects are important, such as, tables, views, indexes, and PL/SQL. The Optimizer evaluates system statistics to decide how to retrieve data, whether it be by full table scans, index range scans, or join table sorts. Each type of index should be evaluated: single indexes, multiple field indexes, partitioned indexes, bitmap indexes, and function indexes. In some cases, it will make sense to use bitmap indexes for data that is relatively static. In other cases it will make sense to use function based indexes where data search on alpha data is complex. Yet in another case it will make sense to use a partitioned index where the data tables have been spread over multiple partition sectors and datafiles. Sometimes usage of indexes is not need and full tables scans are better. The developer uses the optimizer execution plan to see how the data will be retrieved. At first the execution plan may seem confusing, but understanding Oracle database architecture will make the plan readable. I've personally found that keeping the database statistic current and using oracle hints (ordered,index,and parallel) provided the best return on my performance improvements. Table joins is another critical area of performance tuning to grasp. There are a number of join types: nested loops, sort merge, cluster, hash, and index. The optimizer decides which type of join to use based on statistics and available indexes and constraints. The helpful advice, I can give you for purchasing this book is that there are PL/SQL optimization techniques to consider. One I found helpful was to use Packaged procedure calls from triggers rather than putting the PL/SQL code to execute in the trigger. I recommend adding this book to your library."},{"Title":"Oracle SQL High-Performance Tuning (2nd Edition)","review":"Information in this book is out-of-date and the techniques used are too simple.

They may find that their SQL statement will execute very fast in testing environment because the number of records there is 1/10 time of the production, they need to do is to deliver the programs on time and the output of the program is corrected. Performance issue is not their major concern. After the completion of the program development, a big problem relating to performance issue will be unveiled in load test or volume test, much more effort and money will be spent in performance tunning because of bad SQL statements.

Guy Harrison (well named) is expert on tuning SQL, and knows how to write about it in a way that makes it easy for you to benefit.Besides giving you lots examples of how SQL and PL/SQL can work well, Guy shows you how to use the tools (explain plan, SQL*Trace, Tkprof) that let you know when you are getting close. Actually, he points out that you need to set performance goals early on, and keep testing to see if you are on track; if you don't do that early, it may be too late when you realize you need help. One of my favorite sections is on tuning joins and sub-queries and the accompanying graph showing 197,664 block gets if you do it wrong (wrong index), and 45 if you do it right (using pl/sql instead of correlated subqueries).The title of this review aside, Guy has good sections on tuning an instance, looking at instance settings and hardware, that can be helpful if you get the application working well and still have slow response times, but most of the chances to have an application that works are available during planning and development, and this book defintely helps there.

Not just the trivial examples for syntax diagrams, Mr. Harrison demonstrates the discipline required of tuning, performance testing, data gathering and analysis.My copy has pages 59-61 and is just about error-free. I suppose it may be possible that the word &quot;select&quot; may have been mis-spelled somewhere, but if you get stuck on that, you've probably got bigger problems that need to be dealt with before buying this book.Who is it that writes those negative reviews; a competitive author or just someone with a brain-fart?

It provides solid, easy to follow examples. The flaw in this book is that it just provides 'techniques' for improving performance. It's basically a book that is useful for trial and error SQL tuning.When tuning SQL you should think in terms of sets and essentially 'What can I do to make the optimizer do the least work?' This book does not teach you to do that. I've yet to see one book that does. It also only discusses response time. Response time is an ends and is not a means in SQL tuning. By reducing the amount of work Oracle has to do, you improve response time.There is one serious inaccuracy in this book. I emailed the author about this and he did not respond. The author states that you can improve response time of updates, by wrapping them inside of a PL/SQL cursor. This is not only inaccurate, it's not even close. Not only does it take twice as long in Oracle 8i(slightly less in 9i), but it also increases logical I/Os significantly. How something this inaccurate could be missed in a major publication astounds me. To be fair, the 8i version of Steven Fuersteins PL/SQL book has the same inaccuracy(I have not read the 9i version).The rest of the book seems accurate. I recommend it, but beware that inaccuracy.

Like the title suggests, it teaches Oracle database and SQL statement performance tuning rules, strategies and tips. However, it also dips into other valuable topics like principles of indexing, explaining the ever-mysterious tkprof output, configuring and tuning the database server itself, and listing other resources to fill the void of Oracle documentation.This book and Fuerstein's PL/SQL programming book have become standard issue for all developers on our project."},{"Title":"Oracle SQL High-Performance Tuning (2nd Edition)","review":"I do a lot of SQL tuning for Oracle. This book is the best book I have read in this subject. It is not bias, it is clear, easy to understand, with good practical examples. It is written for a truly expert in Oracle SQL tuning. Using plain english the author explains a lot of concepts that are fundamental for a successful SQL tuning effort. I read the 1st edition more than once, and I am reading the 2nd edition for the second time. If you already have the first edition, it is worth to purchase the second edition that has been updated and feeded with additional elements. If you only have the time to read one book in Oracle SQL tuning, this is your book."},{"Title":"Oracle SQL High-Performance Tuning (2nd Edition)","review":"I have read this book cover to cover and more. I have been using this book since 1998 and I still have to say it is good book.It is one of the Oracle Classics. It is a little outdated. If you look at the cover it clearly states it covers to oracle 8i. If you still have 8i databases this is a good book. if you are using 9i and cost based optimization it is still useful but it will not pick up on some of the newer fetures of the CBO. If you use Rule based optimization(RBO) than it is a good book. I had actually used this book as a teaching guide when I use to teach SQL Tuning for an application software company who uses oracle database. I look forward to when the revised version does ship."},{"Title":"Oracle SQL High-Performance Tuning (2nd Edition)","review":"This is a MUST HAVE book if you're writing lots of SQL (in Oracle) and need to make sure it is as efficient as possible. Lots of real-world examples, with side-by-side comparisons of different queries that all produce the same result via different methods. It is easy to apply these techniques in my work. I have six books from Oracle Press, and while they are good as reference material, I find myself using them basically for syntax or server tuning, and never for PL/SQL tuning. Guy Harrison's book is a permanent fixture on my desk; this book covers table access methods, how to avoid unnecessary table scans, how to use TKPROF (with some excellent ratios and things to look for in the output), etc. The list goes on. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who writes SQL (in Oracle) on a daily basis."},{"Title":"Oracle SQL High-Performance Tuning (2nd Edition)","review":"I've been tuning Oracle Applications instances for several customers, this book is the best in its class.

It provides good examples and explains concepts very well."},{"Title":"Oracle SQL High-Performance Tuning (2nd Edition)","review":"This book is vastly superior to 99% of other purported tuning books. This book has saved me huge amounts of time, and assisted me in solving numerous performance problems, with great benefit to myself and my clients.True - there appear to be some minor syntax errors; this only proves that Mr. Harrison is human. I seriously question the credibility of anyone who would call this book not useful. That is simply not a believable statement."},{"Title":"How Start Your Private Investment Partnership","review":"Prospective purchasers should be advised that this work consists of slightly more than 200 pages. The sample agreements/docs consume the last 100 pages while the first 100 provide not much more than an =overview= of pertinent legal issues. At these prices I would have expected more of a compendium. Exacerbating the price issue is the fact that much of the information contained in the book can be obtained =free= of charge from various web sites.In my opinion, the words 'How to Start' tend to mislead. I have serious reservations about anyone not well-versed in the field being able to actually start their own investment partnership (i.e. hedge fund) from the materials presented in this book. This makes me wonder about the target audience. The book will add little, if anything, to the knowledge base of attorneys who work in this area, as well as most other investment professionals. At the same time the work is not sufficiently comprehensive for those interested in accomplishing anything more than learning the basics. With respect to the latter, this book is about as far from the most cost effective means of learning the basics as one can get."},{"Title":"How Start Your Private Investment Partnership","review":"This book would be great at 1/10th of its current price.

For a manual of this price, couldn't the publisher have inserted the new pages prior to shipment? I found this added work frustrating and time consuming.While most of the manual reads like much like a legal textbook as opposed to a practical guide (not many examples), the single sample private placement offering and exhibits were useful. But to be consistent with the loose-leaf, template concept, why wouldn't the publishers have included a diskette of the sample agreement to make implementation easier (again, given the price)"},{"Title":"How Start Your Private Investment Partnership","review":"I found this guide very helpful when I started my private partnership.

His name is Chaim Herzog and he lived through these wars 1948-90's. However this is a overview book that is well written and to the point. It is purely a military history; as in the Jordinians surrounded this city and this unit drove them off. It's not a story based on politics but on battle histories and it includes the raid on the Iraqi nuclear reactor. (Many people wish someone would take out IRAN's nuke program these days; but this is purely history and it moves quickly and each chapter is about various wars in a overview type of writing. But the writing is well done and well researched. The paperback is of course a better deal or you can use your tablet to read this good military history."},{"Title":"To Harass Our People: The IRS and Government Abuse of Power","review":"I first met George Hansen as a college student. Then a congressman from Idaho, his size was as imposing as his character. He was friendly, cordial and cheerful, but as strong on princple as a great religious leader, not a politician. He had the guts to take on the IRS before his time, beleiving no agency of the government was above the law or constitution. It was because of this principle and the audacity to hold hearings that he was convicted of a trumped-up campaign violation, expelled from congress and imprisoned. The charges, even if true, were less serious than the politically connected Geraldine Ferrarro was allowed to plea-bargain into a small fine and keep her position not many years later.

GEEZ! cut the poor book some slak!"},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"About the only excuse I can give for Alan Dean Foster is that he didn't know where Lucas planned to take the SW series, so certain obvious inaccuracies (Vader addressing Luke by &quot;Skywalker,&quot; strength in the Force being measured by the size of the rocks they could lift, the entire concept of the Kaiburr crystal, etc.) can be excused. Aside from that, this book fully deserves the title of &quot;Worst SW book ever written.&quot;The prose alternates between a dry, lifeless husk and melodramatic overkill, the characters are two-dimensional, and those returning from the movie act little or nothing like the characters we know from SW. (The mud-fight scene in particular was so completely out of character for Luke and Leia--though not in the out of character context of this novel--that I threw the book across the room in disgust.)For those who favor empty, pointless plots whose only purpose is to get a quick thrill over the fast-moving, character-driven plots that encompass the trilogy and (for better or worse) most of the novels that followed it, who haven't seen *Star Wars* recently enough to be bothered by the blatant inaccuracies and mischaracterizations, you are more than welcome to this book. For anyone else--it has no bearing whatsoever on any other SW books ever written, so I strongly urge that you spare yourself the trouble."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"This book is essential to make the first three movies make sense.Read this story and then watch the interaction with the three characters from the viewpoint of your new insight and you will say to yourself aha! Clearly the best of any of the star wars books. Hint... The Han Solo books will also give you insight into his character, but they are not nearly as good of a story as \\"Splinter\\"It is also the story that makes \\"Episode I\\" into a bad story."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"The best thing about this book is the cover art in my opinion, and yes I am a huge Star Wars fan. The plot was too simplistic, nothing really interesting happens (who really wants to read about a crystal that contains special powers?) It's been done to death. There's no dramatic space battles- a first for a Star Wars story, no futuristic cities, the original quest of Luke and Leia was never concluded, and the ending is rushed. In general, SOTME is poorly written and nothing to get excited about, it's an adventure, but far from the usual sci fi standard. I was expecting a very exciting climax, but it just fizzled out. The portrayal of Vader was amusing and unrealistic, Alan made him into a big scary boogie man.... Come on, that's pathetic. This is the dark lord of the sith, not some weak villain who gets outsmarted and outdueled by a punk like Luke. This story has nothing to do with the movies, and it was just boring; I couldn't wait for it to be over. It reminded me of the Ewok movies, it contained elements of Star Wars, but it was very shallow. The main thing missing was that the fate of the galaxy was not at stake, there was no sense of desperation to bring down the Empire. Those who gave this book 5 stars are either friends of Alan Dean Foster or are not in highschool yet. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it came out in 78, before our expectations skyrocketed with Empire. I honestly believe a 7 year old could write a better story, how this book ever got published is beyond me, truly awful."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"I was not wild about this book. Apart from the beginning, the entire story takes place on a planet. Luke and Leia are the main characters with Chewy and Han being conspicuously absent. I found the pace of the story to be fairly slow moving and in fact, there was a bit in the middle which I didn't even read because I was getting bored with it. When Vader FINALLY appears in the last couple of chapters [I think he was late because he had been looking for his personality which he seems to have carelessly mislaid, but ultimately had to come on down without it] he is like a cardboard cut-out i.e. one dimensional and not very Vaderish - he even laughs at one point! Indeed, no one seems to be particularly in character. There is a scene where Vader and Luke are lifting rocks using the Force: Vader claims his rock is bigger and therefore, his powers are greater, which called to mind not a Dark Lord of the Sith but, a boastful little boy playing &quot;my father's a policeman&quot;. It was quite ridiculous. On balance I found the entire story disappointing and unlikely. It is completely out of synch with the rest of the Star Wars universe."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"I picked up this book looking to fill in the gaps between episodes. Unfortunately this is the only one between IV and V. At first I had a lot of trouble with the writing style, very bland and boring. Then the author began to throw his own imagination into a plot that was begun by someone else. Luke and Leia act like children and do not show the maturity they did in A New Hope. The authors characters seem to be totally different people. Next with the addition of Luke and Leia's foreplay, I almost couldn't stomach the implications. Even after taking into account that the author did not know where the story was going in later movies, I found his writing style difficult to enjoy due to its simplicity and lack of good character development. If you are looking for a good Star Wars read and not concerned with reading them all, I would suggest skipping over this one because the tone does not fit in with the rest of the saga."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"The best thing about this book is the cover art in my opinion, and yes I am a huge Star Wars fan. Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa travel to a distant planet to recruit new members for the alliance. On the way, they crash on a jungle planet (similar to Dagobah) and get caught up in a search for a crystal that contains special powers (how original). Darth Vader tries to thwart their quest, and a battle ensues. Ok, sounds interesting. First of all, the plot was way too simplistic. Nothing really interesting happens (who really wants to read about a crystal that contains special powers?) It's been done to death. There's no dramatic space battles- a first for a Star Wars story, no futuristic cities, the original quest of Luke and Leia was never concluded, and the ending is rushed. In general, SOTME is poorly written and has nothing to get excited about. It's an adventure, but far from the usual sci fi standard. I was expecting an exciting climax, maybe a few plot twists, or a cool lightsaber duel but it just fizzled out. The portrayal of Vader was amusing and unrealistic, Alan made him into a big scary boogie man that gets hit by blaster fire, shakes his fist at Luke and Leia, then falls into a pit at the end. Come on, that's pathetic. This is the dark lord of the sith, not some weak villain who gets outsmarted and outdueled by a punk like Luke. This story has nothing to do with the movies (obviously) and I find it laughable that this was intended to be the low budget followup to the first movie if ANH failed at the box office.

I do Recommend this seller.Thank you."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"I read this book in 1978, when I was seven years old, and I thought it was terrific. I read it again three years ago, and I still think it's terrific. I'm delighted to see that it's still (back?) in print, because I think it has a heck of a lot more spirit and energy than most of the Star Wars franchise drivel being pumped out nowadays.Reading through the other reviews I see a lot of \\"I liked it a lot, but\\"--followed by some complaint about an inconsistency with the subsequently established Star Wars canon. I know that there's a bit of popular mythology out there that George Lucas had the entire Star Wars series plotted out before he put the first one on celluloid, but I'm here to tell you it ain't so (check out Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays by Laurent Bouzereau for the skinny on this). That is, there was no way for Alan Dean Foster to know that Luke, Leia, and Vader were family, or that Vader was a cyborg under all that armor, or that Leia and Han were going to get romantic, or that Luke would get his lightsaber-wielding butt stomped in the next movie, or that Leia would develop beyond the sarcastic damsel in distress we saw in the first movie.Which is all to say that DESPITE what you read in these other reviews, Foster actually does a pretty terrific job of making this consistent with the characters AS THEY ARE PORTRAYED IN THE FIRST MOVIE. The reason they're different from their portrayals in Empire, Jedi, etc. is that, well, the characterization in the original film was pretty thin. Luke, Leia, Han, Vader--even the droids and Chewbacca--really only developed three dimensional personalities in the second film. So this is a decidedly different Luke and Leia than the ones you're used to, and--swamp planet aside--this doesn't feel like most of the Star Wars that's come since. If the Star Wars that's come since can be compared to Lord of the Rings (epic scope, huge conflict), this is more like one of those original, great Conan novels by Robert E. Howard--well done, fun stuff, but a bit raw.And THAT'S why you should buy it. ..."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"The first novel to take the adventures of Luke Skywalker beyond what we now call Episode IV: A New Hope, &quot;Splinter of the Mind's Eye&quot; drops Luke and Leia onto a primitive jungle planet where the stranded duo must contend with bizarre alien tribesmen, ravenous monsters, labrynthine caves, and roving bands of Imperial stormtroopers--all the while coming ever closer to the romance early Star Wars fans thought was written in the stars. While fleeing the Empire's soldiers, Luke and Leia learn from a Force-sensitive old woman that the backwater planet they've chanced on is home to a mythical crystal that can give its wielder heretofore unimagined power over the Force itself. But Luke and Leia aren't the only ones in on the revelation: the promise of even greater power lures Darth Vader himself, setting up a spell-binding climax including a lightsaber duel that compares favorably with any the films have offered thus far. Naturally, no novel written in '78 can jive with the Star Wars continuity as the movies have developed it since then, but that's not the author's fault. Alan Dean Foster has been of the world's best sci-fi writers for years, and &quot;Splinter of the Mind's Eye&quot; is first class storytelling. Contitnuity nothwithstanding, this is an outstanding and thoroughly entertaining stand-alone novel. What else matters?"},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"This book was the first one authorized by Lucasfilm after the release of Star Wars: A New Hope and it is very good. Alan Dean Foster introduced us to a great sidestory with this and he must have helped many people out back in 1978 by tiding them over till the release of The Empire Strikes Back.The story is interesting enough. Luke and Leia go on a search for the Kaiburr crystal, which is said to make someone indestructible with the Force. Obviously, they have to find it first, to keep it out of the Empire's hands, especially those of Darth Vader.The best part of this book happens to be the best reason to buy this book: Luke's confrontation with Vader. All I'll say is that there is some great foreshadowing in this meeting. Read it and see what I mean.Another interesting thing about this book is that it was written in 1978, so Foster only had the first movie to go on. That makes for some interesting interaction between Luke and Leia. Remember, nobody knew they were related yet.I thoroughly enjoy this book. I'm positive that any Star Wars fan out there would too, so do yourself a favor and buy this excellent book!"},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"Recently re-read SOTME after reading it on its original release in 78. Although the characterizations and story line seem crazy after all the newer accumulated SW lore, I tried to re-read it with the perspective that this was really the only 'expanded universe' we had in 1978.It seems like lots of people have issues with Vader's personality and talents in this book, but keep in mind what we had seen last. Luke had developed force powers strong enough to allow him to guide a torpedo into an un-hittable exhaust port, while Vader had been almost blown away in a surprise attack by Solo's Falcon. We see it now as beginner's luck by Luke and a fury-inducing lapse by an all-powerful Vader, but I think Foster made a pretty logical extension of what we saw at the end of SW.SW fans who weren't alive back then need to remember that not only didn't we know the whole Skywalker family tree, we'd never heard of Coruscant, Palpatine, or Yoda, didn't know the Emperor was a force-powerful Sith, had never seen an AT-AT or a green lightsaber, etc.If you read this from that perspective and pretend you're enjoying a first glimpse at a SW universe outside of what you saw in Ep. 4, you might enjoy it."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"I have to say this was a great book. It is even greater when you relfect on that it was written in 1978! The author had Luke deflect laser blasts, even though that wasn't shown in Star Wars: A New Hope(he only blocked, not deflected).I have read other reviews by other readers saying that they were mad because Leia had no force powers and Luke put himself before everyone else. Well, think about it. You don't discover Leia is Luke's sister until 1983, 5 years later. Luke was not a Jedi, so he could put himself before others and not pull himself to the dark side.Another said they were mad because Vader killed with his lightsaber, not his Force chocking. Well, I have news for you -- Vader never killed anyone with force choke in SW:ANH, he just killed one with a physical choke and another WITH HIS LIGHTSABER!That pretty much sums up my thoughts on this book."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"This is one of my favorite Star Wars books its filled with action, excitement, and adventure. Its the one of the few Star Wars book to feature Luke, Leia and Darth Vader with none of them knowing their relation to each other (Vader may know about Luke but he doesn't know about Leia) they actually have scenes together. That for me makes it the most exciting part. You can see hints towards Leia being Force Sensitive when she duels her father. Sure Vader's just toying with her but she don't know that. Leia does pretty good for someone who doesn't know she has Force abilities anyone else would be dead after Vader toyed with them. I liked how Vader realizes at the end how strong Luke really is and that he really could bring down the Empire. There's also a hint towards Vader knowing C3PO having shut the droid down according to Threepio knowing all of the correct codes to do so. I also liked Luke still interested in Leia because he doesn't know the relation. It would be more weird if after being attracted to her in A New Hope to suddenly become not interested. Luke does realize he would do anything to protect her which I liked and could possibly a hint. Its a great book."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"My opinion of Alan Dean Foster's \\"Splinter of the Mind's Eye\\" gradually got worse as I progressed throughout the novel. It's the very first Star Wars Expanded Universe novel, and at that, it's not bad. It details the adventure of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa between \\"Star Wars (1977)\\" and \\"The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\\" as they search for a mysterious crystal that gives the wielder special powers over the Force; they are aided by two hairy things called Yuzzems, their two faithful droids, and an old woman named Halla. At first as I was reading it, it had a good, classic feel to it. But as the novel went on, things started to hinder it.The book begins with Luke and Leia heading in their X- and Y-Wing spaceships to an underground meeting to secure an alliance, and ship problems are experienced, forcing the two down on the closest planet Mimban. They are stranded there, so they have to get to the nearest station. They come to a small mining town where they meet the eccentric Halla. Off they go to find the Kaiburr crystal to satisfy this woman's desires.... So far so good: the book has distinct characters that are well described--Captain-Supervisor Grammel, Halla, and Leia all have precise personalities, some with which people can connect, but Luke has and always will have the same boyish shallowness. \\"Splinter\\" gets weird in parts where we know from future films that Luke and Leia are brother and sister; the book was written in 1978, one year after the original \\"Star Wars,\\" so the author did not know yet that they're siblings. They seem to fall in love with each other, which is certainly not desirable, but if you're going to read this book, you have to simply accept that it was written before we had any knowledge of Darth Vader's, Luke's, and Leia's biological relations to each other. Creepy, but understandable, love.My opinion of the book thusfar in the plot was four stars out of four. It then gradually made its way down to two and a half out of four as the book kept getting murky in its plot, descriptions, or credibility. When Luke and Leia make their escape from a prison, the two hairy Yuzzem creatures return Luke and Leia's weapons to them. How did the Yuzzem just 'know' which weapons belonged to Luke? There are plenty of weapons held for safe-keeping in a prison; there's no given reason why the two Yuzzem should know that Luke owns a lightsaber that was confiscated from him. Also, as Halla and two fuzzy Yuzzem creatures are running in one direction from a large worm-like creature called a wandrella, Luke and Leia are running in another direction. I had no problem with Luke and Leia's escape from the wandrella, but how old is this Halla woman; how fast can she run? What about See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo; were they being carried by the two Yuzzem, or did they uncover speed never seen in the original \\"Star Wars\\"? I'll never know. I didn't like this part of the book because Foster never gave me a clear picture of what happened.The book is short, but its plot requires it to be even shorter. After already having read through enough adventures in it, we have to read through Luke and Leia's journey through an underground tunnel and across a lake. It only serves to try and make each character a little less shallow, but it just isn't interesting. The monster that they encounter wasn't exactly frightening; it just went away like a harmless bug that you might shoo away at home; though had it been really frightening, it would be just like the wandrella that they encountered before. It got a little more interesting when they entered the abandoned city and fought the Coway. I sort of liked the tournament held to determine whether the kidnapped remain kidnapped; itself it was plain and usual, but made interesting by the elusive manner in which Luke defeated the Coway champion fighter. It added something to the mystery of the Force, and even better that Foster made sure not to explain exactly how Luke won.The end scene where Luke and Leia combat Darth Vader is acceptable. I accept that Foster doesn't know how strong Vader is or how weak Luke is at this stage in his Jedi training, and I accept the result of the fight knowing how little we see of Darth Vader's combat skills in the original \\"Star Wars.\\" But what I don't accept is Vader himself. He's in no way menacing like he was in the original \\"Star Wars.\\" Foster correctly had Vader deal with the Grammel character, but Vader versus Luke/Leia was weak. I tried and tried to imagine Darth Vader's booming voice as he was engaged in combat and speaking to Luke or Leia, but it just didn't work; his words seemed to be too weak to fit the characterization provided by the original \\"Star Wars.\\" Darth Vader is supposed to scare you with elegantly structured, short, ominous speech, but instead here he just 'talked.'The end to the novel was unsatisfying. I was never sure of what Halla was doing while Luke was fighting Vader; she just seemed to skulk around until the fight was over. If she has the Kaiburr crystal in her hands, why didn't she use its power over the Force to help Luke? It all seemed to never come together; Luke and Leia once established their creepy relationship, but by the end of the book it was forgotten, and Halla never seemed to connect as a true friend to Leia or Luke. She was always just like, \\"Luke, boy! Get over here!\\" instead of coming to a medium with him. Because of this, I wasn't really sure of where Halla was going at the end of the book. It seemed to explain it, but I didn't buy it because they just didn't seem like buddies. The loose ends of the plot are never tied tightly.I still found moments to enjoy, nonetheless. I enjoyed Princess Leia's sassiness and how Luke Skywalker and Captain-Supervisor Grammel reacted to it. It was pretty standard sci-fi stuff, but it's still \\"Star Wars.\\" I liked Halla in general; she's nothing like good ol' Obi-Wan Kenobi, but good enough for this book. It's obvious from where Alan Dean Foster got most of his ideas, but there're never why I have criticized this book.\\"Splinter of the Mind's Eye\\" is okay. I enjoyed it as any \\"Star Wars\\" fan should, and I respect the fact that it started the Expanded Universe, but it's just not magical. It has what you'd expect, but nothing more.Note (5/23/09): I no longer consider Star Wars to be a good use of one's time."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"As it has noted, this book came out after the first Star Wars movie but before Empire. Forget that Darth is their father. Forget that Leia is Jedi-born.

Then again, watch Episodes 4 through 6 original versions. They don't even fit the complete story. It is worthy read if you can just keep these facts in mind while reading it."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"Being the first novel that added to the ever expanding Star Wars masterpiece, Splinter of the Minds Eye captured some very exciting moments for fans while waiting for the next film(when the book was first published in 1978). Telling the story of the events told between Episode IV and Episode V of the classic trilogy, it offers a very scary, unpredictable, and twisting adventure on one of the best planets ever created. The planet of Mimban which the book takes place on is unlike most of the new planets and enviorments you'll find in post 1990 Star Wars novels. The plot is somewhat simple, easy to follow...with some twists and turns...and all the characters are very unique and somewhat all strange and a bit spooky themselves. The story revolves only around Luke and Leia after they crashed landed on their way to take care of some business. Not only being the foundation to what will be inspiring for dozens of other contributing SW authors over the years...Splinter is a very entertaing mini epic of one of the first adventures of two very important Star Wars heroes."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"As long as you remember that it was first published back in the early 80s the movies were not done yet. For example things might get a little steamy between Luke and Leia but thats alright because the author didn't know that they were brother and sister. I also liked the idea of an imperial offical that actually CAN THINK. I loved the movies but that little part of the story line where the underdog rebels always beat an over confident empire gets a little tireing. We meet some new charecters in this book that are also well worth the money(because except for the normal charecters you would expect they never show up in a star wars book agian) some are quite memorable."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"a book about luke and Leia having an adventure together. I liked how they had to work together to get off the planet. But the best part was when Darth Vader showed up. Leia totally kicked butt.

A fun and fast read."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"I Originally read this book Back in the Summer of 1978. Star Wars was always in my thoughts at that time. and I was already a fan of Alan Dean Foster. I read it mostly while riding in a car on Vacation in Georgia and Florida. I loved the book, It left me wanting More, but I was very confused, wait, Leia with a Lightsaber, huh? it starts a long Tradition of making new Species as interesting as the Main Characters. No Star Wars Fan should miss this book, and I am proud to have it on my Kindle"},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"I remember my joy at finding this in a grocery store after the first star wars thinking it was the sequel to be ( because Vader and luke were on the cover, I don't think it actuall said Star Wars on the first run) as it happens Lucas hired Foster to write a potentially low budget follow up to New Hope in case the first was not a Financial success and he needed to continue with little or no studio backing. The universe feels streamlined too, no Han or Chewy, and Luke and Leia's behavior may seem creepy in hindsight . This may not be as easily canon as other SW books of late, but a must read for the fan."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"The first of the Star Wars books from Del Rey, and a true classic. I read this when it came out on a summer backpacking trip in 1978. We had stopped at the Great Sand Dunes in Colorado and this story brought Star Wars to life in a way that few books since have really accomplished. Right up there with Timothy Zahn's great series and written so long ago that the mythology of Star Wars may seem out of date because it didn't exist when this was written. Alan Dean Foster is a great scifi writer and this remains a masterpiece of the Star Wars adaptations.

This is probably the beginning of the Expanded Universe so the story is SW history. The comic strips started in 1978, but were probably written after this book. The first of the Brian Daley trilogy wasn't published until 1979. It was even written before ESB.My copy of the paperback has a forward written by George Lucas written as he was preparing to write ROTJ where he says:Quote - SPLINTER was promoted as a further adventure of Luke Skywalker. It hit the bookstores just as I was preparing to write my own further adventure of Luke, in the form of a script entitled THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. - unquote.History not-withstanding, when compared to what followed this is one of the weakest novels and weakest comic produced in the Expanded Universe - Further Adventures. The pencil work is only fair, the story is weak and the inking is well below current Dark Horse standards. The individual comic issues had some very good cover art, but the TPN cover is one of the ugliest in all of Dark horse. This should probably be only 2 stars, but given its place in SW history I'll give it a 3."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"This book was worse than Bantha dung! The characters were totally flat and two - dimensional. Leia depends on Luke for EVERYTHING! As my favorite character, I should know that that is not her personality at all! She is certainly not idiotic enough to duel Darth Vader! That crystal business is junk! Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"This book is Baaaaad! And lets not even talk about the inconsistencies with the Star Wars universe of the future--the author is not even consistent with himself.At the beginning of the novel, Leia says how urgent it is to get to the conference On Time so as not to spook the members of an underground group who might want to join the rebellion. In her words, 'if I'm a little late they might bolt.' The author seems to forget this detail and there were at least 3 times where Luke and Leia got into trouble and it took them 7 days each time to get out of it. Yet, at the end they are still happy and hopeful about going as if they weren't almost a month late---and oh yeah, they still don't have a way off the planet!Though the siblings decide to keep a low profile they get into a mud fight right outside a crowded establishment. Then when they are brought before the local Imperial Leia mouths off to him every chance she gets(nice way to go unnoticed). Not only does the author have Leia flip between obnoxious and helpless, but not one storm trooper even mentions the fact that Luke used a light saber in the fight with some toughs. (Hello guys! Light saber. These might not be just regular townfolk.)There are also smaller but bothersome details. After the challenge fight with the Coway, his friends pull the challenger out of the water to a sitting position. Yet the author, a few sentences later, has Luke stare at a large rock in the water lying by the head of the Coway. Did his friends toss him back in for losing?Another time the group gets into a roomy crawler to go after the crystal. Then they are said to be exhausted from racing through the landscape. How does one race in a vehicle called a \\"crawler\\"? Or did they all get out and run helter-skelter through the swamps?In the underground city Luke senses Vader coming from a distance, however he doesn't detect Vader right outside the temple killing Luke's friends and ordering the droids to turn themselves off.The fight scene with Luke and Darth Vader is confusing at times due to the author using \\"he\\" instead of their names. Repeatedly Luke is said to be unharmed during this fight, yet he tells Halla he felt himself die. Of what? And, though I can't blame Foster for this, it is very disturbing the way Luke crushes on Leia, looking longingly at her body ugh--quick somebody give me some soap and water to wash this image from my mind!It seems like Foster didn't even bother to review what he'd written, but just plowed on ahead heedless of whether it made sense or fit the rest of the book. He conveniently throws in contrived things to save his characters(I am Obi-Wan!) I can hear him thinking back then \\"...Hmmm, how do I end this stupid fight? Eureka! I'll just put a big hole in the floor and drop Vader in it!...uh did I mention a hole before? oh who cares, people are starving for anything Star Wars, cha-ching!At the end of this horrible book I felt like Leia in one nonsensical scene--just letting out one long scream at the top of my lungs. This novel is dreck."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"I am the biggest Star Wars fan in the world and I love everything about it but this book makes me sick.

This takes place between A New Hope & The Empire Strike Back. Lets face it, between those two time periods Luke had no more control over the force than an acorn & somehow in this book he is not only able to stand up to Vader & live but actually win in a saber duel. I mean come on, even those little Padawans in episode 2 could have killed Luke. With all that aside I say this is a horrible book, a disgrace to Star Wars & a shame that it was ever written. I give this book one star & im even being generous with that."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"I have read almost every Star Wars book out there and this was the worst, ok maybe tied with The Crystal Star. I can't believe all the great reviews this got. It seems like the characters personalities kept changing throughout the book. Also, although Luke just got a few lesson from Kenobi and had not even been to see Yoda yet, somehow he has this tremendous skill with a lightsaber. Oh please. This is the only Star Wars book that I actually threw away."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"This book would be 5 stars if it wasn't for two things: Darth Vader kills people with his lightsaber, not at the throat force thing and, (2): Luke keeps telling Leia that she has no force talent, but she does, so she SHOULD be able to feel the Kalibur Crystal through the force! That makes me mad, because I am obssessed with Star Wars and everything that remotely relates to SW. If you don't get mad about little things like that, than this is OK."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"The most glaring inconsistency between this book and Star Wars is the fact that Foster made Leia a pilot. Nowhere in Star Wars is there even a hint that she could fly a Y-Wing.That aside, Foster is totally unable to capture the tone of the characters. I really tried to hear the actors delivering the lines, but by around the first 1/4 of the book, I had given up in disgust. They only characters he got right were Threepio and Artoo.Further, the actions on the part of the characters are also questionable. I refer, of course, to the entirely implausible mud-wrestling scene in the middle of town between Luke and Leia.Lastly, Darth Vader loses the fight by falling down a well. Although this is nice unintentional foreshadowing to Boba Fett's \\"demise\\" in the Saarlac pit, that scene sucked as well.The plot is uninteresting, the additional characters are unremarkable, and we don't even glimpse Han and Chewie. What a waste of paper. Makes me glad I didn't read it back in 1978, where I would have been REALLY offended."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"A few things to begin:1: I know this was the only SW novel in 78.2: How did this author win any SF award?So, I read through this book and by page 83 was convinced that Leia and Luke were two little children who constantly bickered and would lack the intellect not to get into a mud fight in the precarious situation they were in.THIS book is utterly unbelievable. I thought I was sitting in on a 1978 D&D; game!The writing is impossibly immature. Along with petty infighting and Leia's YOU KNOW WHO I AM lines (like that is going to scare big burly miners on an imperial controlled planet????) mixed with a few WORDY paragraphs and that just about sums up this novel.AVOID THIS NOVEL if this is your first venture into the expanded universe! Not all the SW novels are great ore even good, but the worst of the post 78 novels make this novel look like a bedtime story written by a child."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"This is the wost SW book I have eve read. It was so bad, I did something I hardly ever do, stopped reading it. I realize when this was written, but am baffled that Lucas let it ever see the light of day."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"I liked this book for what it is, one person's view of what happened after Star Wars. You have to look at this book realising that the other two movies were not out. With that in mind, the story was good and could be believed. The book is well written. A Star Wars fan might want to pick apart the minor details that come to light later in the series, and those that do probably won't enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"Right up front the reader needs to understand that Mr. Foster's book was published less than a year after the release of the original Star Wars film. George Lucas had not even written the script for The Empire Strikes Back, so Mr. Foster had no clear idea of what the future held for our cast of characters. Now we are way on down the road and we all know what happened, so we are operating at a distinct advantage. Please keep this in mind as you read the book, and I would suggest reading it. It's a good tale.Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia are extremely close friends and hold important positions in the Rebel Alliance. Leia is embarking on a mission to Circarpous to enlist the support of the Rebel underground in the battle against the Empire. Luke agrees to go along with her. They run into problems when the craft is forced to crashland in the swamplands of Mimban, a strange planet with mining colonies controlled by Imperial forces. In their efforts to find a way off of the planet, they run into Halla, an old woman who has a connection with the Force. She offers to help them if they will first join her in a quest to find the Kaiburr crystal, a mysterious gem reputed to give the holder invincibility through the force. This of course piques Luke's interest, so they join forces with Halla and travel across Mimban searching for the Temple of Pomojema.The quest is not an easy one. First they must find a way to get out of the clutches of the Imperial bureaucrats who run the mining colonies. Two Yuzzem named Hin and Kee help them escape their initial difficulties and then go along for the rest of the quest. The Yuzzem are huge, covered with hair, and have a snout. They are also extremely useful in a fight. This merry band of companions sets off to find the temple and crystal, but they run into problems with an indigenous civilization called the Coway. Luke barely survives a major duel with the best Coway warrior when things take a dramatic turn for the worse. Darth Vader turns up on the planet and wants to take Luke and Leia back to meet the Emperor. Luke struggles with him and does amazingly well. So the book ends successfully for our heroes.I had two primary reservations about the book, and they are really the result of the author's lack of future information concerning the Star Wars saga. First, clearly the idea of Luke and Leia being siblings has not been brought up yet. They are strongly attracted to each other with Luke having the typical thoughts a young man would have when he is in close contact with a beautiful princess. Second, Luke fights Vader much better than any of us would have thought possible. He is extremely close to defeating Vader and actually does manage to get him out of the picture long enough for escape to be possible. Imagine the changes in the saga if Luke had actually killed Lord Vader this early in the story, and George Lucas had said OK. Where would we be now?"},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"Regardless of what one might know of the movies this book has it's good points.Luke and Leia have crash landed on a jungle planet, Mimban, on their way to a rebel meeting, and find themselves trapped on a secret Imperial mining world. The two soon discover from an old woman who is a Force-user, that this planet has a crystal in one of the planets ancient temples that can make a Force-user extremely powerful.Although wanting to get off this jungle world, they decide to help this woman, Halla, search for the Kaiburr crystal in order to keep it out of the hands of the now informed Darth Vader. While on their adventure the two heroes run into many problems like monstrous worm-like creatures, tunnels that seem to never end, underground dwellers that are as primitive as cavemen and of course the Dark Lord Vader himself.Even though the story contains the notion of Luke's attraction to Leia, it doesn't hurt the book too much because what we know of them being twins, he doesn't at this juncture of the timeline. With the final conflict being with Vader and Luke battling lightsabers in the decrepit temple, I would say this book should be read by every enthusiast who relishes in all sub-plot stories of the Star Wars galaxy. Enjoy and may the Force be with you!"},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"It had potential. It had the plot, the characters (Luke, Leia, and a woman named Halla) but something about this book didn't add up. First, there was the print. It felt like I was reading The Cat in the Hat! Second, once they got on the planet, they meet a cast of cartoonish, happy-go-lucky characters including the Yuzzem, an extraordinarily strong species that Luke can somehow understand. It's a book that is truly based on coincidence, so far as the plot goes, and does a poor job of detailing Luke and Leia. They seem off as characters. It also bothered me at how easily Luke is able to battle Vader, and the plot inconsistensy that allows Vader's arm to bleed. I am aware of the fact that the book was written before Empire, and long before RotJ, but it still bothered me. Also, Leia is able to battle Vader, for a time. The book does do a reasonable job of showing Luke's budding force talents, but this is not enough to justify the atmosphere that the book is written in. Also, the book starts by having Leia desperate to get to a conference on a world interested in joining the Alliance, but that mission is totally forgotten by the end of the book! The author doesn't even bother to bring us back to the planet they were flying to in the first place. If this book had been a little more spit and polished, it could have been great. But it isn't, so it ain't."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"Back when Star Wars was just Star Wars, I was young enough and excited enough by the movie to be insatiable for anything and everything that expanded the George Lucas universe. Science fiction writer Alan Dean Foster filled the bill with \\"Splinter of the Mind's Eye,\\" an unofficial sequel to the original film that, if things had gone differently, could have been the basis for a second movie.Obviously, that never occurred. And, with Lucas deciding to take his characters in a sharply different direction, the developments of this novel were quickly forgotten by the majority of Star Wars fans. But I never forgot, if for no other reason than the relationship Foster fostered between Luke and Leia -- he still wanted to kiss her, and she wasn't his sister.But that wasn't all. \\"Splinter\\" was a rock-solid novel that took the conclusion of Star Wars and ran with it. Luke and Leia, accompanied by the droids C-3PO and R2-D2, are on a diplomatic mission to secure new allies for the Rebellion when they crash onto a remote mining planet occupied by the Empire. Leia's only worry is to get offworld quickly, but Luke senses a powerful tool that, in the hands of the Empire, could give the enemy far too much control over the Force. He vows to find it before the Empire does, but he wasn't counting on the arrival of Darth Vader, who is also seeking the item.It's powerfully good storytelling that still stands up nearly 30 years later.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(n e t) editor"},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"Although the current Star Wars Expanded Universe novels first appeared in 1991 with the publication of Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire, the adventures based on characters and situations created by George Lucas hit the bookstores between 1977 and 1980. Marvel Comics followed its six-issue adaptation of Lucas' film with its own &quot;continuing adventures,&quot; while novelist Brian Daley followed the exploits of Han Solo and Chewbacca before their fateful involvement with the Rebellion.Alan Dean Foster, the uncredited ghostwriter for Lucas' novelization of Star Wars, followed the further adventures of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia in Splinter of the Mind's Eye. Set shortly after the Battle of Yavin and the destruction of the Death Star, the novel is an atmospheric, almost Indiana Jones-like story pitting Luke and Leia (accompanied by R2-D2 and C-3PO) against Imperial forces in a desperate race to find the mystical Kaiburr Crystal, a gem which has the ability to focus and enhance the power of the Force.Although Splinter of the Mind's Eye is more character-driven than action-oriented (space battle fans will be disappointed), the novel is true to its heritage and has its share of cliffhanger situations, a new cast of rogues, outlaws, aliens, and villains (Captain-Supervisor Grammel is one of the vilest servants of the Emperor). There is even a climactic lightsaber duel between the very untrained Luke and the evil Lord Darth Vader.Foster's familiarity with Lucas' characters and situations helps keep this otherwise planetbound story interesting and lively. Although Han and Chewbacca are absent from Splinter (Luke only makes a passing reference to the Corellian when he asks Leia what Governor Tarkin had done to her before her rescue from the Death Star), Luke and Leia's characters get a chance to shine on stage. Luke is still a bit of a farmboy-turned-Alliance pilot with latent Jedi powers here, and the Princess is still as fast with her biting wit as she is with a blaster. Foster also emphasizes Luke's conflicting feelings toward Leia...he loves her, but knows (or suspects) he has to protect her at all costs, even from himself. (If this sounds weird, keep in mind that in 1978 nobody knew that Luke and Leia were twins!)Readers of Laurent Bouzerau's The Annotated Screenplays will recognize that Foster's plot is actually based on a discarded plot for what would become A New Hope. Part of the original story revolved around the quest for &quot;a Kyber Crystal&quot; -- a gem that a Force-user could utilize to enhance his or her powers; Luke was supposed to have used this &quot;Kyber Crystal&quot; to help him make that &quot;one-in-a-million&quot; shot to destroy the Death Star."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"Reading Splinter of the Mind's Eye gives you a different perspective of the Star Wars universe before the Empire Strikes Back movie arrived. Alan Dean Foster sets about a story where Luke and Leia travel to Circarpous IV to sway the inhabitants to join the Rebel Alliance. Well, they never get there and end up on Mimban which seems similar to Dagobah. Luke, Leia, Threepio and R2, find themselves on a planet run secretly by Imperials using locals and slaves to work the mines. Luke and Leia get in trouble in a local bar/eatery and are imprisoned, but the Imperials do not know them. Before this takes place, they meet a woman, named Halla, who possesses a shard from the Kaiburr Crystal which supposedly enhances the Force to the one who possesses it.Luke and Leia manage to escape the Imperials with the help of Halla, but not before they draw interest to the local Captain who in turn informs the Governor of that sector.There's action as Luke, Leia and the rest of the crew seek to find the crystal, while being pursued by Imperials, and other creatures of Mimban. Eventually, Darth Vader shows up, and there is a duel between Vader and Luke for the crystal near the end.The book seemed mostly like a comic book story, but was interesting how Alan Dean Foster portrayed the characters, and apparently not knowing Lucas's plans for the future as Luke and Leia appear to have a strong attraction to each other."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"This is a classic star wars book. Like how they involved vader but the book would have been fine without him"},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"The story behind Splinter of the Mind's Eye is already very familiar. It was originally intended as a low-budget \\"sequel\\" to the original Star Wars movie in case the movie flopped in the box office. When the movie soared, Lucas decided to allow the book to be published as the first entry into the Expanded Universe.Well, I for one am very happy this was never made into a movie and Lucas instead gave us Empire Strikes Back. Of course, given that Allan Dean Foster was supposed to be writing this novel as if it were a low-budget sequel, he couldn't include a lot of special effects or space battles. However, that's no excuse for a bad story. SotME doesn't even really have a story. It's a contrived escapade to find a few Force-sensitive crystals for an old lady named Halla, who can use the Force. Luke and Leia go from one small \\"adventure\\" (and I use that word lightly) to the next, often escaping monsters or native tribes. Ultimately, readers are left wondering what the point of the whole adventure is. Halla herself is never given any backstory, so readers are left wondering why she wanted the crystals and how she can use the Force and remain hidden from the Empire. Basically, a major plot hole given that she's the driving force behind much of the story.What really bothers me is the characters, or lack thereof. First of all, Foster just doesn't get them right. As others have noted, Luke comes off as way to brash, while Leia is cautious and even unsure at times. Even in A New Hope, we already knew Leia was more willing to charge ahead and Luke unsure (remember the Death Star prison escape). I didn't mind the mud fight outside the bar - I kind of like the playfulness of the scene - but generally I just don't recognize them. Vader is OK, he resembles his onscreen counterpart in A New Hope, but the character of Vader has changed so much since the first movie that it's painful to see Vader as the cartoonish villain that appears in SotME. For the most part, my problems with Vader are more a problem of the Star Wars universe changing than anything Foster did. However, one problem I did have with the characterization was Vader's obsession with numbers. He always seemed to be counting down the minutes or hours until something happened, 15, 27, etc. The Vader we see in the movies was never concerned with such details, just the outcomes.Second, we don't get very much character development. Luke and Leia don't learn anything new or mature. Leia is badly wounded, nearly dead, and yet there's very little emotional power to the scene. In a novel, especially one intended to be a \\"low-budget\\" movie without space battles and action scenes, the story really needs to explore the characters and create a rich plot. Instead, SotME seems like a barebones plot that goes from point A to point B all too quickly.Overall, SotME is interesting as a historical curiosity, a \\"what might have been in the Star Wars EU\\". But as a part of the larger story of the Star Wars EU it doesn't fit very well. SotME is pulp sci-fi/adventure, lacking in the mythic power that makes Star Wars more than just a comic book story."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"The plot is not that interesting, the characters are badly developed (Luke acts more like Han with the Force than anything, for instance) and I had to force myself to finish it."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"Luke Skywalker acompanies the princess on a diplomatic mission to the underground movement on a imperial world in order to bring it to the rebel side.

This novel still fits into the time line of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe without changing any of the major plot lines brought out by the other movies and other novels. Very well written and thought out.I give it 3 thumbs up (if I had that many!) Now pass the Barbarian Cream pie!"},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"This was the first novel in the Star Wars genre that chronicled events not in a movie. Furthermore, it appeared in 1978, before \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" was even in development, so the storyline is inconsistent with what took place in all the movies after the original. Therefore, when I first read it in the late seventies, it kept my interest, but re-reading it now was a struggle.Luke, Leia, Artoo Deetoo and See Threepio travel to the planet Mimban to enlist aid in their battle against the Empire. Their mission is to convince the rebel underground to join their cause and as a consequence, the governor of the planet contacts Lord Vader with a request for assistance. Vader and a complement of Storm Troopers then supplement the forces fighting the local rebels.This plotline would be acceptable, but the inclusion of the \\"Kaiburr Crystal\\" a gem that somehow channels the power of the force through the possessor in a way that will make them nearly invincible was too much. Like all other forces that make someone invincible, I disliked this plot line. With so many options available to develop a story, the inclusion of an all-powerful force-channeling device, and a natural one at that, strikes me too much suspension of disbelief. As the large number of subsequent Star Wars novels has demonstrated, there are plenty of possible lines of action, all of which almost certainly will be better than the \\"mighty gem.\\""},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"Alan Dean Foster was the ghost writer of the original Star Wars movie's novelization, which came out long before the movie. After the movie's release, Foster was contracted by Lucas to write an original novel that might be the basis of a possible sequel to Star Wars. But at the time Harrison Ford's return was uncertain, so Lucas told the author to not write in Han Solo. Apparently if Lucas was going to use Foster's novel, he would put some explaination in the movie, because there wasn't one here. Foster used a discarded premise for Star Wars - a crystal that amplified the use of the Force.I am rating this book based on the fact that I read it after the completion of the original trilogy, and there are a lot more problems with it than the absence of Han and Chewie. Sure, a lot of these can't be blamed on the author because he had no foreknowledge of the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. But today the novel is what it is, not what it was at the time of it's original release. Unlike some reviewers, I can't enjoy this as an independent book because it is not - it has the title of Star Wars so I can only consider it as a Star Wars product.The book greatly contradicts the established continuity and themes of the complete movie saga. Lucas didn't use the crystal idea because he didn't want to solidify and quantify the Force - he wanted it to be portrayed by the invisible energy field that it is. And Empire is presented as the first time Luke personally confronts Vader, and this encounter would not have been ignored if Lucas didn't want to ignore it. And Leia attacks Vader with a lighsaber? Yeah right. And Luke's physical arousal by Leia - ew.But one thing I remember even contradicts the original film. It annoyed me that out of the two characters of Luke and Leia, it is much more likely that Luke would be the one that can't swim instead of Leia. Where did Luke learn how to swim growing up on a desert planet?!Overall, this is not that bad of a story on it's own, which is why it has 2-stars instead of only 1. But this book is way out of place in the Star Wars universe, so don't bother with this book. I highly recommend the following 5-star novels that are extremely relevant to the film series:Cloak of Deception (Star Wars)Shadow Hunter (Star Wars: Darth Maul)Labyrinth of Evil (Star Wars, Episode III Prequel Novel)Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader (Star Wars)Shadows of the Empire (Star Wars)"},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"Before the Empire Strikes Back there was some talk about a Star Wars TV series on local KGO talk radio, and what a Star Wars sequel might look like, if it happened at all.Then this book was published, and I grabbed it and read it. I can't remember too much about it to be honest, other than Luke uses his lightsaber in the water, Leia is there to help him, and a bunch of other things on a Dagobah like world before Dagobah got shoved into a Star Wars sequel.If you find a copy, and are a real Star Wars aficionado, then give this thing a whirl."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"This book takes place between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. It was interesting, but not the best by far. Leia, escorted by Luke, was on her way to Circarpous to enlist their Rebel underground in the battle against the Empire. Thier ships crash on a jungle planet known as Mimban. Hidden on the planet was a crystal that had controlable power over the force. Now, with Vader on the planet, Luke and Leia have to race to find it. Along with the two droids, their new friend Halla, and two Yuzzems.In this book, you can tell Luke and Leia have a strong connection with each other. They pretty much stay in character, except they act like a bunch of little kids. Han Solo and Chewbacca are left out. Which was dissapointing to me, since Han is my favorite character. All in all, this was a decent book that all fans should read."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"The book is well written. I Read it when it first came out in 1978. It has to be remembered that the book was pre &quot;Empire Strikes back&quot; and was at one point supposed to be the basis for the second and final Star Wars movie. The plot is good but the lack of numerous characters interplaying with one another does lead to a simple story line. For those people expecting a smooth interconnection between this book and and what became the Star Wars trilogy and now phantom menace you will be disappointed. Afterall, in 1978, after the first Star Wars movie was made, we didn't know the major plot twists that would follow; Vader being Luke's father was conceived on-the-fly on the set during filming Empire Strikes Back and Leia being Luke's sister didn't come out until Return of the Jedi. Over all this was an excellent book, and still is, especially if you are into &quot;what ifs&quot; and &quot;what could have beens.&quot;"},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"There was nothing wrong with this book, except it was written in 1978, before The Empire Strikes Back.

That Vader can deflect blaster bolts off his hands and Leia can't use a lightsaber? And finally how was he to know that Vader was Luke and Leia's father? he couldn't, there is no way. Read the book, but from the standpoint of someone who has only seen the first movie. Because of a few plot holes I give this book 4 stars instead of 5, but it is still a good book and it is intresting, if you love Star Wars you'll like this book, ifyou don't, what are you doing looking at the reveiws for this book?"},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"\\"Splinter of the Mind's Eye\\" is the very first Star Wars novel set in the Expanded Universe. The only Star Wars book before \\"Splinter\\" is the novelization of \\"Star Wars\\", also written by Alan Dean Foster. Because this book came out before there was even a script for \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\", things happen in the book that doesn't quite jive with what we know from \\"Empire\\" and \\"Jedi\\". I'm not sure there is a direct contradiction, but the story fits better into the Star Wars Universe when the reader knows that this novel was written without any knowledge of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\". Think of \\"Splinter\\" as, perhaps, the red-headed stepchild of the Star Wars novels.This novel takes Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa and puts them on a diplomatic mission for the Rebellion to a planet which has some sympathizers. On their way to this planet, the ship Luke and Leia are on crash lands on a primitive jungle planet occupied by the Empire, human miners, and a host of strange alien creatures. As Luke soon learns, it is also the home of the Kaiburr Crystal, a crystal which magnifies the power of Force Users. In the hands of the Empire this crystal could be a dangerous tool and weapon. Since Luke and Leia have no idea how to get off the planet with their damaged ship, they decide to search for this crystal. The novel gives a fairly fast paced, though simple, adventure story featuring run-ins with Imperial Stormtroopers, natives, and Darth Vader in a face off that foreshadows what will come in future movies.\\"Splinter\\" suffers from being a little bit on the cheesy side, as if it were geared to a younger audience. It also suffers from the timing in which it was written, namely before George Lucas had conceived of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\". This last part isn't the fault of Alan Dean Foster or the novel itself, but this does affect the perceptions of someone reading the book in 2005. Knowing what we do about the characters, the budding romance between Luke and Leia is a bit uncomfortable (as it still is looking back at \\"A New Hope\\" and how Luke looks at Leia).This isn't an exceptionally good novel even by Star Wars standards, but it is a time capsule of where the Star Wars novels came from and as the first Extended Universe novel, it's interesting in that perspective. There's really no other reason to read this book, though, as it doesn't tie into any other Star Wars novel (or movie) or fill in any gaps left by a Star Wars novel.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"I am amazed at the Lucas-ites who follow like puppies accepting the meager scraps he gives. In New Hope, he gave us a feast, a fairy tale in the best sense, good vs evil, princess and hero,the mature political underlyings, and even a small lesson on faith. I walked out of that theatre in the summer of '77, looked up at the stars, and felt wonderment. Instead of that wonderment, we were given 3 movies and various post-trilogy books where a spiral galaxy of billions and billions(Sagan-ese) of creatures and cultures' fates rested on ONE family! Now that's fiction. He should have followed Mr. Foster's lead. We get to see what makes an Imperial officer tick(they are not all idiots),Vader in 3D,some political food for thought, and Luke and Leia aren't the Doublemint twins. And as for as atmosphere, Mimban is so palpable it makes Naboo seem like Disneyland. If you think the story is &quot;unrealistic&quot;, how about a bunch of teddy bears taking out a sophisticated military regiment(i.e. Return of the Jedi). Watch Star Wars:New Hope, read this book, look up at the stars, and let your imagination take you to where George didn't, a wonderment far, far away."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"This book was written before Ep. 5 and 6 so it has a different feel to it then the other books. After reading many of the others it has a different and interesting feel to it considering many elements that we now know about certain characters in the star wars universe where not known at the time this book was written."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"Although it was written less than a year after A new hope had been released, it still keeps its freshness and attraction.The plot goes around the misfits Luke and Leia must go under while trying to help an old force-sensitive woman (never mentions she was a former Jedi) to get a powerful crystal that could enhance the Force.The story gets a little &quot;pink&quot; in my opinion about Luke and Leia, but how could you ever imagine they were brother and sister?And the end makes you chew your nails with the supposed &quot;first&quot; encounter between Luke vs Vader (actually it''s the second, the first is the one which appears in Vader's quest) and...Well, you'd better read it by yourself..."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"I picked up this book mostly because Luke and Leia were in it alone and I thought that was a great relationship to explore. As far as Vader and his fun ol'time killing with Lightsabers, blood post light saber slash was a off, because the wound would cauterize immediatly---lightsabers are very very hot. I could deal with Luke's attraction to Leia as long as nothing happened (justification: he just doesn't get why he feels bonded to her yet). But I wasn't fond of the way they portrayed Leia. They couldn't decide if Leia was a shrieking princess who could do nothing, or a bad girl who could handle everything on her own. One second she's afraid of water, the next she's trying to kill Vader. As far as the force goes, Leia never actually touched the crystal (justification: I could just assume her force powers weren't set off). I actually liked the fact she tried to fight Vader with a lightsaber, and did about as well as Luke did in Empire. But it all turned to junk at the very rushed ending. Find crystal, Luke battle Vader, Vader go down the hole. He's dead! Uh, no he's not. And it's utterly amazing how &quot;good&quot; Luke is with that little lightsaber in this book, but he gets beaten so badly in Empire Strikes Back.I guess way back before Empire Strikes Back was released this would have left an intresting question in people's minds. But now it just feels silly. Still, having the three Skywalker's in one book(Daddy and the kids), in one room, battling it out, did make it intresting read up until the last section."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"This was the first Star Wars book I ever read. I can't remember if it was in '81 or '82, but I can remember how it creeped me out. I'm glad to see that ti has been reprinted and that there is a graphic novel now."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"Alan Dean Foster's Splinter of the Mind's Eye is the grandparent of all Star Wars Expanded Universe stories. Foster wrote this novel shortly after the theatrical release of Star Wars in 1977, and it was published right as George Lucas sat down to begin his script for a movie sequel named The Empire Strikes Back. Taking this timing into account, it's important to note that Foster didn't have much to go on as far as the overall Star Wars story. The characters were fairly archetypal in Star Wars (later renamed to Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope) and it wasn't until Empire that they were more fully fleshed out.Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, along with their faithful droid sidekicks R2-D2 and C-3PO, are traveling to the planet Circarpous for a critical meeting with local Rebel sympathizers. Unfortunately, mechanical troubles force a crash landing on the uncharted swamp planet of Mimban. The four are stranded on Mimban days from civilization and must quickly find a way off the planet to make their original rendezvous. Their efforts are considerably complicated when they learn of an Imperial presence in the five mining communities of Mimban. It is in the first of these communities that they encounter the mysterious old woman Halla, who tells them of the legendary Force artifact, the Kaiburr crystal.The story clips along at a fast pace and is quite readable. I was struck by how Foster's writing has changed between this book and his 2002 Attack of the Clones prequel, The Approaching Storm. In the latter Foster allots generous amounts of prose to description and sequences with very little action; by comparison, Splinter of the Mind's Eye races along from action sequence to action sequence.Some elements of this story don't jive very well with the various Star Wars stories that came later. Luke has a disturbing passion for Leia, but of course, since the two actually have a full-on kiss in The Empire Strikes Back, this can be excused. The Kaiburr crystal, which is central to the main plot, also seems a little off. It affords its users the ability to focus and enhance their Force powers. The later films and novels tend more toward the Force as an internally-driven, self-powered ability (midichlorians aside), and the crystal feels rather like a fantasy creation.One more interesting element to mention is the final confrontation between Luke, Leia, and Darth Vader: it simply cannot be reconciled well with the films. To my mind, the Vader/Luke duel in Empire is definitively their first face-to-face meeting. In this book, Luke is overly confident and seems to be getting the upper hand over Vader without too much difficulty. Heck, even Leia uses a lightsaber and scores a direct hit on Vader's mask! Vader finally seems to take control of the fight (after losing a hand to Luke!), when we are given the sudden climax of Vader simply falling into a hole as he walks towards Luke. It is a truly bizarre way to end the duel. One note I did very much like is Vader telling Leia \\"I have been guilty of overconfidence before. I will not be guilty again.\\" This was written twenty-eight years before Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, and yet Foster inadvertently manages to perfectly raise the specter of Anakin's fate on Mustafar.Halla is never very well rounded, and it is unclear why Luke is so excited to invite her to join the Rebellion. The Imperial adversaries are entertaining enough, and the local cultures of Mimban are mildly interesting. The story has a pulp feel in line with the original influences Lucas cites for the films, such as Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers.Overall, the book is an entertaining read and essential for its place in Star Wars lore, even if many stories since have more successfully tied into the overall saga."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye was written before the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi and it's obvious. As most Star Wars fan knows, the novel was intended as a squeal to A New Hope if the movie was not a success.The story's plot revolves around Luke and Leia finding the Kaiburr Crystal, a crystal in which has power over the Force. In my opinion, something having power over the Force doesn't make much sense to me. If that weren't enough, Luke and Leia aren't true to their characters. I can't imagine any of the dialogue being said in one of the motion pictures.It's decent enough, but I would only recommend it for Star Wars enthusiasts since you must understand this doesn't match up with the later films. Luke and Leia do have a slight romance in the first film, but judging from the book's depiction it doesn't match up with the later films. Of course, I don't blame Foster for that since he was unaware they were brother and sister.I don't consider this part of the cannon, since it doesn't match up with the movies. I would consider this a sort of rough draft of the Star Wars universe. If you think of it that way it doesn't bother you much. Even so, Luke's dialogue irked me through the whole read since it did not match his character. Leia, as well acted so unlike herself. If you can brush the uncharacteristic dialogue away to the point that you only comprehend the facts, then the book's a good read."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"Not one of the better SW books (due to lack of backstory at that point in the writing of SW), but still an interesting story. It is a little weird, especially for those of us who know that Luke and Leia are brother and sister, a fact that the characters are unaware of in this novel, due to the time placement. The value of this story is mostly in its addition of facts about the force and related objects, which comes back much later in the SW series."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"Before I read this book I read a lot of the reviews, and based on other peoples' opinion of it, I wasn't even going to bother to read it at all. I'm glad I did, since, while the book is no litterary work of art, it is generaly well written and brings up some very interesting questions about what could have happened, or what might have happened. The book takes place about a year after A New Hope, and was written before The Empire Strikes Back was made. So, considering that the author had no idea not only of the Luke/Leia/Vader family ties, but also that Han was going to stay with them, he did an excellent job of gracefully avoiding certain issues, and still creating a fairly plausible story, with no real breaches in standard Star Wars history. The story itself basically tells of the misadventures of Luke and Leia as they go on a mission to an obscure planet to try to secure it's help for the rebel alliance. They are diverted and forced to land on a slimy jungle planet, and they soon find themselves caught up with some local lady in a quest for a special crystal that enhances the bearers force powers. There is a lot of interesting interaction between Luke and Leia, but luckily nothing happens between them. Han is also carefully left out of the story. He was never one of my favorite characters, but even so I missed him. The only thing I was truly dissapointed with was Leia. She was portrayed as a weak, disturbed, unapreciative, middle of that time of the month, prissy little princess, who does nothing but complain and cling to Luke when things get dangerous. She is basically an annoying character, which irritated me to no end, since she was always my favorite female Star Wars character, aside from Mara Jade. Anyway, besides those things this was a good book, not entirely neccecary, but in general good entertainment."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"For a book written in 1978, it's great. Foster does a tremendous job of writing for only having ANH to go on. I especially liked Luke in this book. Foster matured him, made him more of a man. No longer is he a whiney farmboy, but a heroic escort of Princess Leia. His only thoughts are of protecting her, and his other new friends he meets along the way. However, I did find Leia to be just awful. Forster totally misinterpretted her character and made her a whimpy, bossy pain. While the plot isn't incredibley exciting, it's just enough to keep you interested."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"I thought that this was a sooper dooper starwars book because I hate dark vader and I like it when they light saver him to peices.

It would be a great book...if it wasn't Star Wars..."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"The book starts off as realistic and normal, as one would expect after A New Hope. By the end, it is completely unrealistic. There is no way things would take place as they did. Vader being so emotional? Never. While he was more emotional in A New Hope than any other time, he still was far colder than shown here. In Empire, Vader is pure darkness and evil, perhaps shown best when he jumps down at Luke during their duel, flying from above, like a dark raven. He has almost no dialogue in comparison, and the thought of him doing and saying all he did in Mind's Eye is not realistic. Vader did not seem all that strong in Mind's Eye, and Luke and Leia seemed stronger than they should have. In reality, Vader could have cut all of them up almost instantly. Luke had almost no training, and Leia none. Way too unrealistic."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"If you take just the first Star Wars movie (Episode IV), then read this novel, it reads as a VERY good novel.If you try to read it as part of the overall Star Wars universe (as it is today) then it doesn't fit as well.In 1978, I thought this was the best book I had ever read. I still consider it high on my all time list (taken in perspective)."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"Foster did make some minor inconsistensies with the Star Wars universe, but the novel itself makes up for the small mix-ups. Foster didn't know there was even an &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; coming. SW seemed to be a one-shot deal. Foster took the basic undercurrent and spirit of &quot;SW: A New Hope&quot; and made a great novel, with SW or standing alone."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"I liked it. Like many have said, it's helpful to remember that this was written before the rest of the Star Wars mythology was spelled out, and so it does feel a little off at times. But given that Foster was writing with only \\"A New Hope\\" as material, I am actually impressed with how well it does in fact mesh with the overall storyline.I thought the hint of romance between Luke and Leia was quite believable, since of course they don't know yet that they are related. Given that \\"Empire\\" begins with Luke and Han seeming to compete for Leia (she gives Luke a big full-lipped kiss as he lay on his clinic bed on Hoth, with jealous Han watching), this part of \\"Splinter\\" actually fits well with the overall storyline.I found the book enjoyable and to me it has the feel of many of the extended SW novels I've read -- action, adventure, curious alien life-forms, dastardly villains, etc. I liked it."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"There is good Star Wars fiction and there is horrendous Star Wars fiction. I would categorise this with the latter I am afraid, would there not be that certain light in which the novel should be held.What this novel in essence pertains, is carefree adventure. What it does wrong in being carefree adventure, is giving the impression to be more. The story is told in the swaying, intelligent voice of high science fiction; and whilst making the book a more supple and pleasant read, this same voice inavertedly places extra focus on the membrane storyline and shallow character depictions. Characters land in illogical and - to the reader - almost offensive situations to preserve the plot. (Luke and Leia loosing themselves in a mud fight, so that there is an opportunity to introduce Captain-Supervisor Grammel, is the chief example. Another is finding sites on the Mimban surface against all odds, all too easily assigned to fortune and Luke's Jedi instincts.)However, Foster had his restrictions laid upon him by the Star Wars Corporation. He could not go and make this adventure far-reaching and implicating. As Lucas says in the foreword, Splinter Of The Mind's Eye was presented in 1978 as a \\"further adventure\\" of Luke Skywalker. Foster has overdone this, I'm afraid. As it is, the only aspect this novel really adds to the whole of the Star Wars galaxy is the shock of Vader's mortality. The heroes do not simply beat him to the chase, escaping just in time leaving Vader with a raised black fist shouting: \\"I'll get you, damned rebels! One day, I'll get you!\\" - the heroes actually gain total victory, leave almost leisurely, and only lack of possibility prevents Vader from being killed in the confrontation.What is good about Splinter Of The Mind's Eye is the unending chain of exciting events. The Adventure never stops. Would it have stopped, and put even a trifle more effort into unveiling the splinters of the characters' minds, it would have been a much better book.Seen in this light, Splinter Of The Mind's Eye is not horrendous, but it certainly is not good.Horrendous fiction get no stars or one star; but as it is, this gets two stars. I am giving.Bram Janssen,The Netherlands"},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"This book, knowing what we know now (January 2003) about the key players in the Star Wars Universe, misses the mark completely in almost every way. Of course, the author at the time (1997, just afer A New Hope) did not know about Leia/Luke/Vader, Luke/Yoda, Leia/Han and other relationships and facts.In this book, Leia is a whining crybaby, screaming in fright at just the thought of the Death Star. Her banter and actions with Luke througout the book are very immature, unintelligent, and unsophisticated, almost like Leia is a 12 year old girl instead of a Senator and leader of the Rebellion. Luke is not much better, very immature and much better with the force than in The Empire Strikes Back, which happens later and AFTER the training with Yoda. I will not spoil some of the plot, but Luke does much more with the force in this book than makes sense based on the following movies and stories.In addition, Vader seems like a different character. In the movies and other books, Vader is a very aloof, menacing and commanding figure. In this book he is like a \\"normal\\" bad guy making bogus comments about the people around him and his thougths on things. This book does a complete injustice by de-mystifying Vader and that is a shame.Skip this book, you will be doing yourself a favor as none of the characters \\"seem\\" the same as the ones we know from the movies. I wish I had never read this book due to the \\"skew\\" in my thinking about the characters. You will lose all respect for Leia by the end as a sniviling wimp, and Luke for \\"getting lucky\\" with powers he should not have yet."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"I started reading \\"Splinter of the Mind's Eye\\" with the knowledge that it was written before Episode's V and VI and the rest of the Expanded Universe, so I knew it would contradict a lot of the future storyline and was ready to accept that. What I did expect was for the characters to behave as they were portrayed in \\"A New Hope\\" movie and book that had been released at the time. Since Alan Dean Foster had ghost written \\"A New Hope,\\" he should have known the characters well -- as well as anyone could up to that point.I'm not sure what happened. Leia is not like the Leia from \\"A New Hope.\\" She was out so full of herself, all high and mighty princess that she is. Sitting around on a wrecked ship waiting to be rescued? Crying? Fainting? Screaming? Does that sound like Leia?Luke starts out addressing Leia as \\"Princess.\\" That's something I think Han would do, and not in a very nice way. I don't think Luke ever called Leia \\"Princess\\" to her face -- well, once he did call her \\"Carrie.\\" He is a lot more like Luke than Leia is like Leia. In one scene, the wounded stormtroopers were being massacred by Luke and Leia's allies. It upset Luke deeply. I'm very glad Foster was able to capture that so early in the Star Wars books, as this is exactly like Luke then and now in every book he is ever portrayed.This story appears to be written for more juvenile readers. Leia's motivation despite serious threat of death was to get to a meeting on time, like they wouldn't understand if she's there late because she was almost killed. Captain-Supervisor Grammel is too comical to be taken seriously, like a villain out of the Batman TV series. And although it's not overly violent, the story is more graphic than expected. Imagine watching \\"Roadrunner\\" and seeing Wile E. Coyote bleed when squished by a rock.The Kaiburr crystal wasn't too much out of the realm of Star Wars, considering the crystals inPlanet of Twilight. Given Foster's limited knowledge of the future worlds of Star Wars, I don't think he should be faulted for his inclusion of the crystal here.Leia using a lightsaber, now that was very good. Foster did not know her relationship with Luke and Vader. It's almost psychic to let her wield it as well as she did (not very well, but better than expected). We can thank her latent Force abilities later.I think this is a good story to read as a part of the history of Star Wars, written long before anyone knew what an impact it would have on the galaxy. On the other hand, if your motivation is to see the story fit into the Star Wars universe, this book is not for you."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"Recently, I read somewhere that Amazon.com was getting a new wave of many Star Wars books for the Kindle that were not available electronically before.

I had never read that book before, so I bought it.An interesting thing to note about SotME is that it was written before the release of the movie, The Empire Strikes Back. That is significant because as the author was writing the book, he did not know that Leia is Luke Skywalker's twin sister and a force user (revealed in Return of the Jedi), and most importantly, that Darth Vader is Luke's father. This lack of knowledge gave this book a very unique feel to it, even awkward at times given the way the Star Wars story played out in episodes 5 and 6 of the movies. For instance, the interactions between Luke and Leia at times are like those of two people discovering the romantic feelings they may have for each other. Sometimes, it's a little too much, but it works for this book given the fact that the author was building upon what little information he had concerning the Star Wars universe.SotME follows a single plot line, which is contrast to nearly all other Star Wars books I have read. The only exception that I know of is I, Jedi. Typically, when you read a Star Wars book, you follow two or three different plot lines that eventually come together or provide a segue to a sequel book. This book almost exclusively follows Luke and Leia from start to finish. I wasn't too fond of the single plot line in I, Jedi, but it worked out pretty well in SotME.If I could provide any criticism for SotME, I would point out that the story progression is a little slow and drawn out. The book spans 12 chapters, but doesn't get to the main point to the plot until the 12th chapter. Then, the book quickly winds down to the resolution. This does give the book an adventure feel, where the heroes are put in a tough situation that gets worse and they must work their way to overcome their dilemma, but the story could have had more substance. For instance, the story could have had a parallel plot line that showed how Darth Vader was made aware of the events going on in the story, rather than just have him show up at the end with only Luke and Leia's speculation as to how he knew where they were going. Perhaps if the story followed Darth Vader, it would have provided a little more suspense in the race to the main object of the story's conflict.The author of SotME certainly had his challenges with the lack of a Star Wars expanded universe from which to form the story of this book. However, I do feel that he did a relatively decent job because there is some good storytelling in this book. Overall, I enjoyed this book. It's at least worth a check-out at the library, if it's available. On a scale of 1 to 5, I would rate it a 3. It's an interesting take on the Star Wars universe, but I probably won't read it again anytime soon because it just seems a little too disconnected from the entire Star Wars story line."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"If you are like me and were kinda let down by the storyline of \\"Return of the Jedi\\", check this out.

As a young teenager, I hated reading anything. I still do in a way. Something about this book just captivated me. It has a lot imagination and visual imagery.

I say go ahead and buy it, read it during a road trip and slip into a world that is far beyond this one."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"As one of the first books in the Expanded Universe, \\"Splinter of the Mind's Eye\\" has a certain charm. Despite the fact that a brother and sister are still having awkward feelings about each other in the book, there are no major contradictions from the major storyline of Star Wars. Even the fate of Darth Vader in the book can be rationalized to a degree.The casual Star Wars fan generally buys the books to read about familiar characters. The pillars of the franchise, Luke, Leia, and Darth Vader are the central charcter of the book. In the plot, Luke accompanies Princess Leia on a mission to recruit new members to the alliance on the planet Circarpous. But unexpected events force their landing on the swampy Mimban. A peculiar old lady solicits their help in seeking the Kaiburr crystal. The powers of this crystal are somewhat unkonwn, yet the Empire wants the crystal too. Knowing this Luke and Leia must attain the crystal before the empire.With large print and a quick pace, the book almost has the feel of a young adult book. Yet this is definitely a grown-up Star Wars novel. Some of the themes would certainly go unrecognized by a younger audience. With a foucs on a central theme with characters central to the Star Wars storyline, \\"Splinter of the Mind's Eye\\" ranks in the upper tier of Star Wars novels."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"The only reason i give it a 4 and not 5 statrs is that it is thick and long, and the print is a bit small to a kid, as i was then, but besides that it is a 5 STARS book.(!!!)Well, maybe it's the 2nd book i ever read, after those \\"Adam the Ant Goes Picknicking\\" picture books. Surprisingly, when i told teachers that this was the 1st book i had read, they were extremely impressed(!), and i was surprised myself that they recognized the title. I was determined to find out more about Luke, Leia and Han Solo's adventures, and...... the book grabs you with the opening crash-landing and pulls you in, and you do not want to put it down as you read about Luke tracking through mysterious, eerie underground caverns, his mitichlorion levels elevated, searching for a way out of and off of the world where he landed. The suspense keeps you on edge. You can't wait to wake up the next day to see what happens next in the book.It jumps between Han Solo and Luke mostly, and then Leia a little at the end (remember, they are siblings and are psychicly linked), as they get seperated at the begining of Empire Strikes Back, or something like it, but the same thing happens again a few years later, or on the way to Degoba, as they run from the troops of the Empire. Maybe it was Han who crashed (1st?). I just remembered it was one helluva book! It meshes perfectly with the movies. Hours of absorbing entertainment to keep a kid, teen, or adult occupied. I recommend it highly for anyone age 7 or over, maybe 8.Sort of an alternate to what happened in the Movie, it reminds you of him crashing his ship on Degoba, but MUCH more interesting, and then you find out what Leia was doing too. It does not conflict at all, as the original storyline was by George Lucas. You can't wait to get through it, to find out what happened. Maybe some of the other editions are easier to read, but why be a wussie and be afriad of learning new words? Luke would not take the coward's way out. So be brave, use the force, and learn a few new cool vocabulary words. My teacher had this one on her book rack to loan out in elementary school, but you can also impress people that you were able to get through it if you are a kid. It looks great on a job resume if you are a kid applying for your 1st job, or something similar.You will feel what it is like to be Luke Skywalker, and find out what he is thinking.

I wish that I would have read it years ago before all the other stuff. I am sure it would have been much better then. I am not sure why, but it seems to be just a simple little story that really doesn't excite me as much as some of the others I have read. I honestly think that this is because I read it later than I should have. It is still a good book and a lot of fun for a true fan."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"I am bettting that most of us think that just because something is a George Lucas Idea it has to work. That is what happened to me with this book, which if by no means is bad, it is not the story I expected to read. In this book you will be treated to the classic elements of the fantasy adventure myth: A near fatal landing, the undesired adventure, the pursuit by a monster (can't miss huh?) and the meeting of a primitive tribe among other typical situations. The book is well written, it reads fast and the plot keeps moving steadily, so it makes for a nice piece of literature, just don't expect another Star Wars, an Ewok adventure would be a more appropriate comparison."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"I can see why critics would diapprove of this book; it doesn't seem to warrant its &quot;official&quot; status. However, the story itself is quite an interesting look at the Force, and you can still reason out all the story elements that are seemingly incongruent to the Star Wars universe by saying that the character developments (for example) in this book are an extrapolation of those in A New Hope, and that when The Empire Strikes Back came out, their development took a slightly different turn."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"I read this novel the instant it came out. Everyone was starving for more Star Wars. Most of us mistakenly thought the sequel to the movie was going to be based on this book, but happily, it wasn't. Its been many years since I read this book but I distinctly remember feeling it was all wrong. The stakes in this story are very small. HOWEVER, in spite of not liking the book, I still have it on my bookshelf twenty years later, because the cover art is AWESOME! It was the coolest star wars illustration around at the time, and still is a classic. there have been several covers for this novel, but the one I had featured a silhouette of Darth against a foggy forest, with Luke and Leia cowering in the foreground by a glowing red crystal. Save yourself the money, and just do a google search and look at the cover. Its very cool!"},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"Conidering that Foster new nothing of current expanded universe continuity, nor did he know where Lucas was going with the Star Wars movies as this book was written before Star Wars came out and was released the next year, Splinter of the Mind's Eye is an entertaining, filled with complex character development an exciting climax and perhaps one of the most brutal Darth Vader scenes ever written. Luke and Leia are off on a diplomatic mission which explains the absence of Han Solo, not known to be a returning character by the author, and they are forced to crash land on a swampy planet that ironically resembles Dagobah. Here they stumble across a hidden Imperial installation, are captured, escape and have to go after a mysterious Force enhancing crystal. On the way they fight locals, Imperials and Darth Vader as well as monsters and their environs. The relationship between Luke and Leia seems to be heading in a more romantic direction than a brother/sister relationship should really go, but then again, in Empire, Leia tries to suck off Luke's face so really it just enhances the sibling surprise. The confrontation with Darth Vader is one of the highlights of the book. Especially the part when Luke is trapped and Leia faces off against the Dark Lord with a lightsaber. Here Vader is at his most evil playing with his prey before pouncing. He tortures Leia with his lightsaber conveying a brutality not seen in him before. The fight between Luke and Vader is also very good and if it differs from Star Wars canon a little how cares! It's still a well written scene. Splinter of the Mind's Eye is among the best of the Star Wars books written and it is indeed Foster's best Star Wars novel. I highly recommend it to the thinking Star Wars reader."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"The first work of the Star Wars Expanded Universe. The genesis of this book is now a fairly well-known story amongst those familiar with Star Wars literature. It goes something like this. Alan Dean Foster was originally contracted to write two Star Wars novels - the original film's novelization and a second book. Before the first film's debut, before George Lucas knew that Star Wars would be a smash hit and a financial success, he instructed Foster to write a story that could serve as a sequel of sorts to Star Wars. If Star Wars was a success, Lucas would be able to go on with creating and completing the rest of his planned saga. If the film turned out to be unsuccessful, his thinking was that he would still be able to make a sequel, but not with the resources that, say, a The Empire Strikes Back would necessitate. Thus Foster was told to construct his story in a certain way. It had to feature a setting that could be easily replicated using low-budget film techniques (a fog-shrouded swamp world would do nicely). It could not feature any space battles (which would be too costly for a low-budget movie). And it could not feature Han Solo (as Harrison Ford had yet to sign on to do more Star Wars films). In this way, Splinter of the Mind's Eye was born.The plot of the book couldn't be simpler. Luke and Leia are aboard separate Y-wings (along with R2-D2 and C-3PO, respectively) flying to a meeting of underground resistance leaders on Circarpous IV. Leia's starfighter experiences a sudden and unexplained malfunction and she is forced to crash land on one of the other planets in the system - Circarpous V, or as the locals call it, Mimban. On the surface, Luke and Leia's prime motivation is to get off the planet and make the meeting on the next planet over. However, they are seriously waylaid when they agree to help a mysterious old woman named Halla find a powerful Force artifact known as the Kaiburr crystal, which is located in an ancient temple somewhere on the planet.Unfortunately, the characters we're familiar with don't feel particularly familiar here, and Luke and Leia in particular make absolutely bone-headed, out-of-character decisions that get them into the exact trouble they so desperately needed to avoid (such as the \\"fight\\" between Luke and Leia outside the diner, although this is but one of many examples). Luke's crush on Leia can be a bit cringe-inducing at times, but they never kiss, and it really isn't as bad as it is often made out to be (it's perfectly understandable given when this book was written). Darth Vader is mostly recognizable from his film counterpart, although he talks far too much during his scenes, and even lets loose an evil laugh once or twice, as if Vader were just another pulp villain. As far as new characters go, Grammel is a joke, once again exhibiting all the worst traits of a pulp villain, and it is a wonder that, despite the lure of the Kaiburr crystal, Luke and Leia trusted and followed Halla, who was clearly insane and more unlikable than otherwise.Vast stretches of time elapse off-screen, but the effect is not handled well. For example, after driving for several days through the swamps of Mimban, a character will ask \\"are you sure this is the way?\\" conversationally, as if they'd been travelling for twenty minutes. Because of this, I couldn't have cared less about the supposed meeting of resistance leaders that Leia and Luke so desperately needed to get to, even though Leia kept reminding Luke of the fact during their stay on Mimban. Considering how much time they spent on Mimban, it was quite clear that they weren't going to make this meeting, unless Leia's original intention was to arrive weeks early. Of course, it is implied at the book's end that they do make this meeting, so what was with the rush in the first place? Ultimately, it doesn't matter, as this is the same book that decided Luke, quite conveniently, would be fluent in the Yuzzum's language because he studied languages while living on Tatooine.This is a low-budget, simple, and inconsequential story set in a likewise low-budget setting, marred by Alan Dean Foster's awkward prose. It might have ignited the imagination in 1978, but the only reason to read this book today is if one were a completionist."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"This review features moderate to heavy spoilers.PlotSplinter Of The Mind's Eye concerns Leia and Luke's relationship post New Hope. After crash landing on the jungle world of Circarpous V, they must search for the Kaiburr crystal in order to keep it out of Vader's hands. This aspect of the plot is simple but effective, adding Darth Vader to anything is usually a good idea, and at least they aren't trying to stop yet another super weapon or something. The author uses the all new setting to introduce new creatures to threaten our heroes with. The creatures are mostly interesting, however the encounters with the wildlife of Circarpous got somewhat old by the end, probably around the time when a tribe of Ewok-esque warriors defeat the Empire in ridiculous fashion. The author also introduces some very awkward sexual tension between Luke and Leia. Although it wasn't seen as such when the novel was published (after A New Hope but before Empire Strikes Back), in retrospect these scenes are very weird and hurt the novel's credibility, at times reading more like ambitious fan fiction as opposed to a licensed story. There is also a duel between Vader and Luke at the end of the novel. The action itself is well written, if HIGHLY implausible once you consider the outcome when Luke and Vader duel in Episode V. Luke manages to defeat Vader somewhat easily, which is a sharp contrast to the events of Episode V, where Luke is soundly beaten by Vader. Other inconsistencies like Halla, the force sensitive hermit, being unable to sense any force sensitivity in Leia (not the fault of the author), and Vader claiming that Luke was the one that shot down his fighter in the battle of Yavin IV (author's error) further hurt the novel's entertainment value.CharacterizationLuke and Leia suffer greatly from the misguided sexual tension that colors the novel. They are also portrayed as being somewhat stupid, the way they are imprisoned by the Imperials is absolutely unbelievable and completely out of line with what we would expect of them even after the first movie (spoiler alert: they randomly mud wrestle outside of a bar, directing attention to themselves and subsequently getting arrested by the Imperials). The author took these characters in a much different direction then what Lucas would ultimately choose, and the inconsistencies of these characters when compared to their actions in Episodes V and VI, and the other novels, are inconsolable. Vader is also given somewhat of a weird character, mostly due to some very odd sounding dialogue during the climactic battle. Two of the strangest lines are \\"Come girl-woman...amuse me.\\" and \\"I am truly sorry I have nothing elaborate to treat you to at this time However, one can do some interesting things with a lightsaber, you know. I'll do my best to show you all of them if you'll cooperate by not passing out.\\" Lines like the above are more in line with a villain in a children's movie, and do not even begin to sound right when imagined in Vader's iconic voice. Among the new characters, Halla is probably the standout. A force sensitive hermit (but lacking the power and training of an Obi-Wan Kenobi) Halla serves as Luke's mentor during the course of this novel. Halla is an adequate character for this role, although her passive behavior during the final conflict left me wanting, she played virtually no role in repelling Vader and that was somewhat disappointing. Hin and Kee, two Yuzzem being held captive by the Empire, don't anything to the story, the only thing we really know about them are that they are alien and very strong. Grammel, the Imperial ruler of Circarpous V, enters the story very powerfully, but, after a rather dramatic entrance, falls flat as he is manipulated by Luke, and reduced to easy subservience beneath Vader and an Imperial governor.ProseDialogue and descriptive phrases are littered with sci-fi stock terms that aren't really appropriate in the Star Wars universe. They don't necessarily make the novel harder to read, it just seems out of place in a universe that now has so many modified or invented terms to itself. Strange descriptions of Vader's suit and lightsaber power functions are the worst results of this re imagining of the Star Wars universe, but at several points it just doesn't feel like Star Wars. This language is still effective at explaining settings and the like. One thing I didn't care for, was the fact that the author writes in several large passages of times to make the world of Circarpous V feel more expansive. Instead, it just makes the novel feel incomplete. It left me wanting to know what happened during the days that were completely excluded, considering Hin and Kee were grossly underdeveloped, a scene or two during these days could've easily been devoted to fleshing out their characters, without really breaking up the pacing of the novel.ConclusionSplinter Of The Mind's Eye has aged very poorly, and inconsistent characterization, events that don't fit into Star Wars canon, and awkward dialogue give the novel entertainment value more so as a \\"what could have been\\" than as a worthwhile novel in its own right.Final Score45/100"},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"There are a couple reasons to read SOTME and there are a couple reason not to. If you're into Star Wars (and I don't refer here to anything that developed after the theatrical release of Jedi except, perhaps, the Zahn trilogy or Dark Empire), you will probably find interest and entertainment in it. Don't expect anything similar to those stories, however. This is no tale of the wars among the stars. The details here are mainly concerned with the landscapes of an alien world and its main protagonists' hearts. As long as you can brush aside the fact that Luke and Leia are siblings, as well as the fact that they are rather grown, you will enjoy the burgeoning of awkward adolescent desire between them. And if you like reading about ancient places and alien worlds, Foster does a descent job of writing it. It's nothing spectacular. Science-fiction fans will probably find things a bit boring and those excited by the enigmas of lost civilizations will not be mystified, but Foster does a good job of making his world both normal/familiar enough that it becomes believable and alien enough that it seems wondrous. The book isn't particularly well written, but not particularly bad either. One could say it was slightly artistically done. Up until the point of arrest and after the point of fleeing the mining town on Mimban, the story is engaging. The other fourth of the text, however, is dull, plodding along in a dry and predicable fashion. Exposition comes into play many times throughout the book, which can become a little irritating. Even if this were written as if it might become the second Star Wars film, theoretically, movies as a visual medium shouldn't require exposition. The whole point of motion picture is showing, not telling. The main antagonist, Grammel, is simply \\"the bad guy\\" who will enter the story to play his part and then leave the story without much difference either to the reader or the narrative. Things get much more interesting when Vader, a character already developed elsewhere, comes onto the scene to steal the show. There is, however, some good character development for L&L. We get to see in this story the awakening of Luke's relationship with the Force and his inner struggle to understand and work with it. Personally, I think that is what the \\"mind's eye\\" is all about. It doesn't really have anything to do with the crystal except insofar as the splinter and the crystal serve as catalysts for that development. What could and probably should have been left out was Luke's sudden ability to speak and understand an alien language when it became advantageous. And here we get some more of that wonderful exposition: one way of dealing with the boredom of growing up on a desert planet was learning the languages of some of the races he would never encounter. Ooooh-kaaaay. Was there really any point to those two giant hairballs other than the conceptual link between them and the first giant hairball, who would've made the story a lot more interesting if he were part of it? I'll give a little, though, for the old woman's ability to chatter up the Coway. Leia's development was also pretty well done (although it could have been spectacular if the story had been told through her perspective instead of Luke's). We get to see her dealing with the trauma of her torture on the first Death Star, the duty and violence that weighs on her as Rebel, Princess, Senator, and last survivor of Alderaan, and are even treated to circumstances and events that expand her back-story and explain her motives. The climax is great and 3PO's lament at the end is satisfying. I wish Vader's defeat had been dealt with differently. The only thing that allows me to accept his fall was the way Foster foreshadowed it earlier with another sort of being. But what of the crystal? What does the future hold for its power? How will that affect Luke? What will it mean for the Alliance? And how is it that neither L nor L ever need to relieve themselves whilst being stranded together and confined in such limited spaces for so very, very long, but Halla is ready to erupt after being tied up for a few hours? There is a lot more story here to be told..."},{"Title":"Splinter of the Mind's Eye","review":"From my blog review: [...]As a novel, \\"Splinter\\" is fast-paced and full of tension and atmosphere. This was the first non-canonical Star Wars story, so what makes it refreshing is that it is not full of self-aware references to things mentioned in the movies or other non-canonical works. Foster even describes one creature's sound as being \\"like a hog in heat.\\" Subsequent writers would scarcely use such a non-\\"Star Wars\\" frame of reference.Unfortunately, he who lives by the sword also dies by the sword and what makes \\"Splinter\\" disappointing is its detachment from \\"Star Wars.\\" Taken exclusively in relationship to the 1976 novel and 1977 film, most of the inconsistencies are easy to accept. There is, for instance, no reason to be found in that tale (later re-titled \\"Star Wars: A New Hope\\") that would prevent the presence of sexual tension between Luke and Leia. What taints the story, though, is the climax. Darth Vader simply bears no resemblance to his previously established self. Even if we overlook the description of his lightsaber as blue instead of red as irrelevant, try not to notice the absence of any reference to his scuba-inspired breathing sounds and try not to hear James Earl Jones's voice speaking his lines, this is simply not the same character. Neither in prose nor on screen is the Dark Lord so wordy, sounding here more like a guy with a large mustache whose plan involves tying up the princess and leaving her on the train tracks.\\"Splinter of the Mind's Eye\\" includes several scenes that today call to mind not only the subsequent film sequels in the series, but the Indiana Jones series as well. In fact, an alternate title of this novel could well be Luke Skywalker and the Kaiburr Crystal. The relationship between he and Leia bears a striking resemblance to that of Indiana Jones and Willie Scott inIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (Special Edition), and their trek across Mimban feels more like an Indy adventure than a \\"Star Wars\\" tale.

A combination of resignation, insight, and patient manipulation of the more powerful men around him allow Wilson to suceed.Page and his fellow officers lack Wilson's saving graces, and the tension builds as they struggle to convince themselves that God is on their side. This is a well paced book with a number of humerous scenes, but it drives Page relentlessly towards a grim confrontation with the reality of the glorious struggle he had envisioned.

The main character, Page, an Episcopal priest, is called to be Robert E. Lee's Chief of Artillery. He takes his personal servant to war with him, Wilson. Wilson's wisdom and his great sense of caring for his fellow humans makes him an outstanding character and allows the reader to appreciate his emotion and intelligence as he makes his evaluation of slavery vs. freedom. The reader watches the priest win battles, pray to be the winner of a terrible war, and watches Page develop as a more caring and thoughtful person as he experiences the devastation of war. Other vivid characters add humor and insight to the main characters, Page and Wilson. By book's end, The Seventh Trumpet has become a very emotionally moving book. I think the book has special merit by making the reader intimate with the perspective of Virginians before and during the war, without being an apology for the 'Southern cause'."},{"Title":"The Seventh Trumpet","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Judge Frye's book about the fictional General Page, whose character was based on that of General William Pendleton. Gen. Pendleton was the rector of All Saints' Episcopal Church in Frederick, MD, but who left the parish after an argument with the members of the vestry over the construction of a new church building. He did become the one of Gen. Lee's staff officers, as the head of artillery of the Army of Northern Virginia. Nevertheless, Judge Frye's sensitive portrayal of a conflicted man, husband, father, and officer touched me deeply."},{"Title":"The Seventh Trumpet","review":"John Frye's excellent narrative follows the career of Page, a clergyman and general in the Confederate army, whose skills as an artilleryman and conviction that God favored the Confederate side in the Civil War lifted him above both his competence as a soldier and his ability to rationalize the slaughter of young boys in the name of &quot;freedom&quot; - a word that means different things to the two sides of the war. Frye's touch is deft, allowing us to watch along with Page's (slave) servant Wilson as the contradictions and suffering that flow from his commitment to the Confederacy slowly undermine and finally destroy Page's ability to serve. This is a great story and one that keeps you thinking long after you finish reading."},{"Title":"The Seventh Trumpet","review":"The theme of this book was actually searching for the justification of The Civil War. Both the North and the South were certain that God was on their side and, therefore they would prevail.The main characters were the Confederate General in charge of Lee's artillary and his negro servant. Both saw the carnage and death, but from a diffirent perspective.The General is also a pastor. Can he somehow convince himself that killing is allowed in the eyes of God if you are on the 'right' side?The author takes you through the lives of both these men and their families as they all endure the hardships, death and destruction of war.The historical side of this story was pretty accurate, but I felt the personal side addressed a lot of questions and feelings that everyone was going through through those four bloody years.The reasons I decided on a four star rating was that the language throughout the book was pretty rough (and unneccessary) and sometimes the story seemed to develope at a slow pace.After having said all that, \\"I feel the good parts definately overshadowed the bad.\\""},{"Title":"The Seventh Trumpet","review":"John Frye's excellent narrative follows the career of Page, a clergyman and general in the Confederate army, whose skills as an artilleryman and conviction that God favored the Confederate side in the Civil War lifted him above both his competence as a soldier and his ability to rationalize the slaughter of young boys in the name of &quot;freedom&quot; - a word that means different things to the two sides of the war.

I think Sabatini was hoping to repeat his earlier success and many of the elements are there. Again we have a hero of doubtful paternity who is caught up in the events of the French Revolution. While Scaramouche takes place at the beginning of the Revolution, this story takes place at its height, but after the fall of Robespierre, and, hence, after the worst of the terror is over.The author gives us a very good picture of rural France at that time of the Revolution which is one of the strong points of the novel. Another is Sabatini's handling of the romance between hero and heroine--something which Sabatini does better than most historical novelists, certainly a great deal better than Scott. Another strong point is the description of sword-play--a Sabatini specialty--unfortunately, in this novel, limited to the early part of the novel.What the novel lacks is the Sabatini hero that drives the action. Because the hero is involved with a military campaign that failed, he takes on a role largely of a complainer. As the novel becomes bogged down in the details of a campaign that suffers from one blunder after another after almost endless arguing and backstabing, even the sword-play disappears from the action.The novel has, in my opinion, a very satisfying ending, but it doesn't quite make up for the lack of real action in the last half of the novel."},{"Title":"Durer","review":"This Phaidon Durer book is probably, for the price, by far the best comprehensive introduction to the life and works of Durer. It is also one of the best books on Durer in absolute terms. The photographic reproductions vividly bring out the color and sharpness of the dozens of key Durer paintings illustrated in the volume. The photographs show that there is simply no substitute for an up-to-date book utilizing modern photographic reproduction/printing techniques to reproduce paintings. I have looked at several older books in librarys with color reproductions of Durer works, and this newer Phaidon book has much better quality color reproductions. It also has examples of key Durer drawings, such as &quot;Praying Hands,&quot; and &quot;Architect,&quot; as well as good-quality reproductions of the three classic Durer engravings (&quot;Melancolia I,&quot; &quot;Knight, Death and the Devil,&quot; and &quot;St. Germone in his Study&quot;) and beautiful, crisp and brilliantly colored reproductions of several key Durer watercolors, including the classics &quot;Hare&quot; and &quot;Great Turf,&quot; as well as key landscape watercolors. Of particular interest are the reproductions of the 3 classic self-portraits, of which the one Durer did at age 28 was so fascinating that it alone made me buy this book and is alone worth the price of the book. Another fascinating painting is the one that Durer made of Wolgemut, who was his mentor and who taught him how to paint. It is startlingly brilliantly colored, and has amazing color depth for a photographic reproduction of a painting. This book shows how Durer may well have been the greatest graphical artist of the Western World, and one gets a sense of his amazingly modern personality from the selections in this book and the quality of their detail. It is hard to believe that a man as modern-thinking and scientific as Durer lived 500 years ago."},{"Title":"Durer","review":"This book was a very pleasant addition to my art library. I never saw it in a bookstore, so I was hesitant to buy it when I saw how little it cost and how small it was. But, I didn't know anything about Durer and wanted to learn and I figured I'd take a chance on this book. Good decision! This book is well put together and a tremendous bargain to boot. The book starts off with about a 25 page, obviously brief, biography by Mr. Bailey of Durer. Then there are 48 full page color plates with descriptions and explanations of the paintings on the opposing pages. The reproductions are of good quality and the descriptions are well written and informative. Any of you out there who own a lot of art books know what 48 color plates usually does to the price of an art book, so &quot;Durer&quot; is really a steal. After you see this book you will realize what a great all-around artist Durer was. He wasn't only a painter of religious scenes but an equally talented landscape and portrait painter. (Some of the portraits are just fantastic!) He also did some beautiful nature studies. Included are 2 paintings he did of a hare and of the wings of a bird that will just knock your socks off (assuming you wear socks!). He worked well in all mediums. The watercolors are as beautiful as the oils. Phaidon has a whole series of these books in their &quot;colour library&quot; and this book makes me want to check out some of the other titles concerning other artists I haven't learned about yet. Definitely worth purchasing as an introduction to an extremely gifted artist!"},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"The entire premise of the book is about playing nice in the sandbox. It is unfortunate that we as human beings seem to forget that simple rule that we learned when we were very young...but we do.Marshall Rosenberg explains in the introduction that he has two questions that have motivated him to find the answers to: He asks: \\"What happens to disconnect us from our compassionate nature, leading us to behave violently and exploitatively? And conversely, what allows some people to stay connected to their compassionate nature under even the most trying circumstances?\\"These questions are truly profound and Rosenberg does an exceptional job of answering both of them in his book.Rosenberg notes that the first component of Nonviolent Communication is to observe without evaluating. In other words, apply empathy when communicating. This is easier said than done and takes time, patience and a willingness to change ones behavior. There will be mistakes along the way, but change does come with the right attitude.The second component is to express our feelings. It encourages conscious responses bases on awareness of what we are perceiving, feeling and wanting rather than being habitual and auto responding without thinking. In other words, Rosenberg recommends critically thinking through what to say before saying it. Words are weapons and they need to be handled skillfully or they will be harmful!There are many insightful comments throughout the book. For example, Rosenberg says: \\"It is the rare human being who can maintain focus on our needs when we are expressing them through images of their wrongness.\\"This book and other excellent books on communication help us understand each others needs better.

It is an important work that has its roots in the universal wisdom that connects our human history sometimes with strong threads, sometimes with thinner ones.

However, just understanding how much I have ingrained that I need to unlearn has been worthwhile."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"This book is a good starting point to learn what NVC (NonViolent Communication) is all about. Reading it, you will learn that our culture is a \\"Domination System\\", where concepts of right, wrong, good, and evil sabotage our ability to communicate our needs to each other. Our language supports the illusions of \\"enemy images\\", and that the only way to get what we want is to either punish or reward others for their actions. Marshall teaches us how to recognize these pitfalls and traps of our language. He helps us probe and explore the needs behind our language, and then how to translate those needs into words so that others can understand what we need without feeling judged or threatened, or feeling as if demands are being made of them."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"This book is a great tool for learning how to communicate effectively. It shows us that when we're emotionally triggered, it's usually because a need of ours isn't being met. But if we can learn to uncover that need (which puts responsibility of our feelings back on ourself) and verbalize this to the other person, along with the emotions we're feeling, they are more likely to \\"hear\\" us, instead of becoming defensive.One of the things I love about this book is it really urges us to take responsibility for our emotions and actions, instead of blaming others. (And in my experience, that's a lesson that many still need to learn)There are also many excellent real-life examples of this communications tool (or language) in action. Great book!"},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"I ran this through this book on kindle text to speech three times, worked great.I found myself at a period of introspection and wanted to know what I could do better in dealing with people. This book really helped me think of a mindset of approaching arguments and expressing concerns.The basics could not be more simple, observation feeling need response. The majority of the book is simply case studies that cover applying these four steps from different angles, be it with mentally disabled children, at risk youths, the arab-israeli conflict, or a long-winded school principal.I recommend this book for bullied schoolchildren, handling irritating coworkers, defusing marital tension, essentially this book is useful for everyone.I've read this back to back with emotional intelligence 2.0, and in contrast this nonviolent communication book is much more anecdotal and from one point of view. This point of view is consistent and well thought out, but my one critique is that it is subjective in this manner."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"This book is highly political and biased showing the Arabs in a poor light.

I may need more work on not getting upset or emotional, but this is not the book or the author."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"This book is heaped with patronizing, self-serving junk. The teachings in the book have extremely little practical use. I have read many useful self-help books. Some are great, and some are mediocre. This NVC book is simply bad."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"All the hype surrounding this book is for naught. Rosenberg simply condensed (simplified) into a few pages the wisdom of all other self-help book writers. Unremarkable. For those members of the Church of NVC, please expand your reading library."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"I got about 4 chapters into this book and stopped reading it. It was a challenge to get that far. I had borrowed this book from someone in the hopes that it would help me to establish more gentle communication with my young children, but this guy is definately not someone to get parenting advice from!First of all, the entire concept of NVC is based on the idea that it is a part of human nature to desire compassionate communication with others. This goes against some of my fundamental beliefs as a Christian. When I got a few chapters in and started reading the sample conversations, they were so robotic and absurd that I was reading them aloud to my husband for laughs. Even Rosenberg's writing language is absurd. For example, the instructions on one of the end-of-chapter exercises says, \\"If you would like to see whether we're in agreement about the verbal expression of feelings, circle the number in front of any of the following statements.\\" Please.Then I got to the chapter on \\"Taking Responsibility For Our Feelings.\\" I had almost finished it when I came to a part where Rosenberg is relating a story about his own daughter, and that is where I threw the book down in disgust. Here, he talks about a moment in his own daughter's life that was a cause for celebration: She had told her school principal to \\"F*** off!\\"Now there's a non-violent communication for ya."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"Excellent Book!!!...............WOW"},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"Very good. Very logical: Deceptively simplified by Dr. Rosenberg, but this \\"simplification\\" is the beauty of the discipline itself: Mr. Rosenberg allows access to success of his teachings in a way that is accessible even to the skeptic --- skepticism being the failure of the individual to successfully navigate the most profound communication outside of knowing oneself --- reaching out to know the other."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"Initially I thought this book wouldn't be relevant to me since I didn't consider myself a &quot;violent&quot; communicator. A few pages into the book however, it became evident to me that despite my easy-going nature, I had much to learn about communication. Dr. Rosenberg identifies learned communication that disconnects us from each other and is at the very root of violence. He then offers a simple yet powerful 4 step model that leads to respectful and compassionate communication. One catch - while the model is simple, it can be challenging to apply, especially when we're upset. That's because most of us have learned to blame others when we're upset and it's hard to unlearn this behavior. However, use of the model deepens our awareness and it becomes very clear how destructive our habitual knee-jerk reactions are to both ourselves and others. The Nonviolent Communication model helps us to become conscious and choose to respond differently - that is in ways that are more likely to lead to positive and satisfying outcomes for everyone. If you'd like to transform your relationships, for example: learn how to really listen to others while not taking anything you hear personally (what a gift!), learn how to give and receive in ways that are deeply gratifying, and much more, this is a must read. Also, this model is applicable in all relationship types - perfect for couples, parents, teachers, managers, executives, counselors and anyone else interested in relationship building.On a personal note, this book has been life-changing for me. I have witnessed truly amazing results in all my relationships including one relationship which had been a great struggle for me for many years."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"In November, 2000, I read the previous edition of this book...The quality of empathy I now am able to provide has enlivened my therapy practice, and meets my need for hope that I can contribute to the well being of my clients, and also connect deeply with my friends and family. The step-by-step empathy skills in this book are learnable by anyone..This latest edition of Dr. Rosenberg's book has a completely new chapter called, \\"Connecting Compassionately with Ourselves.\\" It's about what he calls, \\"self-compassion.\\" He writes, \\"When we are internally violent towards ourselves, it is difficult to be genuinely compassionate towards others.\\" I enjoyed this chapter because it helped me translate my self-judgments into statements of my own unmet needs. I now see that when I am angry with myself it is because my actions were not in harmony with my values. Seeing things from this perspective helps me mourn my action and move into self-forgiveness by connecting with the specfic need I was trying to meet when I used a strategy that I now regret. I particularly enjoyed the section on translating \\"have-to\\" into \\"choose-to.\\" The exercise showed me how to locate the choice in what I do, by connecting with the need, want, or value each activity serves. I find I have more energy, more compassion when I experience choice in my life."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"I borrowed this book from the local library after it caught my eye, sitting on the &quot;new books&quot; display. It's a pretty good book, although I do have some reservations about it./Nonviolent Communication/ is a rather easy read. This is both good and bad - good, because you're not slogging through lots of academia-speak and technical jargon; but also bad because you might breeze through the book too quickly to truly absorb the rather useful and insightful information it is offering.The idea behind the NVC process is rather simple - it's mostly about learning to be more precise in expressing your feelings, their cause(s), and what you would like done to resolve them. Rather than saying &quot;you never clean the !@#$ kitchen,&quot; the NVC approach would be to say something along the lines of: &quot;When you do not take out the trash in the kitchen, I feel __________.&quot; And so on. NVC also encourages you to be receptive to what other people are saying and feeling, even if (or perhaps especially if) they do not word things with as much precision and care.The approach is very sound, but I have reservations about the way the book presents it. Most of the example conversations are so unbelievably robotic, at times I just wanted to laugh out loud at how absurd they were. My initial thought was that I was being unreasonable - after all, they're just words on a page, and perhaps they would seem less laughable in person with real emotion behind them. And then I realized that was the key that was missing - the conversations were little other than the facts of the situation, and the exact words the people said. There was no emotional context, no insight into the feelings that were being expressed. I found this to be extremely ironic. A book about expressing emotions, with lots of examples that HAD no emotion!I think if you can get beyond the rather mediocre examples, and put genuine *thought* into the principles the author outlines, you will find much of value in the book. Before reading /Nonviolent Communication/, I didn't think much about how the imprecision in our wording can cause a great deal of conflict. &quot;You are so inconsiderate!&quot; versus &quot;When you leave your dirty dinner plate on the table and go watch football, I feel very angry. Would you please rinse the plate and put it in the dishwasher?&quot; It's a world of difference, and I believe there is much benefit to this approach.Final thought: there's a lot of good stuff in this book, but the presentation could use some work. Read the book carefully, and do not go as quickly as the breezy writing style allows - the material here needs careful consideration for it to truly benefit you."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"While I agree with another reviewer who questioned the rather stilted examples in the book, I believe that the premises on which this book is based are absolutely sound - that all humans want to be understood and acknowledged.I've worked myself, and coached adult students to work through some of the example scenarios. They prompted lively debate, critical thinking and crucial self-reflection about our own styles of communicating with ourselves and others.We realized that we often put judgement into our language when we think we are simply describing beahaviour. We were struck by the realization that our English language often adds to the confusion when we make statements like: &quot;I feel that this is unfair&quot;. Rosenberg spends a whole chapter on us being able to actually express feelings, rather than opinions and thoughts, as the above quote exemplifies.He helped me realize that I rarely sort out for myself what personal need I have of another, and I was struck by the simplicity and power of being sure that I am able to identify what request I have of the other person that will address my need. Since I am practicing these skills with my teenager - you KNOW that they are truly being put to the test!This is a book that is much better shared with at least one other person so that you can share the examples and share the hard work of changing unconscious communication patterns. If you breeze through this book as an interesting read, you won't get much out of it. If you treat it as a workbook, with gems of wisdom that need to be assessed, and practiced and made your own - then this is a treasure, and one you'll return to again and again."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"First, the basics. Before I read this book, I had no idea that there were learnable techniques for enhancing your performance of empathy. For that matter, I didn't even know that empathy is something that you do; I thought that it was just something that you feel. Well, it turns out that empathy is really an activity with techniques, and this book teaches them.Now for some context. In the last year, I've read about twenty books on emotional intelligence (EQ) and related topics. (If you're unfamiliar with the term, just think of EQ as \\"socio-emotional fitness\\". It can be roughly divided into self-awareness, self-direction, social perception and relationship management.) Good intellectual frameworks for understanding EQ have been easy for me to find; practical instructions for increasing your EQ seem rather more rare. (By \\"practical instructions\\" I mean pragmatic action plans with specific things to DO, not just project proposals with goals to accomplish. It's a shame how often the latter is presented when the former is needed.) In my reading experience, \\"Nonviolent Communication\\" is THE premiere how-to guide for improving your performance at doing empathy, which is one of the fundamental competencies of EQ.Third, a caution in the form of a metaphor. The author is proffering you a diamond while demonstrating an oddly formal way of holding it. Just take the diamond and ignore the formalities. That is to say, other reviewers have pointed out that he uses some rather stilted language at times, and that's true; but, the phrasing is NOT the point. The remarkable insights are what matter.Fourth, an idiosyncratic recommendation. One of most amazing ways that this book helped me was by teaching me how to empathize with my OWN needs. That made it much easier for me to tackle certain problem behaviors of mine without threatening the universal human psychological needs that those behaviors were (self-defeatingly) satisfying. (The book \\"Flawless!\\" by Tartaglia is a good place to start for that, BTW.) I firmly believe that one of the best uses of \\"Nonviolent Communication\\" is to lay a strong cognitive foundation for future self-improvement.Finally, some setting of expectations. As with any competency training techniques -- musical performance, physical fitness, whatever -- how much you benefit will depend on how much you practice. However, if you work at it then you will change your thinking, which will change your behavior, which will change your character and your circumstances, which will change your destiny, which will change the world.This book is eagerly waiting to improve the human condition through you. Will you activate it?"},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"Marshall Rosenberg has initiated peace programs in war ravaged areas around the world including Ireland, Serbia, Croatia, Rwanda and the Middle East. He also gives workshops has worked in the prison systems and has applied his ideas with great success in a variety of settings. His book that goes along with this audio series Nonviolent Communication was a textbook for one of my communication courses which was a requirement for a Masters in Integral Psychology. In short, he is a highly credible author with a gift for simplifying complex topic down to simple models that could be applied easily in daily life.The basic model he uses allow a person to unravel the trigger for an emotion from the actual cause which is often unconscious thinking or beliefs. For example, if I child didn't clean his room that is not necessarily the cause of the parent's anger. The real cause is some underlying need for example that the parent is concerned about the child developing discipline or an examined assumption such as my child is ignoring what I asked them to do. The point is that we often jump into action or go immediately to a negative emotion without much CONSCIOUS thought. This four step process allows you to deepen your awareness so that when you are in situations that might automatically trigger you, you can chose more healthy options.Another aspect of the four step process is staying with emotions until one uncovers the underlying need. Sometimes, this involves the emotion shifting to another one. For example, say my partner gets angry because I didn't do the dishes. Rather than just starting an argument, Rosenberg would advise my partner to stay with her emotion. By being willing to fully feel the anger, she might realize in actuality that she feels hurt. By staying with the hurt she may have the realization that her underlying need is actually to feel loved and that me doing the dishes is symbolic for her of loving her and being concerned. With this additional awareness she is in a position to make a more vulnerable and powerful request that is likely to get her what she really wants. For example, using the four part model she might say, \\"When you forget to do the dishes (observation), I feel hurt (feeling-notice there is no blame or shame) because I notice that I'm not feeling loved because I associate you following through on things like that with being concerned for me (the real need). Now that you understand how I feel, would you be willing to be more vigilant about your agreements over everyday stuff because when you do it makes me feel like you care (request).Admittedly the model is simple, but it is also very powerful. Most of us act without awareness much of the time. In our time contrained culture, we also tend to dismiss feelings as sources of information about needs that are important to us. This model helps you to get back in touch with the purpose of your emotion and your buried needs. It will help you to increase the intimacy in all of your relationships, not to mention helping you to make requests that are more likely to get you the results you wanted in the first place.If you are serious about changing unhealthy communication patterns, I would also get the book to accompany this audio set. Patterns of language and the thinking that accompanies them are deeply engrained. In fact, there are often hidden assumptions in our automatic thinking such as OTHER people CAUSE our emotions. We actually have a lot of degree of control over how we feel when someone does a particular behavior. A lot of this depends upon how we \\"frame\\" or contextualize the behavior. This book is very useful in helping you uncover these patterns and changing them.In my practice as personal growth coach I often recommend this book and audio CD to clients. I've seen this information help a lot of people and it has helped me too. If it helps you avoid even one argument with an important person in your life, it is well worth the cost. I guarantee it will raise your awareness around your unconscious processes and help you to have healthier relationships if you apply the ideas faithfully.The CD on giving and receiving anger compassionately is especially good. This is a problem area for a lot of people and I think this CD alone justifies the cost of the set. Don't be deceived by Rosenberg's simple presentation of ideas. It is often the most simple ideas that are the most powerful when applied in daily life."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"I think there are some valuable insights and tools in Nonviolent Communication, and I'm very heartened to see a yearning growing among people, the desire to be able to talk to and listen to each other more fully, freely and openly. At the same time, for someone who wants to learn to talk to others (and themselves, as well!) in a more open and less defensive way, in a way that makes it easier for people to speak openly to each other, I find Sharon Ellison's book, Taking the War Out of Our Words: Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a much clearer, more complete and more effective paradigm and method for a non-defensive model of communication than Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication.Taking The War Out Of Our Words (2009 Edition)I have found value in Rosenberg's lists of feelings and, in peripheral ways, in some of his exercises, among other things. However, while one of the stated aims of the process is to eliminate judgement and criticism, I respond to some of his dialogue as if there is judgement hidden within it. I also find his methods rather cumbersome.Taking the War Out of Our Words gives me a substantially different, much more positive experience. In the presence of Ellison's writing - explanation, description, exercises, examples, and so on - I find myself relaxing, and feeling safe even while I confront and acknowledge the ways in which I myself act defensively. Her book is very rich in detailed examples, and alive with individual voices. (It also has a wonderful index to the examples, so you can follow them from one part of the book to another.) I find encouragement and acceptance, as well as simple, clear steps I can immediately begin to apply to the way I say things. It has been my experience that these small changes often make a rapid difference.Ellison's process speaks more strongly to me than Rosenberg's, and I find it more gentle as well as clearer. I believe that her framework is simultaneously both more radical and simpler than Marshall Rosenberg's. To me, Rosenberg's system nibbles at the edges of our difficulties in communicating with each other, where Sharon Ellison's sweeps the rubble out of the center and starts rebuilding the structures of our communication, but in a way that makes an intuitive kind of sense.Ellison examines and identifies the fundamental structures of our languages (not only English, but many other languages as well) which, it seems, almost inevitably cause defensiveness between us, even when we don't mean them to. I find her tools profoundly practical and useful, and I find it easy to begin applying them; and even though the process of becoming significantly less defensive is a long one, and not very easy, the encouraging experience of little successes, here and there, helps keep me going. It also seems to me that achieving the very smallest changes, working with everyday issues, is in the end what creates the deepest shift.Despite my own preference for Sharon Ellison's paradigm and tools, I would not want to discourage anyone from trying Rosenberg's program. At the same time, I would encourage anyone who experiences any difficulty in applying his system not to give up on the hope of learning a more peaceable and open way of communication, but to have a look at Ellison's book and see if you find it more helpful."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"This book was recommended to me by several friends in healing professions, and also by a business litigation accountant. Having a great deal of respect for these people I decided to give it a try.To me the book is about elements of threat, judgementalism or violence that are unintentionally included in the language that we speak and hear, and think. The book suggests that by clearly separating factual observations, feelings, needs, and the resulting requests, acknowledging vulnerable feelings and needs, and using listening tools, we can defuse confrontations, become more effective communicators, and become more at peace with others and with ourselves.My speaking and thinking patterns are deeply entrenched over many years, and I expect that it may take at least a few passes through reading and applying the book before I see many benefits, but I am impressed with this book and think that the potential benefits are worth the investment of time."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"NVC or Non-Violent Communication is build on a solid foundation. This book was written quite simply, so that anyone might learn the techniques of speaking clearly so that others can understand what you think, what you feel, and what you want. It also offers valuable information on \\"empathic listening\\" - rather than just parroting back what someone says to demonstrate that you HEARD, you go a step further to express that you understand what someone is thinking and feeling. I know several people who have gone to NVC workshops and practice NVC regularly, and they are incredible supporters of this technique. They say that while initially your conversations may seem rather stiff and formulaic, that as the technique becomes more natural to you, that it is simply a clear way of understanding yourself and communicating in a way that others can hear and accept more readily. It is a wonderful technique, I have found it helpful, however it really does not allow for the full depth of emotion and thoughts that create that emotion. Sometimes thoughts are not logical, but may be underlying schema or beliefs that each individual may not want to even acknowledge, never mind express out loud. The book and technique are excellent, but this all needs to be refined a bit more to really allow emotion to be expressed, not just intellectually identified. \\"I am feeling anxious because my need for security is not met, will you please contribute to the rent?\\" is very clear, but the speaker does not actually show their anxiety. I suppose if we all learn to communicate without allowing ourselves to express the emotions we are feeling (like Vulcans) then our communication will be more clear and peaceful. It will also lack a certain amount of depth. Also, not every conflict can be resolved with NVC - the author begins by talking about how he mediated discussions with Palestinians and Israelis, and street gangs who were in gang wars. That sounds pretty dramatic, to even get some folks into the same room. However, NVC may not solve the problems that lead to the conflicts. It may allow for a greater understanding between sides. The book could have been shorter, with fewer personal anecdotes. The method is sound, and just needs a bit of refining. What a great way to build a bridge and develop understanding between people!"},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"Nonviolent communication is a very effective tool for anyone looking to create a bridge of understanding and establishing healthy boundaries through thoughts and words. It moves away from the aggressive, competitive and confrontational models that so many people learn from parents, in dysfunctional relationships and at work. My cousin took \\"Assertiveness Training\\" back in the 70s. She said that NVC though took that to the next level by introducing compassion, understanding and nonjudgment though observations, feelings, needs and requests.I've recommended this series to many people [including my cousin] and especially those who have problems with coworkers and bosses. I thought it amusing that even one of Dr Rosenberg's participants conceded that working with parents can be the biggest NVC challenge of all. Nonviolent communication may not be the solution, but it does help.One particular story Dr Rosenberg imparts among many is about how his grandmother -- a Jewish immigrant for whom English was a second language -- invited a homeless man into the house for a bit of food and rest. When she asked the man his name, he said, \\"Jesus the Lord.\\" Without a hint of irony or judgment, the grandmother introduced the man to the rest of the family as Jesus. She fed him and gave him a place to stay without a second thought for his gruff appearance or his unusual name. In her own way, by living NVC everyday, she provided the framework for Dr Rosenberg's works.A few items to nitpick -- and by no means a slight or a reason not to buy the audiobook. In fact, go ahead and buy it now.Sometimes using NVC language can seem a bit stilted and unnatural. For example Dr Rosenberg often says the phrase, \\"This meets my need to...\\" It works in writing and even when Dr Rosenberg says it. But personally, it sounds stilted and just doesn't quite roll off the tongue for many of us. Instead, I personally say, \\"This works for me. Does this solution work for you?\\"Another nitpick: I paraphrase a bit but Dr Rosenberg gives one particular sentence as an example of violent communication: \\"Minorities don't take care of their property.\\" Then he offers a nonviolent-communication example: \\"I've never seen the minority family down the street take out the trash.\\" I wondered if bringing up that the family a \\"minority\\" is truly germaine. Is bringing up a source of division and stereotype such a race or nationality truly nonviolent or would it be more kind to refer to the family as \\"the Smith Family\\" or even as \\"the family two doors down\\"?Last small nitpick [and a bit of a spoiler]: Dr Rosenberg tells a compelling story of a patient who was uncommunicative and unresponsive due to severe psychological trauma. Dr Rosenberg describes how the woman finally broke through by writing a note to him in perfect NVC language. \\"Help me to express what is going on within me...\\" Not only did she become NVC fluent after 4 or 5 treatments, but she had the fine motor skills to write this out. So why then did she seem unable to pass him the note until he had to pry her fingers open? There must be more to the story than what we're being told, but it is a bit of a small plot loophole in the overall scheme of what is a great tool for communication and for expressing compassion while at the same time holding one's own integrity.This audiobook introduced me to the grander realm of NVC and I've since attended some workshops where \\"jackal\\" and\\" giraffe\\" are introduced. Like me, you may find that you already use many of these techniques, but NVC just ads a few more tools to the toolbox."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"I highly recommend this book. It offers great insight to the root of conflict and how easily it can be transformed with effective communication.

It has profoundly transformed my life and I believe it has the potential to transform the world. I realize that these may seem like extreme statements, particularly the second one. But I mean them both quite soberly. In my personal life, it helped me to heal old ruptures such as one between my mother and myself that enabled the two of us to have a deep close connection when her life ended. Other very difficult relationships have become joyful and more harmonious. It helped me develop an empathic connection with myself and other people. On one level, shifting from judgments of ourselves and others to consciousness of what we are feeling and needing and requesting to make life more wonderful might seem simplistic, but it promotes a process within oneself and others (and I have witnessed the transformative power of this process in others as well as myself) that has remarkable depth. If you want to enrich your experience of life, and improve the quality of your connection with others, and promote peace by living it, I cannot recommend this book too highly!"},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"I enjoyed many parts of the book, especially the common theme of becoming much more intentional in how you communicate your needs to others.

It is, however, definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"I am so glad I stumbled on this book last year.

Rogers' concept of absolute respect for the client helped me assist persons and couples in reaching their potential. I am delighted to find Marshall Rosenberg's book--a book that lifts Rogers' concepts out of the therapeutic setting and establishes it in the world of common communication. His writing is clear, and his examples are helpful. I recently used this book in a class that was examining ways of establishing islands of non-violence in a violence-saturated society.I have one complaint. Rosenberg implies that a careful use of nonviolent communication could rid our relationships of anger. Anger can, indeed, be destructive. Anger needs to be channeled, not eliminated, and nonviolent communication can assist in achieving this goal. But eliminating it altogether? Is there a spouse in this universe who wants to be married to someone who never becomes angry?So I encourage people to read and respond to this fine book. Know, however, that nonviolent communication, while it can deepen and enrich our relationships, will not turn those relationships into a boring flatness.Andrew J.

In other words there is no way to say &#34;you are wrong.&#34; In our culture we so often talk to each other in ways that imply goodness or badness, guilt or innocense.

People gather in groups and work on stating their needs and feelings to each other. People do this because we are all conditioned culturally and religiously to deny our feelings and needs and then talk at each other out of those adpative denials and what we wind up doing is having conflict.We don't want to be emotionally vulnerable and we don't want to admit we have needs. So we posture, pretend, rationalize, idealize, romanticize and spend our lives missing the point of being humans. Together. So how does this work? Why does this work? I'd say the keystone of it for me is that we cannot really truly have compassion for another unless we have it for ourself. We cannot have it for ourself if we are denying our feelings and needs. If we don't even know that our feelings are connected to our needs and we don't even know that's life and truth. All our neurotic adaptations that lead us to argue, condemn, judge, accuse and waste life trying to be right to an imaginary audience in our narcissistic mind's eye (sounds like I've been there) are a complete waste of the gift of being.So thank you Marshall and I've got the feelings and needs lists printed out and some people in the family are going to give it a try when we gather. Instead of our usual verbal abuse and denial, we'll just give it a try.

This sort of communication, based on true empathy, and caring for others and ourselves, is critical for the earth's human community at this time, as we strive to form a global, connected humanity. If we don't learn this way of communication, we are in big trouble."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"This book is a fabulous introduction to the notion that we can help create a more peaceful world by improving our ability to communicate effectively and compassionately. Rosenberg points out a disturbing fact: we have more words in our language with which to judge each other (and ourselves) than we do to express our emotions. By learning to feel and express our emotions with words, we become less likely to act aggressively from these same emotions. When we can honestly say, \\"I feel angry when you speak to me like that,\\" we become more able to own our feelings and less likely to escalate the conflict through assumptions, accusations, and violence.Like many other books I have read recently, this book helps us to understand that by really being present in the moment, we gain access to the ability to steer the course of the future. Typically, we are barely listening to the other, especially in conflict. Instead, we are preparing our rebuttal, mentally judging the other, chewing on the past, or worrying about the future. This impedes our ability to be truly present for what is going on. The ironic thing is that once we get in the moment, our presence and attention is often all that is needed to de-escalate the conflict.Rosenberg provides many entertaining and inspiring anecdotes to demonstrate the many ways one can use Non-Violent Communication. From conflicts in the Middle East and Central Africa to the classroom, from parenting to prisons to self-defense, NVC proves over and over that violence comes from lack of connection. Learning to facilitate that connection can decrease violence, increase compassion, and help people grow into more compassionate and community oriented lives.I found this book inspiring and educational. Rosenberg helps me to see that we can help others heal just by how we move and communicate in the world. By modeling effective and compassionate communication, we can create more peace in our own lives, and help to create a less violent future for us all.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in connecting more deeply with the people in their lives. It is especially useful for people in positions of power, who can learn to act in a way that empowers and inspires others. Parents, educators, health care professionals, managers, mediators... really everyone could use a little help in communicating in a way that enriches life for us all."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"Very enlightening and has dramatically improved my marriage, work and family relationships.

Great and easy reading to improve and understand communication."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"This is an excellent book in many ways. The author is teaching a language of authenticity or of the heart. The purpose of teaching this language is that people will find it easier to express their desires in a way that does not make others defensive so that they may better get their needs met.The author teaches that it is not good to flatter people or to give them encouragement like \\"way to go\\". I have a hard time understanding why this is. He says that things should not be viewed as good and bad but more relative. This theme of relativity is repeated throughout the book as he gives examples of how people can use relativity and empathy to get needs met.I do not think that ALL things are relative though, and I do not appreciate his example of a battered wife coming to him for help and him teaching her to treat her husband with more empathy as a way to keep from getting beaten as the end all be all solution to her problem. In that situation I still think it is wise for the woman to get out of the situation where she is getting beaten.I think that alot of this authors tools would be so helpful to law enforcement workers who need to diffuse possibly volatile situations.The goods in this book far outweigh some of the radical danger zones that I think an extreme relativist could get into with it.I think it does help to stop looking at everything as good and evil and to recognize that much of behavior is habitual and that habits can be changed. This is an idea that the author bases his workshops, books, tapes, and retreats on. It is an idea from the famous woman philosopher Ruth Benedict. He never once though gives her credit for this idea (as far as I have seen). I think that is kinda sad and borders on plagiarism but I do not think that Ruth Benedict is still alive. I only know of her philosophy from a beginners philosophy course that I took and she was one of the many philosophers on ethics."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"Participating in a weekend workshop on Nonviolent Communication about 15 years ago, before the first book was ever published, changed my life ever since. I was so excited when I later discovered a book had been published. I have since given this book as a gift many times. In almost every case (the cases in which the person actually read the book!) the person had a very similar experience to my own. This book will help you see communication (and relationships) in a whole new way. As a therapist I have found this book to be helpful to clients with anger management difficulties and problems with conflict in relationships. It also promotes self-awareness and self-acceptance. It takes practice, but once you understand and internalize the general attitude promoted in this book, it sticks. And then it seeps into your life like a soothing balm. That's right, like a soothing balm. Try it; you'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"I think there are some valuable insights and tools in Nonviolent Communication, and I'm heartened to see a yearning growing among people, the desire to be able to talk to and listen to each other more fully, freely and openly. At the same time, for someone who wants to learn to talk to others (and themselves, as well!) in a more open and less defensive way, in a way that makes it easier for people to speak openly to each other, I find Sharon Ellison's book, Taking the War Out of Our Words: Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a much clearer, more complete and more effective paradigm and method for a non-defensive model of communication than Marshall Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication.I have found value in Rosenberg's lists of feelings and, in peripheral ways, in some of his exercises, among other things. However, while one of the stated aims of the process is to eliminate judgement and criticism, I respond to some of his dialogue as if there is judgement hidden within it. I also find his methods rather cumbersome.Taking the War Out of Our Words gives me a different and considerably more positive experience. In the presence of Ellison's writing - explanation, description, exercises, examples and so on - I find myself relaxing, and feeling safe even while I confront and acknowledge the ways in which I myself act defensively. I find encouragement and acceptance, as well as simple, clear steps I can immediately begin to apply to the way I say things. It has been my experience that these small changes often make a rapid difference.Ellison's process speaks more strongly to me than Rosenberg's, and I find it more gentle as well as clearer. I believe her framework is simultaneously both more radical and simpler than Rosenberg's. To me, Marshall Rosenberg's system nibbles at the edges of our difficulties in communicating with each other, where Sharon Ellison's sweeps the rubble out of the center and starts rebuilding the structures of our communication, but in a way that makes an intuitive kind of sense.Ellison examines and identifies the fundamental structures of our language that, it seems, almost inevitably cause defensiveness between us, even when we don't mean them to. I find her tools profoundly practical and useful, and I find it easy to begin applying them; and even though the process of becoming significantly less defensive is a long one, and not very easy, the encouraging experience of little successes - some of them quite unexpected - helps keep me going. It also seems to me that achieving the smallest changes, working with everyday issues, is in the end what seems to create the real shift.Despite my own preference for Sharon Ellison's paradigm and tools, I would not want to discourage anyone from trying Rosenberg's program. At the same time, I would encourage anyone who experiences difficulty in applying his system not to give up on the hope of learning a more open and peaceable way of communication, but to have a look at Ellison's book and see if you find it more helpful."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"This book has been the missing link for me in my journey to heal others through touch and to also heal the wounds of my past. I have studied much in the subjects of Buddhism, psychology and other subjects related to our internal world, but it was this book that helped open me to my own need to feel my own hurts equally as I have created a space for others. Having had an extremely violent father, I had become a protector--my role as a child w/my siblings. But, until this book, I had never given a voice to my own needs regarding those experiences. There is not enough that I could say that would express the freedom and light heartedness I experience everyday. I feel as though I've been given a second chance to really find a partner for my life who wants to create a truly spirtual relationship with me. I had never thought that was possible until now. I will be forever greatful to Mr. Rosenberg and to the therapist who could see me deeply enough to suggest the book. I'm looking forward to receiving my cd/dvd study course in the mail soon so that I may assist others. Thank you so much."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"I have read this book over and over and always find a new layer to discover, like uncovering the multiple layers of needs when offering empathy.

I say all because you may unknowingly benefit because someone in your life read it and is following Rosenberg's suggestions. If you find that you are getting along better with a friend, a family member, a colleague or a co-worker it may well be that you are responding to the communication style being taught in this book.But don't wait for someone else to read Nonviolent Communication to clear your relationship problems. Jump in now. You may have a quick temper or harsh way of speaking that you know about. You may consider yourself a kind and gentle person and are baffled by problematic relationships. You may feel resentful because you withhold your feelings and desires to appease and go along with someone else's agenda yet still suffer in negative communications.You may be self critical, harsh and verbally violent in your inner talk to yourself about what you perceive as your shortcomings. The harshness within yourself about yourself can contribute to your belief that such harshness is normal. You may not realize that the level of harshness you consider normal expresses itself as violent communications to other people.Rosenberg offers compelling stories and simple steps to communicate to others and yourself in a clearer, empathic, vulnerable and strong way. He shows you how to move through surface storms and knee jerk reactions to genuine connection and understanding.This is a book that takes on the challenging task of real peacemaking - with others and with yourself. Making peace does not mean ending a battle. Making peace means creating a climate of communication that allows for differences and honors all parties with respect and understanding.Rosenberg's book is not a solution to all the human created problems in this world, but it's a great contribution. I recommend it as a helping guide for individuals, families, people in therapy and in recovery work from addictions, for employers and employees. I think it would be wonderful to teach these practices in schools from kindergarten on up to graduate levels.Rosenberg shows us that it's never too late to fully enrich our lives with the gifts that come with peace and compassion in our relationships and with ourselves.P.S.

You can listen to the disk that speaks to your needs and stop and absorb as you progress. Marshall Rosenberg has a unique way of speaking slowly enough and plain enough so you can understand and really take in the messages of feeling and thinking with compassion and empathy. I recommend this book on cd to everyone. Think what a great place this planet would be if we were to all embrace and practice living through compassion and empathy towards all things. Our society really needs this quiet and thoughtful way of being right now.

If only for how I listen to, and shape my internal dialogue, this book is an excellent resource. There is never going to be one cure all book. No life is perfectly executed. Everyone can benifit from perspectives outside of their own. Read this book and learn it's teachings then read other books, rinse and repeat. Fill your life toolbox, and enjoy all of the moments."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"The teachings in this book are easy to read and comprehend. I have applied them immediately in my workplace and was delighted with the results. It adds on as a great management skill. I particularly liked the chapter on \\"Anger\\". Out of experience and observations I have noted that when one comes away angry out a conversation one tends to look for a sympathizer. The sympathizer is usually a close friend or a relative who listens \\"understandingly\\" to all the details of the event. Feeling understood by the listener more bad points about the person who \\"made\\" one mad in the first place begin to emerge. The listener usually will add on some social values and declare the behavior absolutely unacceptable. Hence the anger is legitimized the relationship with the person who \\"made\\" one mad becomes irreparably damaged. Empathy works very well in diffusing the situation and leaves all possibilities open to express one's feelings and get what one needs. I used this in my family to help a loved one to resolve an issue when she came back angry with somebody at work. With \\"Nonviolent Communication\\" at work, She is still friends with the person who she thought was responsible for her anger.I think if Mahatma Gandhi had read this book he would have been delighted at Dr. Rosenberg's contribution to Non Violence."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"When I am in a conflict, there are really just two things I need to do - listen to the person I am talking to, and make requests from him or her. Marshall's NVC provides a framework for both. You may ask \\"why would I need to have a framework for such simple actions?\\" The answer is simple - in the heat of a conflict I can easily fall into the trap of blaming or accusation or name-calling, none of which lead to resolution. If I use the NVC framework, I can keep a level head and focus on the solution. These CDs have really improved my interactions in my personal life and at work. The only downside is Marshall's soothing voice, which is too easy to tune out after 5 hours of listening.

The new copy (second edition, paperback) is full of abbreviations and full of marketing statements about all the wonderful things Nonviolent Communication supposedly does for you. Superficially, the book sounds great. However, applying the technique of Nonviolent Communication day to day is much more difficult than it seems.

I read about 60 pages of this book then skimmed through the rest of it and realized I was wasting my time and had read it all before. Unless you have never read the first book on anger-management, group communications, interpersonal relationships or even a basic primer on Cognitive Therapy, you will not learn anything from this book. It has it points that have been well taken from all the original works that have gone before this and if you can get past the self-aggrandizing stories, you can get to the basic information.

What makes Rosenberg's update worth reading is its articulation of a means of recognizing in our selection and interpretation of language the clues to revealing our real human needs. The book offers a framework for gently uncovering the \\"viruses of language form\\" in which we either lose ourselves or ignore others in unwitting emoto-linguistic ignorance. It reveals, by extensive reference to Rosenberg's own rich experience in mediation and conflict resolution around the world, how these conventions of form often obscure our true needs and those of others rather than help us discover what these needs really are so that we can cooperate to get them met.Acknowledging that the insight and empathy, whether for other or self, required to do this is rare, Rosenberg's book will nevertheless be an enlightenment for almost all of us of an extraordinarily practical kind. It is also an inspiration and an encouragement to try out the \\"NVC skills of language and listening\\" he skillfully advocates and illustrates. If NVC leaves you wondering where in the real work, market, and election places of the world you are likely to be safe doing so, that can be a stimulation to discover the power of Rational Emoto-Linguistics to ground your \\"I\\" concept in a yet deeper truth."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"To me, Nonviolent Communication, the book, is a superb guide to healing, and life, helping me to be how I want to be in the world. I had a hard time with the language the first time I read it, and I know that some of it could be said more beautifully, but I've read it several times now (the second time I started with the last chapter I liked it more than the first), and given it to people. Here's why:When I read this book, I found an assertion -- all human beings, just like you, wish for their own well-being AND for others' well-being AND take joy in being able to contribute to others' well-being. This is a core value or belief for me and I suspect that if you really can't accept that premise, the book would not be so useful and healing.The book goes on to show examples of thinking that gets in the way of living this core value. Most wonderful of all, it offers tools to help us live in accordance with our values. Some of the tools are: the idea that feelings point to met or unmet needs; the list of needs; the differentiation of needs from strategies to meet needs; examples of how to find the feelings and needs in some common scenarios; the insistence on separating observations from judgments; the idea of listening for the needs underlying a person's words; the explanation of feelings as having internal origin rather than being 'caused' by others, etc.The huge steps I've taken in the past 3 years toward peace, self-acceptance, and realization of my potential seem to have come from attending workshops and classes based on this book. When I re-read Nonviolent Communication, I find bits I missed the other times.The chapter on self-empathy is particularly helpful on the problem of self-acceptance.

If you deal with anger issues this would be a good book to help you rethink your responses."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"Rosenberg has written many great books, all potential game-changers, whether for family therapy or conflict resolution between warring factions.My minor reservation, maybe not so minor, is that it is mostly only about how to express when something is wrong, albeit without telling the other person they're wrong.However, it tries to teach how to do this in the most compassionate and effective way possible, so both parties go away feeling their needs are met, which would be terrific.In this book, no one is ever wrong; everyone is doing his/her best. Much like family therapist Carl Alosko in his book, Beyond Blame.[Cross-referencing NVC with Meditation is another story. In brief, we do need Mindfulness to practice NVC(please see below)]:One very big difference with Rosenberg's NVC is that Alosko says never to go to a family member or spouse and say, \\"Why did you or didn't you do XYZ?\\"Simply because the tone in saying that usually involves an implication of wrongness in the other. Those are toxic words, says Carl.In Non-Violent Communication or NVC, we are allowed to check things out and say e.g., \\"I noticed that you left the lights on last night. When you do that I feel confused and begin to wonder if we are on the same page. I need for us to have a little bit of consistency. Would you be willing to talk about what we want to do re: lighting?'Here I must be careful of my tone(no eye-rolling:) and body language. It is not enough to talk the talk without walking the walk of compassionate communication.So, \\"Observation, Feeling, Need, Request\\" is how it goes. Or as my husband said half-jokingly but much more conversationally,\\"I noticed you walked into my office. I feel anxious because i'm needing space. Would you be willing to leave?\\"The trick really is to make it more conversational and my husband is much more the natural diplomat than I. However NVC isn't about strict diplomacy.We are not tricking anyone. More to the point, we are putting all our cards on the table.Most of us have been trained that if we show weakness by expressing a feeling nor a need then we will be laughed at or attacked, so in any societyawareness of even our own feelings and needs can be very difficult. We are trained to suck it up and go out and get 'em. Or get it.So identifying feelings and needs means psychological insight into our own feelings. I believe most of us do not do it automatically. It can take time evenfor experienced practitioners, who will sometimes need cooling off periods to empathize with themselves first before communicating, just as much as lay-people do.It's helpful to say, \\"I'm too angry to talk now; can we discuss it later?\\" Rather than stonewalling with \\"the silent treatment\\", which can be experienced as hurtful, too.[InI Don't Want to Talk About It: Overcoming the Secret Legacy of Male DepressionI learned that \\"alexithymia\\" means not recognizing one's own feelings.]So yes a lot of work here; and the easy read is not half so easily executed in daily life. But I think NVC is a great manual.Here's my caveat. Rosenberg waits until Chapter Ten to talk about Appreciation. Marshall Rosenberg is a great man and I believe his one blind spotis that in his admittedly very great life-work of MEDIATING NEEDS for people, it all focuses on what's wrong. If we only work with what's wrong,we will be in danger of making the other person think that we are all about what's wrong with them and not enough about what's right with them.Not that anyone is right or wrong, here; NVC is ALL beyond good and evil, or rightness and wrongness.When someone is \\"evil\\" we call that \\"using a hurtful strategy\\" but no one is intrinsically evil.Negotiation can begin, once both parties' needs are articulated to both parties' satisfaction. With practice, NVC gets us to that point."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"Nonvioldent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg is the foundation text for those who are interested in communicating in an effective manner.

From rereading it, I've learned: emotional literacy, to readily identify my own judgments, and more.For NVC learners, I recommend listening to Marshall on CDNonviolent Communication- hearing his stories in that format allowed me to learn the material much better than the book."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"I must have listened to this CD a half dozen times. Often, when I am upset by the outcome of some conversation in my life, I'll find just the right chapter from this CD and a few minutes later I'll have the \\"Aha!\\" insight as to what went wrong in my conversation.Marshall is hypnotic and enchanting - its worth the price to hear his voice."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"I am really enjoying this book.I feel that young people (18 and under) should read this book as well, because I am currently 18. It contains valuable information that is helpful for everyday life. I am currently trying to practice the NVC process, sometimes I forget but It is a nice book! I tell everyone, even my friends about the book, It makes you look at life a different way, instead of out for wants in life, it is all about your needs and other people. If all the people in the world have this book and practice, the world will be a BETTER place!!"},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"This book helped me see that judging and blaming is not a recipe for happiness. An open exchange of feelings and needs is. This book could help nearly all humans find the peace to stay compassionate in the most trying of circumstances by changing the way we hear words. Insults aren't insults. They are a way people communicate needs when they are highly disconnected from their feelings. I found this book to be very beautiful and I would hope everyone gets a chance to read it."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"The understanding that has come to me from Marshall Rosenberg's work, Nonviolent Communication, has been transformational. As my experience and understanding of this work sinks into my bones, and becomes part of my consciousness, I see it as a deeply spiritual practice, and one that helps me to live in alignment with values that I work to uphold .....compassion, empathy, non-judgement.While my initial understanding focused on learning this language, it quickly became clear to me that this was far more than mastering a way of speaking, and required one to be clear with one's self about what one's own \\"needs\\" are, and to own them as such is to free ourselves of the cycle of criticism and blame that is so destructive to relationships.Non-violent Communication offers a tool that allows one to consider what others are doing or sayingthat makes it possible to actually listen rather than react. This is like tossing a stick in the spokes of a wheel,interrupting a pattern of reaction that often leaves both people feeling frustrated and not understood.NVC has taught me to hear in the same way that drawing has taught me to see.To have the experience of being treated by one who lives this language of understanding is to feel known, appreciated and to feel valued. That is powerful. One is left feeling deep gratitude for the gift of that understanding. How good is that?!"},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"What began as a search for a better discipline system for our 6 yr old has turned out to be a philosophical approach and communication tool that is transforming how we relate to each other and ourselves.We originally set out on this journey because our current discipline method with our 6 yr old (a reward/consequence system) was no longer working and we were getting into escalating cycles of defiance/threats/punishment with him. We began with the small booklet Raising Children Compassionately - and I think it helped to have this brief overview before plunging into the NVC book.Like other things worth doing, this one has taken consistent work and patience on our part. The first week - in which we were letting go of our old ways and clumsily trying out some of the new ways - felt, at times, like being on a turbulent river in a small boat with just a couple of wooden paddles to steer us around the rapids. Our son was acting out (e.g., refusing to do HW, whining, arguing) and instead of punishing, threatening and coercing him we were trying to problem solve using the methods - and more importantly - the goals - of NVC. I am glad we hung in there during that transition period and patiently and imperfectly kept at it. Although it was taking a lot more time and effort, we could tell - even in the beginning - that the approach was working as well as our old \\"1-2-3 you lose a privilege\\" chart - minus the hurt feelings, tantrums, and moping that resulted.After about 2-3 weeks, we began to notice unexpected side benefits. We still had to work hard to resolve situations every time our needs did not coincide with those of our child - but we were finding that we were not nearly as drained at the end of the day as when we had been exerting our control over him and aiming for obedience. At the same time, as we were applying the system and actively working on the approach, we began to communicate with each other (as a couple) in a more peaceful, respectful, and less blaming manner. Other small benefits followed. A phone call with mom about a difficult subject went surprisingly well. A visit with the in-laws was unusually smooth and light. I was able to re-establish communication with a colleague I had been sort of avoiding at work because of what I had perceived as his caustic ways. Even our 6 yr old began to speak to his 2 yr old sister with more patience and kindness.Most interestingly of all, I have begun to feel more connected to myself: to what I need, feel, and why.I want to emphasize that the system has not been a magic wand but more like a road map to a way of being. We have been very imperfect at it, losing our temper and our connections with each other many times since we set out on this journey a month ago. However, unlike other behavioral systems, in which \\"inconsistency\\" seems to erode positive outcomes, every successful effort at connection, using NVC, has been like a paving stone that, once put down, has remained in place patiently waiting for the next one. The result has been a slowly emerging road of consciousness and connection with each other that we are able to walk on even as we build it."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"A friend recommended Nonviolent Communication to me, after seeing how much I enjoyed Crucial Conversations. I was at first skeptical, but wound up being completely won over by Marshal Rosenberg's theories. Crucial Conversations is a cookbook of communication techniques that usually work... Whereas Nonviolent Communication goes much deeper into the fundamentals of human nature -- needs, desires, observations, judgment, empathy -- and helps you understand why these techniques work.I'd recommend seeing Rosenberg in person, and using this book as a reference. Despite a legion of worshipers, he's incredibly pragmatic and down-to-earth. In contrast, this book feels a bit new-agey. Some of the sample dialog is a bit contrived, and it could use a better quick-reference. However, his whimsical style certainly helps you remember what's important.The real-life stories and dialogs were amazing! He can communicate effectively with a couple having marriage problems, psychopathic killers, gangs, warlords, or even someone in a near catatonic state. Empathy is the key: once somebody feels that you understand them, and that you are trying to feel what they feel, then they will be more more likely to speak honestly with you to resolve conflict. Empathy trumps psychology every time. However, it also requires you to suspend all judgment that the other person is a monster -- merely another human being trying to fulfill their needs in the only way they know how.The rules behind nonviolent communication are simple, and believable, but the application is extremely difficult. Our brains are wired for survival, not dialog. If I were speaking to a psychopath, the last thing on my mind would be his needs! However, Marshall gives several examples on how empathy is the most effective weapon when you want to defuse a dangerous situation.Its instinctive to make snap judgments when we feel threatened. It takes a lot of courage and practice to do what Marshall does... I can only hope to be half as good as him."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"I got so much out of this book, I have never been able to communicate with anyone without it becoming an argument or a fight.

I understand their feelings and thier needs. This book has really changed my way of communicating. Since I've read this book, My wife and I have not had any problems communicating.

My husband and I now have tools for far more than just our relationship together. We've used NVC techniques for decision-making and found a win-win solution to a complex problem that left everyone feeling like their needs had been heard and addressed, if not completely met. This alone was worth the price of the book!I think the NVC work is deceptively simple, but not at all easy. It's taking a lot of awareness on my part to respond differently from my habitual ways. When I do, the results are amazing. To paraphrase the Rolling Stones, I don't always get what I want, but I get what I need.No conflict necessary to enjoy the benefits! I'm discovering that NVC even works with acquaintances who, after all, just want to feel heard.I really, REALLY wish my parents had communicated this way with me when I was growing up. But hey, it's not too late for me to change myself.I will be getting the NVC home training CDs as soon as it comes out."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"This is an excellent book in many ways. The author is teaching a language of authenticity or of the heart. The purpose of teaching this language is that people will find it easier to express their desires in a way that does not make others defensive so that they may better get their needs met.The author teaches that it is not good to flatter people or to give them encouragement like \\"way to go\\". I have a hard time understanding why this is. He says that things should not be viewed as good and bad but more relative. This theme of relativity is repeated throughout the book as he gives examples of how people can use relativity and empathy to get needs met.I do not think that ALL things are relative though, and I do not appreciate his example of a battered wife coming to him for help and him teaching her to treat her husband with more empathy as a way to keep from getting beaten as the end all be all solution to her problem. In that situation I still think it is wise for the woman to get out of the situation where she is getting beaten.I think that alot of this authors tools would be so helpful to law enforcement workers who need to diffuse possibly volatile situations.The goods in this book far outweigh some of the radical danger zones that I think an extreme relativist could get into with it.I think it does help to stop looking at everything as good and evil and to recognize that much of behavior is habitual and that habits can be changed. This is an idea that the author bases his workshops, books, tapes, and retreats on. It is an idea from the famous woman philosopher Ruth Benedict. He never once though gives her credit for this idea (as far as I have seen). I think that is kinda sad and borders on plagiarism but I do not think that Ruth Benedict is still alive. I only know of her philosophy from a beginners philosophy course that I took and she was one of the many philosophers on ethics.The Cd is awful! He just goes on and on with no inflection in his voice and his teeth keep moving around in his mouth sliding off his gums which makes it hard at times to understand him. The cd of the book is about 10 cds of just him droning with no speech skills or organization when it comes to getting to his points."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"The book is somewhat corny, the examples border on ridiculous at times.But, I was trying it out with my husband. It was like a miracle. The minute I would use the techniques we would stop fighting, we began to express our affection for each other and were able to talk about things we'd never talked about before. The minute I would stop using it, we would start fighting again. I have taken conversations that were headed for the dumps, starting using these techniques and ended up with a very useful bonding experience. My husband won't try it though because when he read the book, he thought it sounded so stupid. But, he is sort of picking up the techniques I think from copying me."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"Life-changing. NVC is a wonderful approach! Highly, HIGHLY recommended!I grew up in an environment of critical, angry, blaming and disrespectful communication. So, that's what I knew how to do when my needs were not being met: blame others for not acting the 'right' way and 'making' me unhappy. Doesn't give much leverage for changing the situation, does it? I don't like treating people that way, they don't like it either, and those behaviors don't work very well for meeting my needs! I felt helpless, frustrated, guilty and angry, and learned to mostly withdraw and suffer in silence. Very unpleasant.Marshall's NVC approach shows me how to take responsibility for my emotions and reactions. When I'm unhappy, NVC tells me that my needs are not being met. NVC shows how to consciously figure out what I need, to distinguish which needs are my responsibility vs. needs that are reasonable to ask other people to help with, and how to connect with people in a respectful, loving and gentle way to get my and their needs met in a way that everyone is happy with.NVC also helps me handle people feeling angry at me: I work with them to understand and communicate their needs in a gentle, respectful way. Then I'm generally glad to help. Very win-win.I LOVE this approach!

Then I started reading it.The book is meant to be a handbook for carring on day to day communication with people in your life in a nonviolent way, which is defined as not passing judgment, making accusations, etc.The downside? The formula the book describes can seem a bit cheesy and mechanical at first. The scripts suggested are fairly specific and involve some langauge that will strike many as sort of garden-variety touchy-feely stuff (\\"When you say that, what I hear you saying is that . . .\\").But the underlying ideas about the importance of empathy, the unproductive nature of approaching communication (even argument) as adversarial, and the basic human decency that lies beneath the concepts are more important and can't be trivialized by what might seem like hokey language.Thorough-going cynics will not enjoy the book, but others will find some new ideas (and reminders of some basic common sense) that are useful.BTW, thre are a number of books that make some similar points, but do so using a martial arts analogy (which might seem odd, but is actually in keeping with the \\"nonviolent\\" ethos of this book). You might look at \\"Aikido for Everyday Life\\" and/or \\"Verbal Judo,\\" particularly if \\"Nonviolent Communication\\" sounds like it's just a bit too, well, wussy for you."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"This audiobook is a really neat exploration of how to communicate honestly to positive ends.The cds are dotted with Rosenberg relating conversations that employ each technique he discusses.

It sounded like exactly waht I had been looking for. I had been seeking solutions to better communicate with people and to also learn to listen better. My relationship needed to move in a new direction and I was willing to open my heart to the love that I new was dieing to spill out from me. My purpose has always been to motivate and inspire people to be more then they could ever imagine themselves to be and to know they are already that. But I did not know how to communicate to those who were still living from the programming of their painful lifes experiences. I realized through the process how I myself allowed old habits and feelings of the past to filter up when someone did not communicate to me properly. I then would feel that aching, painful anger coming up to respond in the way I had been taught. Marshalls book has been a wonderful tool to change the habits of the past and to truely have all of our needs met through love and respect. I hope that those who are seeking to truely find peace and happiness dig deep into these principles.

However, I know some people really relate to this approach and it does drive the model into memory.In terms of material, I think there are lots of other good books on the subject out there that pack more material into the same space.

Systematic approach to refresh our way of communication and cast new lights on improving interpersonal relationship."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"I love NVC. I teach at a community college and used it in a class for Adult High School and also taught it to staff. I felt unsure of myself and thought it would be better to train to do this in person with Marshall. However, insecure or not, Marshall's techniques DO work with anyone in my life, when I use them. One idea of Marshall's was adopted by a fellow teacher in her classes with great success. A former teenage student came to me and said she wanted to be able to talk to everyone in her life like this, but she can't because no one she knows talks this way and they'll think she's nuts. sigh. I also taught Byron Katie's \\"The Work\\" and think these two things have a lot in common and could be used together with great success.Marshall's book is easy to read, understand, and apply, although as I said, the application is not the way we do it normally. I used exercises in my class from companion books based on Marshall's work like, \\"The Compassionate Classroom\\" and got so much from them as well. Other books written by Marshall, specifically, \\"Speak Peace in a World of Conflict\\" and \\"Life-Enriching Education\\" need fresh examples and material. I do so wish that schools would adopt Marshall's NVC. I wanted my daughter to have an experience in school of being listened to with empathy, but it rarely happens. sigh.These books on NVC would be so helpful to anyone who is tired of complaining about relationships that don't work and wants to create an alternative. Go for it!"},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"Toward the end of the 1970's, while studying at the Gestalt Institute San Diego, I was treated by a colleague to an intriguing list of tips about the use of language from a group in Southern California calling itself the Center for Nonviolent Communication (CNVC). I found the list both intriguing and helpful, and I sought to practice what I could understand of it, but somehow never discovered the source. About 25 years later the work of Marshall Rosenberg surfaced for me and I was both delighted to reconnect with the NVC movement and also curious as to how the passage of so much time might have affected its development as well as my understanding and acceptance of the technology of communication that it forwards.In the passing years, I had changed substantially in my outlook toward humanistic as well as traditional psychology, shifting my thinking in the direction of linguistics and cognitive science. I immersed myself in intercultural studies and gained experiences working abroad that distanced me to some degree from my US ethnocentricity and provided cultural perspective on ideas and movements that I had formerly swallowed whole.Treated to a review copy of Nonviolent Communication, I feasted on it with an appetite whetted by years of waiting. At the same time I attempted to critique the cuisine with the palate I had developed since I had last tasted it. What did I discover?First, then as now, I was reminded that NVC remains an act of courage, courage to confront self and others with both honesty and empathy. This has not become easier in a culture that, from kindergarten to White House, seems to value shooting from the hip followed up by cover-your-ass strategies.Other important insights emerged. For years I had been uncomfortable with assertiveness training where a constantly whining, \\"You make me feel...\\" subtext is camouflaged under the rubric of \\"When you do/say X, I feel Y.\\" People were learning assertive scripts but practicing them punitively, that is, without the intentionality that would allow them to become constructive. It is this intentionality that is at the core of NVC. Life is frequently made up of competition and acquisitiveness, and trying to look good when clawing our way to the top tempts us to put on appearances of trendy communications practice in order look good and be liked.Being positive is the sine-qua-non of today's US culture. Put another way, the quickest route to becoming a pariah in both work and social contexts is to fail to show the obligatory positive attitude. Negative judgments, failure to look on the bright side, criticism, mourning failures and losses head a list of US capital sins. The result sounds good on the surface-positive feedback, lots of encouragement, and a steady diet of \\"atta' boy/atta' girl\\" language. Negativity is bad, violent, and destructive, while \\"Blessed are the positive!\\" is beatitude in US civil religion.Plenty of non-USians had been telling me that they felt attacked and aggressed upon by US \\"positivity.\\" My initial temptation was to dismiss their complaint as negativity or pessimism. However, listening to what they felt, I learned that having a positive attitude was not itself the problem. They felt that they were being judged, that their US interlocutor was taking a one-up or arrogant stance toward them. I had overlooked the fact that both positive and negative evaluations can be violent communication forms. Both play into the our addiction to judgment and dichotomous thinking. We fail to observe that the messages, \\"Great job,\\" and \\"You screwed up,\\" are identical acts of violence, the subtext being, \\"I judge you,\\" whether the judgment be positive or negative.Also often missed is that the injunction to be positive can be a power play used to neutralize opposition to one's ideas and plans. Criticize me, or look on the negative side of what I am doing or saying, and you are no longer my friend. We experience this on a daily basis, and recently saw it writ large, in US policy toward those countries that refused to support the US invasion of Iraq. While Rosenberg's book does not address the cultural phenomenon of US \\"positivity\\" directly, reading it that gave me the impetus to look for the feelings and the needs in people's reaction to the aggressive use of the \\"be positive\\" principle.It is not surprising that there is a national crisis of self-esteem when empowerment based on judgment is a norm of communication. As some critics of the drive for self-esteem in the California school system pointed out, self-esteem comes from acknowledged accomplishment and a growing sense of one's own competence, something that no number of feel-good strokes can replace. Particularly since USians believe they are defined by what they do rather than who they are and where they come from, there is an insatiable thirst for identity via accomplishment. Respect, not being dissed, is the yearning; positivity is the palliative. In this light, NVC can be without question an important tool for healing in the USA, as it teaches the attitudes as well as the practices that help us genuinely respect others as well as ourselves.In the past 50 or so years we have discovered or become conscious of language is the tool by which we create things in the first instance. Tangibles flow from intangibles. We construct and deconstruct with words. We can use them to create powerful visions and dreams. But the words create chimeras unless the intentionality and commitment to what we say is furthered by what we do and how we relate to each other. Power leads to the illusion that when we say, \\"Let there be light,\\" there will be light. However, being mortal, our sound bytes and adverts, propaganda and spin require closer examination, something they rarely receive in the general fog of okayness we strive to maintain. When some years ago, Richard Nixon uttered his famous denial of dishonesty by saying, \\"What I said then is now inoperative,\\" many of us got our first clue as to the possibility that big lies could happen here as well as elsewhere in the world. NVC is a call to use the creative power of words compassionately and ethically. Much still needs to be done to see how it can be more broadly applied in public life.The need to decide who is good and who is evil, to judge, and then to act, drives our national ethos to a stark \\"good guys vs. bad guys\\" paradigm of reality, personal, economic and political. Rosenberg astutely notes how we, \\"having learned that the bad guys deserve to be punished, take pleasure in watching this violence.\\" It is this addiction that we are struggling with daily as USians, particularly now that geopolitical and economic stress have become a constant. Self-righteousness arouses a latent Schadenfreude that relishes misfortune almost anywhere and anytime. We live in a time of small and great religious wars. Mastering NVC can keep us from turning observations and desires into non-negotiable absolutes, to keep the brush fires of disagreement from becoming deadly firefights.A few words from the interculturalist side... Separating observation from evaluation has long been recognized as essential to working across cultures. For people in my profession, NVC can contribute substantially to success at expatriation and global teamwork. There are only occasional notes in Nonviolent Communication about how local values affect how NVC is practiced in other cultural contexts. The international distribution of NVC practitioners and programs offers a very rich field for international understanding that deserves exploitation on a larger scale. Capturing NVC challenges, solutions, best practices and learnings as its core technology is applied around the world would be an exciting undertaking and a rich contribution to how we generate cultural competence. The next doctoral candidate I lay my influence on will get steered in this direction.As to the book itself, it is highly readable, definitely value for the money. Each chapter gives the reader the opportunity to grasp the principles explored by asking them to assess a list of statements in terms of their non-violent quality. Linear flow is relieved with occasional poetry or metaphor to remind us that there is beauty in what we are learning to practice. Key insights are visually highlighted so that you can flip through the book for a refresher course in a few minutes.It will be good for the world's trouble spots to know that Nonviolent Communication and not just tear gas canisters and weapons bear the cachet \\"Made in the USA.\\""},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"Hi!

Reinforcing the legitimacy, to say nothing of the primacy, of such desires can go quite a way toward reifying them in the minds of their holders, and thence to create an increased sense of entitlement. All that said, I still find the techniques described to be extremely useful, especially in such cases as \\"arguing about the toothpaste\\" when there is clearly a deeper and more important issue underlying a given conflict.

There is no \\"nu-nu, na-na\\" terms or phrases that tend to turn off or alienate the spiritual initiate or layman. The 4-step model is easy to understand both in terms of everyday use and in underlying logic of why and how it works. One is able to put the process into use from day one; indeed from page one. Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life is not the thickest book in my personal library (248 pages) but it is definitely the most effective when it comes to interpersonal communications, bar none."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"This is the most concise, most clearly written manual on interpersonal communication I've ever come across. It's an easy read, practical and to the point, and endorsed by the likes of Deepak Chopra and Arun Gandhi. The meat of the book is the suggestions it's making about how to best communicate with each other, how to ask for what you need, hear what others need, and evoke compassion and empathy in yourself and others. It's a book that I've needed to read for a long time; I can think of a number of occasions where I wish I had communicated better and been able to stay connected instead of disconnect in discouragement and anger. I've been challenged by this book...challenged to be the change I want to see in my world."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"This is one of those books that's potentially life-changing. Its conclusions, exercises, and recommendations are delightfully simple, and in some ways even obvious - except - the obvious isn't always so obvious, is it?One example that really struck home for me was the concept of positive feedback. Instead of just giving someone a compliment - \\"Wow, great work!\\" or \\"I really appreciate your help\\" - say specifically what was great about it or what you appreciated. \\"Without your help in the yard last weekend, I wouldn't have been able to get the fruit trees pruned in time to get all the branches out for curbside pickup. I really want to thank you for helping me meet that deadline.\\"This is only one of the truly meaningful ways that Nonviolent Communication can help you make a difference in your relationships with others and can help you really get your requests and needs *heard,* *understood,* and *acted on* by others. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"This book is the most practical book I have ever read, and one of the most powerful. I hate the title, because I interpret the \\"non-violent\\" part as being abusive... but this books is really about Compassionate Communication. I think EVERYONE should read this, and am using it to teach my 2 and 3 year old how to communicate. So often we focus on vocabulary and grammar, but don't realize there is so much more to communication. I hope to get them grounded in these concepts early on, so they don't have to spend so much time having to unlearn or relearn as an adult. I have read many other books, and they all offer generic advice such as \\"listen empathetically\\" which is great advice, but doesn't provide insight into HOW to do it. THIS BOOKS IS ALL ABOUT THE \\"HOW\\" TO COMMUNICATE. I really appreciate the examples, and 'homework' type assignments. I was profoundly impacted by the lesson on taking responsibility for my INTERPRETATION of what others say. Previously, I have been told \\"you give power to others to let them make you feel guilty, angry, etc.\\" In this more [traditional] explanation, others still are making me feel some emotion. Rosenberg helped point out that I really do have control of my own feelings - it's not what others say, it's how we interpret it. I have control over my own interpretations. There are very view jerks out there who are purposely trying to hurt us... why do we interpret, particularly from our loved ones, that they are trying to hurt us? We should seek to clarify... \\"when you say that, using that tone of voice, I hear this ... is that what you meant?\\" Many friends have commented to me, \\"you and your husband communicate so well together... how do you do it?\\" And I refer this book. I would buy it in cases and give it away to everyone if I could.Regarding some of the negative reviews:I find it interesting that one review comments this book doesn't give credit to any previous work. I would have found it helpful if the reviewed provided additional resources to direct others too - whether we like the book or not - we could all use help communicating better. Why trash the book, but not provide specific alternatives?Yes, it provides a list of specific words to use, but I found this extremely helpful and illustrative as examples discussed in the book, and not an end all be all list of words to use. I don't think the author was limiting at all."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"This is a good book, and you get the gist of the material, although I have heard from people who have attended Marshall B Rosenberg's workshops or lectures that he is more convincing in person than on the printed page.

But I'm going to try!"},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"This is an important well-written book on a subject both individuals and nations could benefit from knowing more about.

Wow!! what a better place we would live in!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"I didn't really like this book. Although the skills described are useful, the author's style is incredibly condescending and arrogant. I felt like a dumb child at the back of the class all the way through. And some of the examples given of \\"real life\\" situations are ridiculous. As if you would ever, in a group of people at a function, tell the person talking that you find what they are saying to be unnecessary and uninteresting. Well, not if you don't mind not having any friends or business contacts. Honesty should only go so far in my opinion. I'm sure there are many other better books if you want to learn some good communication skills."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"Excellent tools to speak your mind without causing conflict . Also allows you to be aware of your communication methods and to improve on them. Good book!"},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"I did like this book, but I've also had some communication training before and this was pretty similar.One of the things I didn't like about the book was that it focused more on what works rather than what does not. To me this is like people who say America is the land of opportunity. Yes, many people do find success, but most don't. Success, when less than 1% are successful is the exception not the norm. The same is true in communication. There are many situations the author points out where it works, but if it really worked then he would be more successful and there would be a lot less conflict. :)Most books on assertiveness will give you similar advice to this one. I would recommend Nagle's books on Principled Non-Violence, which is more about the heart than the words."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"Marshall Rosenberg explains in easily readable form how human interaction can move from confrontative, argumentative win-lose battles to productive, mutual problem solving conversations. HIs methods can be successful in everything from family interactions to international conflict. I strongly recommend it for those who want to improve their own communication skills as well as those who would like techniques for facilitating productive conversations for those in conflict."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"Life and self matter. This book is similar to Dr. Phil McGraw, however it's easier to read and quicker to understand"},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"Reading this book by Mother's Day (today 5/8/11) is the best gift I could have given myself...the title does not do it justice...I only read it after 2 people urged me to do so (one being an MD). I have built an \\"Inc 500 Fastest Growing Privately Held Co\\" and a \\"Best Place to Work in Texas\\" company, but not until today do I feel that I know how to create a life filled with joy, hopefully modeling that possibility for my daughter who is only 2. Thank you, Marshall Rosenberg, for giving me the hope and encouragement I had lost until I read your book, especially when it comes to developing intimate lasting relationships."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"This book is a wonderful read.I love the premise but the actual implementation is a little tricky! They have trainers available it would be better with more roll playing,but being able to communicate and really articulate what you want out of life or a conversation is so inspiring. If you can master this book you can enrich your life beyond your dreams!"},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"THis book is capable of changing one's life and ulitmately the way we all communicate. I wish these tools were taught in school.There are workshops to supplement the book which I highly suggest."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"Marshall Rosenberg does an outstanding job of explaining his simple and profound method for building peace. I have listened to it again and again to get a grip on my tendencies to be defensively aggressive.Give yourself the gift of peace for the holidays."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"Got this book for a workshop, but have been interested in it for a while. Full of really great principles that foster better communication in all sorts of relationships. The workshop I used it for only covered a few chapters, but I read the whole thing and found it to be more relevant than I initially respected. Compassionate communication is all about communicating needs and feelings and exhibiting empathy rather than making value judgments and potentially harmful assumptions. To take it all the way sounds great in theory but nearly impossible in practice, however I have found that utilizing this approach as best I can has helped me greatly in difficult communication situations.You don't have to see yourself as a poor or violent communicator to grow and improve you communication skills through this method- it can help on every level. And there is always room for improvement in human communications!"},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"I went to an NVC information session and am reading the book for the first time. I will take the presenter's advice and read it 2 more times. I really need to learn NVC and would benefit from using it in all areas of my life. The process seems like it will be difficult to learn to implement in a way that seems natural and effortless. I hope to be able to attend practice sessions to help integrate the principles into my life."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"This is a wonderful book if you are ready to make some fundamental changes for your own good. It is more than about how you talk. It is how you think of yourself and others. It took me a while to actually pick it up after a friend recommended to me. And I am so thankful that I did! I started out by changing one thing that I tend to do that hurt myself, and subtly the world around me changes with it. I am a happier person because of this book. Don't read, unless you are sincerely looking for some changes."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"I really like this book specifically because it gives you actual tools to become a better \\"nonviolent\\" communicator.It has helped me think before I speak, these are tools I did not have before I read this book."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"Excellent and very important book.Very important for living in the modern world."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Communication","review":"I'm really enjoying reading this book. So much so, in fact, that I've returned here to Amazon to order the \\"Companion Workbook\\". This book is an easy read with readily understandable examples. I have found the implementation of the concepts to be much more challenging, hence my desire to practice with the companion workbook. Some of the examples given do seem silly or awkward, I think because communicating clearly & revealing our vulnerable emotions is something we are not accustomed to. I highly recommend this book because I can already see the NVC strategies changing the way I interpret other people's statements to me and the way I respond to others.

For generations, Darkover has consisted of seven domains loosely ruled by the Comyn, the aristocratic families of those domains. By this time, however, the influence of the Terran presence in the land has led some Darkovans to express a desire to abandon the old ways and form a close and mutually beneficial relationship with the Terrans. The true power of the Comyn has long been found inside the mysterious Towers of the land, but now only the mighty Tower in Arillin can boast of a full-fledged Keeper, and even this primary Tower's circle is incomplete at the time this novel opens. Some of the people believe that the old ways are out-dated and needlessly burdensome, but few in authority have the desire, let alone the courage, to pursue progress of any sort. Thirty years earlier, Cleindori, former Keeper at Arillin, had courageously sought to change the laws (as was her right as Keeper) and free herself and her successors from a life lived under the most severe, isolated of conditions; her ultimate reward had been death and denial as a declared traitor and renegade.Raised in the Spacemen's Orphanage on Darkover until he was twelve, Jeff Kerwin spent his next several years on Earth with his Terran father's parents; an outcaste on a world not truly his own, he pined for the time he could return to Darkover and learn the truth of his heritage. All he has is the name his Terran father gave him and a matrix jewel of unknown origin. He also has bright red hair, and on his first night back on Darkover he gets into several altercations with Darkovans who mistake him for someone else - a Comyn. When he begins to search for the history of his earliest years, he is surprised and increasingly frustrated to learn that no such records seem to exist anywhere of him or his Terran father. Even the Spacemen's Orphanage has no record of him. Kerwin knows he is being lied to and manipulated, but he has no idea why. Seeking information on the nature of his matrix jewel among Darkovan matrix technicians, Kerwin finds himself pulled in a new direction while the Terran authorities seemingly push him out. On the brink of deportation from the planet of his birth, a voice beckons him through the jewel he wears, and by following this voice Kerwin finds a new home on Darkover - a home within the very Tower of Arillin.Thus we get an inside look at the work of the Comyn and their sheltered Keepers inside their mysterious Towers. It is a brand new life for Kerwin, accepted into a telepathic circle of power and authority. He finds new friendships, experiences beautiful yet tragically painful romantic relationships, and tries to work alongside a personal enemy determined to prove that he, as a hated Terranan, is a spy who does not belong in Arillin. Ultimately, he carries the burden of knowing that the very future of Darkover depends on him, as the Tower of Arillin is put to a test that will determine whether Comyn &quot;magic&quot; or Terran technology will best serve the Darkovan people in the future. Of course, things get much more complicated than this, and the ultimate revelation is not to come until Kerwin discovers the truth about his parentage and childhood on Darkover. That revelation is rather involved, requiring several moments of &quot;wait a minute, let me get this straight&quot; reflection on my part (which is not to say it does not make sense); it is as meaningful and powerful as it is complex.The Bloody Sun is a thoroughly engaging novel boasting impressive elements of both science fiction and fantasy. In the context of its place within Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover novels, it is among the most important and significant works, showing as it does the inner workings of the last of the most powerful of mysterious Towers, revealing long-buried secrets linking this story and Darkovan history back to the crucial era of The Forbidden Tower, vindicating completely a renegade Keeper of the past, and basically explaining the impetus for one of the most significant cultural evolutions in Darkovan history."},{"Title":"The Bloody Sun","review":"\\"The Bloody Sun\\" is the first of the Darkover novels set in \\"The Second Age\\" of the Terran/Darkovan contact. The Terran Empire has rediscovered its lost colony and has set up a spaceport on Darkover. But contact between Terra and Darkover is still tenuous at best. The \\"Comyn\\" rulers of Darkover are keeping Darkover out of the Empire and are keeping the Terrans restricted to \\"Terran Zones\\". In the decades since making contact, nothing has changed. With individuals, there has been communication and interaction between natives of Darkover and Terrans, but this has always been on a person by person basis and not any sort of policy. Some on Darkover, however, are pressing their lords to allow more interaction from the Terrans and to join the Empire so Darkover can move out of the \\"Dark Ages\\".Jeff Kerwin was raised on Darkover in the Spaceport Orphanage. All that he knew was that his father was Jeff Kerwin, Sr, a Terran citizen. Working in the Terran service he finally gets an opportunity to transfer to a world of his choosing and Jeff chooses Darkover. He had been dreaming of Darkover his entire like and he felt as if something was missing from his life. On Darkover, Jeff tries to learn of his heritage and finds that, officially, he has none. The Orphanage which he so deeply remembers has no record of him ever being there. His bright red hair marks him as a member of the Comyn (telepathic ruling class of Darkover), though he believes himself to be Terran, and this sets him apart from any Darkovan citizen he meets. Because of his actions outside of the Terran Zone, the Terran authorities intend on deporting Jeff offworld. Instead Jeff follows a voice inside his head and joins up with the Tower of Arilinn. A Tower is where the major telepathic work on Darkover is done. He finds a sense of home at Arilinn and also learns that he will play a major role in shaping the future of Darkover.This is the first time that the reader has had the opportunity to see the inner workings of a Tower on Darkover. Finally we get to see what it is that the Tower Technicians do and what matrix work is. The inner workings of a Tower have been hinted and spoken of by characters, but never before has it been seen in action (\\"The Forbidden Tower\\" was outside of a Tower structure).While Bradley deals with the same main theme that she does in every other Darkover novel (a Terran finds himself having to adapt to Darkovan culture and the conflicts of two different cultures meeting and trying to understand each other), she tells a rather good story in \\"The Bloody Sun\\" and shows aspects of Darkover which have been previously left hidden. Bradley uses her main theme to explore how the Terran Empire is starting to change the lives of the Darkovans and how it is going to change the culture of the planet, which affects the Comyn ruling class. Bradley uses her main theme to show the changes in the Tower culture and how the telepathy can survive on Darkover. There are betrayals, heartbreak, and the amazingly fast romance that somehow morphs into a long lasting love which will last for years.\\"The Bloody Sun\\" is one of the better Darkover novels and one which is as good a starting place as any for the series. It is a standalone novel, but ties into the novels earlier in the chronology and is the starting point for the \\"Second Age\\" of the Darkover/Terran era.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"The Bloody Sun","review":"Several years ago I was looking for a science fiction author whose continuing works I could follow. I had followed Robert Heinlein for years and loved his style of writing. I picked up a book called &quot;The Bloody Sun&quot; by Marion Zimmer Bradley while browsing at the local bookstore. Normally I would not have purchased a book by an author I was unfamiliar with but something in the brief on the back cover piqued my interest and I purchased &quot;The Bloody Sun&quot;. I am so glad that I did. This book opened the door to an entire world, the world of Darkover. I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed with a Marion Zimmer Bradley book and this book in particular is one of my favorite Darkover novels. The world of Darkover and the characters the author has created there are believable and enchanting. You'll have trouble putting this novel down, I did"},{"Title":"The Bloody Sun","review":"I am making my way through the Darkover novels in the order in which they were written. The Bloody Sun is an accidental exception. This is the third Darkover novel, but I found out partway through that I'm reading a 1979 rewrite of it, and not the original 1964 version.That fact lends some credence to my speculation that MZB improved as a writer over time. I thought the first two Darkover books were readable but clunky efforts, and I wasn't quite sure that I saw the appeal. The Bloody Sun, at least in this rewritten incarnation, was much better!I enjoyed this tale of a man drawn to his ancestral home, whether they want him or not. He, and the other main players in this book, are well-defined characters, and unlike the earlier books, I wasn't left confused by a plethora of characters and cultures and a dearth of context.That said, MZB is still a frustratingly inconsistent writer. Even in a good book like this one, certain scenes come crashing down with a resounding thud. A glaring example, unfortunately, is the very last few paragraphs of the book, which read like the d&eacute;nouement of a Scooby Doo script. Ouch!I can complain -- hey, I can always complain -- but I did enjoy this book and recommend it to anyone looking for a good entry point to Darkover. I look forward to reading the next Darkover novel on my list. Seeing as I just read a 1979 rewrite, I'll be moving \\"backwards\\" in MZB's bibliography to a book written 14 years earlier. I hope it will be a good read!"},{"Title":"The Bloody Sun","review":"This was one of the first science fiction/fantasy books I ever read.Was just as good forty years later.Great read!!!"},{"Title":"The Bloody Sun","review":"This is one no Darkover fan should be without.

He wonders about it and does't know what in the world is going on. But he searches for his past. What he discovers is truly amazing!!! Jeff had barriers built in his mind, so powerful that it killed one woman. Later he gets accepted by a group of Comyn and is 100% accepted but for only one problem. A member is being hostile and isn't trying to hide it, either. Jeff falls in love with the Keeper of their circle and they both run away. They find out what has been troubling his mind and that if they don't warn their circle then there is a major cost involved, with the risk of their lives. But they are afraid because when they rushed off Jeff was blamed for some problems and after they left the rest of the broken circle hunted them down. They asked for the girl to come back but she refused. When Jeff and his beloved returned they were met with hostile and wary greetings. It turns out Jeff wan't his actual name and that a man was betraying the Comyn all along, right under their noses!!!!!!! This is one of the best books ever written, I think!!!

If you ever wanted to tap into the interior dialogue of the people we see daily, then read this book, work for a few months, then revisit it. Winckler (nee Marc Zaffran MD) is a gp and writes with insight that is simply remarkable - he sees the stories in his patients lives - and he sees the stories in ours. The long soliloquies that the doctor writes - our only glimpse of his inner work - say things that doctors think but don't say - or write!! It is a book that starts slowly, moves with a cadence and rhythm that any doctor in a community recognizes, and wraps us in the lives of these people - and leaves us wondering about Sachs - what he really thinks and how he reconciles his anger at what medicine has become and cannot do with his patient, peaceful exterior. A book to treasure."},{"Title":"The Case of Dr. Sachs: A Novel","review":"Written in second person and narrated by those whose lives intersect with that of Dr. Bruno Sachs, this novel is a portrait of a French country physician's daily life and his practice of medicine. The story is told by patients, friends, relatives, a girl-friend and the doctor's own writing. Most of the book is sparkling dialogue. Dr. Sachs is portrayed ascaring, dedicated, practical, supportive, and determined.Very creative in the way it's told, the story brings out the main character vividly through the eyes of others. It's not often that a novel can so accurately portray the human side of a medical practitioner. Might it have something to do with the fact that the author, a medical doctor himself, wants to let the world know what a doctor feels and how he reacts to patients on a day to day basis as well as show what patients really feel about their physician? If so, he thoroughly succeeds, as his delightful story conveys all that and more."},{"Title":"The Case of Dr. Sachs: A Novel","review":"This is the story about a small town general practitioner and his patients in France, but it's really a statement about life, connectedness, relationships, and more. How relationships change and morph over time. How people help other people. How sometimes we can't help, but can listen.

But the bad news, relatively speaking, is that we just get the scripts without any extras. The pages are your traditional Courier style font (including the title page), and while the pages are not in blue, pink, green, yellow, goldenrod and salmon to reflect the various revisions, if you follow the revision dates on the top of the pages you can figure that part out. Therefore, while I appreciate having the original scripts in front of my while watching the episodes so I can see what has been deleted/added/changed (these are not transcripts; big difference), I would have really liked to have a bit more such as introductions by the writers talking about the genesis of the script ideas or problems they had to overcoming in putting the script into production, beyond the production notes and stage directions. Certainly some of what I am looking for can be found in &quot;The Watcher's Guide,&quot; which covers the show's first two seasons, but given how first-rate the BtVS companion volumes have been I am rather surprised this is a comparatively bare bones effort.Included in this volume are &quot;Angel&quot; written by David Greenwalt, &quot;I Robot, You Jane&quot; by Ashley Gable and Tom Swyden, &quot;The Puppet Show&quot; by Rob Des Hotel and Dan Batali, and a trio of scripts by series creator Joss Whedon, &quot;Nightmares,&quot; &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight&quot; and &quot;Prophecy Girl.&quot; These are the episodes where BtVS kicks into high gear, starting with Buffy's discovery that Angel is a vampire and ending with the Slayer's return from the dead top finish off the Master. The emphasis in the second half of season one was a bit more on the Buffy mythos, but still paying attention to the idea that high school is literally a living hell when you are a teenager. You also find the elements falling into place for the shattering conclusion of Season Two."},{"Title":"The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics","review":"I love huge, exhaustive books like this. I hate not being able to find the answer to a question in under five minutes, and my library has dozens of books like this that make such searches easy (the internet is another fast tool, but very few websites have more than the most basic knowledge.) If you want to learn how to write poetry and learn prosody by hands-on examples, go read John Hollander's little masterpiece, &quot;Rhyme's Reason.&quot; If you want fast biographical and literary references, go check out &quot;Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia.&quot; But if you want the absolute last word on poetic forms and meters, with absolutely thorough histories of each subject, use this book. It's saved my critic's keister more than once in the classroom. As one of my professors said, a scholar is not somebody who knows all the answers: a scholar is somebody who knows how to find all the answers.

Look it up here, \\"The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics.\\" Not only will you see 'priamel' defined, but a short history of the use of the concept, examples of priamelic poetry, and a other resources to learn more.How about Hungarian poetry, what makes a hymn (as opposed to a carol), a discussion on line usage and techniques? It is all here. Exemplum? Septenarius? Metalepsis? What's an iambe?

But there are several serious problems. First, there is only a completely useless Table of Contents and no index. Yes, it is an encyclopedia and the entries are in alphabetical order but the subjects are very broad (Symbol, Twentieth-Century Poetics) making it necessary to scan several pages in several different subject areas without knowing if you have missed the poem or poet you are looking for. How will you know to look for comments on The Illiad under the heading of Simile or that the subject heading Intuition contains a discussion of the Neo-Platonists? Scanning pages for a specific piece of information is difficult because the print is tiny. The Preface and Acknowledgments are in big print and then they switch to very small print for the remainder of the book. You will need lots of time and a magnifying glass to take full advantage of this book."},{"Title":"The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics","review":"Basically, it has abstracts that touch on just about any topic you would conceivably want to look up in the course of doing any analysis of poetry. Not only does it provide fully adequate, concise definitions, but it includes a bibliography for each entry, providing loads of sources for further inquiry if you aren't satisfied with the book's definitions."},{"Title":"The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics","review":"I have very little to add to the laudatory reviews. Some found the print too small, but for me it was not a problem - I am used to using reference works with smallish print.I just got my copy and found a lot of fascinating information on the ode which I didn't know. From what I've read so far, the topical discussions are excellent, and there are ample biographical references for the major and some of the minor entries. All in all, it is a great resource for student, poet, poetry lover, and critic."},{"Title":"The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics","review":"At present I'm researching the way poets use structure as meaning in poetry. This excellent book not only explains the different poetic forms from poetic traditions from around the world, it also gives details of their history. The book is organised so information can be found quickly. The only drawback I found is the small font it uses."},{"Title":"The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics","review":"Good and detailed book providing the advanced reader/poet with many information. As the title says a real encyclopaedia. One problem is that it is suitable only for very advanced readers and professional poets. Common readers will find difficulties. One more disadvantage is that the book is printed with very small font, making it difficult and tiring while reading. Good as a reference but difficult to use otherwise. It is recommended for experienced readers with poetry and poetics. Other people will be able to find everything but they will end up to find nothing. They should try something simpler."},{"Title":"The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics","review":"I have been using this excellent reference book for over three decades, and dozens of my students have acquired it. The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics retains the virtues of the original edition but adds extensively to it in order to deal with the profound changes in critical practice that took place since the structural revolution. The entries are clear and dependable, and the book remains a precious compendium of critical concepts to be visited systematically in order to make sure one is on the right path, and given valuable keys to further reading."},{"Title":"The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics","review":"Even I, an extreme enemy of the poetry establishment, was surprised by how poor this edition of the Princeton is. To find out how much it misses concerning what the best poets and poetry critics are doing now, read Richard Kostelanetz's Dictionary of the Avant Gardes. For more particulars of my case against the thing, you'll have to go to my blog. Oh, my recommendation to anyone already owning one of the very mediocre previous editions of the Princeton is not to bother with this one. It covers almost nothing new that is worth covering, and is incompetent to an extreme on the few new things worth covering that it does cover, particularly my own areas of expertise, visual poetry. (P.S., it doesn't know what poetry is, its entry on that finding it undefinable.)Quickly click the \\"no\\" button next to the question about whether or not this review was helpful to you now.

(The other two are Pound's &quot;ABCs of Reading&quot; and Shapiro's &quot;Primer.&quot;) Answers questions &amp; points you in the right direction for more. Once you open it, you'll wonder how you got by without it."},{"Title":"The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics","review":"This is the most comprehensive and informative encylopedia of poetry and poetics that I know. It at times seems so comprehensive and detailed as to make understanding of its entries possible. It is in fact so overwhelming sometimes that it confuses by telling much more than I, at least, need or want to know. It seems to me in a way a very academic work, wonderful for critics but probably of very little use in inspiring to poetry. So much knowledge about poetry is not necessarily what poetry is."},{"Title":"YELLOWSTONE KELLY (Frontier Library (Ottawa, Ill.).)","review":"Peter Bowen has taken stories about Luther &quot;Yellowstone&quot; Kelly and made them his.

I am so excited it is back in print. The text is the same, but the illustrations are different. I prefer the older illustrations, but that may just be nostalgia.

It was consistantly the favorite picture storybook for my kindergarten classes over a 20 year time span. The book was out of print for a long time, and I was delighted to see the book become available again. My only regret is that the wolf doesn't look a bit more scary in the new illustrations.

I was pleased with the prompt mailing of the book after purchase."},{"Title":"The Gunniwolf","review":"My experience with using the Gunniwolf as a preschool teaching aid has been very successful. This tale of little girl and her forbidden, flower-picking adventure in the jungle evokes the imagination of children and inspires their dramatic play. The marvelous detail of this poetic emprise is a valuable tool for teaching critical thinking skills. The Gunniwolf successfully accentuates the importance of following the instructions of parents and caregivers. Little girl's jungle adventure provides the opportunity to teach the concept of a multicultural world with common issues among its people. The creative writing style of the author makes it simple to incorporate creative storytelling techniques that will enkindle children to request, listen to, and retell over and over again the story of little girl and the Gunniwolf."},{"Title":"The Gunniwolf","review":"What a shame that this classic children's tale is out-of-print. I was introduced to this story about five years ago and have shared it with many children along the way. I can almost see the Gunniwolf standing in front of me when I read the book aloud and his voice is a clear as a bell. What a joy to read. I only wish that I could give it as gifts to all of my friend's children."},{"Title":"The Gunniwolf","review":"It's the type of picture book that has magic to it. You don't realize it at first: it's an old picture book from the 1960s. The text is from 1918. It looks like one of those outdated books that might be of interest to a book collector, but how could it possibly pull in the media-drenched youngsters of today? At least that was what I thought, until I decided to try out this story for a read aloud. That's when I found the magic.This old cautionary tale that's just a bit like Red Riding Hood, sans grandmother and woodsman, has a universal theme that any child will recognize. Little Girl lives near the jungle with her mother, and her mother warns her never to go near the jungle or the Gunniwolf might get her! Of course, one day, her mother goes out and Little Girl forgets the warning . . . The story has a happy ending when Little Girl manages to run home after a good scare, having learned her lesson. What makes this story sing is Wilhelmina Harper's delightful turn of phrase. Simple, easy to understand but musical with all the power of a storyteller behind them. Particularly notable are Ms. Harper's onomatopoeic phrases describing the Gunniwolf chasing Little Girl.(Hunker-cha, hunker-cha). The dialog of the characters is unusual, the Gunniwolf sounding strange with his demand that Little Girl \\"sing that guten sweeten song again!\\" and little girl's basic response of \\"I no move.\\" when the Gunniwolf asks her why she moves. A child older than preschool age may find this tale a bit too young for them, but for a youngster it's one of those stories that fits just right.While the text can be used without pictures in its own right, the pictures with this particular version of the book: William Wiesner's green and red colored drawings with incted in cross hatching for shading, are also part of the magic. They don't overwhelm the text or complicate it. Each picture complements the story in it's simplicity, but gives readers a clear image of the Gunniwolf and Little Girl. Wiesner does a marvelous job depicting the Gunniwolf as a crafty old trickster of a creature, without making him overly scary for youngsters. There's a newer version of this tale out with a different illustrator and the same text, but I confess to preferring this version and find the pictures mesh perfectly as they are.The result? Spellbound audiences of youngsters. I keep getting requests for the story, and parents who want to find the tale to retell to their own children. It's a tough book to find since this publication is out of print, but you can find a newer version with different illustrations on the market! If you like this story, consider checking out Where the Wild thing Are by Maurice Sendak and Caps for Sale by Esphyr Slobodkina for more magical picture books!Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshad"},{"Title":"The Gunniwolf","review":"We've gotten both this version and the original out from the library so many times that I had to buy our own copy. For some reason, my girls just love this story. They love the repetition of the song and the pit pat pit pat of Little Girl running away and the hunker cha hunker cha of the gunniwolf chasing her. They want me to read it again and again. And when I'm not reading it to them, although they are both preschool age, I hear them \\"reading\\" this book to each other."},{"Title":"The Gunniwolf","review":"For those of you who, like me, have tried to settle for the 2003 version with the painfully saccharine illustrations by Barbara Upton, there's simply no comparison. If you, too, are thrown by Upton's depiction of the \\"jungle\\" (and the text does use the term) as a North American hardwood forest, complete with a log cabin, or the fact that the Gunniwolf looks like a really pleasant pet dog (shepherd-wolf mix?), or the little girl's bland face and single expression of fear and surprise (like a bad actress), then you've got to track down the 1967 version, with its direct and edgily effective art. I was able to get a copy for $35, but some of these run much higher, so you might want to try the public library.William Wiesner's art shows a child and her mother who look vaguely Asian or Indian, living in an Asian-style hut next to a stylized jungle. The Gunniwolf is a marvel with his rust-red pelt, his long bangs like a Beetles wig, his sharp teeth, his tufted tail, and his friendly-sly smile. The little girl's facial expressions are simple, yet perfect.Why is this story worth the trouble? Because its repetitive action and superb refrains make it a kick to read with a child. The fact that it's a Red Riding Hood-type cautionary tale is mostly irrelevant. My favorite soundbite is the contrast between the running noise of the little girl, \\"pit-pat, pit-pat, pit-pat,\\" and the noise of the Gunniwolf bounding through the jungle, \\"hunker-cha, hunker-cha, hunker-cha.\\" I think more than anything, despite the folktale structure, this story reminds me of the little games parents play with two- to four-year-olds (tiptoe, jump, tickle, run!).Find the Harper-Wiesner Gunniwolf and see for yourself!"},{"Title":"The Gunniwolf","review":"I'm familiar with the green and red version of this story, but I think this is almost the same text. My daughter loved this one when she was little, it's just a bit frightening because the Gunniwolf himself is so silly looking. I particularly like the dialogue with the quaint wording. It's different from most stuff published now."},{"Title":"The Gunniwolf","review":"This story is a classic and has been presented in many cultures using familiar places and customs. I liked it mainly becasue of the lack of violence. Most importantly my three year old grandson loves it."},{"Title":"The Gunniwolf","review":"I was very happy to find the same book I read to my own daughters to read to my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter. We have read it so often that she can almost read it to me. It is a simple cautionary tale about straying away from home and learning a good lesson."},{"Title":"The Gunniwolf","review":"I bought this book for my mom - she is a pre-school teacher and was telling this story to her class for years without having the book. The kids love this story so much, so she was excited to be able to bring her new book to share with her kids."},{"Title":"The Gunniwolf","review":"The Gunniwolf is a classic story about a little girl who wanders off into the woods, where she is confronted by a wolf. She is, of course, frightened, but she and the wolf soon establish a cordial relationship. In fact, the wolf wants nothing more from the little girl than that she sing a little song for him. Although the Gunniwolf story has been around for years, the illustrations in this new version make it particularly appealing. A young child can enjoy the book simply by turning through the pages."},{"Title":"Just Listen 'N Learn French","review":"I used this program in conjunction with a non-credit French course taught at my local community college. I think the program is very good because the recordings are obviously of real French speakers in their native situations. It is almost impossible to understand some of them; they speak so fast, the words are all slurred together. But I know that when I travel in France, I will be better prepared to understand native speakers, for having listened to the tapes over and over! Also, I like that they record even small children on the tapes, and that's encouraging, because they don't always speak correctly (I am not the only one!). My major complaint about the program is that it uses cassette tapes, which are very outdated! I had a hard time even finding a cassette player in my home, and I only have a CD player in my car. Its very hard to find a place to listen. Then, you have to keep rewinding the tape back to relisten, and its the pits to find the exact spot where the last unit or lesson began. If they put it on CD, it would be great!"},{"Title":"Just Listen 'N Learn French","review":"I agree with the review by James McCoy, avoid this one! This set is difficult to understand and not formated in a user friendly manner. My biggest frustration is the multiple lessons on each track of the CD - making it very difficult to go back and repeat just what you need to listen to again rather than all of the lessons in a segment. To follow their lessons as intended you would have to constantly go between the book and the CD, making it very difficult to make much progress while driving. I ultimately purchased another French CD to replace this."},{"Title":"Just Listen 'N Learn French","review":"Passport Books has issued some fine French audio-cassette materials, but this certainly isn't among them. In my opinion, they should remove this from circulation, because it provides such a bad impression of their product line.First, the book and three cassettes are poorly thought out and organized. The creators of the book seem to be confused as to whether they wanted to provide a book for beginners, learners at the intermediate level, or listeners with advanced skills. Little, if any thought, as to how to present material so that the listener can understand and master it is in evidence. The lessons do not build upon one another, and consist of a hodge-podge of loosely related topics, such as &quot;shopping&quot; or &quot;getting information&quot;.Secondly, it appears as if various background noises have been inserted in many conversations to give them a &quot;live, on-locations&quot; feeling. The result, however, is that many are virtually unintelligible. The sounds contribute nothing to the learning experience and become extremely annoying to listen to: it is one thing to listen repeatedly to master the material, another because you can't hear it.Thirdly, there is a *tremendous* amount of wasted time in these tapes. A lesson consisting of *one* sentence by a native speaker may be introduced by three, four or more paragraphs by the english speaker, who often attempts to be entertaining by interjecting dry comments about this, that or the other. This is especially irritating when rewinding --- as is frequently necessitated by the poor audio quality ---- to hear the French dialogue, only to hear the English speaker go on and on.If you want to actively master the material by repeating it, the approach taken by this book really doesn't accommodate that. There are a few opportunities, but the primary approach is to introduce the dialogues, run through them very quickly (except for the English speaker, who is interminable), and then move to the next.The tape isn't a total loss --- there are some some cultural notes that are interesting, and I managed to pick up a few idioms that I hadn't seen before. All in all, it's a pretty weak offering. Let me end with this: I'm not even donating it to the local library, because I wouldn't want in any way to contribute to discouraging anyone from learning French. &quot;Just Listen 'n Learn French&quot; might just do that."},{"Title":"Just Listen 'N Learn French","review":"This review refers to the CDs: I have about 6 years of junior high/high school French, so I would consider myself intermediate but by no means fluent. The CDs were great in helping me with my pronunciation and listening skills (as an Anglophone my pronunciation is horrible), and I was able to review one lesson a day during my daily car commute. I like the fact that the speakers are actual French speakers, although the background noises were indeed distracting and made it hard to hear at times.The problem with other CDs I've tried were that they repeated boring conjugations that would never stick. At least with learning from this CD if you misconjugate, the listener would at least understand what you mean. This CD was actually fun to listen to."},{"Title":"The Color Design Sourcebook: Using Fabrics, Paints & Accessories for Successful Decorating","review":"I love this book.

The Color Design Source Book by Caroline Clifton-Mogg is one of their smartest presentations.Much more than a how-to book, this is very nearly a piece for the coffee table. The size is impressive, the colors more than catching, the paper quality so luxurious a browser notices the \\"click, snap\\" sound of the pages as they turn. Mostly, though, it is the content that keeps a reader between the covers. Clifton-Mogg covers color, pure and simply.

Disney has done this novel a great injustice. Hugo paints an elaborate and incredible picture of 15th-century Paris. The main character is not Quasimodo, the infamous hunchback, but rather the cathedral of Notre Dame itself. It is a complex and powerful character who shifts dramatically depending on who percieves it. Hugo is a brilliant writer; each image is beautiful, each line a poem. The book is four hundred pages of pure poetry. I highly recommend this novel for anyone who appreciates good literature."},{"Title":"Notre-Dame de Paris","review":"I still do not have the faintest idea as to why Disney could possibly make this book into a children's movie. First of all, I would rate the unabridged book itself &quot;PG-13&quot;...but anyway. This book, more popularly known as &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; (even though the plot circles around the Cathedral, not Quasimodo) is like a twisted &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; story sans star-crossed lovers. The real protagonist (in my opinion) is Esmarelda, the sixteen year old gypsy dancer. She falls passionatly in love with the chauvanistic stuff-shirt Captain Pheobus whotakes advatage of her love while meanwhile courting a young, rich noblewoman. Meanwhile, both Quasimodo the deaf bell-ringer and Claude Frollo the fanatical archdeacon fall madly in love with Esmerelda. So naturally things get quite chaotic when the gypsy is sentanced to death for &quot;murdering&quot; the captain. The action so is spectacular, especially the siege of Notre Dame, that I almost forgot I was reading it, not actually standing in Place de la Greve watching it all happen. Hopefully I don't give too much away when I say yes, there is a heck of a lot of dying going on throughout the book. This book, unfortunately, does have its long, slow, boring parts too...such as the beginning--just get through it and you'll be alright. And unless you are an ardent scholar of mideival architecture or French history, go ahead and skip the chapters titled &quot;Notre-Dame&quot; and &quot;A birds eye view of Paris&quot;. P.S: my favorite part...Esmarelda's &quot;marriage&quot; to Pierre Gringiore, and also Gringiore's unhealthy obsession with the gypsy's goat"},{"Title":"Notre-Dame de Paris","review":"Unlike a great number of the people giving this book a positive review, I was and still am a fan of Disney's movie. Yes, the movie distorted the book quite liberally--but this is to be expected of a children's film adaptation. I view the movie's existence as positive since it encourages older fans of the movie to go and seek Hugo's book to get the complete story. It is a sad fact that most people have never read the book, however, the Disney movie brought attention back to it--a victory, in my opinion.As far as the book itself, it was marvelous! Hugo's writing style is ornate and an artistic work in itself. As far as who the main character is, I would daresay that this is up to the reader's interpretation. I agree with the fact that the British translation regarding the title is misleading, as I find Quasimodo to be a bit distant from the focus of the book.Hugo seemed to be preoccupied with portraying both Notre Dame and 15th Century Parisian society when writing this book. From that stance, it would seem as though both Cathedral and time period were the protagonists of the story.As far as in-context, living characters, I would again like to state that Quasimodo is not whom I would nominate as protagonist. Esmeralda is a tempting choice, however, she is not given too much detail as far as personality. I would daresay that the most developed character in the book is the antagonist, Claude Frollo. I could write volumes on this character alone, as he is my favourite. If he weren't already antagonist, I would deem him a good candidate for protagonist.Ah, Claude Frollo. He is the main reason behind my love for the book. (To Disney fans--his story does not unfold as in the movie!) I find his constant struggles and painful past to be some of the most intriguing parts of the book. The parts which included dialogue predominantly on his part were certainly my favourite ones. Claude and his constant battle with his feelings, his devotion, his jealousy and his belief in fate colour the book like no other character could.Ultimately, the message of the book is that appearances are deceptive. Hugo portrays this most obviously with Quasimodo. In my opinion, however, he gives the reader this message through every main character. Phoebus, for example, is at first presented as a gallant officer who rescues Esmeralda but later turns out to be a vulgar womanizer. Clopin is first encountered as a mere beggar but is in fact the king of the Gypsies, holding power within his circle of vagabonds. Quasimodo is first thought of as a monster but is given a more tender place in the reader's heart by the conclusion of the book. Esmeralda is described as beautiful and she at first shows mercy to both Gringoire and Quasimodo, but is later revealed as superficial and vulgar in her taste for men. Claude Frollo appears as a studious priest, but is in reality a passionate, tortured spirit and so much more.To all, I encourage you to read this book! You will feel what the characters feel as your eyes follow Hugo's words. I recall with clarity reading the part where Claude observes as Phoebus attempts to manipulate Esmeralda for his own purpose and, enraged, stabs the captain with Esmeralda's dagger. I remember how my stomach turned as I read. I could feel Claude Frollo's every emotion. It was like magic. It was, in fact, magic. The magic of excellent literature!"},{"Title":"Notre-Dame de Paris","review":"The story takes place in 1482 and 1483, when Paris's center was, as today, the Ile de France, surrounded by the Seine, where there emerges the marvelous Gothic cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris, a work of the people, of the years, and of Gothic architecture. The book begins with the popular festival where Quasimodo is crowned as Ugly King. Quasimodo is a deformed creature: hunchback, deaf, blind in one eye, but in posession of an extraordinary physical strength. Abandoned, as a four-year-old, at the Cathedral's gate, he was adopted by Claude Frollo, the arch-deacon of the cathedral, a nobleman with a tragic story and a younger brother who, in spite of having been nurtured and loved by Claude, has betrayed him with his licentious and illegal behavior. Frollo hates women, in particular the young gypsy Esmeralda, a lovely young girl who, with her white goat, dances, sings, and divines the future, to the scandal of the good consciences, including Frollo.This is one of the most powerful stories ever created, a masterful adventure into the depths of the late Middle Ages. Surrounding the tragic love story between Esmeralda and the Hunchback of Notre Dame is a deep reflection on the demise of Medieval times and the slow but inevitable onset of the Renaissance. Hugo inserts chapters about the Cathedral's history and the description of Medieval Paris, its different neighborhoods and urbanistic setting. Frollo explains, to his astonished listeners, how and why the invention of printed books will mean the death of Architecture, at least as an art. \\"The book will kill the building\\", he says, because the printed book \\"is the greatest event of humanity. It is the mother of Revolutions\\". Before the press, the Church was able to control thought and speech. People expresed themselves in architecture, when they participated as artisans in the construction of public buildings, true works of the people. Not anymore: the book will allow a clearer and more powerful means of expression; fluid, eternally changing, from then on literature will be the most transparent way to express oneself. We know the printed book precipitated the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the Renaisssance and Modernity, but Frollo submerges into bitterness and his terrible sexual frustration: he hates Esmeralda because he desires her immensely.The plot thickens with the whole crazy, tragic love story involving the pretty gypsy, the hunchback, the captain with whom Esmeralda falls in love, Frollo, his brother, the mad crowds, and king Louis XI, sending his troops to take the cathedral. Impossible literature in our days, \\"Our Lady of Paris\\" is a prodigy of imagination, of the recreation of a bygone world, of an integral work which articulates history, political and ecclesiastical power, and the whole of society, from the rich and noble, and the bourgeois, to the miserable and criminal rubbish, peopled by unique characters, yet a reflection of their time and place. In spite of being a somber and desolate story, Hugo tells it with an epic tone, not a sociological one, and therefore makes it an endearing and not a sordid story. I wonder what Dostoevsky would have made with this material!An emblem of Western culture, it is much more than a story, because it includes a grand reflection on the age: architecture and the printing press, a changing society, urbanism and people."},{"Title":"Notre-Dame de Paris","review":"I still do not have the faintest idea as to why Disney could possibly make this book into a children's movie. First of all, I would rate the unabridged book itself &quot;PG-13&quot;...but anyway. This book, more popularly known as &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; (even though the plot circles around the Cathedral, not Quasimodo) is like a twisted &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; story sans star-crossed lovers. The real protagonist (in my opinion) is Esmarelda, the sixteen year old gypsy dancer. She falls passionatly in love with the chauvanistic stuff-shirt Captain Pheobus whotakes advatage of her love while meanwhile courting a young, rich noblewoman. Meanwhile, both Quasimodo the deaf bell-ringer and Claude Frollo the fanatical archdeacon fall madly in love with Esmerelda. So naturally things get quite chaotic when the gypsy is sentanced to death for &quot;murdering&quot; the captain. The action so is spectacular, especially the siege of Notre Dame, that I almost forgot I was reading it, not actually standing in Place de la Greve watching it all happen. Hopefully I don't give too much away when I say yes, there is a heck of a lot of dying going on throughout the book. This book, unfortunately, does have its long, slow, boring parts too...such as the beginning--just get through it and you'll be alright. And unless you are an ardent scholar of mideival architecture or French history, go ahead and skip the chapters titled &quot;Notre-Dame&quot; and &quot;A birds eye view of Paris&quot;. P.S: my favorite part...Esmarelda's &quot;marriage&quot; to Pierre Gringiore, and also Gringiore's unhealthy obsession with the gypsy's goat :-)"},{"Title":"Notre-Dame de Paris","review":"If you read Victor Hugo Novel \\"Hunchback of Notre Dame\\" in school or tried to read but failed to finish it now if you are 50+ this book deserves a reread or if never read deserves a read from an adult perspective.

This one did not disappoint. Maybe a film remake is in the future. It's been way too long to reread this one. I enjoyed it tremendously on my new Kindle fire HD."},{"Title":"Notre-Dame de Paris","review":"This is the second time I've read Notre-Dame de Paris (the first time was with a different translator, but I don't see any real difference with the writing), and I certainly have a better understanding of the story. The book's main character is Notre-Dame, and the supporting characters are Claude Frollo, La Esmeralda, and Quasimodo. Frollo is the Archdeacon who lusts after La Esmeralda. Quasimodo is the hunchbacked bell-ringer of Notre-Dame. La Esmeralda is a 16-year old gypsy girl who is the target of witchcraft by the Parisians. What happens in the novel is sophisticated: basically Claude Frollo & Quasimodo fight for the love of Esmeralda, and it doesn't turn pretty as Esmeralda has fallen in love with Phoebus de Chateaupers, one of the King's captains.One of the things I particularly enjoyed was Hugo's descriptions of the gothic cathedral itself. The chapter entitled \\"A Bird's-Eye View of Paris\\" is a pleasure to read. Another thing is the switching of POV's in every chapter; Hugo made a brilliant execution of this. Despite a few flaws here and there (such as Book Ten/Chapter Four interrupting the very important assault on Notre-Dame), \\"Notre-Dame de Paris\\" is of course a classic in the world of literature. And it's almost sad that most people recognize the book with only the english title \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\". Almost sad, because Quasimodo is not the central character. I hope more and more people will understand that the cathedral itself is the actual central character (even though it's not human)."},{"Title":"Notre-Dame de Paris","review":"Heritage's Notre-Dame of Paris was released in a black slipcase with textured, pictorial, two-color cloth.Illustrated with color paintings by Bernard Lamotte.

I am not sure what Disney has to do with this novel, other than to make a cartoon that uses it as a starting point. I write this review to say this: if you know this novel and this story, and you watched the Disney cartoon, you cannot have missed \\"Hell Fire\\" the song solo by the Frollo character. In my opinion, the lyricists and artists for that song got it all perfectly right: the historical dimensions, the moral, ethical, social and even the political. That song was the plea of a man, to God, who knew he would risk death and eternal damnation to possess a woman that burned him down to his soul. In the song, he plainly explained that he would do ANYTHING to possess her, including throw over his religion and his piety and his god, and that he would literally jump into a pit of sin to get her. This cartoon song, forgive me, is one of the most powerful objects of art ever created by Disney and may I say, perhaps by all of American civilization. It encapsulates all that it is to be a human, and all that being a human implies. Frollo was but a man, and Esmarelda but a woman. Put the two together, throw in some wealth and political intrigue, and you can have hate, or extreme passion, or hell-fire, or maybe good art, or even stranger, it might just be one heck of a damn good movie."},{"Title":"Notre-Dame de Paris","review":"The story by Victor Hugo is a classic that has been presented on film a few times in one of which Quasimodo was played by the late great Charles Lawton. I therefor felt that I would appreciate reading the original by the author. My experience with other book/film connections has always left me preferring the greater content available in the book. Robinson Crusoe, Treasure Island, Gulivers Travels etc. The same cannot be said of this Victor Hugo classic. I managed to read three or four chapters before finally giving up on it. It runs into interminable descriptive dissertations about the city of Paris at the time of the story setting and Quasimodo is hardly mentioned."},{"Title":"Notre-Dame de Paris","review":"Forget anything about that story of disney movie, this is a complex book with very complex characters and a splendid story.

I believe it was the authors intention to give a thorough portrayal of the history of the city, leaders, and architecture, but most of it was irrelevant and was stretched out beyond necessity. Once the storyline picked up, about a quarter of the way through, it became much more captivating. I would recommend briefly skimming the beginning to get the gist of things and then commence reading more in depth at the introduction of Quasimodo."},{"Title":"Notre-Dame de Paris","review":"The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a truly special work.

The books you \\"should\\" read for very little money and at your finger tips. I am catching up on classics and I love my Kindle."},{"Title":"Notre-Dame de Paris","review":"Everything in The Hunchback of Notre-Dame is a fascinating juxtaposition of the grotesque and the sublime - the speech, the characters, the setting. I felt like the whole point of the story was to show that architecture was the only good thing that came from the Middle Ages so for heaven's sake, don't tear those buildings down! We could never build something like that again! This book saved the Notre Dame Cathedral by giving people a reason to care about it and showing how Gothic architecture was beautiful even though it was different (which is a theme in the novel that applies to the characters as well). Victor Hugo likes lists that are very, very long full of even longer names and I found myself falling asleep a lot in the first half of the book. Then suddenly I get hit over the head by this steamy, passionate, action-packed, gruesomely violent second half of the novel complete with forbidden love. Didn't see that coming. I found it surprisingly modern in that there are a lot elements in this story that are popular in novels, especially young adult ones, today. Though I can't help but think that the girl would have been turned on by the whole forbidden/creepy love thing if it had been written today instead of her being horrified by it. And can I just say how shocked I was when he used the word \\"vampire\\" AND talked about Nicolas Flamel? There was some great sarcastic humor in here that had me smiling. This was Hugo's first novel after writing plays and it reads like one. There are lots of action scenes and he writes an excellent mob. He almost makes me want to grab a pitchfork. I walked away from this book thinking about what beauty and love really are."},{"Title":"Notre-Dame de Paris","review":"Notre-Dame de Paris by Victor HugoAny fan of great literature, beautiful prose, French history, architecture, or Victor Hugo will love this ebook.

However, over the years, I've become disillusioned with the HBSP editoral style and model of publishing management/general business books.Funny how many of their titles are written by Harvard Business School professors. Basically, the professors -- Olympian guardians of all management ideas and \\"know-how\\" -- are writing books telling practicing managers (middle to senior level) how to maximize their leadership styles and their corporate profits.Anyhow, I believe that HBSP has recently released a rather improved book, \\"A Bias for Action,\\" written by Heike Bruch and Sumantra Ghoshal. It strives to explain the idea that effective managers aren't necessarily busy managers. Busy managers being those who find comfort in just being active, without a vision or long-term goal for their group or team. It asks the question: what can we do as a managerial class to become more effective and focused?What really shines through (and caught my attention) is the book's underlying theme that willpower is a major force for success. Willpower, to the authors, is a combination of energy and focus. There are several traps/pitfalls that are outlined:&lt;ul>&lt;li>Trap of overwhelming demands&lt;li>Trap of unbearable constraints&lt;li>Trap of unexplored choices&lt;/ul>What I've found most favorable is the authors' strategy of finding a goal and protecting your intentions. Inevitable setbacks will occur. Great managers and leaders know how to deflect that and concentrate on the positive energy by thinking about past successes, envisioning the goal, controlling your confidence, or talking with a mentor.The latter half of the book deals with CEO-level management and how they can program their organizations to exhibit the environment that enable managers to become \\"purpose-driven.\\" Depending on your role in the organization, this half may not be too useful."},{"Title":"A Bias for Action: How Effective Managers Harness Their Willpower, Achieve Results, and Stop Wasting Time","review":"Required reading for anyone who aspires to success in business. The first half does the job on an Executive Coach. The second half explains why some people at some companies can transition from good to great -- and provide more insight than the Collins book on the process. I like the authors approach -- based in accepted scholarly theories -- and not just another bunch of stories from personal experiences (although there are a good many of those here too). Notwithstanding, I'm recommending this to my clients and associates; and, I've already instituted certain changes with the expectation of being more effective."},{"Title":"A Bias for Action: How Effective Managers Harness Their Willpower, Achieve Results, and Stop Wasting Time","review":"I purchased this book when it first came out, and skimmed through the first few chapters. At that time I thought it was another collection of motivational cliches; the kind of rubbish one finds in Robbins' Unleash-the-Real-Man-In-You pulp motivationals. So the book drifted about from desk to desk for quite a long time, mostly unread.A few things changed, however. I found myself needing to motivate personnel after several missed deadlines, and high absenteeism; including among them lead programmers and team champions. Despite my experience in project management and a background in counselling, I was floundering for a while - seeking carrots and sticks, and unsure of how to get the best out of my people. Then I read Peters' and Waterman's \\"In Search of Excellence\\", Collins' and Porras' \\"Built to Last\\" and Roberts' \\"The Modern Firm.\\" (the last of these being the best of this genre; very strongly recommended).Finally I returned to \\"A Bias for Action\\" and this time the big picture presented by the book and the recommendations for managerial action (checklists of questions, for example) made complete sense. I realized that this was anything but another collection cliched motivational slogans. This book is based on empirical research, and that makes the difference.When you come to it as a manager facing motivational problems among your senior staff, you will discover here the solutions to the problems you face; not in a cook-book fashion, but rather the big picture and with broad principles. And among them you will find specific schemes for re-thinking the motivational dynamics in your firm and implementing constructive change.Using this book, with several others on coaching adults, I am putting together a coaching programme for my staff. The material in \\"A Bias For Action\\" has already provided valuable material for this programmme. I shall not characterize this book as a must-read for every manager; but it is a very useful addition to the reading list for managers who are confronting motivational problems among senior staff."},{"Title":"A Bias for Action: How Effective Managers Harness Their Willpower, Achieve Results, and Stop Wasting Time","review":"I have read and re-read this books several times. It is research-based and spells out why so many managers who know what they need to do, don't, and what successful managers with willpower (only 10% of all managers) do. I have read all the best management books and I put this one among the top-five books for guiding effective self-management. The others are Getting Things Done by David Allen, The Effective Executive by Peter Drucker, The 80/20 Principle by Richard Koch, and The Power of Full Engagement by Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz. Frankly, I am amazed this book has not attracted more attention and become a must-read for managers.

The big \\"ah-ha\\" moment of the book is where the authors state that their research has found that the willpower of an individual is a critical element in that individual's success - hmmm....that sounds more like a \\"ho-hum\\" moment that could have been divined by common sense rather than independent research. Despite the book's over-promised-under-delivered haze, there are some potentially useful strategies the authors offer to spur individual and collective willpower.

The premise of Shuai Chiao is simple and direct; if an attacker touches you he is thrown. It is this combative premise that attracted me to amateur wrestling and the martial arts for many years, and to this art and book in particular.That being said, &quot;Fundamentals of Shuai Chiao&quot; is a good reference for a martial artist who wants a different perspective on the throwing arts. I tried some of the throws shown in the book and compared them to the throws I've used in amateur wrestling and in my school's style of kenpo ju jutsu. The throws used in Shuai Chiao are not necessarily pretty; they are, however, fast and effective. Some of the throws in Shuai Chiao are similar to (but not the same as) the ones found in the books &quot;Kodokan Judo&quot; and &quot;San Shou Kuai Jiao&quot; (Chinese Fast Wrestling for Fighting); very many are not. This book demonstrates through drawings, and not through photographs, thirty throws. It also demonstrates twenty drills to help one employ the throws better. It also shows some of the neat traditional training methods used by a Shuai Chiao practitioner.The art of Shuai Chiao and the throws demonstated in this book are designed more for a combative situation than many of the throws in judo. Shuai Chiao practitioners use holds and locks that don't require the grasping of clothing. The throws used in Shuai Chiao are designed to lock an opponent's joints or trap an opponent's limbs before throwing him. The throws are hard and fast, and it is difficult for the opponent to breakfall. Many of the throws require the Shuai Chiao practitioner to use his legs to lift his opponent; these throws are especially powerful. Finally, the throws are designed to allow the Shuai Chiao practitioner to remain standing after throwing someone, and to leave his opponent's body open for a vital strike.&quot;Fundamentals of Shuai Chiao&quot; is a good reference, but as with any text it cannot be the sole reference to master a martial art. While the throwing techniques are taught well, the approaching methods are too contrived and unrealistic. This text would be an excellent supplement for any experienced martial artist or anyone who is training right now. If nothing else, it helps you to develop a mindset for defending yourself. Self defense is not tournament sparring or performing a Kata; it is fast, brutal, and not pretty. &quot;Fundamentals of Shuai Chiao&quot; is strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Shuai Chiao","review":"Really a great book if you want to grasp the basics of SC, it really straightened some of the questionmarks i had.It?s a must for every SC practitioner, especially when it is the only book written in english on the subject!"},{"Title":"Intimate Memoirs (Erotic Classics)","review":"This edition is a compendiom of the three classic novels of the 'Intimate Memoirs of an Eduardian Dandy' and this volume contains 645 pages of the greats of erotic writing by the masters ....First published in in London in 1913 these books I am sure have weathered time in many of daddys desks bottom drawer to be discovered .....The books are an autobiogrphy of Rupert Mountjoy's introduction and growth in the world or erocticism.

Come on, what about old classics like weapons or nuclear triggers?); and (being Turkish) the depiction of Turkey as a criminal heaven where every official can be bribed, and nothing works.

He pressures his son Oliver to begin to learn the business and ultimately take it over when Tiger retires. However, Oliver loathes the illicit dealings of his father and begins talking to the customs blokes. However the situation abruptly changes when his father's former allies in Russia try to wrestle the business from Tiger, using any means possible. Oliver knows he must decide between his family by rescuing his father or justice, by turning him over to the law.Of all the Cold War espionage novelists, John Le Carre has switched to the post Soviet Union environment without missing a beat. His latest story, SINGLE &amp; SINGLE, is an intriguing look into the so-called legitimate banking of the West and its ties to the criminal elements of the East. The story line is crisp and filled with action. The sub-plot portraying the father-son conflict is well designed, but fails to live up to Mr. Le Carre's previous novel (THE TAILOR OF PANAMA) because Oliver never quite emerges as a complete person. This novel is a well-done tale, but not quite at the level of some of the author's previous masterpieces.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Le Carre's writing talents didn't tumble with The Berlin Wall's rubble. Since the fading of the Cold War, he's demonstrated his continuing ability to weave a plot and image people apart from those in the espionage game.

In support of this immaculate enterprise, the financial house of Single is recruited for money management. Tiger Single, the senior partner, with his son Oliver, are set to reap a fortune. Certain events impair the smooth flow of cash, and the Russian partners turn to a new means of profit-making, drugs. As a lawyer in a financial management organization, Oliver draws the line at drugs. It jeopardizes the future of the firm, and his own. He informs on his father to government officials in the hope of cutting a deal.Like many other Le Carre novels, this one eschews a simple linear plot format. You are offered a thread to study, then another seemingly unrelated, one. You must carry the information you're given when other threads emerge. But Le Carre never leaves you hanging or lost. The threads begin to come together in the rich tapestry Le Carre is so talented at weaving. Nothing is inevitable, the twists are sometimes abrupt, but never implausible. There are no real weaknesses in this plot. Some of the characterization, however, seems a bit contrived, unusual in Le Carre.Although not an espionage novel, Le Carre draws Oliver as if he was a George Smiley operative. He goes to ground with amazing skill for a lawyer, his cover the performance of children's magic shows. Oliver maintains this role long enough to marry, bear a daughter and complete a divorce. He is \\"run\\" by a Brock who teaches him tradecraft, which in Oliver's case only requires some touching up, not attending the whole course. Oliver is loved or admired by more women than one man deserves - his landlady, a Russian gangster's wife and Aggie, one the Brock's agents. Somehow, given Aggie's role, this last seems the least plausible.As with other post-Cold War Le Carre novels, this one is as much education as entertainment. You close the last page but you find closing down the memories and topics more difficult. International blood traffic is a real issue, exactly as pharmaceuticals were in The Constant Gardner. The issues are real, the people mostly convincing, the events hidden from the public eye, but revealing in their likelihood. Any Le Carre novel is worth a read, some welcoming a revisit. Single and Single is one worth picking up again."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Le Carre has done well in continuing to come up with interesting plots in this post cold-war era, but his storytelling abilities are not displayed in this novel. I disagree with the idea that readers should be required to dig or struggle to enjoy fiction. The criticisms of this work expressed in other reviews are justified. The book is needlessly vague and meandering. Where the author was successful in earlier books at deliberately hiding or limiting information to drive the plot, that is not the case here. Instead, the author hints of pathways to be explored later, which mainly turn out to be dead ends. None of the characters, with the possible exception of Brock, were consistent, and none at all were fully developed, Oliver least of all. One of the joys of reading Le Carre's earlier works was developing a reader's relationship to the characters. He has recaptured that in his latest work, The Constant Gardener. If you're a LeCarre fan, it rates three stars. If you are not, then it only merits two."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"I read a lot of Mysteries and Thrillers by Connolly, Lehane, Burke, Hiassen, Sandford, etc., etc., and I have always heard very good things about LeCarre. While reading this book, I thought perhaps he was too &quot;sophisticated&quot; for my tastes, and that I didn't get it. Wrong. It was just tedious. LeCarre decides to change directions in the story, and does an exceptionally poor job of setting it up. Hey, lets just hop over to Russia from Turkey, and nobody will ever know we are there. Gimme a break. I was hoping in the end that everyone would get shot. I'd hate to think this book may reproduce a sequal. I'll stick to stories about good ole U.S. gumshoes and Florida freaks. Sophistication is not all it is hyped up to be."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"While I am an admirer of LeCarre, and while I believe that he has not lost his powers, I find this book's characters to be caricatures, and the plot to be predictable. The protagonist, the women, and the heavies are already familiar to LeCarre readers. LeCarre is justly noted for his sensitivity to ethical dilemmas, but the one potentially at the heart of this novel (a son's loyalty to his father) is not developed. Gone, too, are what I most treasure in LeCarre: the interrogations that are conversations, and the conversations that are interrogations. One last lament: the explication is clumsy. In the opening chapter a man about to be executed by the heavies goes on and on explaining to his executioner plot background that the executioner knows even better than the victim; later, a lawyer who professes to be worried for his life, babbles more explication at great length. On the other hand, LeCarre is an interesting enough writer for his weaker works like this one to still be pretty good reads."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"This book is a jumble, much longer than it had to be, filled with extraneous (and useless) detail. It simply does not grab your attention and carry you forward like Le Carre's earlier books did. You get sidetracked by the detail, which does not add anything to the story line. I wound up attempting to skim the most egregious parts because they were so boring. This book could have used a strong editor to force Le Carre to re-write and focus the story line. If you loved Le Carre's spy stories, you're going to be very disappointed with this attempt. I sure hope his next book is better."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"This is a novel about greed, avarice, power and ethics. It asks the question, \\"When money is no object, when you have the power and resources to do anything you can think of, what will you choose to do?\\" LeCarre\` puts us in front of a wonderfully crafted mirror, allows us to see our own motivations and ethical values, and then shoves unimaginably difficult choices at us. This book is a masterpiece of thought-provoking character development. The foils he presents are not driven as much by the characters themselves as by the cultural values they represent. LeCarre\` understands that the languages we speak and the cultures they evolve from determine how we think about abstract concepts such as 'profit' and 'power.' In the Russian language there is no idiomatic equivalent for the concept of profit as it is used in the West - acquiring a commodity at a low price, adding value and selling at a higher price, is a concept that is simply not found in the Russian culture. Instead, as LeCarre\`s characters show us, wholesale theft and resale of such essential human commodities as blood supplies becomes the operative dynamic for a money-making scheme gone awry. The House of Single is the mirror of every man's opportunity to make critical choices based on moral and ethical values. What happens to this venerable institution is what happens to all of us when we refuse to intervene in affairs that are immoral, unethical, manipulative, exploitive and fundamentally self-serving. I loved this book because it is the product of careful craftsmanship, clear thinking and a deep understanding of what is wrong with the way we treat each other. The language is richly constructed. The dialog is masterful - the reader is never put in the position of having to try to figure out who is speaking. The gestalt of this book is pure LeCarr\` - rich, powerful and authentic. I highly recommend to anyone who is grappling with such choices."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Ten years ago, many of us were concerned that the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union would also spell the end of Le Carr&eacute;'s masterful stories of international subterranean intrigue and mischief. We needn't have worried. We forgot that that there's just as much venality and disregard for law and civilization in the West as there ever was in the East. Le Carr&eacute;'s earlier work has reached its inevitable end, but the saga of George Smiley has been succeeded, if not replaced, by a series of individual tales featuring characters like (in this one) Nat Brock of the Customs Service, pursuer of the launderers of illicit offshore wealth in the hands of drug lords, arms dealers, and the Russian Mafia. The laundry being the House of Single, under the proprietorship of &quot;Tiger&quot; Single, who expects his surviving son and junior partner, Oliver, to someday succeed him. Oliver becomes closely acquainted with the Orlov brothers and their billion-dollar schemes, learns to fear the Georgians and their henchmen, and finds his view of the House of Single changing more than he would like. Being young and recently called to the law, he can take only so much before he peaches to the authorities in the person of Brock. And Brock, who can barely contain his glee, trains the young turncoat in undercover work and puts him back in his father's House as a mole. This is not quite what Oliver had in mind and, after causing his father considerable financial grief, he finally flees the whole scummy mess, preferring to hide out in a seaside resort as a children's party clown and magician. Then the Russians become more than Tiger, in his straitened circumstances, can successfully deal with, and Oliver is swept up in the acceleration of events. As always, Le Carr&eacute;'s characters are four-dimensional and utterly believeable. His narrative proceeds on several lines at once, in both the past and the present, which will keep you busy sorting out what has happened and guessing what is about to happen. This is his best work in several years."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"I'm 60 pages into this book &amp; one word seems to fit: OBTUSE. Perhaps if someone has the patience to sit down &amp; blast past the jumbled first chapters in one sitting it will make more sense. I haven't read anything by LeCarre before &amp; got this as a Christmas present. I also have a speed reading course I want to take &amp; think I will use this book as fodder for the course."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Le Carre has created an exceptional body of fiction within the trappings of espionage and the Cold War. As the world has changed, though, the author's focus has shifted to peripheral criminals and hangers-on in shadowy but less recognizable conflicts. But his writing has always been about the human dimensions of people involved in these situations. A reciprocal betrayal - father and son of each other - cuts through this story like a fault line and defines the moral landscape which Le Carre explores with characteristic skill. The particulars of his characters never seem like backstory manufactured for a Holywood film. There is an undeniable Oedipal dimension to this fine book: Tiger Single is a survivor, whatever his morals, and Oliver, however high-minded, remains altogether untested. Wife and mother appears briefly as a lurid incarnation compared to Tiger's solid mistress. And the utter failure of three capers planned early in the book paves the way for Tiger's capitulation to a sordid course which his son cannot stomach. First rate."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"John le Carre can be writing about the phone book and he will make it exciting to read."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Single &amp; Single is vintage Le Carre.In light of his previous work 'The Tailor of Panama' which was a big let down the present work comes as a solid proof that the master is still alive and kicking. This is a collage of his earlier work (no doubt about that!) and says something more that is as incisive and truthful as only Le Carre can write. The beginning of the book is a winner and the character of Alfred Winser keeps haunting the reader throughout the book only on the basis of that brief appearance. I would strongly recomment this book to all those who feel the need to understand (realise?) one's own psyche."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Why write a lengthy review of this book. Yes there are shades of characters in this book we seem to have met before, but I do not care. This is Le Carr&eacute; again at his very best and I loved it. After one day of reading it was over again and I will have to wait another two years or so......... I think I will start rereading Night Manager for a change"},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"It had been a long time (over fifteen years) since I had last read a John LeCarre novel when I picked up this novel out of a bargain bin. Reading the story, I was reminded why I had gone so long without reading his books. Single and Single is not really a bad novel, but it is not a very exciting one either.The plot revolves around Oliver Single, son and partner of Tiger Single. Tiger is a wheeler and a dealer with a limited sense of ethics. Oliver's own ethics have caused him to betray his father to the law and go into hiding. When Tiger's life is threatened, however, Oliver re-emerges into society and searches for his father.For a story that deals with murder, betrayal and theft, there isn't all that much to excite. The characters are well-written but bland and the structure of the story is more complicated than it needs to be. I understand that LeCarre is supposed to be a master of the mundane spy story, but this is one tale that is a little too mundane and not masterful enough. For better works in the same field, I would recommend Len Deighton; once again, LeCarre has failed to impress me and it may be a long time again before I read another of his books."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"I was in an airport buying a novel to read on my vacation. This one was prominently displayed, I read the back cover, it seemed OK so I bought it. It stinks. Period. It can be read about a minute a page, it's like a short story, and it's bad. BAD. Dumb silly pap for the mass market. Instead of bringing it back home with me, I threw it in the garbage, where it belongs. I can't believe Le Carre wrote this garbage. He used to be good. This is junk."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Is it possible to improve as a writer while producing less interesting books? John le Carr&eacute; makes me think so.More than 30 years after \\"The Spy Who Came In From The Cold\\" and 20 years after wrapping up the Karla Trilogy, le Carr&eacute; produced this, 1999's \\"Single & Single\\", a feat of impeccable writing about characters and situations I couldn't give a cuss about. Whether it's a businessman slowly waiting for his life to be snuffed out, an eastern European village where a woman stands at a window naked in the moonlight, or a son trying to both save and stop his crooked father, I was continually impressed by the author's lapidarian eloquence but aloof from the story.The son and the father form the central plot line and the title of this book. Oliver Single is the son, a children's magician whose most successful trick involves disappearing from his father's world. Tiger Single is the old man, a ruthless enabler of rich bad men who lives for himself but inspires a stubborn loyalty.\\"House of Single's got more scoundrels among its valued clients these days than the entire rogue's gallery at Scotland Yard,\\" a customs officer named Brock tells Oliver at one point.For le Carr&eacute;, all this is a way of getting at the culture of global corruption House of Single's helps enable, not to mention a chance to showcase his ability to keep writing spy thrillers after the end of the Cold War. Russian gangsters plot shipping vitally needed blood West for easy profit. A shady British cop dispenses bribes while living a life of luxury. No one is completely stainless, making Oliver's attempt at escape absurd even to himself.\\"We are no longer looking at adventurous outlaws who will reveal themselves by clumsiness or repetition,\\" Brock observes. \\"When one containerload of cocaine safely landed at a British port is worth a hundred million pounds, and the harbormaster is enjoying a salary of forty thousand, we are looking at ourselves.\\"As long as le Carr&eacute; stays on this theme, the novel is very interesting. But as he works in a plot around the son searching for the father, \\"Single & Single\\" feels a bit lost. Turgid le Carr&eacute; never is, but he does like long conversations and narrative asides that tease out every psychological nuance. Making me enjoy these digressions is a true gift of le Carr&eacute;'s, one that seems richer now that I've begun to take more notice of it.Opacity is what does in le Carr&eacute; here. Oliver's motives remain obscure throughout the novel, and he continually jumps ahead of the reader in a way that's more confusing than stimulating. Numerous women throw themselves at him for even more obscure reasons, defying family and country to offer caresses and counsel about not giving in to corruption. The relative purity of women is a constant theme of le Carr&eacute;'s, but here it grates with repetition.By the time we reach the end of the story, Oliver is on the run from everyone but the man he started out escaping. Things happen, windows crash, and people die, but nothing is made very clear, perhaps to reflect the new world le Carr&eacute; is writing about. Author's intent, perhaps, but \\"Single & Single\\" leaves an odd unresolved taste that makes one wish for the relatively finer loose ends of the Cold War again."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"I'd give this 3.5 stars, but the only choices are 3 or 4. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Iron Curtain, Le Carre lost some of his traditional material but gained others with the Russian Mafias, Chechen rebels, etc., etc. He has done an excellent job leveraging this subject matter in other books, but only a &quot;fair-to-middling&quot; job with Single &amp; Single. The father-and-son conflict is a new spin on Le Carre's morality plays--however, the other characters are much flatter than his usual style. The end was interesting but fairly predictable as well."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"!Yes, the ancient Roman poet and propagandist would have approved of this novel.One of the other reviewers of this book on this site asks if it is necessary to trudge through a morass of introspective self-analyisis in this novel ... the answer is: if you think not, then you are missing the point (of literature generally, probably).Virgil, too, started one of his &quot;more famous works&quot; by telling his readers he was writing of &quot;Arms and the man&quot;; and it was left unfinished - at the point where the hero kills an enemy who has stolen his armour - having first been through a metaphoric journey to the 'underworld'.

So it was with great disappointment that I read Single & Single. The novel never rises above the conventional thriller: the predictable killings, the now mundane concept of the strained relationship between the protagonist and his father. Worse, and I admit that it might be just me, I found a lot of it ludicrous. Single detests his father and that lifestyle so much that he leaves it to become a clown and make animal balloons? Too bad that this was my first Le Carre novel (even my friends who are Le Carre fans told me that they didn't like this particular one). My friends tell me that I need to give one of his better novels, like Tinker, Sailor, Soldier, Spy a chance instead."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"I snapped up this book as soon as I saw it at a newsstand in Rome. Mr LeCarr&eacute; has cleverly switched over from the the world of espionage between the West/East blocs during the Cold War, to that of some British Services (in this case, the Customs Service) versus the so-called Russian Mafia. The House of Single, a law firm in the City of London headed by Single senior (Tiger) is active in representing and managing several shady interests, and gets dangerously entangled with an assortment of Russian, British and Turkish characters and their offshore companies. Enter Single junior, Oliver (aka Oliver Hawthorne), who is instrumental in getting Dad out of a very sticky situation. We can find here the Old Master in action again but please, Mr LeCarr&eacute;: is it possible that, for every 5 minutes of real action and dialogue in your books, the reader has to go through ten solid pages of philosophizing, introspection, insights, rationalization, meditation, self-criticism, self-effacement, flashbacks, memories, sudden change of times, etc.?

I thought it was just me until I read some of your other reviews."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"After the utter disappointment of The Tailor of Panama, Le Carre's latest novel harks back to his crafty old ways. His writing is superb, particularly in the treatment of the father-son relationship and he knows the way around scenes of physical and psychological tension better than any other author I know. The opening chapters are brilliant and his ability to put together a seemingly complex puzzle is still in top form, albeit with somewhat less shine than in his early masterpieces set during the Cold War. However, this outing is deceptively timid by comparison. The plot, when revealed, is simple and contains no surprises. We know who's the crook from the start, don't we? The approach to the climax is indeed rushed and the big bang one hopes for fails to materialise. Despite these flaws, it's still a very good read and I'm glad to see Le Carre regaining some of the lustre that made him, in my opinion, the best and classiest espionage author of his generation."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"John le Carre has produced another masterful novel. The basic theme is individual decency, loyalty and helplessness. Unlike his Cold War novels, the backdrop is capitalist Russia and international finance, instead of espionage.This is the story of Oliver Single, apprentice at his father Tiger's financial empire, messenger between Single & Single and a Georgian/Russian family, the Orlovs. He falls in love with the Orlov family and their daughter Goya, but betrays both his father and the Orlovs by walking to the government to tell all. Sent into hiding by the government, he comes out again four years later, in search of his father Tiger Single, who has disappeared after Single & Single's top lawyer is executed on a Turkish hilltop.Tortured by his betrayal and by his conscience, Oliver is the heart of the novel.This is also the story of Alix Hoban, a Westernized Russian crook. Married to Goya Orlov but faithful only to himself, Alix makes ambitious plans for selling his peoples' blood to the West, but failing that, runs a drug trafficking business on a massive scale, from Istanbul and Vienna. He tries to take over both the Orlov and the Single empires, but his ruthlessness does not pay off in the end.This is also the story of Brock, fighting corruption in British law enforcement and running undercover operations for evidence against Single & Single. (This part I found untenable. Aren't ruthless bloodthirsty financialists the engine of Anglo-American growth and imperialism? Why should the British government run operations against its finest wealth-creators? But, okay, fiction is fiction.)And this novel is a story of ruthlessness, and a vision of how the rich & powerful actually run this world of ours.But despite the dark backdrop, \\"Single & Single\\" is lighter and more hopeful than many of Mr. le Carre's earlier novels.There is the portrayal of Goya, crying for all the victims of white powder (heroin?) traded by her family. And Aggie, a girl working for Brock, with morals far higher than you would imagine from your knowledge of the English.And of course there's Oliver, and the little Oliver-Aggie love story.In its hope and humanity, and with its little love stories, \\"Single & Single\\" is a bit like le Carre's \\"Russia House.\\" A reviewer of \\"Russia House\\" said: \\"Fans of the George Smiley books may find themselves disappointed, but I think fans of Le Carre as the storyteller and writer will be very satisfied.\\" I can say the same of \\"Single & Single.\\"As in other le Carre books, you have to get well into the book before you piece together what the story is about. I guess this is not news to le Carre fans, and I hope new readers are not put off by it.As in the author's other novels, you get a sense of the research that went into the book, and the meticulous connection with reality. Like in le Carre's \\"Our Game\\", you get a human picture of peripheral pieces of the Russian empire. How does le Carre know people from so many different places, so well? The Russian murderer rings as true as the Turkish small-town police & mayor, as does the flowing emotions of the Georgian women, and the selfish Polish lawyer.I also appreciated the smell of Istanbul coming out in the descriptions, soooo real. As well as the descriptions of traveling across Europe, Zurich to Vienna to Istanbul, and the feeling of displacement with too much traveling. Le Carre knows the continent well. I can't testify about the Georgia/Russia descriptions; I haven't been there yet.The novel begins with the description of an execution, on a Turkish hilltop, carried out ceremonially by a rather international assortment of criminals. This description is masterful, done from the point of view of the condemned.Well worth the read, and then (like much of le Carre) also worth a second read because you won't get everything the first time around."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"If you read this book expecting one of Le Carre's spy novels, you will be disappointed because although there are connections to the spy world this is not a spy novel. If you keep an open mind about what will emerge in Single &amp; Single, you will enjoy an interesting tale of good and evil drawn through the detective genre. At its best, Single &amp; Single is as gripping as any Le Carre book -- especially in the first few chapters. The downside is that the tawdriness of almost all the characters make the book a bit of a downer. The Cold War stories in Le Carre's earlier books had the redeeming (and sometimes inspiring) quality of addressing more kinds of potential nobility. The hero in Single &amp; Single is a rewardingly complex figure, righteous yet not always strong enough and conflicted . . . and more than a little idealistic, reminding one of Don Quixote. If you like heros like that, you will very much enjoy the book. If you find small-minded crooks pursuing their ends in petty, immoral ways relatively uninteresting, you will meet a lot of them here. I found myself mixing the crooks up in many cases because they seemed so similar in motivation and characterization. Perhaps the best part of the book is the subtle exploration of a son's feelings for a father, even when that father doesn't really add up to a lot. Although far from his best work (probably because of the subject rather than his writing skill), this Le Carre will satisfy all but the most demanding fans. Those who will be disappointed will include those who want a startling revelation at the end. That's not the way this story is constructed. It would be a mistake not to read it, however, if you are a Le Carre fan or just like a good story."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"In the battle between those who can't seem to comprehend the elliptical style perfected by Le Carre (who give it one star in their reviews) and those who claim that Single &amp; Single is a masterpiece (five stars), I come out on the positive side, but with a few reservations. Yes, the first 125 pages are slow. Yes, the writing can be maddeningly obtuse at times. And yes, none of the characters are complete models of moral integrity. But, if you expected something else from Le Carre, you've clearly not read his prior work. His books always take a while to draw you in. His lack of clarity in individual scenes are like brushstokes--eventually leading to a picture that (even though impressionistic) stands beautifully by itself. And Le Carre remains the superstar portrayer of moral ambiguity. In my view, Single &amp; Single is completely consistent with Le Carre's other work. It's a very good addition to his body of work and delivers in the end. On the other hand, it's not among his very best (the Karla trilogy, The Spy Who Came in From the Cold), but it's certainly better than The Tailor of Panama (a book that had me believing that Le Carre may have lost his way). Welcome back, John, and please write a few more. It's so nice to see a thoughtful, literate, and entertaining book on the best seller list (even if it's only for a few weeks)."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Before the fall of the Berlin Wall, John Le Carre wrote magnificent spy stories. Then the wall fell, and what was he to do? He takes up writing stories about international drug and arms dealers, and pharmaceutical cartels,and tricks them out with all the midnight meetings of the Home Office mandarins,and their ilk, that he previously wrote so well about, but in the case of international drug-arms smugglers, it's definitely the mountains laboring to bring forth a mouse.Single and Single, unfortunately, follows the same pattern, though there's also some patter about smuggling blood, perhaps based in research. Her Majesty's Customs Service is all over the story, safe houses, hard men, smart beautiful talented women from Glasgow, and all. It's hard to believe in such a proactive bureacracy in hidebound Britain, aside, of course, from the fabled MI5 of LeCarre's good old days. The obligatory love interest strains credulity: I can't recall ever seeing such an extraordinary female customs employee at any British airport; and we're given precious little indication of what such a woman might see in Oliver Single. The book does begin, at least, with a bang,set on a mountainside in Turkey, it's one of LeCarre's more powerful openings. And the central conflict, between Oliver Single, and his rogue Dad, Tiger Single (thus Single and Single), has some credibility and resonance:Le Carre has let it be known that his own father was a rogue,and a con man."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Calling this book a &quot;thriller&quot; is a bit like calling English cooking &quot;cuisine&quot; (or that &quot;not a cheap shot&quot;). Countless digressions and flashbacks prevent the story from building up much tension. The opening chapter serves as a good case in point: When threatened with execution, Alfie Winser's life literally passes in front of his eyes. This seems witty at first, until it begins (and continues) to happen to people whose lives are not in similar jeopardy. In the final 75 pages or so the pot finally begins to boil, but we're left with such a waterlogged mess that the climax lacks any real punch.The story revolves around Oliver Single, one half of the book's title and junior partner of the story's eponymous capital investment firm. After experiencing ethical business qualms he leaves the firm, revealing its secrets to and British Intelligence and allowing them to set him up with a new identity. Of course, that never goes to plan, and coincident with his cover getting blown, Winser is killed and his father disappears. There's nothing left to do but for Oliver to become a junior G-man, find his dad, thwart the villains, and save the day. Sure, that's a pretty simplistic overview; on the way he has to fool around with three or four women, too.If you enjoy psychoanalyzing things, you'll get a kick out of this book. Everybody has issues. Everybody's in denial. From the obligatory psychopathy and transgenerational child abandonment to exhibitionism and German-engineered phallic symbols, this book has it all. If, on the other hand, you like a tale of espionage, cat and mouse, cross and double-cross ... well, there's always the Smiley books.In the end, Single &amp; Single is a love story between a son and his father, so perhaps it's only natural that there be an Oedipal angle to the whole thing. If you go into it aware of what you're getting yourself into, perhaps you'll enjoy it more than I did. At any rate, the scene where Yevgeny Orlov asks Oliver to hop on his motorcycle (&quot;Ride it, Post Boy! Ride it!&quot; (p. 179)) takes on a whole new meaning when looked at from a Freudian point of view."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Like all Le Carre novels, Single &amp; Single can be read for the shear beauty of the style, each sentence neatly crafted with well placed and carefully selected words that just beg to be spoken aloud. But beyond that it has problems. Taking more time than usual to get his story going, Le Carre launches the reader into a muddy mix of high finance, secret intelligence, political connivance, treachery and deceit - just the stuff we expect of his fiction, but embodied in a plot that is so all over the place that it needs a map to follow it. Unlike the spare, dark constraints that made The Spy Who Came In From The Cold such a tight and tragic story, this story seems to have no constraints. The cast of characters is huge (something he handled well in Smiley's People because the focus of the story was clear) but their place in the action is not always apparent. The direction of the plot - while known on one level (locate the crooked banker Tiger Single, father of the magician ex-spy recruited to help find him, and answer certain questions about mysterious bank deposits and shodowy transactions in drugs, money laundering, Russian mafia, etc. - that's clear, isn't it?) has so many strands it's as though Le Carre took a full notebook of ideas and tried to use them all at once.Ultimately it doesn't work. The plot is too convoluted and the conclusion achives neither the satisfactions of tragedy or melodrama. Further, the lead character, Oliver Single, is too weak and peculiar a figure to serve as the hero (even granting that Le Carre intends him to be flawed) of a story that hopes to achieve so much. His father, the corrupt and selfish Tiger Single is easily a more interesting character, but not enough is really done with him. He is, for too much of the book, offstage, while onstage the weaker characters stumble through one ambiguous situation after another.I will read anything Le Carre writes and with a certain pleasure even when, as here, he doesn't achieve the narrative clarity that some of his books have. But I could hardly recommend this as an example of him at this best. Not even close."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Although the Cold War has long since faded into the history books, John Le Carre is still turning out good, well-written spy stories. You cannot use the term &quot;potboiler&quot; with a Le Carre book, although some of his more recent endeavors have come dangerously close to that level. Thankfully, &quot;Single &amp; Single&quot; is not one of them.Since the KGB doesn't exist anymore, Le Carre must look elsewhere for the kind of story he writes like nobody else. And he's found it in the story of Oliver Single, the son and junior partner of a banking house whose owner and senior partner is a greedy, corrupt, and probably amoral (business)man who has gotten in way over his head by getting involved in the drug trade with some - shall we say, less than reputable - gentlemen from the former Soviet Union.As with most Le Carre novels, the story moves back, forth, and sideways between various parts of and characters within the same story. You have to flip back a few times to keep track of who's who and what's what, but that was part of the charm of the George Smiley/Karla series, and it's the same here.Unfortunately this book does suffer from the one flaw that exists in most of Le Carre's books - and that's an uncanny ability to turn its so-called action sequences into the dullest parts of the story. I actually enjoyed the back-and-forth between the characters more than I enjoyed what they did. But if this &quot;flaw&quot; were corrected, I think I'd actually like Le Carre less than I do. Weird, isn't it?"},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"LeCarre deals more in nuance, innuendo, facial expressions, glimpses of telltale movements, and dawning realizations than he does in other kinds of action. Just like a spy, one might say. This book is loaded with all of that, even with a bit more action than I'm used to seeing in his books.This is not as bleak as some of LeCarre's writing. There is some fun and joy to it. There's a buffoonish magician who plays a surprisingly magical role (theatrical, not occult). There is also a wealth of the father-figures who haunt so many LeCarre stories. There is the kind of weighty ambivalence toward families, loyalties and ideals that many fans have come to know and love.LeCarre's medium of exchange seems to be human spirit, motivation, interaction, doubt, ambivalence, regret. Sometimes we are left to see it only from a distance, just as in real life. At other times, when the story justifies it, those emotions will crawl right into your shirt and chew on you.The writing has a bit of British idiom which seems only to add charm (for an American). None of it interferes with the story. Otherwise the dialogue and setting are simply wonderful, as engaging as any novel I know, and more detailed than most.It may take just a bit of effort or concentration to follow and appreciate the characters. This is not grade-school writing. Nevertheless any such effort will be very richly rewarded."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"John le Carre is a master of language, mood, and character. His subtlety is well-established, and I'm sure he feels the pressure to push the envelope, to better his last attempts. Usually, he succeeds, or at least satisfies.Here, le Carre's subtlety is exchanged for a sock-it-to-'em opening. Gripping, captivating...all that jazz. From there, however, he slips deeper into his renowned subtlety than I've ever seen him do. In &quot;The Night Manager,&quot; the innuendos and atmospheric textures were initially bewildering and finally mesmerizing. In &quot;Single &amp; Single,&quot; these attempts fall flat.The threads of the first few chapters weave together, revealing the tapestry of Tiger Single's high-finace world--a world of shady dealings and shadier characters. Oliver, Tiger's son, becomes our eyes into this world. His sometimes childlike innocence is contrasted with his legal knowledge, and his conscience soon becomes weighted by the workings of Single &amp; Single. This culminates in his betrayal of his own father.The rest of the book pursues the redemption of father and son relations, the justice due a murderer, and the maturation of a boy grown up in his father's shadow.Yes, le Carre carries out his task competently. No scene or character rings untrue. On the other hand, few of them are able to breathe life into this tired horse of a thriller. Aside from Oliver, it's the minor characters--his mother, his father's janitorial guardian, etc--that stick in the memory. Oliver's relationships with women seem two dimensional and lacking in depth or motivation, on the womens' parts anyway.When we first meet Oliver Single, we meet him in his role of magician. As he steps out of his shell, as he pulls his own identity out of the hat, everything else in the book seems to pale. This novel, measured by le Carre's own standards, is a one-trick pony. A well-groomed creature, but short on magic."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Solid. Sometimes Le Carre can miss the mark, and I saw shades of Absolute Friends in this book, rather foreshadowing, but this work is solid all the way through. A return to classic John Le Carre themes worked out with flare."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Although I am a fan of leCarre, I had not heard of this book but decided to try it. I was hooked right from the opening chapter. For readers who insist on linear accounts this would be a challenging book since it does jump around but leCarre fans expect that and wait and watch as the story unspools.Others have reviewed the plot and there is no need to till that ground again.Suffice to say I found the father/son interactions the very best part of this interesting novel.A really fascinating read. The only negative is the rather rushed ending....but overall definitely recommended.Would make a great movie!"},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"I loved Le Carre's early works and the he went down hill and this one hit bottom. I finished this book looking for at least ten more pages. I thought the printer left them out."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Le Carre has created an exceptional body of fiction within the trappings of espionage and the Cold War. As the world has changed, though, the author's focus has shifted to peripheral criminals and hangers-on in shadowy but less recognizable conflicts. But his writing has always been about the human dimensions of people involved in these situations. A reciprocal betrayal - father and son of each other - cuts through this story like a fault line and defines the moral landscape which Le Carre explores with characteristic skill. The particulars of his characters never seem like backstory manufactured for a Holywood film. There is an undeniable Oedipal dimension to this fine book: Tiger Single is a survivor, whatever his morals, and Oliver, however high-minded, remains altogether untested. Wife and mother appears briefly as a lurid incarnation compared to Tiger's solid mistress. And the utter failure of three capers planned early in the book paves the way for Tiger's capitulation to a sordid course which his son cannot stomach. First rate."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Though Mr Le Carre knows the complexities and the essence of the spy world probably more than any other author judging by his biography I think that though in Single & Single, he fully goes into these elements to make a story, he fails, unlike other spy authors, to provide ingenious twists and turns and credible suspense to make its work enticing leaving it somewhat dull. In addition, his writing style permanently changes its focus in every paragraph with places, characters and times, so sometimes it gets tiresome to follow him. The ending in this particular plot was prepared beforehand and made predictable, leaving a bit bitter taste on myself as a reader at the time I turned the last page. I have had great expectations when I purchased the book due to the reputation of Mr Le Carre, but they were not fulfilled, at least with Single & Single"},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"I read this while on vacation recently and thoroughly enjoyed it. This book is a good, light read that's great for vacations or other times when you want something that isn't going to consume all of your waking thoughts. Took me about five days to read.Single and Single isn't the super-intense spy thriller that I remember LeCarre's other books to be. Don't get me wrong, it's a good book -- just not as intense as some of his others.Recommend: YesRe-read: I probably won't bother re-reading this one."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"This very entertaining book on tape would have been much more enjoyable had the author choosen to hire a professional to do the reading. His attempt to immitate the various characters voices and the various inflections he uses make this a difficult listen. When he lowers his voice to create the illusion of secreacy, it is almost impossible to understand what is being said. Next time I'll read his work!"},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"With the exception of Le Carre's latest book, The Constant Gardener, I read all of his work. It is not the interesting stories Mr. LeCarre can tell you in his books, but also his excellent writing style that I personally find enjoyable. This book, however is a new kind of mystery novel. There are no spys, and it seems that every character in this book is more of a &quot;bad guy/gal&quot; than a good one. They are all looking to redeem themselves one way or another, but with no success. I enjoyed this book completely and recommend it to anyone as a good and interesting read. Go for it!"},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"I would advise anyone thinking of reading this book, not to buy the paper version, but to get the audio version instead. There is simply noone who can read his own work better than Le Carre. His voice is wonderfully expressive, his accents are flawless, his personas 3-dimensional. He conjures up a movie in the listener's head. My daily commute went by in a blur listening to this, and it was so gripping that towards the end I ended up sitting in the car park morning and night desparate to listen to just a little bit more. It's perhaps not his greatest book -- The Perfect Spy probably gets my vote -- but it is superb nonetheless."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"I hadn't picked up a Le Carre novel in years, but decided, after being urged on by my wife, to give this one a shot. I enjoyed it. Le Carre does an excellent job of delving into the schemes of the international lawyers, and bakers who support mafia operations worldwide. In doing so, he demonstrates that he is more than simply a spy novelist. Some readers may find the chronological shifts of the story to be jarring--especially if you tend to skim as I do when reading anything whatsoever. However, the story will make itself clear by the end of the book. I eagerly look forward to Mr. Le Carre's next literary venture."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Single and Single portrays the consequences for Oliver Single after his crisis of conscience. Single is a trust lawyer, with his father, for an emerging Russian Mafia family. The novel thrusts Single into a cloak and dagger world where he attempts to rescue his estranged father, and uncover the conspiracy within the conspiracy of the Russia underworld.The novel maintains tight suspense, and yet addresses issues of personal ethics and family relations. The book is really a great read, the only drawback is the lack of development among woman's characters. This weakness has little impact on the story or the message, and like some others of Le Carre's books the main character propels the story into a thought provoking struggle between ideas, as much as a struggle between people."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"This is a case where it doesn't seem quite fair to have an audiotape rating mixed in with the ratings of the print version. I might have liked the print version of the book assuming it filled it the gaping holes in the abridged tape. As it was, the tape was a frustrating experience in trying to keep track of a very large cast of characters; unexpected flashbacks; and sudden changes of scene. LeCarre's narration didn't help as he often spoke too softly.I'm not even sure if I can wrote coherently about the plot. Truely the tape was so scattered that I only have a mild sense of the complexities motivating Oliver. The rest of the characters, including some with terrific potential such as his father, are barely two-dimensional as abridged. I did manage to grasp that Oliver is torn between loyalties to his father and to the British government.Bottom-line: Maybe the print version is worth reading but avoid the tape."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Early in the novel we find Alfie Winser, lawyer and agent for British investment firm 'Single and Single' - alone, on a hillside in Turkey, realizing, with mounting horror and panic, &quot;a mess of sweat and piss and mud&quot; that he is about to be killed gangland style by Russian/Georgian hoods. We quickly move to a small town near Devon, England where Oliver Hawthorne lives quietly carrying on his trade as a children's magician. Things get complicated quickly. UK authorities want to know how five million Pounds suddenly appears in Oliver's daughter's trust fund. Oliver has no anawer - the depositor is an anonymous, mysterious stranger. Oliver's father disappears. With this fast start you may be forgiven for anticipating another typical convoluted and complicated Le Carre plot. That 'Single &amp; Single' is unable to maintain momentum and fades into a rather predictable plot, with a silly Hollywood-script-like action conclusion is disappointing.Along the way though Le Carre employs his more familiar style - using flashbacks and multiple story lines to flesh out the characters and their history and to weave his story plot. Flashback some years earlier and we meet selfsame Oliver, but his surname is Single and he is working for his father in the British investment firm they own. The firm, and domineering, greedy and arrogant father - Tiger Single - deal with 'specialized' finance - assisting Moscow power broker Yevgeny Orlov launder money from his illegal arms trade. Oliver and Tiger are very reminiscent of Magnus and Rick Pym's father-son, love-hate, relationship from 'A Perfect Spy' but with a twist. Oliver and Zoya Orlov fall in love, get married and with Zoya's urging, Oliver turns informant and blows Tiger's and the firms cover, to Nat Brock from the UK task force investigating black market crime. We are back with Hawthorne now, Oliver angry, guilty, alone tries to start his life over as a new man in a small quiet town. We are also back to where we began - with events unfolding, Oliver with the assistance of Brock begins the search for Tiger. All paths lead to Alix Hoban, Orlov's main man.It's in the straightening out of these paths and in following along to the journey's end, where the predictability and disappointment come in."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Not only can Le Carre write circles around hacks half his age, but he reads his stuff really really well. Ultimately, the characters that fall in and out (and are sometimes shown stage door left with a resounding gunshot) are pretty much the same. But they all represent what LC's work is about ... complete loneliness. Tattered men with tarnished ideals making one last good for the team. And LC's voice captures that loneliness perfectly. While not as stunning a performance as Tailor Of Panama, S &amp; S shines nonetheless. In no small part because of Le Carre's terrifically lonely voice."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Unlike the brilliant &quot;Our Game,&quot; &quot;Single and Single&quot; creates no meaningful connection between the its reader's life and the world of its characters; Oliver's big adventure (and Oedipal gratification) is good fun, but leaves the reader unchanged. The world is not a better place, the British Intelligence community is still run by uncaring accountants, but at least Oliver's loved ones are safe, he's gotten himself a girl, and Dad promises to be a better person. Shucks, I suppose he wasn't going to join the Chechen army, but I'd hoped for something more than a ride into the sunset."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"There is a tendancy to compare, favorably or unfavorably, an author's latest with his previous work. Given that, I say with some qualification, that this book is not as good as some of Le Carre's earlier books: specifically, the Smiley/Karla triology. So what! Compared to what else is out there, I'm convinced that something coming from Le Carre's hand is a better read than anything else currently available, unless Graham Greene or Eric Ambler are still publishing without my knowledge."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Although Single &amp; Single falls short of the Karla series,LeCarre is back on track (I am still puzzled by the Tailor of Panama)with this excellent novel. Single &amp; Single, like all of LeCarre's work, requires some discipline but duly rewards the patient reader. The writing is beautiful, and LeCarre remains peerless on matters of ethical imprecision."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"I loved this book. His ear for dialogue is matched only by Elmore Leonard and I don't think his sense of the complexity of ethical behavior is matched by any other contemporary writer.I am a little distressed by the arrogant, dismissive tone of some of the one star reviewers. Surely it's not fair to offer such scathing reviews to a book that they didn't take the time to understand--or even finish."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Despite other readers' comments to the contrary, this newest LeCarre novel was a big hit with me. His best effort since A Perfect Spy (wherein we also examine the complexities of the father-son relationship), LeCarre weaves a magical story with twists and turns that leave the reader breathless. This is not a fast read--the character development and international intrigue are rich with detail and need savoring. LeCarre loves to jump back and forth in time; this device can be confusing at times. Nonetheless, if you loved A Perfect Spy you will enjoy this one too."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"LeCarre equals his performance in the Tailor of Panama.

International Intrigue, Fathers, Sons, lovers, betrayal, all are part of this engrossing book. A truly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"This book should be recommended reading for anyone suffering from insomnia. I could hardly stay awake after reading two or three pages. The characters have little depth. There isn't a likeable or sympathetic character in the book. While some critics might call this Le Carre's best novel in years, this might be because it is only slightly more interesting than anything he may have done in years. This book is next to impossible to read. I would characterize Le Carre's writing style as both tedious and boring. Much of the dialog is crytic and virtually incomprehensible. I found the plot only slightly more interesting than a Martha Stewart cookbook. I really felt cheated after reading this book in light of the hype that came with its publication. Reading this book is a waste of time."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Reading Single &amp; Single reminded me of having to read Crime and Punishment while in college, even though Single &amp; Single was not as long it was as torturous to read. I admired Oliver but got lost in the world of the magician, the spy, the merchant, the lawyer, his dear dad Tiger, the russian mafia and the various love interests. I am afraid time has passed a great writer by, and his attempt to catch up was just about a failure."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Hooray! John LeCarre has given us his best novel since Smiley's People. Everything is here, troubled hero, hateful villains, even LeCarre's obligatory sad Russian woman. No one writing today matches LeCarre's ability to mix sheer mass market excitement with literary craft superior to what usually passes for literary. I am a happy reader."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Le Carre is a true master, getting better and better. Single and Single is another excellent example of Le Carre's talents, superbly written in classic Le Carre style. A well researched and convincing story with vivid characters. Truly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"This is the first Le Carre book I've read. I enjoyed it, but it was only above average. The ending was somewhat forced and seemed slapped together. As though the author had a page limit, realized he was almost out of space , and brought the book to an abrupt ending. All in all, though, it was a good read."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"As time goes by, the Cold war is giving new cannon fodder to spy-stories, but the thrilling and mistery of the East-West secret conflict are all but gone. It is rather clumsy to follow the adventure of a Custom and Excise Officer and his buddies once Mr. LeCarre' had been serving us so juicy MI5 or KGB's stories, and apart from some rare sparkle, the plot is somewhat dull, the gist can be inferred from the first pages and, well, everything seems become trivial and meaningless, just as perhaps Mr. LeCarre' honestly wants us to understand."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Single &amp; Single is marvelous. Because Le Carre has set such a high standard--he is after all, the greatest writer in the genre since Joseph Conrad--it is high praise indeed to say that he is in close to top form. Tiger Single is a compelling character, and the interaction between him and the principle protagonist, his son Oliver, is the heart of this exciting novel."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"This is classic Le Carre. It's a page turner. You will be burning the midnight oil to finish it!"},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"John Le Carre novels have an atmospheric quality. I tend to read them more slowly than usual to let the sense of corrupted ideals and imminent menace establish itself within the complex, relationship driven scenarios. Le Carre's odd construction unfolds in a series of vignettes and flashbacks, often at seeming tangents to the storyline, elaborately and sensuously detailed, while important plot developments can be dealt with and dismissed in a paragraph. His novels have to be read carefully to retain continuity due to the abundance of participants and the abrupt changes in pace, venue &amp; time. The end of the Cold War left Le Carre without a natural theatre for his pragmatic exigencies to beat down moral principle. His people in previous books tended to be minor functionaries, acting out of habit, in the exhausted codices and machinery of the Cold War. Bleak Kafka like landscapes such as Berlin acted as a backdrop to roles in which meaning and nobility had long since been lost. The gangster barons of economically ruined Russia and the errant knights of Merchant Banking have replaced his Cold War operatives with cool aplomb but perhaps a less clinical austerity. The moral issues of the Free Market become equally vague and malleable in the over all scheme of things. The manners, intrigues and betrayals of family now replace that of state and ideology. MI5 and MI6 are replaced with agents of the Foreign Office &amp; Customs Service to provide the de rigueur bureaucratic intricacies. A great cast of characters, well developed, and the irrepressible Le Carre knack for cynical panache presents itself. Women are sprinkled in as mystical sexual icon or Amazon princess. I rated this book as a 4 (i'd rate it 4.4975 if this were allowed!), however, the author is an acquired and peculiar taste and I'm sure many die hard Le Carre afficionados will have no problem giving full marks to his new incarnation."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Oh, dear. Le Carre is, or was earlier in his career, a brilliant writer.I have read and reread a number of Le Carre books lately and what is clear to me is that the quality of his novels has deteriorated over the years, as one might expect, I suppose. Single and Single reads like something written to fill out a publishing contract for a certain number of books.The plots meanders and is hard to follow. You may think that this is par for the course in the novels of Le Carre, but all I can say is that his better works like Spy Who Came In and Honourable Schoolboy have elements of this trickiness, but it is not overdone.There is a certain tendency in modern English novelists--I'm thinking of people like Martin Amis--to give the reader a hard time, and in his later books Le Carre seems to be increasingly of the school of letting the reader try to figure out on his own what is going on in the book. My interpretation is that this is due to lazy writing, and the author losing sight of the reader. Others may disagree.In earlier novels Le Carre leaned a great deal on what appeared to be inside knowledge of the espioniage business. Well, he had me convinced, anyway. Once he gets away from that territory, it seems to me that he is much more inauthentic.My guess is that the character of Tiger Single is somewhat based on Le Carre's own father, who was something of a jet-set conman.The book has plently of brilliantly witty dialog, very much a Le Carre specialty, and passages of superb descriptive writing, so all is not lost, but I would only recommend it for the diehard Le Carre fan who has read everything else and has a lot of time on his/her hands."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Mr. David Cornwell(better known as John LeCarr&egrave; esquire) has come up with another very good book. Afetr the &quot;disappointment&quot; of &quot;TheTailor of Panama&quot;, it seems he has returned back from farce and satire to what he knows best: characterisations, mysteries, moral messages and relationships. His great, philosophic, entertaining, complex writings have propelled him into the realms of Literature. And deservedly so indeed. He is not just a simple spy novelist, but a social philosopher and thinker and a great social historian, definetely one of the greatest of our life and times.A lawyer has his skull shot open on a Turkish hillside; A quiet, lonely magician in the town of Abbot's Quay is called in the middle of the night by his bank to explain the unsolicited arrival of 5,000,030 (the 30 has a very clever and symbolic sinificance) pounds into his baby daughter's very modest Bank account; An illegal freighter gets boarded by Russian coastguards with the brothher of an influential Georgian tradesman gets killed; The great merchant venturer Tiger Single disappears into thin air. What connection can these 4 events possibly have? This is what Mr.LeCarr&egrave; sets out to establish throughout the book. He also tells another tale, the relationship between a Father and his Son. The Son:The Traitor. The Father:The Betrayed. The roles get somewhat changed. The Son:The Redeemer and The Forgiven. The Father:The Saved and The Redeemed. LeCarr&egrave; being the great thinker that he is gives us a very realistic story based on his own relationship between himself and his father. Oliver Single, the Traitor(and also the children's magician) gets asked by a Customs officer to help him track down his father:The celebrated Tiger Single. We know exactly what will happen and how the book is going to end but the journey to the ending is masterful. Oliver's characerisation and his flashbacks connects all the events together and we see them all converging and leading to the final picture like a jigsaw puzzle.LeCarr&egrave; has not lost his talent and ability to create characetrs and to create gripping mysteries ouw of nothing and leave us all satisfied yet hungry for his next.For those who have not met LeCarr&egrave; before, this is not the place to start, I recommend his earlier ones like &quot;The Spy who came in from the Cold&quot; or the Karla trilogy."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Le Carre is back on his game. This book has the feeling of the old Smiley novels. I highly recommend it to anyone who liked Smiley and thought Le Carre was losing his touch. Le Carre is still a great writer and master of this genre."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Besides being a good read with richly developed complex characters, this book has one aspect on which I'd like to commend Le Carre: his treatment of women. Yes, the female characters are a little flat, but compared to other, equally mature best selling authors--Tom Clancy comes to mind in particular--LC's women don't seem to me to fit superwoman stereotypes so readily. I had to congratulate the author here, especially given that he's from a generation of men who find modern women just puzzling. Aggie's nurturing side doesn't detract from her strengths; LC juxtaposes it with Oliver's equally nurturing tendencies in a scene in a Georgian house. Giving two women critical plot-altering victories while the men lie helpless? Unheard of in LC's generation. Good courage on his part."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"The opening is quintessential Le Carre. Who but Le Carre would chart the internal dialogue (or does that constitute a monologue?) that goes through the mind of senior corporate lawyer Alfred Winser, of the firm Single &amp; Single, just as he is about to be summarily executed? Granted it isn't as incisive as Le Carre's previous interrogation scenes but it is still deftly done.If that whets the appetite, then the introduction and eventual discovery of the lead character, Oliver Single aka Oliver Hawthorne, is somewhat of a letdown. Like the elusive Scarlet Pimpernel, Oliver is first shown eluding a bank official who wants to find out why he has a sudden influx of funds in his bank account. Not giving away too much of his background, Oliver is next shown performing magic tricks at various children's parties. But all hopes that Oliver is as multi-faceted as Jim Prideaux (of Tinker, Tailor fame) are soon dashed. Oliver may be driven but he is not stoic though he shares a certain recklessness that seems common among many of Le Carre's leading men.Le Carre still has a knack for concocting a convoluted plot but he seems to be treading on very familiar ground when he paints his portraits of individuals leading double lives and under stress. In fact, one might even say that Single &amp; Single seems to have been sampled freely (in this case, scavenged seems to be too harsh a word) from Le Carre's back catalogue - shades of Jim Prideaux; Brock - the George Smiley stand-in; the Russian locales (from Our Game); the bumbling hero (anything from The Honourable Schoolboy to The Tailor Of Panama, only this time with a happy ending); the duplicitous father (A Perfect Spy) - and, hopefully to rope in and satisfy a new set of younger readers, throw in an all-out assault at the end to justify the pyrotechnics.Single &amp; Single is entertaining but what about those insights on the human predicament that made Le Carre an important writer? There isn't a sense of exasperation in Le Carre's tone (probably not yet anyway) but one certainly expects so much more out of a John Le Carre book that that in itself can be exasperating. - Stephen Tan (Note: This is an excerpt of a longer review that will appear in the February 1999 issue of BigO magazine.)"},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"After finishing Lender's excellentTrojan Horse, I decided to go back and re-read this older LeCarre offering. The drawing of characters and their complex interrelationships of Trojan Horse are reminiscent of LeCarre's mastery in Single & Single. The complex psychology of Tiger and Oliver Single's father-son personal relationship is woven into the plot of this chilling, methodical story. This is not LeCarre's best story by far, but how he portrays the Tiger/Oliver relationship is as good as LeCarre can be, and worth the read."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Overall the story is an interesting read, but it seems to wander at times and there are a lot of subplots which don't seem to really contribute a whole lot to the main story. That's okay, but in the end you find yourself asking, \\"so what happened to....?\\" I found the end especially unsatisfying because it ended so abruptly as if Le Carre had just had about had enough of it already. Kinda disappointing."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"---expert storyteller and expert in painting scenes with the British language, that is. Reading le Carre is most always a pleasure, and this book is not one of the exceptions. He is a master at devising and presenting a stimulating sequence of chapters, gradually encouraging the reader to piece together a bit more of just what the story might be. And within each of those chapters, one discovers many a sentence with well-chosen words likewise arranged in an appealing and creative order. This plot turns out to be an appealing one, but le Carre probably would make the IRS instruction booklets appealing for this reader."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"With nary a spy in sight, Le Carre, British master of Cold War spycraft, constructs a taut tale of international finance and betrayal involving two families - one Russian, one English.With a plot involving intricate high finance it's a good idea to start off with something that will grab the reader's attention and this Le Carre does with the graphic - and videotaped - remote mountainside execution of a proper pinstriped lawyer representing a British investment firm.The narrative then moves to the Devon coast where Oliver Single, a children's magician and divorced father, mysteriously hiding out from something or someone, discovers that a deposit of five million and thirty pounds has been paid into his baby daughter's account. The extra thirty, Oliver knows, is the Judas fee for betrayal.Gradually over the first third of the novel, Le Carre weaves together these disparate events. He resolves various elements of suspense as he sets up the plot, revealing a background of financial, international and familial intrigue. The resolution of minor mysteries opens a treacherous path to a game with much higher stakes, for one of Le Carre's special charms is the aura of deadly playfulness that surrounds the narrative.Another is the development of character. All of LeCarre's players, but for the most thuggish villains, embody soft spots of family love, compassion, humor and whimsy. Oliver, the key, appears as a big, sad, disillusioned amateur, a novice in the unprincipled world of high finance whose education brought about revolt. An unhappy pawn, he develops powers of resourcefulness that cut to the heart of things worth dying for - love and self-respect.The plot moves around the globe from the staid elegance of London's eponymous investment firm, to a lavish villa on the banks of the Bosphorus and an ugly rented house in the new suburbs of Istanbul, to the land scars and idled bulldozers of a busted development in the rural Caucasus, Republic of Georgia.Place embodies character. The \\"prickly sofa\\" of a safe house, the faithful Indian retainer asleep in the bay window of his master's deserted office (\\"the Tiger's tomb, closed but waiting for the robber\\"); the shiny new BMW motorcycle parked in the drawing room of the Russians' extravagant villa, the \\"wet Turkish winter.\\"Le Carre explores the vulnerabilities of the new Russian economy, the opportunities for looting and robbing and the sophisticated Western systems for laundering - and grabbing - much of the money. But the scheme is a primarily a mechanism for motivation as Le Carre lets greed, gullibility, deception, scruples, revenge, fear and bravery work their magic.Oliver is a thoughtful, endearing character whose heroism is practical and nearly devoid of machismo. His physical presence is deceptively clumsy, his morose demeanor equally useful. And he even gets the girl."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"If you take this book to the beach you are going to have to sacrifice something. You can't have it both ways. There are several flashbacks that force the reader to keep on top of the story line. The introduction of numerous characters also require the dedicated attention of the reader. A peak into the &quot;mafia of tommorrow&quot; and their efforts to establish in the west while retaining their ties to their homeland. The main character was likeable. The romance caught me buy surprise and worked well in the story. A good read."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"A first time reader of a Le Carre novel, I found it intrigueing, yet predictable, and all too willing to rush through the finish.

The relationship between Tiger Single and his son Oliver is portrayed with deep insight and literary perfection. I found myself re-reading sentences with delight.The first 100 pages begin the story in the middle, so, although seemingly confusing at the beginning, I found sticking with it well worth the effort. The author knows and loves his characters, each of which he reveals in sparingly beautiful language.It's about the strongest love imaginable... between a parent and a child....about integrity, morals, good and evil. I've read all Le Carre's books and hope to live long enough to read them again... but especially Single &amp; Single. It is his masterpiece."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Having read only one other Le Carre (Night Manager), I thoroughly enjoyed this and even bought a second copy as a gift.

Maybe more seasoned Le Carre readers are hip to the bag of tricks, but I found it top notch."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"LeCarre has recaptured the form he showed with the Smiley books by capturing the seedy side of trade with the gangsters in the former Soviet Union.Single &amp; Single is a law firm in London that has ties to the Russian underworld.

He meets colorful characters in a book full of LeCarre's cerebral images.This is a must read for fans of the spy novel."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"Based on the other reviews, this book appears to be a &quot;love it of leave it&quot; type. I enjoyed how the author peeled off layer after layer revealing secrets along the way.The writing style was, at times, a little confusing. But that only required the reader to think and read carefully. This was welcomed in comparison to some of the bland and formulistic writing today.Not quite five stars but close."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"I found Single and Single to be the perfect book to read on vacation; engaging, suspenseful, interesting, and with palpably real characters."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"I am a major John LeCarre fan. His Cold War novels were unique in distilling the moral ambiguities of that age into the lives of his characters. Like some foreign policy professionals, he has not adapted well to the New World order. This novel is as disappointing as The Night Porter.The characters are underdeveloped, especially the women. All of them play the role required of them by the main character, without any inkling of why they might act that way. Most often, they provide the common sense the hero seems to lack, but why?There are plenty of war stories left in the Cold War. Perhaps LeCarre would do better to continue writing those. The post-Cold War era seems to have eluded him."},{"Title":"Single & Single","review":"AMAZON PRICE $18.20 (PLUS ?)

He has concentrated on the leadership of this elite force, its traditions and battleground experiences.

George W. Burning Bush (with Thomas Fink): The new chief executive/takes his oath with ease./The White/House chef powders up a lethal beverage/and the chief sips with patrician grace./A sunrise effect takes over./The tavern keeper changes channels./Nixon knows people were happier before he was president,/but he lives."},{"Title":"Skinny Eighth Avenue","review":"Poetry these days seems to fall into a few distinct categories: Hallmark-esque quatrains of sentimentality and not much else, turgid prose the energy of which never seems to rise much above the level of a peaceful slumber, and rage-filled rants against one power structure or another, grammatical correctness optional. In an odd way, Stephen Paul Miller's latest work, SKINNY EIGHTH AVENUE, combines all three of these parts--but does so in such a way as to make their sum much greater than one might have a right to expect. Actually much of this book is about combining: in terms of subject matter, Miller flows easily from academic metaphysics (\\"I'm Trying to Get My Phony Baloney Ideas about Metamodernism into a Poem\\") to current politics (\\"George Whatever Bush, or It's in the Bagh, Dad\\") to personal emotional loss (\\"Potato Chip,\\" a poem about his son's grief over the loss of a goldfish) and beyond, and in most cases throws some or all of these subjects together to see what the final result might be. I get the sense that Miller at times isn't entirely sure himself what he's getting at in a given poem, but trusts his reader enough to stay with him while he muses about the possibilities (the specific formatting of the poem is impossible to reproduce in a review like this):they might see it in Bush / but think they've / a solidrationale / that just feels right, / just as / neocons /think they / don't need / to make sense / because /they're cool. / Sometimes / I feel that / way / but it'sweird / how / my job / sort of / well...misused... /well...they put me through / this whole 14th Amendmentthing...This effect is sometimes offputting, since at times it seems as if Miller expects the reader to clean up the intellectual clutter he's casually looked through--difficult without knowing where the different parts of the clutter are supposed to go. But much more often, if one is patient enough to follow along, the impact is startling...as if one has followed Miller through the wanderings of his consciousness to find him or herself, inexplicably, facing the familiar traces of the reader's own. Miller is at his best when he can bring the reader to just such a place, and he is at his best quite a bit throughout this book.Perhaps the most striking combination the book makes, though, is between Miller's words and his son Noah's illustrations, which are always insightful and sometimes strikingly different yet strangely familiar--nothing we would have drawn ourselves at any age, perhaps, yet exactly accurate once we see them in relation to the words which inspired/were inspired by them. The book is extremely well-designed in this regard, mixing illustration with word so neatly that I felt that I was looking at what might have resulted if Shel Silverstein and William Blake had been able to discuss the niceties of their respective crafts over a friendly lunch someday. Absent such a meeting, though, Stephen Paul Miller's work will fill in nicely. It's not always successful, and the different parts don't always fit together neatly. But when they do, the whole they create together is both fresh and compelling: \\"the grounds of your birth have been / lifted, you stay at the corner / of the picture and / away from me, / connected to a thread\\" (from \\"Photo Post\\").Here's to the melding of opposites, and a book which shows us such a powerful way to do so."},{"Title":"Honky-Tonk Cinderella: How to Marry a Monarch (Silhouette Intimate Moments No. 1120)","review":"A night of magic brought a stranger and truck-stop waitress Luanne Evans together. He thought he had been careful, but he unknowingly left Luanne pregnant. Without knowing his true identity, Luanne could not contact her baby's father, so she married her \\"best friend,\\" Jeff Henderson. Jeff raised Luanne's son Chase as his own and pursued a career racing cars. A year and half after the stranger left Luanne behind, he returned to the states to put a racing team together. Luanne's stranger, Prince Alek of Carpathia, was stunned to learn his future driver Jeff had married Luanne and they had a son. Ten years later Jeff dies in a tragic racetrack accident, leaving Luanne seven months pregnant.Chase blames his mother and Alek for his father's death, as grief replaces the child's once sunny disposition. Alek persuades Luanne and Chase to accompany him home to Carpathia for two weeks. After all, the child is heir to his fortune and his throne. Chase quickly adjusts to life in the palace. Meanwhile, Alek's grandmother encourages him to marry Luanne and publicly declare Chase his heir. But complications with her pregnancy lead Luanne to return to the United States.Author Karen Templeton brings a fresh perspective to this Cinderella tale in HONKY-TONK CINDERELLA. Her characters are believable, flawed and human with the expected misgivings and insecurities that make them sympathetic. Rather than the classically beautiful Cinderella beneath the grime and overwork, Laura is pregnant, unwieldy, and resentful. Conversely, Alek transforms over the years, forsaking his Peter Pan/playboy existence for responsibilities and maturity. Further, as in PLAIN-JANE PRINCESS, Templeton captures that surely kid attitude in all its nuances, making her young character sparkle as he struggles with grief and new beginnings. Indeed, Templeton once again masterfully makes royalty and happily-ever-after-ending believable without dodging painful emotional terrain. Consequently, Templeton's trademark balance of convincing romance, well-developed characters and a healthy dose of humor makes HONKY-TONK CINDERELLA very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Honky-Tonk Cinderella: How to Marry a Monarch (Silhouette Intimate Moments No. 1120)","review":"Luanne Evans Henderson is currently dealing with the death of her race car driver husband, her ten year-old grieving son and the impending birth of her baby. As if this all isn't enough, the man who walked out on her eleven years ago has now shown up on her doorstep. She had known him only as Alek Hastings, fellow race car driver and friend of her late husband. They spent one intimate night together, then Alek disappeared -- leaving Luanne pregnant and alone. Jeff Henderson was her salvation, offering marriage, security and a father for her son. The last person she needs back in her life is Alek, resurrecting long-buried memories and turning her and her son's lives upside down.Prince Aleksander Vlastos of Carpathia had been sowing his wild oats eleven years ago before having to settle down as leader of his country. Never did he dream that he would regret leaving Luanne behind all those years ago. Now, with the knowledge that she is the mother of his heir, Alek is back to atone for his mistakes and those of his friend, Jeff Henderson. Convincing Luanne of that, however, is another story.Karen Templeton is a master at in-depth characterization. Luanne is a tough cookie on the outside, confused and emotional on the inside. Alek is the perfect foil for her; compassionate, caring and as stubborn as Luanne. Luanne's ten year-old son Chase is an emotional and integral addition to the story, delivering realistic, emotional, and tumultuous dialogue and actions. HONKY-TONK CINDERELLA is filled with Ms. Templeton's trademark descriptive and narrative prose, witty and realistic dialogue and down-to-earth, real-life people. A heart-wrenching twist near the end will have readers reaching for the tissues.Readers will feel a true sense of affinity with these characters as they travel along the path of their incredible journey discovering each other and the power of familial love.

The original missionaries; twelve Franciscans in 1524, twelve Dominicans in 1526 and seven Augustinians in 1533; noted the similarities between European Christian thought of the time and the Aztec beliefs they found in New Spain. Although fundamentally different, coincidental similarities abounded: both cultures thought the world was about to end; both used architecture for rituals and pageantry, both loved theatrical presentations using large casts of people. The early missionaries took the notion of building a New Jerusalem literally and the mendicant compounds were built with the plans of the ancient Temple of Jerusalem in mind. These complexes included open altar areas and architectural details such as a short tower or a row of three arches that could symbolize Jerusalem. Drama became a catechetical tool and the missionaries knew the natives responded favorable to the sights and sounds on the altar, be it the liturgy of the mass or a religious play. Both cultures loved crosses and Aztec crosses would include an obsidian mirror at the center, reflecting the sun. This sunlight could be linked to Jesus, the light of the world, or to the Canticle of the Sun of St. Francis. Likewise, the Aztec blood sacrifices seemed to make possible a fundamental acceptance of the life-giving sacrifice of Christ on the Cross. A culture familiar with rituals of cutting out a sacrificial victim's heart might embrace the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. This book is very scholarly with 50 pages of notes and a 29 page bibliography, but it is not only for the scholar. It is oversized, beautifully designed and richly illustrated with hundreds of color examples of Aztec relics, early missionary buildings, rare manuscript pages and remarkable building decorations, many photographed by the author on site. A superb demonstration of how the mendicant friars \\"changed the root metaphor and Christianized a continent.\\""},{"Title":"The BBI Dictionary of English Word Combinations: Using the BBI Combinatory Dictionary of English: A workbook with exercises","review":"VERY USEFUL!

This is a book that will change the way you think about Flemish painting. Although its topic is ostensibly narrow--pictures of markets from about 1550 to 1650--it actually offers an entirely new interpretation of Flemish artistic culture, and it does it by using a refreshingly new methodology. Honig argues that painting became a site where issues of economic thinking (about value, exchange, desire) were rehearsed and finally resolved, although their resolution spelled the end of the market genre. The best chapters were Ch.3, on Beuckelaer's *Ecce Homo* scenes set in a market (these, she shows, are about judgment, justice, and market desire) and Ch.6, where she discusses the history of connoisseurship, collecting, and forgery.

That surface agreement, however, will be misleading because the other person is probably thinking about a totally different kind of scenario thinking than you are.Learning from the Future helps overcome that misunderstanding by explaining a large number of ways that scenarios can be used. The book contains 25 chapters which each look at a different aspect of scenario development and subsequent thinking.Three chapters look at what scenario learning is. Seven chapters explore basic approaches to constructing scenarios. Eight chapters describe how to apply scenarios in different contexts, like competitor evaluations, technology investing, making public policy decisions, and considering customers. The final section looks at how to create the right organizational environment for making and using scenarios for learning.You will benefit from reading the thoughts of many of the world's top experts and users of scenario learning including Peter Schwartz, Kees van der Keijden, Ian Wilson, Liam Fahey and Robert Randall. It is a great line-up, and what they have to say is good food for thought.If you would like a good introduction to scenario learning, this is an excellent place to start because the perspectives that are captured are unusually broad and appropriate.This book belongs in the business library of every business decision-maker. When an important question arises, you can use this book as a resource to think through how you might best use scenarios to create a better result.

All too frequently, these efforts become routine: what if we increase (decrease) marketing budgets by 10%? What if raw material prices go up (down)? It's all pretty warm beer given the pace of business change every company faces.This book shows how to do it right. The editors have shaped the contributions of 24 experts iinto a thorough, rigorous book covering all the vital aspects of scenarios. The reader will find clear discussions of what scenarios should be and how organizations can use them to &quot;learn from the future.&quot; There are chapters on tools and techniques (like simulation models), advice on implementation, and case studies from both the private and public sector. The last chapter, &quot;Twenty Common Pitfalls in Scenario Planning&quot; is especially valuable.Forewarned is forearmed.

The 446-page book is a collection of 25 chapters by a variety of authors, each adding a perspective to the scenario learning process. Fahey and Randall explain how scenario learning builds on traditional scenario planning, then follow up with a chapter on integrating scenarios with strategy. Several essays explain basic approaches to constructing scenarios. The next section shows how to apply scenario learning in diverse contexts including industry scenarios, competitive positioning, technology investments, and anticipating new consumer products. The last section details the vital step of managing the organizational context for scenario learning. Included in this section is a contribution by Kees van der Heijden on the business idea, and Paul Schoemaker on common pitfalls in scenario planning. This book is an excellent resource on the practical use of scenarios in business strategy. It mostly avoids overcomplicating the process as some other books have done, and it focuses on practical strategic implementation, not scenarios for their own sake. At a time when the New Economy continually throws up surprises, looking ahead with scenario learning is more timely than ever."},{"Title":"Learning from the Future: Competitive Foresight Scenarios","review":"Learning From the Future, by Fahey and Randall, is a very comprehensive how-to manual for creating foresight scenarios and turning them into action. The use of scenarios to formulate a vision of the future and how best to be prepared for it has been a major strategy tool since the RAND Corporation, the military think tank, started using this methodology in the 50's to plan for \\"unthinkable\\" contingencies.The collection of authors recounts the steps vital to a good scenario: identify key current forces affecting the organization, involve all levels of management (so they \\"own\\" the scenario results), assure the scenarios are linked to crucial decision processes, do not slip into trying to forecast the \\"most likely\\" future, tell a story, link the scenario elements logically (perhaps graphically) together. Chapter 4 is especially good at describing how to create matrices of outcomes with sliding scales of driving forces such as the price of gas or protectionist versus open markets. Both \\"future forward\\" (present day forward, or inductive) and \\"future backward\\" (working from the future backwards, deductive) scenario types are explored, as are computer-assisted methods.Every conceivable element that could be factored into a scenario is covered and categorized in the book, including political trends, natural disasters, pricing and cultural trends, as well as the classic SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats). If there is one fault to the book, it is that the case studies could be more poignant - instead of distinct organizations with palpable products and threats, these tend to be generic (e.g., a \\"high tech\\" company producing \\"electronics\\"); this exsanguination of content leads to some bland examples and occasional lapses into platitudes (e.g., \\"leave enough time for evaluation\\"). In contrast, another scenario book, The Sixth Sense, by van der Heijden, glows with colorful case studies. When I created and played in scenarios at RAND, we found that adding color and story helped the process immeasurably: we created posters and put them on the wall, we got into character like actors do, we generated future headlines and stories - not just generically, but for a specific date and paper (the Washington Post was a favorite) - to make the process seem more relevant and the results more richly detailed. The book could also have more precise examples of insights and corporate changes that resulted from scenarios as evidence for their worth - this text is clearly meant for the already converted. That said, the very extent and thoroughness of the material, its coverage of elements often left out of other texts, and its provision of checklists for novice scenario builders, make it a must-read. The use of scenarios has a long track record of success, even in decades past when the rate of change and pace of market forces was more leisurely. In this day and age, when markets can evolve every six months, the use of scenarios to enable an organization to be proactive rather than reactive is more important than ever, and this text is one of the most exhaustive that exists on this important topic."},{"Title":"Learning from the Future: Competitive Foresight Scenarios","review":"Fahey and Randall have brought together an excellent team of authors who have given numerous suggestions of what to do and what not to do in developing scenario learning in organizations and institutions. From making it unmistakable that top CEOs must be involved in the process, to offering an outline for a scenario learning workshop, suggestions for scenario learning team members and cautions about the pitfalls of using scenarios, the authors have given their insights and visions for successful futures planning for organizations.The smart leader uses scenarios as an important tool in the executive toolkit. Just as good decision-making is not done in a vacuum, but rather is done in the light of a good deal of research and information gathering, so even scenario planning is prefaced by homework, preparation. Elements of history, traditions, branding, decision-making methodology, personnel, key decision factors and key external forces are all pieces of the background necessary for scenario planning. Scenario Learning is not just one more thing one must do because some higher up says it must be done. It is not just a task. All decision-making of any magnitude needs to cease until the scenario planning sheds light on the decision. This process is the best of strategic planning and should not be set aside while the company chooses its strategy. \\"Scenarios are most valuable when they are understood to be movies of an evolving story, not a snapshot of a specific point in time\\" (p. 12).Several types of scenarios are offered. Scenario learning, in the context of Systems Thinking, is a powerful tool for moving into a changed reality. Systems thinking is the engine of dynamic scenario planning. In any system it must be understood that each element in a system acts or reacts to every other element in the system (elements such as events, patterns of behavior and contextual structure). Seeing the system rather than individual elements when making a decision means making decisions with a greater possibility of successful growth.\\"Scenario Learning is a search for an understanding of how the future could change, and how an organization could thrive by adapting to a number of particular changed circumstances.\\" Scenario learning identifies what the indicators of change are, and what decisions and actions must be taken today to be ready to survive and win tomorrow and in the years to come\\" (p. xi).

His scholarly articles focus on problems of Hittite history, mainly matters affecting the western half of the Anatolian peninsula -- Ahhiyawa and the Lycians. The first of his two recent books published by Oxford (of which this is the second), entitled \\"The Kingdom of the Hittites\\", shows the fruit of his close engagement with the best and latest research. In this second book, the subject of which is not quite as much his specialty, Bryce has written a lively and accurate account of what life was like in the ancient Hittite world (c. 1650-1150 BC). The chapter headings indicate his approach, which personalizes the subject matter. Instead of chapter headings like \\"Law\\", \\"Religion\\", \\"Art\\", \\"literature\\", etc., Bryce focuses on the person who operates in these spheres: scribes, priests, judges, farmers, craftsmen. In so doing he allows even old hands in his discipline to appreciate the information they already possess as seen in a new light, and makes comprehending the subject easier for first-time students. Oxford University Press has not cluttered the page with footnotes, but ample documentation is available in unabtrusive endnotes. For a hardback edition the rice too is reasonable, chiefly because the press did not indulge in glossy plates or maps. Readers who feel the need for more graphics should also buy J. G. Macqueen's book \\"The Hittites\\" which has a plethora of plates. Highly recommended for readers from high school through retirement home."},{"Title":"Life and Society in the Hittite World","review":"This book is one part of what is essentially a duology. Trevor Bryce wrote two books on the Hittites, one dealing with their history and the other with their culture and society. This book is the latter. If you want a book that will tell you how the Hittites fit into the Near Eastern world then this isn't the book for you. You want Bryce's other book. This one is solely a cultural history, although it does include a king list at the beginning. It is surprising how much information there is available on Hittite culture considering that everything we know is based on tablets unearthed from archives. Not surprisingly there are many gaps, but this book lays out the basic map of what it was like in Hittite times. Instead of dividing it into general sections like Religion and Religion Bryce has focused each chapter on a particular career such as that of a scribe or a priest. This gives it a much clearer focus and lets the reader see clearly how that segment of the population lived.

As a follow-up, Bryce offered something that focuses more on the Hittite little guy, or at least little guys important enough to leave traces in cuneiform texts.LIFE AND SOCIETY IN THE HITTITE WORLD consists of thirteen chapters that each focus on some particular demographic. Sure, chapter one concerns only that kingly sphere that Bryce's earlier book did, but then we get depictions of what life might have been like for scribes, farmers, merchants, warriors and healers, as well as descriptions of marriage, religious observance, funeral rites and popular mythology.This is an entertaining book, and a necessary complement to Bryce's earlier history. It could be improved, however. One weakness is that although Bryce is clearly indulging in a lot of speculation (the phrasing \\"X may have Y\\" is seemingly on every page), there is no chapter describing the sources used so we can get some feel for how firm his vision of Hittite life might be. Sources are briefly described, but only in footnote citations that will be help more to specialists than the wide audience this book is directed at. Also, the last chapter, which muses on what debt Greek mythology and poetics might have to links with Bronze Age Anatolia, feels somewhat out of place here."},{"Title":"Life and Society in the Hittite World","review":"one of the best books for the life of the ancient Hittite civilization.this book like his previous work of; \\"The Kingdom of the Hittites\\" used the latest researches about the subject."},{"Title":"Absolutely, Positively Alexander","review":"I have a 6 year old nephew and gave this book to my sister to read to him, they both loved it!"},{"Title":"Absolutely, Positively Alexander","review":"This book is a must have!

In &quot;Alexander Who Used to Be Rich,&quot; he fantasizes about all you do with a dollar, while in the third book, he resists (as most kids do) the family's need to move far away.My own sons have enjoyed these books - starting in 1972 and into the present. The stories are not dated, as any parent of a child like Alexander can tell you - every untied shoelace is a major tragedy, a move around the corner can be traumatic and 'unfair,' and a dollar can buy you just about anything when you're in that wonderful 4 to 8 year old time of life.Parents reading the book will see the humor. Children hearing the words will feel as though they are being understood.As kids grow up (8 to 9 is about the end of the line for this series) they'll begin to see the humor in Alexander's thoughts.Well written, with illustrations that are well above average, these books are a wonderful addition to any family library.

If you've ever wondered when a tip is expected or worried that you have embarrassed yourself by leaving too much or too little, the information in this little book will put your mind at ease. Following a brief Introduction and &quot;History of Tipping&quot;, the tipping advice is divided into 9 chapters, each for a different situation in which you will be expected to tip: Dining Out, Transportation, Lodging, Personal Care, House Calls, Weddings &amp; Other Special Events, Casinos &amp; Cruise Ships, Going Abroad, and Off the Beaten Path (which discusses tips for more exotic service providers, such as tattoo artists and lap dancers). Each chapter begins by describing the topic and &quot;the players&quot;, those service persons whom you will encounter and possibly need to tip. This is followed by an explanation of the job each service provider does for you, accompanied by the appropriate tip. At the end of each chapter, there is a &quot;tipping chart&quot;, which allows you to see whom and how much to tip at a glance. Also included throughout the book are bits of tipping trivia, advice on when not to tip, and ideas for how to plan and organize your tipping expenses. The &quot;Going Abroad&quot; chapter differs from the others in that it is organized by continent, and then by country, and its tipping guidelines are more general in nature. There are tip tables in the back of the book for calculating 15 and 20 per cent gratuities.In consulting several books and web sites for guidance, I've noticed that tipping is often subjective. Even &quot;experts&quot; don't always agree on what is appropriate. But, all in all, &quot;The Itty Bitty Guide to Tipping&quot; is a useful, well-organized book. It's only 3 1/4 x 5 1/2 inches in size and will easily fit in a briefcase, the corner of a suitcase, or even a handbag. There is one issue, however, that may or may not bother you: The type in this book is dark green on a white background. The introductory pages to each chapter are written in white on a green background. Some of the sidebar-type information is even green on green. The green print is dark and easy to read when against a white background, which it is for most of the book.

It is concise and specific and tells you *exactly* what to do in each tipping situation you might encounter."},{"Title":"The Itty Bitty Guide to Tipping","review":"I bought this book for a non-American friend to help answer all those questions about tipping in this country. When I glanced through it, there seemed to be adequate information in most areas of tipping. I think he finds it useful."},{"Title":"The Itty Bitty Guide to Tipping","review":"Contains suggested tip amounts and reasons for them. I will use it often. It includes many areas where most people do not think of giving tips. Such as garbage collectors."},{"Title":"Pure No More (Erotic Classics)","review":"The Wantons is the story of Linda and her girlfriend Betty in modern day England. Being a modern tday tale the sex of course includes drugs as Linda hooks up with Desmond and a group of his sleazy buddies .... The writing is Ok the sex is not really spectacularForbidden Pleasures is a disgustingly vague and and dumb story from the mexican hinterland that makes no sense and is disjointed ....The editor probably hated the first two stories so much he didn't even bother to read the third story in the book .. I as well was tempted to forget it ....The Musician is a third story or mini boook over 100 pages long. This is a sensless story about Mr Gus Tolman and his growing up in the US Northeast ... This is a ho hum account ..Sorry the best thing about this book is the title and thats it !"},{"Title":"Teaching Language and Literature in Elementary Classrooms: A Resource Book for Professional Development","review":"I used this text with pre-service teachers as required reading for my course in teaching elementary language arts. It is a book that my students highly recommend and that they feel will be a useful resource to them throughout their future years of teaching. This text gives a solid framework to a well-rounded language and literacy program, based on sound theory and realistic practice. Each of the twelve chapters is divided into recurring sections so that the format becomes predictable. The author shows in a meaningful way how to integrate language and literature across the curriculum, giving concrete examples of each concept and teaching practice at the Kindergarten level, the primary level and the intermediate level. Throughout the text, in the \\"What Do You Think?\\" section, Popp asks reflective questions to her readers. These provide wonderful discussion starters in class and opportunities for the students to reflect privately at home in a focused manner. The recurring section on evaluation was of particular value to my students, connecting specific types of assessment strategies to specific classroom activities - for example, creating a \\"discussion chain\\" or a \\"shared-pair\\" summary to evaluate understanding of a presentation. Popp makes sure to build connections from home to school and community, and is very conscious of including students and teachers with varying needs and in varying situations. There is truly something for everyone in this valuable text. Popp provides for each topic recommended readings of relevant professional literature, descriptions of teaching resources and a variety of theoretical perspectives, in addition to very thorough preparation and step-by-step instructions in carrying out the teaching strategies.Although as a Canadian I had some concerns about the all-American references and cited literature, I would still heartily recommend this text to instructors/students in both Canada and the U.S.A., perhaps encouraging additional Canadian content or a future Canadian edition."},{"Title":"Shake Dem Halloween Bones","review":"This has to be one of the best books!
