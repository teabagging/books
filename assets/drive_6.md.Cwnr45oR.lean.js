For everybody who loves fantasy books, this is a definite 'should read'.This is about an 11-year-old orphan, Harry Potter, who lives with his aunt, uncle, and cousin - all of whom are (to put it bluntly) 'not very nice' to Harry. When Harry finds out he's a wizard, it seems his dreams have come true - he gets to leave his relatives house (at least) and go the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is also, in the wizarding world, famous. He makes friends, and it all seems so wonderful.But Harry is famous for a certain reason - and he might just not have the most wonderful time at Hogwarts as he though...."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I first opened this book I thought it was going to be some cheesy children's novel. Thank goodness I gave it a chance. The first installment to the Harry Potter series is bewitching and exciting. I couldn't put it down after the first chapter. It's a short read but the story will last for a long time. Tales of a boy wizard and his first year at a school of magic, what could be more fun!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was introduced to me by a child and now I have read the first two and agree that it is one of the best books I have read in a long time. The story is full of entertainment and enchantment while keeping the reader spellbound and entranced from start to finish. I recently finished reading it to my 7 year old daughter and I am in the process of reading the second book to my 4th grade class. Let your mind go and enjoy this delightful tale."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As many kids and adults before me I thorouly enjoyed reading this book. I couldn't put it down. Every plot line led to something else interesting and you just had to read on. J.K. Rowling did an excellent job writing the plot lines.The story starts when Harry's parents are killed by You-Know-Who and Harry is made to live with his uncle, aunt, and the unbearable cousin Dudley. Harry lives a boring and horrible life as he is mistreated by his relatives. Everything however gets much more interesting on Harry's 11th birthday as everthing seems to be out of ordinary. Harry begins to find out the truth about his past and before he knows it is wisked off to Hogwarts itch and Wizardry School with the giant gameskeeper of Hogwarts named Hagrid.Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione have many adventures as they survive the sorting hat, battle a mountain troll, survive Professor Snape's Potions class,befriend Hagrids Dragon,survive Draco Malfroy and his 2 buddies, and find out the truth about the sorcerer's stone. Sometimes it is very frustrating reading this book because you want the kids so much to tell the teachers what thy have discovered so they don't get into danger but it is impossible. I thourouly enjoyed this book and there wasn't one point in the 3 hours that I was reading it was I bored.Hope I'd helped!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If I were twelve, this book would rate five stars. This is because it is a fine children's book, and Rowling must be given credit for constructing the perfect fantasy for a twelve year-old. Harry is alone, neglected, unloved, and misunderstood; these are feelings that come naturally at that age. Harry's cousin is odious, spoiled, and pampered by his adoptive aunt and uncle, while he is mistreated terribly. Who among us has not felt at least once that a sibling was favored over us?But Harry is also something special, as all twelve year-olds want to be. He has special powers, and he is rescued from those who do not appreciate him by a magical fantasy world where not only are all his needs met, but where he has a great destiny, where even the oldest and wisest know his name and power. Vengeance is exacted on the foolish \\"muggles\\" in the form of a tail being placed on his fat, spoiled cousin, and the terrible aunt and uncle are humiliated before him by a rescuer who is utterly loyal and overwhelmingly powerful. Adventure and excitement follow.It's easy to see why kids love this, and it's great that so many are reading rather than watching the tripe we are fed these days on television. But what is confusing and even disturbing is how Harry Potter has caught on with adults. Because for an adult, this story fails on many, many levels. Were Harry to be locked under the stairs for weeks at a time by a cruel aunt and uncle, he would be an emotional cripple, sick from living in his own waste, quite incapable of the things he achieves at Hogwarts. One would like to think that social services would appear and remove him from such an abusive environment, and it's likely that he would spend the rest of his life needing regular therapy.As well, the story is problematic as a story, for there is no real dramatic tension here. We know that Harry is messianic, that he has a great destiny, that he is morally pure in a world of unrealistic black-and-white ethics. At no point after his arrival at Hogwarts does he actually fail, and we the readers know that he never will, that he will always be the hero, the star quidditch player, the only one who can face the evil wizard. Were Harry to be less than perfect, to be human and flawed like the rest of us, would expose the fantasy for what it is: shallow and empty, lacking the richness that real life, with all its risks and rewards and moral uncertainty, can bring.In a children's book these flaws may be overlooked; children, and their stories, thrive on hyperbole and exaggeration and simplicity. But for an adult, there are serious ethical problems in this story that the media-induced frenzy surrounding this series has not addressed. Revenge is presented as a virtue; witness the treatment of fat, one-dimensional little Dudley, and the glee with which Harry looks forward to tormenting him at the end of the book. There is a disturbing racial overtone to the work as some people (those with magic powers) are presented as being inherently better than others (muggles). And in the relationships between magical folks and muggles, might, of course, makes right.As we age, it is hoped that we will outgrow such beliefs and prejudices, that our parents and teachers and experience itself will show us that they are wrong. But the fact that adult fans of Harry Potter embrace the series with such enthusiasm makes me wonder if indeed we have, or if we have simply become bigger, better-armed versions of Harry, exacting petty revenge and imposing our power over peoples and nations we find unworthy, and encouraging our children to do the same.Being a mere muggle, I find that prospect rather unsettling."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Some ask \\"If these books really aren't evil, why are so many parents not allowing their children to get involved in Harry Potter?\\" True, these books take place in a magical world with wizards and spells, but they do not revolve around satan or demons etc etc. There is a certain part of one of the books of the series- an astrology teacher.I, being a strong christian child, disagree with astrology. But, for the most part of the book, her \\"tea-cup predictions\\" and \\"futures told\\" are regarded and hogwash. Except for a one serious prediction, which the student didn't ask for. But she is still considered full of balogni by the author/book/reader.Just in real life-there IS evil out there, and you may find it even when not looking.The spells used in the books are to benefit the students in Hogwarts (the wizarding school Harry attends), and defenses against the \\"Dark Lord\\" Voldemort's powerful spells. Which is like christianity, we have to learn to defend and protect ourselves from Satan.These books are very good, and if you read them, you should understand. Some reviews and newspaper/magazine articles only tell parents about the negative things-and not how truly great these books are. I am 12 years old, not quite your normal child. As I hope you may have noticed, I am quite literate. And although I am young, I think I know much more about these books than some adults do, and can read pretty deeply into them.Please read these books before banning them from your child. Oh, and unless you have read the books, the movie trailors won't help. They put on a quite \\"serious\\" effect, and don't show the comedy relief/fun parts of the book. I hope I don't sound too grouchy! Just trying to get my point across with my positive pount on these books! They are the best I've read!!!! Good-day :)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"&quot;The Lion The Witch And The Wardrobe&quot; , &quot;The Faraway Tree&quot; and books by the amazing Ronald Dalh were the stories that enriched my childhood. But now years on i feel like i'm a child again. I've just read my first Harry Potter book. Comparisons with other classics are reasonable and the media hype is warranted. J.K. Rowling's series is truly wonderfull.The Sorcerer's Stone is perfect for young readers. The language is suitably readable, but more important are the fun cast of characters and exciting plot. This tale is so well crafted and engaging that parents will find themselves sneaking a read after the children have gone to bed. They have even published a special edition featuring an adults cover so adults can read this &quot;kids&quot; book without embaressment .I'm hooked!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J. K. Rowling definitely belongs in the pantheon of children's book writers that can create a complete world for developing imaginations to explore and simultaneously pique an adult's interest. As a CHRONICLES OF NARNIA adorer, I have no hesitation saying her name in the same breath as C. S. Lewis. The other night I tried to read Madeline L'Engle's classic, A WRINKLE IN TIME, for further comparison (it had been over 20 years since I read it for the first time); while enjoyable, it just didn't whisk me away like HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE.Harry Potter is an orphaned child of magical parents raised in a hateful and merciless environment. Admission to the Hogwarts School is both his birthright and saving grace. His shy but brave friend Ron, overshadowed by famous brothers, and their dying-to-know-it-all classmate Hermione help Harry negotiate a magical boarding school with its bullies, dark passageways, and nitpicky teachers. We've all read stories of witches and wizards before, but Rowling is that one author in a generation who breathes new life into our archetypes.I held off reading the first Harry Potter book until my wife borrowed it from a friend of ours recently. While I'm not racing out to buy the other three, I certainly will pick them up in paperback as they become available.This is one that lives up to the hype admirably folks--anything that's popular inevitably will have its detractors, but people should remember this is a children's book, and children are in many ways smarter than adults. It is also a work of art, and for the number of children Rowling has gotten excited about reading she probably deserves a Nobel Prize. Now if those kids would only grow up to read Cervantes and Shakespeare, something far more magical than Harry Potter's wand will have done fine work. Cheers, Harry!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am not a general reader of scifi or fantasy, but because of the hubbub concerning book four being released to the unsuspecting public recently, I decided to give book 1 a try.I loved it! JK Rowling writes for everyone. This isn't just a teen book or a kids book, or even really a fantasy book. What it is, is a well written marvelously told tale of Harry and his adventures. the plots are written nice and clean, the story wraps up properly, and the characters are brought to life and seemed REAL.i was so entranced with this book, i was furious when my fiance told me to put the lights out when I was halfway through the last chapter. Needless to say, i finished the book first thing this morning and gave it to his 14 yo brother (who isn't a reader) to read. He's so engrossed into it, i've ordered books two and three so that we can get through them just as quickly.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who isn't into fantasy or scifi and judging by my fiance's brother reaction, to anyone who isn't a reader. This defiently brings out the magic in us all."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After hearing all the hoopla, I decided to read Harry Potter myself. It is a truly, wonderful awe inspiring book, one of those that I think will be around for a long time. Hopefully it will soon be required reading. Harry Potter is an admirable and interesting main character. The story has elements of classic well-loved movies and novels, and many important themes, like not to give up when obstacles come your way, or the fact that there's always going to be mean, nasty and/or annoying people wherever you go, but you can learn to live with that. As for people who think the book is Satanic--I have three things to tell them. 1. The book is a work of fiction--fiction is a story that's NOT REAL. 2. It's in the fantasy genre--fantasy is a genre of fiction that deals with magical or supernatural elements. 3. There's no mention of Satan worship or the Bible being bad anywhere in the book. (It actually promotes what could be termed 'good Christian morals') I think people who pronounce the book Satanic or whatever are overreacting and haven't read the book.Who ever thought in this age of the internet and 100 plus TV channels that kids would read a 300 plus page book and actually enjoy it? Not only that, their parents would read it and enjoy it too! I can remember being in the 9-12 age bracket and never in a million years could I imagine myself reading a book as long as &quot;Harry Potter&quot;--and I was voted the most avid reader in my school! Obviously, today's kids are a lot smarter than we give them credit for, and this book is a testament to that."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Durrie Schuette Colorado USA.........Great...........Magical..............Fun!

She is writing seven of these books, so far I have read the four she has released. These books get better and better as you go on.

Knowing that they would fly off the shelves if I didn't grab a copy (I had heard about the book on the news that evening), I bought a copy. Not only that, but I bought a copy of each of them (I'm one of those people who, in the heat of the moment, believes that if I don't get one now, I'll never be able to!)I decided I would give them to my 8 year old niece for Christmas. Now, I heard the stories about how &quot;evil&quot; the books were supposed to be, so I decided to read the first one - just to see. I was HOOKED.I read all the books the week I bought them. I gave my niece a card and $20.00 for Christmas.Sure, these books may be the epitome of mass market publication. And you might get sick of seeing Harry Potter everywhere. But when it comes down to it, the books are good. Ignore the trinkets, the bookends, posters, glasses, stuffed animals and all the hype.

I usually prefer hardcore science fiction or murder mysteries, but Ms. Rowling's tale has made it in to my list of favorite reads.What a wonderful way to start a career in writing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The basic story of &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; is simple enough: young orphan Harry Potter, nearly eleven years old, lives with his unpleasant relatives, the Dursleys. But when his birthday arrives he discovers that he has a magical heritage, and the rest of the novel describes his marvelous adventures at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.Simple enough. But the execution is an absolute delight, and author J.K. Rowling has created a genuine international cultural phenomenon. I believe that the secret to Rowling's smashing success might be broken down into a sort of mathematical equation: (Tolkien + Dickens) x Cleary = Rowling.In other words, she has created a truly magical, yet consistent alternate world (as did J.R.R. Tolkien in his &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; saga), added to that by a propensity to people that world with memorable characters who have a rich assortment of defining quirks (as did Charles Dickens in his many great novels), and multiplied it all by a skill at depicting young people who are realistic and who engage the reader's emotions (as did Beverly Cleary in her novels about Henry Huggins and other characters).I read this book mainly out of curiosity over the endless media hype. And when I did, I discovered a fantastic new world to which I immediately wanted to return, and a cast of individuals to whom I felt immediately connected. And on top of that, I found my vocabulary enriched by an assortment of new words: Quidditch, Muggles, Diagon Alley, Golden Snitch, etc. &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; lives up to--and surpasses--the hype. So whether you ignore or enjoy the media frenzy, read the actual book. You just might get hooked."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a magnificent tale that lives up to its hype ten fold. J.K. Rowling's world within a world, where witches and warlocks (as well as many more so called mythological creatures) live secretly amongst humans (or Muggles) is great fantastic reading for child and adult alike. Granted this is geared toward children no younger than nine years old, it shouldn't be too scary or thematic for any child if read to by a charismatic parent(especially one who does voices!). Whether it be letters delivered via owl, an invisibility cloak, or the ever present promise of adventure Harry Potter is a wild, exciting ride into juvenille literature that has started an explosion of children desiring to read. And this is definitely a well written story to encourage a child to read. Harry Potter is fast becoming a literary icon and with good reason; the character is so likeable that anyone reading of his exploits can't help but cringe when he's in danger and smile with the very notion that somwhere a Hogwarts exists and that within its walls resides an eager pupil by the name of Harry Potter!

My mom first had to almost force me to buy it, but now I'm the one that makes my mom buy Harry Potter. This book is increduble.My brother commented that the sun would be rising from the west when he saw me reading the book for the 5th time in one week. I'm not sure why I like this book so much, except for the reason it's so fun to read.Maybe J.K.Rowling went to Hogwarts herself and put a spell over her book so that the people who read it will have their noses stuck in the book and would have to do everything with one hand(Like what Ron said in book 2,when Harry found the diary)! To the people that haven't read it, buy it, or borrow it, as soon as you can. J.K.Rowling has a true gift for making up storys and words.

I did not give this 5 stars because I've heard the Audio Books by Stephen Fry (not sure if the spelling is right ;-P ). I have to say, in my humble opinion, Fry's voice is more grown up as a narrator and his character voices are excellent. His voice sounds over all more respectfull and apropiate. Jim Dale has done his version for the american audience which doesn't mean it's bad, but I like things in their original state.

I couldn't put them down and thoroughly enjoyed them! I let others have their own opinions but I really love the series.Here we are now, waiting for the seventh book to be released, and I have become permanently disabled, which makes it so hard to hold a book for long periods of time, even these intoxicating and addictive books but I couldn't put them down no matter how badly my hands hurt! So what's a person supposed to do who can't hold a book but wants to know what's going on in the Harry Potter universe? Enter Jim Dale bringing an unabridged telling of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone using his multi-talented narration and incredible vocal range to bring Harry Potter, Hermione, Ron, Hagrid, Albus Dumbledore and the rest to life with each one of them having their own voice different from the others. It is so wonderful to be able to put a high quality CD in and just get lost in the world of magic found in the Harry Potter Universe. I loved the narration so much that I finished this first audio book in two or three days so I quickly ordered another one in the series!Quickly you begin to be able to tell Ron's voice apart from Harry's and so on. Hermione's voice is a hoot because Mr. Dale always has her draw out Harry's name to sound like, \\"Harreee.\\" It is interesting to note in this first book that \\"Voldemort\\" is actually pronounced \\"Voldemorre\\" but I think that has to do with the way the English \\"speak English.\\" However, I just received and am listening to \\"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince\\" and Jim Dale is very clearly saying \\"Voldemort\\" now. It may be because of the movies, fans, the publishing house or author but for whatever reason, it sounds more natural to me and how I would have pronounced it myself.I recommend this audio book to you highly as you rediscover the magic of the book that started it all while you lay down to rest, do dishes, go for a drive or a jog, head for work or whatever else you may do where you can concentrate on the fantastic story telling. And if you miss something or find yourself wanting to dive back into the world of Harry Potter, you can always rewind or start again! The price is great and the product is awesome.

Ms. Rowlings did an excellent job in writing a very interesting story. The characters are well developed and the story line has a lot of great twists and turns. I would recommend this book, or any of the Harry Potter stories to anyone in desparate need of a good laugh!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved reading Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone because of all the drama and suspense. Also, it gives kids a chance to see a story from a wizard's point of view.Harry at first doesn't even know that he's a wizard, a very famous one at that. Hagrid, the keeper of keys at Hogwarts, comes and gets Harry and takes him to Gringotts to get some of his money, get supplies for school like robes and such, and then Harry is off to Hogwarts on the train on Platform Nine and Three Quarters.Even though what happens in the book could never happen in the real world, it's fun to pretend.

I recommend this book to kids with BIG imaginations!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After all this time I've finally started to read the Harry Potter series. I had planned on avoiding it still, but I figure anyone who makes a study of popular culture, the Potter series is a must. It surprised me by turning out to be quite good. I wouldn't have expected it to create the mania it did, but still I found it to be a well-written and entertaining book. Not at all offensive. And a little simplistic at times."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a book about an 11 year old wizard named Harry. The only thing is Harry doesn't know he is a wizard until the Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Hagrid, tells Harry that he was accepted into Hogwarts. While at Hogwarts, Harry discovers that the Sorcerer's Stone is being kept there and someone is after it. Harry and his two friends, Ron and Hermione, must work together to try to stop who ever is after the Stone. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a book full of magic and fantasy. It is the kind of book that can keep you on the edge of your seat and you never want it to end."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone was a great book to start off the rest of the series. I enjoyed the characters in this book. I think that this book had the best story line to it in comparison to the other books in the series. This book grabbed my attention and kept me interested the whole time. This book was good enough to make me want to experience the other books in the series. I like the kinds of books that have magical and mystical things in it and thats why I would highly reccomend it to other kids or even people of all ages who are interested in this type of stuff.

When a boy named Harry Potter thought he was normal, he was not. He was a wizard. But as he learns about his mysterious past, he finds one evil wizard is trying to kill him."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fantasy book by J.K. Rowling. It shows you magic and spells. The protagonist is Harry, and he has two friends to help him on his adventure. They are Hermione and Ron. They try to help their school and they succeed. Harry is always in trouble, Ron always afraid, and Hermione is a teacher's pet. Harry and his friends are trying to save the school by finding the Sorcerer's Stone because someone is trying to take it and use it for bad magic.What I liked about the book is that it had a lot of excitement. It was interesting when Harry and Ron were playing wizard chess, and they had to tell the pieces where to go. I thought it was cool when the queen stood up and hit the other chess piece. I also liked when Ron tried a magic trick on his rat and it just made a noise. It was interesting when Harry ran right through the wall so he could get on the train to go to school. It was suspicious when Snape was always there when Harry, Ron, and Hermione were always trying to figure out the mystery. However, I didn't like when Ron didn't die playing the big version of wizard chess. The chess players were so brutal to the people it would have made more sense if he had been killed. There were a lot of Weasley family members and it would be interesting to see how they would have reacted to Ron's death. This is a wonderful fantasy book that can take you to another place that is magical."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book has a bunch of things that are going on.

Can't wait to ready the next one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an exciting and suspensful book. It follows the journeys of a young boy, Harry Potter, and his career of magic. As a young baby, Harry proved to be invulnerable to the evil sorcerer Voldemort's spells, though his wizard parents were killed. Voldemort was driven away. This encounter with evil magic left him with a strange lightening- bolt shaped scar on his forehead. A wizard named Albus Dumbledore, a witch named Minerva McGonogall, and the huge groundskeeper Hagrid decided to leave him to be raised by his aunt and uncle, the snobby Dursleys. Harry is forced to live in a closet and be tortured by his cousin, Dudley Dursley. But one day, a letter comes to Harry inviting him to be a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy, brought by friendly Hagrid and an owl. When he boards the train to Hogwarts with his wand and his owl securly with him, he meets characters like clumsy Neville, poor Ron, evil Malfoy, and talented Hermione. At Hogwarts, he is accepted into Gryffindor House, and begins his life of magic. When you read this book you find about interesting things such as the arial sport Quiddich, Fluffy the three-headed dog, a dragon baby, and even the mysterious Sorcerer's Stone. Why is someone trying to steal it? Could it be Voldemort come back? Pull up a chair, pick up your wand, and find out!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"this is definitely my favorite book. J.K.

While the author plays mainly to her youthful audience there is material here that only older folk will appreciate. In addition to the mystery there is humor, the author even takes a good-natured swat at her own kind(writers). Perhaps best of all, the author is able to accent the personal values of her hero with out having the book turn into a morality play. Suggestion: DO NOT begin reading the last few chapters of one of these books if it is anywhere near your bedtime. You will be up until you've finished the book.

I originally went into reading the book, thinking that I wouldn't like it because I don't like science fiction books and I thought it would be too childish for me.Although the book was a bit too easy to read, everything flowed together and somehow contributed to the ending of the book.

There were a lot of parts where you didn't know what was going to happen. I think people from the ages 7 until the oldest you can get, should read this book. People who like mysteries, action, and children will enjoy this book.

It combines urban life with life in the fantastical land of wizards and witches. The book continues to climb in masterpiece as the story progresses. Harry and his friends are lovable; the unlovable characters are VERY unlovable. This book is beautiful! Congratulations to Rowling on this first book!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I agree with anyone else that says that Harry Potter is a great book (the BEST!) But I just read two reviews that almost made me cry. First, the one that said that JK Rowling is making it O.K. to &quot;ridicule fat people.&quot; YEAH RIGHT! When Hagrid turns Dudley into a pig and only comes up with a pig's tail, it's because of Dudley's personality, not his weight. And that same review said that... &quot;...one girl is disliked because of her tendency to follow rules. When she breaks rules and lies like the rest of them, she is accepted.&quot; Well, Harry and Rom TRY to follow the rules, and Hermione only breaks a rule in a time of great despair. GET A LIFE! Imagine what the book would have been like if they'd never broken a rule or told a lie. Hermione would be dead, killed by the troll. Voldemort would have taken over again. Ginny Weasly would be dead. Hagrid would be in Azkaban. Sirius Black, an innocent man, would have had his soul sucked out of him, and a guilty man would be free. Along the &quot;fat&quot; line, another villan is as skinny as a stick, so there.... The other review referred to these books as &quot;glorified horror stories, and each one gets worse and worse...&quot; AGain, get a life. These books are wonderfully humerous. They are not GOOSEBUMPS. THey have good and bad things happen, like in real life. But anyway... I love these books!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter books are amazing!! They get you sucked into their world the instant you sit down to read them.

Then, Harry Potter entered my world and unleashed the magic within me. I will be forever grateful to J.K. Rowling for giving birth to Harry. He and his friends at Hogwarts and the horrible horrible Dursley's ( a very Muggle reminder of reality) have become a part of my existence.

You've inspired me."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Remember the days before life became a routine of waking every morning, heading to work only to come home to the same place you left? Remember when weekends were not simply a time to clean the things you left laying around during the week? Think back to when a day-dream was part of your reality? Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone can take you back to the days when you used your imagination--the days that you found the time to create a world of your own. Entering the world of Harry Potter, his friends, and his enemies will help you remember or once again create the places you need to escape to each and every day in your own world. By avoiding this book, you once again accept the stress pain in your neck, the throb in your back and the lathargic awakening to another tedious realistic day. Take the time to capture a breath of fresh air with Harry Potter as you sour on a broomstick in a wizard's version of soccer, football, hockey and capture the flag all tied into one. Creep down the tight cool gray hallways with Harry and his friends as they avoid ghosts and search behind closed doors.

Once Harry arrived at Hogwarts, I was spellbound with the book and all of its characters, especially Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. It had a good plot and small details you'd never think to pay attention to came into play later on in the book. Harry's encounters with Lord voldermort, the idea of the game Quidditch, and the nasty Draco Malfoy instantly got me hooked on these books. Harry Potter's adventures are real, true adventures with a hero and a real evil villain, not the cheesey over advertised adventures of movies and cartoons."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' was simply a magical book. It presents a fascinating concept about there being two kinds of people in the world while at the same time, it's a fictional story about a young boy enjoying a different kind of life. He's surrounded by incredible creatures and many different kinds of fun such as Quidditch matches as well as his mischeivious enjoyment in things such as wandering around with his Invisible cloak. This is an amazing story, a must-read for children and adults!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This was an awesome book... if you like fantasy books, with magic in them, then this would be a book that you would like. It tells a story of a young boy, Harry Potter, who's parents were killed by a dark wizard when he is still VERY young. He has to go to his Aunt Petunia's house, but she is a muggle (non-magic folk) and she hates everything to do with magic. When Harry turns twelve, he starts to receive letters. He never gets mail, so he doesn't know what is going on. He finally gets his hands on one that his Uncle Vernon hasn't managed to burn. It says, \\"Mr. Harry Potter, we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\\" Harry goes to Hogwarts and starts his first year as a wizard. Towards the end of the year, danger will await him. The Dark Lord, Voldemort (or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named), waits for him. Will Harry defeat him, or will Voldemort succeed? To answer this question, you will have to read this great book. You will get caught up in the story and you won't be able to put it down.

I recommend this book to all fantasy book lovers!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter series has now become a world wide wonder. This is the first book in a fabulous series that continual gets better and better. The movies are good, but the books are better. The movies have a difficult time capturing the full plot of the books. Most readers who are just picking this book up now, will probably know the main story. But the books are the best for they contain details the movies don't show. They don't really tell you much about why any of this is even happening. But the good news for you is the books do. The books are wonderful.As most of you probably know, the first book is about a 10 year old boy named Harry. He lives with his Aunt and Uncle and his Cousin, Dudley. They are his only living relatives. The family who took him in, hate him, just as much as he hates them. The only thing they told Harry about his past was the fact that his parents died in a car crash. But the second Harry turns 11, his world is shaken upside down, when a mysterious man named Hagrid, comes and tells him the truth (or what he knows of it) about his past.Harry is sent to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy, where he finds many magical things, challenges, friends, and of course, everyone's favorite - danger. Though the movie's do ruin the wonderful climax, this series is the best and this book is what started it all.If you like this book I recommend that read:Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (book 2)Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (book3)Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (book 4)Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (book 5)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (book 6)Who knows what secrets and dangers lie in the next book to come?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The harry potter book the Scorer's stone written by J.K Rowling is a great book.It is a exciting book,harry,ron and hermine fight a huge troll and they do a lot of magic and if you think one thing is going to happen the opisit is going to happened, it keeps you on your heels though the whole story.It is even better than the new one.

Rowling's modern classic need to take these tales of witchcraft with a grain of salt. The idea is not a new one; the book \\"The Worst Witch\\", which became a popular TV series, has covered this topic as well.But in a writing style that is more than highly reminiscent of another British children's author, Roald Dahl of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" fame, Rowling has shared with fans of all ages a fantastic and well-structured world in which the characters face extremes of good and evil. The scenarios covered in these tales are dark, bright, spirited, poignant, and funny at various turns, as are the characters themselves.At the heart of it all is the book's boy hero, Harry James Potter, orphaned during his first year of life when the evil wizard Lord Voldemort murdered his parents and, while failing to kill young Harry as well, left the infant with a jagged scar on his forehead that causes him pain at critical moments in his life for many years afterwards.The ever wise headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Albus Dumbledore, along with Professor Minerva McGonnagall, and the hirsute giant Rubeus Hagrid, deposit the infant with his only remaining family, the Dursleys, and for the next decade, the young Harry suffers abuse and neglect at the hands of his dead mother's sister, Petunia, her husband Vernon, and their spoiled and menacing son, Dudley.An owl with a message provides the first sign that Harry's fortunes are about to change. Despite the Dursley's decade-long efforts to break Harry out of some mysterious habits and goings-on that often surround him, Harry finally learns the truth about his background during a surprise encounter with Hagrid.Soon the boy-wizard-to-be is whisked away to the Scottish castle that is Hogwarts to begin a life previously unknown to him.Realistically, he learns that life is not completely free of torment from his peers since leaving the Dursleys when he encounters the stuck-up Draco Malfoy and cohorts.But he also encounters the red-haired and hysterical Ron Weasley, who like Malfoy is from an old wizarding family but from a different end of the spectrum, who can prove himself to be a noble friend in the thick of a major crisis, and the Muggle born intellectual, Hermione Granger, patterned after J.K. Rowling herself.Slowly, we watch these three develop a complex friendship and evolve into Hogwart's trouble-shooting trio amid an array of broken school rules, encounters with dangerous magical beasts, and the occasional backfiring of magic spells, finally reaching the climax in which Harry must help break the power of the Sorcerer's Stone, in his first encounter with the Dark Lord since his infancy.Interestingly, magic and witchcraft do not solve all the characters' problems. Most deaths in the stories are not reversed, the lively Weasley Family is not made any richer, nor does magic reduce Harry's need for glasses or the pain of his scar.But they provide Harry with the chance to do things he never imagined, such as the chance to play wizard sports, the joy and freedom of flight, a chance to confront his yearning for his dead parents, and world of companionship, and the wisdom and kindness of mentors.Readers can delight in watching the tremulous lad prove his mettle and courage when confronting unexpected hazards of the wizard world, and maintain his natural kindness and humility while dealing with the acclaim he never knew in the Muggle world.We watch with admiration and amusement as his relationships with his peers and teachers develop,his constant struggles with his parents' killer, and along the way, wediscover why it's so difficult for Hogwarts to maintain a Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher for very long.The characters are relatably modern in some ways, and old-fashioned in others, and the story is written with brilliant plot twists and clever resolutions.And so, I conclude my editorial toast to one of the most famous characters of modern literature, and the friends who help him along the way. I give every star available to the beginning of a great literary series, which in turn, has spawned an equally terrific film series, both of which will undoubtedly be enjoyed for many years to come!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm one of those people who has been meaning to read the Harry Potter series forever, but has never got around to it. Well, yesterday I borrowed the first instalment from the library and gave it a go. I was really, really impressed by how thrilling and funny Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Philosopher's Stone in the UK) is. There isn't a slow or dull moment throughout the whole book and I would recommend that everybody reads it - old or young - because it is simply a very special, delightful novel.The characters are all unique and intriguing. Previously I have been completely confused when Harry Potter fans go on about \`Hagrid this...' or \`Dumbledore that...', but now I can see why people get so into it, as each of the characters come alive. Loads of other reviewers have mentioned the plot, but basically Harry Potter is orphaned as a baby and taken to live with his nasty Aunt and Uncle and their horrible son Dudley. His new family do not tell him that his mum and dad were a great witch and wizard couple who were killed by the evil Voldemort. Harry is mistreated by his new family, but when he turns 11 he gets a letter informing him that he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft where he makes new friends and enemies and has to face an old rival.The language that Joanne Rowling uses is really imaginative. She'll describe a character or a situation and sum it up in just a couple of witty sentences. For example, when Harry is introduced to Diagon Alley, where he can buy school supplies, Rowling writes: \`Harry wished he had about eight more eyes'. Perfect! And there are lots of other snappy, wonderful sentences like this throughout the book. Harry's new friends, Ron and Hermione, are particularly well written and easy to relate to. Ron is the typical hand-me-down kid with wonderful parents while Hermione is somewhat of a perfectionist whose bossiness hides her insecurities. Hagrid, the keeper of the keys at Hogwarts, is also a particular favourite of mine because he is so kind and amusing.I think one of the reasons why the book is so good is because there are all different types of characters, good and evil. It isn't a children's book where everybody is nice and friendly. It is like the real world, where some people are lovely (but still have their bad points), other people are in the middle, and some people are downright horrible! I think this is why Joanne Rowling and Roald Dahl are often compared, because they both write about nasty, horrific characters as well as good ones and do it in a way that both adults and children can relate to.I'm looking forward to reading the other books in the series and getting to know Harry and Co much better. I would especially encourage people who have never read any kind of fantasy books before (as I haven't) to give it a go because it will surprise and entertain you.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I never gave into the Harry Potter hype. I always believed that Harry Potter was a kid's series for kids.I am one year graduate students working on my masters in English. I took a class that discuss heroes, and we had several papers topics. One of them said to talk about Harry Potter and how he has heroic qualities.So, I decided to read the series to help me develop my paper. Boy, when I started reading the first one, I continued to read the second one right away, and I am 1/3 of the way through the third one.Harry Potter isn't just about a lost boy who appears on a aunt's and uncle's doorstep when his parents are killed. Harry Potter is a story about a boy who begins on his destiny---his journey through heroic origins and has to fulfill a powerful fate that leaves readers' breaths with awe...also anticipating how the next book with tie into the previous book.Harry Potter is one year old baby who defeats the evil Lord Voldemort after he murders the young Potter's parents. Hagril, Dumbledore, and Professor McGongall decide to leave Harry with his uncle and aunt...who are by the far the most evil relatives in literature. For eleven years, they treat Harry like foreign object. Harry experiences no love, no caring, no remorse, and no acceptance from these horrid people. They see Harry as disease because his aunt's sister and her husband were weirdos that practice magic.Yet, Harry gets to break out of his cruel and tormented home when letters after letters come from Howgarts: The School of Magic and Ministrey. It is time to Harry to go off on his journey and see if he is able to fulfill his destiny as a wizard. Hagrid rescues Harry from his vicisious aunt and uncle to take his to the magical world to buy his school supplies for his first time at Hogwarts.Harry is amazed at this new world he encounters. Feeling out of place and unloved, Harry feels a sense of belonging to this new place he's not been apart of for eleven years. The next days, as Harry leaves on Platform 9 1/2, he meets the Weasleys, who are this cool family...all with red hair. He becomes best friends with Ron when they ride to Hogwarts together.As Harry learns about his magical roots, he learns about his abilities and how he conquered Lord Voldemort. Harry proves that his his the abilities to do good, but he has to refine those abilities to skills to become the ultimate wizard to defeat Lord Voldemort.On his journey, Harry shows those heroics characterisitcs that most of us admire and respect. He is humble, friendly, courageous, and knows where he stands with good and evil. He risks his life for others and proves that just because he is famous in the magical world doesn't mean he can take advantage of his fame.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a lovely book. Rowling has produce another mythological creation with flying brooms, an academy with lessons on magic and sorcerecy, and with issues that our society can relate to in the wizard society. She shows through her knowledge of world literature and mythology how we can take what is already existience and make something quite unique and original."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry PotterBy KirbyI read the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling. This story is about Harry Potter going to Hogwarts and finding out someone has stole the sorcerer's stone, so Harry goes with his friend's Hermione and Ron to find out who did it. Harry Potter is an unlikely hero because he saves a very powerful stone that could destroy anything. I think the message in my book is anyone is a hero, even if you are only eleven in Harry's case. Oh, and did I mention that he saved his entire school. If I could trade place's with one characters, it would be Harry Potter because, if I were eleven and defeated Lord Voldermort, that would be amazing. The sorcerer's stone represents power because that is what is causing the entire mystery in this book. J.K. Rowling is amazing! She just make's everything exciting that is why I love her so much. She is the number one writer. Before I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I thought that a hero was like superman, but now that I have read the book, my schema has changed, and now I know that anyone is a hero, because even though Ron wasn't a great wizard, he was great at chess, and Hermione was awesome at witchcraft, and Harry is pretty much good at everything. I recommend this book for girls and boys because you would think it's all about Harry and Ron, but Hermione is a big part of the story too. I will give this book a five star rating because it has everything. I think this book is great."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"We enjoyed the book very much. Our teacher read the entire book to our entire class everyday. You could hear a pin drop in class while she was reading it to us. At the end we had A Harry Potter Day where we dressed up as our favorite character . We had different stations where we explained the parts of the book to our guests. My favorite part of the book was the man with the two faces...We also liked the mirror of Erised..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is the greatest! The only book that I have read better than it is the sequel. I can't wait for the third one to come out. I like how J. K. Rowling researched the three headed dog from ancient Greek mythology. This book has great charactors."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is the best book I've ever read!I feel like Harry, Ron, and Hermoine are my good friends.Harry and his friends go to a magical (and truly magic) school, called Hogwarts, where they play a really cool game called Quidditch. It is very well written and makes strange happenings really come to life. If you are thinking about buying this book-go ahead- you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said by everyone else? This is the sort of book I would probably have loved when I was a kid. Now that I'm an adult, I still loved it. To me, that's the hallmark of a great children's book: one that doesn't talk down to its audience, one that can be read and enjoyed by readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When one of my friends introduced this to me, I couldn't believe that such a mature reader as she would read such a book. but since she insisted I read it, I did. Once I started, I couldn't believe how gripping to book was!! I just couldn't help going to the next page to see what happens. As you go through the book, it is as if you also are in that world, and, perhaps, that this world could be real. The fanciful and very different characters are portrayed so well by J.K. Rowling!! As a Roald Dahl fan, I fell in love with this book instantly. I urge EVERYONE to read it!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The best book I have read in a long time, and when I found out there was sequel, I wanted that one too. When my sister is 10 too, I will read it to her and I am sure she will absulutely love it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry potter is the best book in the world. My Primary teacher read it to my class in Primary 7 and I think my whole class loved it. I keep reading it over and over again because I love it so much. Also when I was in P7 J.K.Rowling came to my School to see another class but she had enough time left to come see my class and she was really nice and she told us all about her next book that's out at the moment and she told us there would be 7 Harry Potter books altogether. I can't wait for the next book and I just hope it's as good as both her other books! My favourite part was when Harry, Ron and Hermione were looking for the stone. I hope everyone else liked it as much as I did and if I could I would give it a Thousand stars but it only goes up to 5!

I just ordered the 2nd and 3rd!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Okay, so I'm not in the age group that these books are targeted to, but as a teacher, I thought I'd better pick up the book that so many students were talking about. This book was truly one of the most interesting and funny books that I've ever read. As Harry goes through his daily life, the reader becomes involved to the point where one does not want to put the book down. It is thrilling and will keep you reading until the very end."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Unlike most, I did not feel Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was 'the best book I'd ever read' or even close. It was, however, temporarily amusing and enjoyable.THE GOOD PARTS: Harry is a moderately appealing hero, and the plot is clever, if not exceptional, and moves along quickly. Touches of creativity enliven the pages, particularly in the descriptions of Quidditch. THE NOT-SO-GOOD-PARTS: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was quite derivative, and felt familiar when I was reading it for the first time. Kind of a mixture of Roald Dahl's Matilda, Diana Wynne Jones' Witch Week, and Eva Ibbotson's Which Witch and The Secret of Platform 13. Nor are the characters done particularly well. Harry and his friends, while entertaining, remain 2D stereotypes throughout the book.J. K. Rowling has clearly succeeded in imitating a style that has been successful before, but she fails to create something completely new and creative. Nevertheless, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a light and genuinely fun read even to hard core fantasy addicts."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"These 3 books were GREAT!

I've read worse (hence the three stars), and the plot does move, but it lacks the magic of real children's classics. Read C.S.Lewis, Dahl, Tolkien, Baum."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This was a very delightful book even for an adult. It caught my interest right away and once I started it I had to hurry and finish it. However, I do have one issue that struck me and I must say I was not very pleased. Being basically a &quot;children's&quot; book, she used the word &quot;damn&quot;. Now, I know that it was NOT necessary to have this type of language in this book. If I were to let a child that I know read it, I would have to scratch through that word or any of those type of words she may use in future books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I feel sorry for those who couldn't enjoy the Harry Potter books becuase they were concerned about &quot;fat people&quot; and &quot;rule breaking.&quot; Mabye they forgot that Harry, Neville, and Herimonie were punished for their night time wandering,(their rule breaking) and were looked down apon by their peers for it. I have read both books multiple times and still can't put it down. I commend J.K.Rawling and can't wait for more books. The characters that she invented are marvalous. The Weasley twins are hilarious, Professor Dumbledor is absolutley noble, Hagrid is loud and laughable and Professor McGonagall is serious yet kind. I also would like to congratulate the illistrator for her wonderous portayals of characters and events."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm fourteen, and I don't care what people say about this book. I don't care if it's too simple, or too predictable, or if the characters don't develop in the story, or whatever. The important thing is that it's an exciting, entertaining, fun-to-read-book that makes the reader feel like a part of the story. A friend from Luxemburg introduced me to Harry Potter, and I was hooked. For weeks after I've read it, I was in a dreamworld, thinking about what it would be like to receive that letter, to go to Hogwarts and to meet all the characters. I have to say that I don't actually believe in a school for witches and wizards, but all the same it was a wonderful and well-written book. I'm not missing the third one!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I found Harry Potter and the Sorceror's stone one day hile strolling through the book store. Like many other reviewers, I am well above the age guidlines set in this book. I am a 22 year old college graduate with an English degree. I have had the opportunity to read some of the greatest literature from Dickens to Mark Twain to Roald Dahl to even the so called &quot;evil children fantasy writer&quot; Phillip Pullman (great author by the way!). When I first read this book, I did read it with a bit skepticism. The hype didn't seem real. I am happy to say I was pleasantly suprised. This is a great book! Rowlings has created a fantasy world that will easily live in the hearts of millions for generations. The characters are original, courageous, and just plain believable! I found myself craving for more of her works, and bought the sequel on the first day! To those who claim that Rowlings has created an occult world of witchcraft and wizardry...stop looking for the evil in everything...because you will find it in almost every book ever published...including the classics! Harry Potter besides the wizardry has a story about friendship, loyalty, love and courage...wonderful qualities to be passed on to the next generation. Ms. Rowlings, keep writing these wonderful books. I can't wait to own all seven of them (though I will probably be buying them for my children at that time rather than just for myself :) ). In the meantime, I think I will reread the first two!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Although I realize that due to the overwhelming volume of review responses there is little chance my offering will be read, I enjoyed the book too much to be able to resist. It is an absolutely marvelous story, the best new book since who-knows-when and easily topping even the works of &quot;adult&quot; literature with which it shares the best-seller list.It is a geography of the imagination, which will remain long after the ephemeral chronicles of the time have withered and blown away. Having a classic structure and classic protagonist doesn't do it any harm, either.Harry Potter is a more-or-less archetypal sort of hero. Parents mysteriously killed, raised in menial domestic situation by aunt and uncle, possesing a strange mark and even stranger powers- that type of the hero can be picked up everywhere from early fairy tales and legends to &quot;Star Wars&quot;. And the story's plot- the education of the remarkable young man- is equally precedented.But the wonders J.K. Rowling works with her classic form! Her story is a perfect blend of theme, plot, and character, action, humor, drama, deeper meaning, and sheer imaginative revelry. She has combined her ingredients, and said the magic words, and has caught the reading world in the resulting enchantment."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought the fist harry potter book was great!

The buzz has been tickling my ears for a long time. I gave in. I went and saw the movie \\"Harry Potter and the Scorcerer's Stone\\".. Okay..I have seen the movie and then read the book.....And I must say..the movie IS better than the book, but ONLY because of it's marvelous visual display..you'll love it. I read the book following my thrill at the movie and fell in love with the story once more. Harry Potter...an ordinary boy about to live an extraordinary life. Imagine being orphaned to your dreadful aunt and uncle who care nothing for you and tell you nothing about yourself. Harry Potter was told his parents were killed in a car crash and since has lived a most dreadful life in the cupboard under the stairs in the house of the Dursley's: his Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and their obnoxious son, Dudley. Harry's life, well, it[...]to put it plainly. They treat him like a servent...Until one fine day........Letters start arriving. Hundreds. They are flooding in the Dursley home. Harry, however is forbidden to read one even though they are addressed to \\"Mr. H.Potter, The Cupboard Under The Stairs\\". On Harry's Eleventh Birthday he is finally greeted by a giant named Hagrid who is appalled that the Dursley's never explained Harry's letters or his past to him...Harry Potter is a WIZARD! His parents who died trying to save him from an evil wizard were famous and so is Harry because he survived! Hagrid tells Harry he is from \\"Hogwarts\\" a fine school of witchcraft and wizardry and that Harry is invited to join, just like his parents before him. What happens next once Harry finds his place at school is a jumble of schoolwork, magic, mystery, scary secrets and some unyeilding professors. If you want to know about Quidditch, Peeves, and the Fat lady...you'll have to immerse yourself into Harry Potter's world..it does not dissapoint. It's an easy read for young adults and yes many adults have found it charming as well. What can I say?

One of my friends read one this summer and loved it, however I still didn't think that I would be interested. When I read the first chapter of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, half out of curiosity, I absolutely loved it. Throughout the entire book I felt myself getting mad at the &quot;bad&quot; characters when they did something that made Harry get into trouble. Also, every time in the book that Harry was about to get into trouble or was scared that something bad was going to happen, I felt the same emotions. The book was in a wonderfully creative setting that not only appealed to small children, but people my age also. It's nice to think that Harry Potter went to a place that in a sense swept all of his problems away. Granted, it was still life and he had to deal with everyday problems but his problems with the Dursleys and feeling like a nobody were postponed. I think that this was something else that made the reader feel good from the beginning. I really enjoyed this book and can't wait to finish the other three."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a compelling adventure of a young boy who goes from being an outcast to being a well renowned wizard....This soon to be classic children's book has all the elements to keep any ten-year-old to adult consumed and enticed into reading the Harry Potter saga. Between its epic journey of good verses evil and its wizardry and witchcraft verses the muggle world, there is no end to J.K. Rowling's creative imagination. The novel flies by very quickly and packs quite a punch. From an Owl UPS delivery service to the high speed broomstick game of Quidditch and the frightening but satisfying conclusion of the first book, Harry Potter made me want to jump on the back of the closest Centaur and ride in the light of the moon."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What is all the hype about? I will tell you. This is a masterfully written story with believable, lovable characters in a wonderfully imaginative setting. A must read for everyone!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Normally, I wouldn't have much good to say about this book. The writing is very boring, with no particular style or emphasis on emotions, the story line moves at the same drab pace all the way through, and there is nothing really deep or interesting about any of the characters. Yet Rowling presents us with such an imaginative twist that this book is difficult to resist. This book's world is one of pictures whose subjects don't like to stay put, chess pieces that shout out suggestions to the player, and a game played high in the air on broomsticks with flying balls. The world the author creates is one of great originality and delights, with inventions and characters somewhat reminiscent of Roald Dahl. Curl up with this book on a boring day and enjoy yourself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I first heard of the Harry Potter books when I was visiting my Mother's home in Florida. She told me that if I read one chapter of The Sorcerers Stone that I would not be able to put the book down. I didn't believe her, but after reading half way through the first chapter I was hooked.I was drawn into the world of Harry Potter and The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry Lived with his Aunt, Uncle and a bully, who was his cousin. Harry detested living with them and was treated so poorly that he had to sleep in a cupboard and was tortured by his cousin. However, everything changed the day Harry was visited by a wizard named Hagrid on his eleventh birthday. Hagrid told him of his true magical past and how he once stopped Lord Voldemort, the most evil and diabolical wizard that ever lived. Harry was invited to The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where he meets new friends and experiences incredibly realistic and amazing adventures.J.K. Rowling has created another world with every adventure so realistic that you feel as if you are one of the characters. I think this book is fantastic and I would recommend it to all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a great book.

It was amazing! I live in South Carolina and there was some debate in the town in which I live as to whether these books were suitable for children. This book teaches that friendship, honesty and loyalty are traits that are to be rewarded. The wizardry and magic is secondary to the theme of this wonderful novel. I would encourage my children to read it. Harry is an endearing little boy with many problems that all kids his age can relate to, problems such as school bullies, unpleasant adults, and tough homework assignments. Rowling does a wonderful job unraveling her stories. The characters are inviting, even the evil ones! You just want to know what they are going to do next. I am quite jealous! Harry has a very exciting life! Except for those rotten Dursley's!I was completely engrossed in this book until it was over! I have read her second book &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; as well.

J.K. Rowling is a creative storyteller that kept this adult interested all the way through. A good, quick read for a long flight (which is what I bought it for). I'd forgotten what fun a child's adventure story can be. I was enchanted from the moment Harry Potter selected his magic wand and was on his way to Hogswarts."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K. Rowlings has written a clever mix of all my favourite school girl stories ( The St.Clare's/Mallory Towers series of Enid Blyton), hints of Tolkien, C.S.Lewis, and even Roald Dahl. It's a pity that not many kids seem to read these authors in these days, but better that they fall for Harry Potter than not live in a book-induced haze of sorts at all.( What a wonderful feeling, at any age!) She has effectively replaced some of the more dated concepts with a veneer of modern references and even political correctness ( boy with dreadlocks, Parvati Patil(! ) etc., etc.) But the basic appeal of the story remains the same as many great stories -- The triumph of the under-dog."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read this book because my best friend told me that it was excellant novel. I took her advice and I read through all three in the matter of two to three days. I was amazed at the idea of a magical wizard world that exists right in front of our &quot;Muggle&quot; eyes. It was a suspensful and interesting story that you never can never put down. I eagerly await the next books that J.K. Rowling will bring out. Any person who claims that this is a horror story and has no true value is just jealous at one person's great sucess because of true talent!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Something I have learned observing the past trends of human beings is that nothing can be immensly popular without some group of people hating it. The problem with this is that the books are so well written and interesting that nobody can complain about the style of the writer, so they have to complain that it encourages witchcraft. There are no witches, people. There must be a million other books abnout sorcerors and you don't see anybody complaining about that, do you? Let's get with it, all right?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As a 21 year old cynic, I couldn't believe my friends when they started babbling on about some childrens book.

I got to my hotel and put it on my bed and decieded to start to read it before bed. Let me say I couldn't go to sleep I stayed up for 4 hours reading it and was just left in amazment with this book. Needless to say I read it all the way home. I got home and immeditaly went to get the other two books. I started the second book two nights ago and finished it tonight and will most likly start the third on tommorrow and hopefully will love it as much as I loved the others.

We are surrounded by Muggles (unfortunately). Those are the ones who sign their memos &quot;regards&quot;, whereas the others (witches, warlocks, goblins, dragons, etc) sign &quot;cheers&quot; or &quot;ciao!&quot; or &quot;bye&quot;. The Muggles are the ones who come in at 5 (a.m.) and leave at 8 (p.m.) whereas the others stay in the office as little as possible, then rush off to LIVE. The Muggles are the ones who follow all the rules, or at least try hardest not to get caught breaking them, whereas the others take a little company time everyday to dedicate themselves to a good laugh and a little fantasy.It's been a while since anyone wrote a good fantasy. I grew up on Roald Dahl, CS Lewis, Tolkein, and so many more. Thank goodness fantasy is back in style. I hope that the popularity of these wonderful books will inspire writers to write fantasy, and publishers to publish it.Cheers!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone has kept me up nights!

(I have to admit that one night only a chapter or two into the book, I stayed up late to finish it off!) My daughter and I have laughed out loud at the antics of the characters, and the action and mysteries have unravelled at just precisely the right pace to keep her imagination going and her interest high!It is such a joy to find a book that touches a child like this one has my daughter.

The visual imagery is wonderful and our protaganist is a very identifiable character.If a parent is looking for a book to interest their young child in the joy of reading, I would direct you to this book.(Am I the only one that thinks there's more to Hagrid than's being let on?)Oh by the way. . .I'm 'over 40' and a banker.Read this book/Read this book to your child!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"For your information, the Harry Potter books are numbers 1,2, and 3 on the New York Times bestseller list.

Magic wands, flying broomsticks, potions, dragons, messenger owls--and much more--are present to enchant the reader whether old or young. The young Harry, magician unaware, is a charming and somewhat pitiable young man who comes into his own in the world of wizards as well as the world of humans. His instinctive notions of what is right and wrong make him an immediate favorite with his fellow students at Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft, although he invokes the jealousy and derision of a certain evil element group. In the world of wizards and witches that Harry joins we find all the joys and sorrows, foibles and follies that exist in the human world. The only real difference is that their differences are settled with spells and magic as well as common sense and good moral character. Overall, this is a story of the battle between good and evil, with virtuous and kindly wizards poised against dastardly villians. And what a pleasure it is to get lost in a different world where magic and myth join to not only teach a lesson but to entertain us royally. I haven't had as much fun reading since The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. This is a book for children--and adults of all ages. Go quickly and get the first so that you can start the next ones!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm about to turn 40 and have no children but have read many reviews on this book, and the others in the series. Hearing about children giving up some television and computer game time to read this book--well I had to see for myself what all the excitement was for! Half way into this book I rushed out and bought the other two, not wanting to miss a heartbeat of the story.The story of a little boy without parents and left with family that doesn't act like family, and is horrified with his capabilities. This book is a great adventure story to escape into and come out better for. A story about friendships, good and evil and struggles of right and wrong in all of us.This story really reminded me of C.S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia series(which I also highly recommend). The difference is, as a child I adored the same fascinating imaginings and stories of adventure. As an adult I re-read that series and for the first time saw the Christian teachings I'd missed the first time. If you're not comfortable with that, you won't find it in R.J. Rawling's novels to find later! Just a wonderful adventure with characters you'll love to boo and others you take to heart!ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I bought all three Harry Potter books for my 11-year-old son for Christmas, and, before giving him any books, I always read them first. I think they're wonderful! They're fun, challenging to a young reader, and are sure to keep him interested. Harry Potter demonstrates the value of making good choices and shows how an ordinary kid can be a hero. These books are pure and simple fantasy; they are no more &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;anti-religious&quot; than Tolkein's Lord of the Rings or CS Lewis's Narnia series, both classic works of fantasy, and I have no doubt that these books will also be read over and over by kids, both young and old, for years to come."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Absolutely delightful book.

The wizard tried to kill Harry but he couldn't kill him for some reason. So he just left a mark on his forehead for the mark of death.

Then go back and read the book to tell which of the stories was better announced from the movie to the book. After all, yes this was a good book I have read from J.K Rowling.

I enjoyed the different names for people she uses. This helps you stay reading to find out what kind of personality they have. Reading and knowing that the life story goes on is like being a part of reading soap opera. One where the life of the main character Harry, changes almost over night! I t was a fun and easy going book to read when in high school the storys are not curernt and what everone is reading. The part I liked best was when Harry finds himself in a dark room, only for it to be a huge chessboard. They find the only way out is to play chess, and become the pieces to get out of the room. The author writes in a really talking style which makes it hard to put the book down. The end is really only at the end of the book and even here she lives you wanting to read the next book because you know Harry is going to have lots of fun with Dudley and his magic.

At first, many people think, silly teenagers Harry Potter books are for kids, but when you first read about Hogwarts, Quidditch, and invisibility cloaks you really get into it. The best thing about the book is that it makes reading fun. When you start using your imagination it opens a whole new level of thinking. It's fun to imagine what it would be like to attend a school like Hogwarts. When reading the book you really get into it. You can imagine yourself casting spells on your friends and you may even notice yourself calling the spells out loud, I certainly did. It would be really cool to try some Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, but I don't know if I could get myself to try them for fear of getting an earwax flavored one, but you can judge for yourself. The only bad part was when they decided to make a Harry Potter movie. Now don't get me wrong, it was a great movie, but it takes away all the imagination from reading the book.

When my mother brought Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for my younger brother I read it to keep from being bored. I was Immediatley hooked. The writing style is simple and easy to read, which gives the younger people who read this a boost in confedence, not many kids can say that they read and liked a 300+ page book!Even though the book is written for kids, its good for all ages, dont believe me? just look at the wide variety of people who have reviewed this. Theres people anywhere from 7 years old to in the 60+ range.Dont let the size of the book deter you though, this book teaches good morals like: sharing, kindness, and curiousity, duty and several others.

It was almost as if I was being introduced to the incredible power of the fantasy genre all over again!

I suggest that if you're going to read this youmight aswell by the rest of them in one go for you really won't be able to put this book down. Most of the people I know read all three in one go.... I certainly read all three books in a matter of three hours because it really was an amazing journey altogether. The book is right for adults and children. I can't say the vocabulary is too easy or the topics are to childish because once you read it you'll understand that it's just one huge fantasy land that children will fall straight into and adults will look back on. The ideas are wonderful and if you need a book to hook your children on it's educational too and you can take it somewhere to spend some quiet, quality time alone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This, being the first in what will hopefuly be a long series, has captured readers minds around the world including my own.

Finally as the book went on I could fully understand how greatful he must have been to be gifted in such a profound way. All in all this was the best book I have read in a very long while, and I am a very avid reader. Well I hope this review will reach out to someone who will enjoy this amazing series just as much as I did.

I absolutely LUV to read, but I can hardly find anything on the shelf right now - even though my mom is a librarian! - so you can imagine what this book really meant to me. Not that I couldn't live without books . . . I'm just so much of a reading maniac, I. . . . You know what? I'm getting off track.

I happen to be a rather cynical teenager, so I expected it to be stupid. I was totally surprised when I started reading the book and I loved it!

I wasn't disappointed. The story is brilliantly creative, the characters are realistic even if they do have magical powers (I just loved the Weasley twins), and it's funny (I laughed out loud several times). The book is very versatile, so that people from three years old to a hundred and three will love it. I haven't read the sequels yet, but I think I'll get them for my birthday so I'll read them then.

We think that they are so good that every night we read them. We highly recommend them to anyone who needs a good book to read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Although deliberately mis-marketed as a children's book, this light contemporary fantasy breaks many frontiers by appealing to such a wide audience.The scope of the story is limited to the life of one young Harry Potter, whose early life was shaped by events beyond his control to such a degree that almost everyone in the world around him has some preconceived idea or notion about him as a person. Harry's life is burdened by both this and by many other factors.The book's themes move through many traditions, well drawn and illuminated, including: child versus adult, child versus child, and child versus himself.Harry is pitted against adults who hate him for things his parents did; adults whom he might trust, but is not sure of; against other children jealous of a status they view he does not deserve (but which, of course, he did not acquire through deliberate action); and finally against his own fears and lack of self-confidence.There are many elements of classic mystery woven in as well, and indeed, a mystery is the central point around which the novel revolves.All of this is combined into a single whole carries the story forward quite nicely.I first became interested in the books when 60 Minutes did a segment on them and the author. Never before had one author had three books on the NYT Hardcover Bestseller list all at once, much less numbers 1, 2, and 3 at the same time, much less all &quot;children's&quot; books.To say the least, I decided that there was something much more than a simple children's book behind this success story.I was right.I finished the book quickly and immediately purchased and read the next two. The next book is slightly better, and the third is much better. My money was well spent here."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"There are some trends I try never to get sucked into; Harry Potter was one of them. From the start for whatever reason I had something against Harry. It had nothing to do with it having witchcraft and wizardry. Perhaps it was because children everywhere were reading it, raving about it, and devoting their souls to it. I reasoned it had to be fast, shallow fantasy in order to grab the attention of today's youth. I wrote it off as another Goosebumps phenomena.When I started dating my future wife this all changed. I did the unspeakable and took her to the third Harry Potter movie. Unlike me she loved Harry Potter and had read the first three books. This and several other concessions I made brought me the point I'm at now: where I'm typing a review after having read the first book.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone begins a young boy's education in witchcraft and wizardry. This boy, named Harry Potter, lives a Cinderella-type of existence where he stays with his terrible aunt and uncle. Little to his knowledge he is already famous to the world. As unlikely events unfold, he is eventually sent off to study at Hogwarts, the prestigious school of magic. While there Harry meets a variety of interesting characters.At Hogwarts the real adventure begins. Harry realizes that a dark presence is seeking out the Sorcerer's Stone, a powerful artifact that grants its user riches and immortality. As Harry delves deeper into the mystery of the Sorcerer's Stone, he also comes to unravel more of the questions surrounding his own beginnings.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a very fun book. It's quirky characters and their adventures will prove to keep the reader entertained for a very long time. Though the book is only three hundred pages or so, I can honestly say there wasn't a dull moment in the entire story. J.K. Rowling has drawn many comparisons with other great authors. This is due to the fact that her work is very smart and original.To all those latecomers who are jumping on the bandwagon: if you can help it, don't see the movies before you read the books. It takes a lot of the suspense out of the reading when you already know what's going to happen. This shouldn't deter you though, as the book still proves to be a quite satisfying read with important details the movie didn't catch."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a great book, however if you are looking for a complete set of the HP books in hardcover this is not the version to buy.

When he was running from Dudley's gang, he jumped behind some trash cans and ended up on the roof of his school. Harry Potter isn't a normal boy.Then suddenly, his whole life changes with the arrival of one letter and a knock on the door. The one knocking is a man named Hagrid who is twice the size of a normal man. He tells Harry that he is a wizard (but not without Uncle Vernon trying to stop him). Harry and Hagrid go to the city the next day and they go into a shop that the muggles (people with no magic in them) can't see. When they go in there, people bombard Harry and shake hands with him. Hagrid tells Harry he is attending Hogwarts School, but Harry is more interested in why everyone was so happy to see him. They go through a brick wall to a place called Diagon Alley where they buy Harry's school supplies. He goes back to the Dursleys for a month and then they go to the train station to see Harry off on the train that brings him to school. But the station doesn't seem to be there. He asks a family with all red hair how to get to the platform, and the magic begins.J.K. Rowling is a great fantasy writer. When I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down.

It was a letter that said Harry was eccepted to Hogwarts, but his umcle just threw it away.The next day more letters came. They were all flying around and Hary managed to get one.

However, I find something magical in the fantastic tapestry that J. K. Rowling has woven. My little sister saw it, which is why she begged me to read the books for 2 years. When I finally caved to her command, I found a book series that not only evoked my imagination but also rekindled my love of Modern English Literature. What the critics fail to realize is that the Harry Potter series is popular for a reason! It is incredibly well written, on a thought-provoking subject. The plot is immensely detailed but easy to follow, the characters come alive and the reader is transported to a land where evil challenges good every day in an all out war. There is no better story to read the that of Harry Potter. But be warned, like chocolate, drugs and tattoos, its addicting."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This Is Definetally a got to read book! It's great to see that people still love and read fantasy books. J.K. Rowling has got to be one of the best authors ever!

Rowling. Its all about a miserable boy named Harry, who lives with his horrible aunt and uncle, the Dursleys, and there over-weight son, Dudley. The Dursleys, who are obsessed with being normal, are prepared to blame Harry for anything unusual that goes on in there house and make Harry sleep in the cupboard under the stairs. But all that changes when Harry receives a letter from a magical school inviting him to come and learn wizardry. Harry soon finds that he's famous and that every witch and wizard in the world knows his name! Harry, with the cleverness of Hermione Granger and the humorous Ron Weasley, finds that something secret, called the Sorcerer's Stone, which can turn any metal into pure gold, and holds the Elixir of Life which can make the drinker immortal,is hidden in the school, and some one is after it. The clever Hermione thinks it's Professor Snape, the cold hearted Potion's Master, who has it in for punishing student's he dislikes, exspecilly Harry. So Harry, Ron, and Hermione must find where it is hidden and then get past the many tasks guarding it. But the ending is much of a surprise. J.K Rowling plots and ending are clever and tricky, and once you've read it, you'll know why it's my favorite book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book! What a mind Rowling has. The things she came up with when it comes to the Hogwarts School...nothing but brilliance. The Char. of *everyone* in the book is incredible. The Good (Harry, Harmonie, and Ron) the bad (snape and Maloy) and the ugly (that-who-can't-be-named) is just incredible. As I was reading this, it was easy to see all of the hype that goes with this.

I am glad he did. Once I began reading, I couldn't stop. I have always been a fan of movies and books that contained magic. This book is easy to read but very intresting. The characters are great too. As a college student, I could find each one of my professors in the teachers at Hogwarts. I could also see a majority of my friends in the students at Hogwarts."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"i almost didnt buy this book because it was a childrens book but because of all the press, i thought why not. this is by far the greatest book ive ever read. harry encounters many dangerous adventures and turns during his first year at hogwarts. read this book..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for the first time right before the movie adaptation was released. I was a bit behind the already numerous series fans, but still managed to experience Harry before he took the remaining non-reading, but movie-loving world by storm. I read the books. I saw the movies. A lot. And as I patiently, yet sadly, await the release of the final part of the final movie I finally sat down to re-read the series in its entirely.I could rave maniacally over the utter perfection that is Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but I won't. That's been done. To death. Over 4,700 5-star reviews on Amazon.com alone.What I will do is point out the things that became very obvious to me during this re-reading of the book. So many things became clear years later, that I never noticed or appreciated at the time of the first reading. As much as I'd like to take credit for being older and therefore wiser, the real truth of it was I became so enamored with the book from the first chapter that I devoured it as quickly as possible. Needing to know what happened, needing to experience this new and fantastical world, I read as fast as I could - totally glossing over things I wish I'd took the time to notice the first time around.We all know Harry Potter is a wonderful story. Arguably the best of its generation. But I never noticed how wonderful the writing was until this re-read. This new world, complete in every minute detail, is world building at its finest. Never is the reader confused as to how the world is supposed to work or appear. Never do we stumble over the many invented words. The story flows so smoothly that you never realize how huge an endeavor this must have been for the author.As the first book in a series, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone lays the groundwork for everything to come. Harry's relationship with the Dursley's. Harry's friendship with Ron and Hermoine. Harry's rivalry with Malfoy. The tone is set for Harry's future interactions with Dumbledore, Hagrid, and Snape. So much character interaction, coupled with the introduction of both Hogwarts and the magical community as a whole, in such a small book. We know Rowling can write a doorstopper, so fitting all of these important things into barely 300 pages is nothing short of miraculous.More than just magical adventure, Rowling weaves some charming humor into the Harry Potter world from the get-go. Naming Filch's mean, old cat Mrs. Norris - genius. And the school song. How did I miss that? It's ridiculous and wonderful all at the same time.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is often dismissed in favor of the later, darker books in the series, but I think that's a mistake. The entire series hinges on what is contained in this one book. The magnificence this series reaches by the end is only possible by the limitless imagination Rowling puts forth in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said.I actually read this for a narrative class in college and fell in love with it. I read it at least once a year."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm 23 and just now getting into the wonderful world of reading. I've got quite a bit of catching up to do but the Harry Potter books have been a great place to start for me. I became very engrossed in the imaginative school setting, sense of magic and wonder, and charming and rather believable characters(despite living in a very fantastical world) upon reading the first few chapters.The entire cast of characters is one area where this series hits the bulls-eye dead on. Every one of them, from the most important all the way to the most minor are full of quirks and personality, not to mention clever names. The brave, virtuous and ever-enduring Harry, the whole lot of the poor yet heart-filled and strong Weasley Family, the incredibly intelligent and responsible Hermione Granger, and the majestic and extremely kind Albus Dumbledore(every time he shows up I feel a sense of warmth and comfort for some reason) are just a few of the great characters Rowling has dreamed up.For the most part I really liked the story of this one, it's great to see the 3 main characters learning the ways of magic and the way of the school. This is the beginning of their friendship and bond as well. There are quite a few great scenes in the book, some with edge-of-your-desk action, and other that offer charming details of the world and characters. My only qualms with the story of \\"the Sorcerer's Stone\\" and \\"the Chamber of Secrets\\" is that the big reveals at the end seem a bit forced. They are certainly shocking and interesting reveals, both unmasking someone you wouldn't suspect as the villain of the story. They seemed forced into the end of the book and came off as slightly contrived. It's not bad at all though, and the way Harry has to go through and handle the situations garner a lot of respect for the guy from me.I have the 3rd book ordered right now and I can't wait to continue giving my thoughts on J.K Rowling's masterpieces. Highly recommended to kids as well as adults, as I have learned plenty of cool words with a British flavor, so there is some brain candy for everyone here."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter has been a wizard all his life and has never known. His Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia always did, but they never told him; instead, they kept him in his cupboard (a.k.a. his bedroom) and treated him differently - much differently - than his cousin Dudley, who was spoiled beyond comparison. On Harry's 11th birthday, however, Harry receives a visit from, well, a giant. Named Hagrid. It is then that Harry learns of his past - and what his future could be. After dealing with Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, Hagrid whisks Harry off to Hogwarts and a new life of friends, magic, flying and...and evil sorceror who is trying to knock Harry off his broomstick - literally.I'm a first time Harry Potter reader. I've heard so many different opinions that when I started reading The Sorceror's Stone I was really excited to form my own opinion about the series. So far, I have to say that I'm impressed. I was expecting a bit of an \\"older\\" read, but I guess that is yet to come. As Harry grows older and progresses in wizardry, so do we. I like that. I'm very much looking foward to seeing that change in the story/characters in the coming books.While J. K. Rowling has a very strong original writing style, there was one thing that bothered me every time I saw it. She has a slight case of the \\"run-ons\\". I hate run-ons. They seem so easy to find and simple to fix - and yet there are so many of them in literature today. However, I can't say that the few grammatical errors I found in The Sorceror's Stone ruined the book for me. It was much too good for that.In one word, I think - and a few weeks ago I never thought I'd say this about a Harry Potter book - I would described The Sorceror's Stone as lighthearted. It was very funny and J. K. Rowling has a quite a bit of sarcasm under her belt. I laughed out loud multiple times. Fred and George Weasley were always making me laugh, from their smart mouths to them always getting in trouble. The Sorceror's Stone was a very good start to a series that I hope will get better and better as I continue to read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"With Jim Dale's unique voices for each character and dramatic inflection, it is easy to forget that he is the only person reading. He is fantastic! I thoroughly enjoy his reading of all 7 books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a latecomer to the Harry Potter books and after finishing this first novel I am deeply impressed with Rowling and her ability to create a magical world. Harry Potter is badly treated by his family and I was overjoyed when we found out he was a famous wizard. There is a villain in this book (a couple of them actually) and Rowling keeps you guessing until the very end. The characters are very likeable and the quidditch games are exciting and intense. I loved this book and I am looking forward to reading the rest of them! Now I know what everyone was raving about"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is a clique, but it is such a classic, well done clique that that doesn't matter in the slightest. Everyone (children and adults) loves a great \\"good vs. evil\\" story. I often think that something that everyone raves about just can't be as good as the say, but Harry Potter exceeds the reviews.The incredibly rich detail in all the Harry Potter novels is really the best aspect of the story. JKR creates a whole world that readers can't forget about. There many subplots, but JKR keeps them all straight. Because of the detail, you are really in the story.I can't tell you how great all the books in this series are, you'll have to read them for yourself. Harry Potter is the new Star Wars, the new Lord of the Rings. It already is a legend."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I started reading Harry Potter a few years ago so that I could find out if they were suitable for my kids. Guess, what? I'm a well-educated adult, and I love Harry Potter! I can't believe that I can be so entertained by something that every kid on the block is reading (usually I don't go for children's fantasy).Sophisticated adults will complain that this is derivative and \\"light.\\" Yes, it is. It's children's literature, and that's what kids like. But, this is superior children's literature. The writing is exceptional, the characters are deep, the humor is subtle enough for adults to enjoy. It's very well done. I wish that all of the stuff my kids were reading was done this well.I'm thrilled that, because of Harry Potter, children are reading large novels again. I know several kids who've been inspired to read, and to not be intimidated by big books, because of J.K. Rowling. If you have only seen the movies and haven't read the books, you are really missing out. --FanLit.net"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"One fine day while I was at work, I went into our caf&eacute; and came across a coworker reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.Like a lot of adults I started laughing and said, \\"Aren't those for kids?\\"My former coworker said, \\"Don't laugh until you've actually read them.\\"I took her advice and picked up the same book.And I have to admit, she was right!The Sorcerer's Stone was, like many of you, my introduction to the Harry Potter Empire.I loved it, from start to finish, a pleasure to read.These books are not just for kids, but anyone who has an imagination.I've since read all the Potter books and I loved every one of them and the movies also.How many books end up getting made into worthwhile movies?Not very many, but I'll be darned if Hollywood isn't making every Potter book into a stellar movie.I give this book and all the Potter books my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Our family enjoys the annual summer vacation road trip - seeing the countryside; anticipating our arrival at the vacation destination and listening to audio books.

Wrong! Little does Harry know, but he is a famous wizard-to-be, that couldn't be killed by Vol-, I mean you-know-who. He has never had any friends or participated in group activities. Then one day, without warning, a giant named Hagrid comes to invite him to one of the best school of witchcraft and wizardry around, Hogwarts. Of course Harry accepts, anything to get away from his rotten family.I really liked the way Ms. Rowling had a front row seat in the book waiting for me. I felt if I were in the book with Harry. The descriptions were unbelievable, they helped paint a really live picture picture. I really think it is really cool how she can write the exact way people with lisps talk. I thought it was amazing to have that ability. I really liked the book a lot, so I gave it five stars. I only recommend it though if you like adventure, mystery and friendship. Each chapter is filled with its own special uniqueness to keep you turning the pages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter was a well written book.

Unfortunately,she is not interested in the normal subjects of teen books (boys, divorce, peer pressure,etc). She and I thoroughly enjoyed reading the first Harry Potter book. I read it with her to make sure there wasn't anything &quot;inappropriate&quot; for her age. There wasn't. The book held her (and my own) attention from the very beginning to absolute last word in the book. We are both looking forward to the second book. Which, by the way, Santa will be bringing!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought this was the best book I've read. The story is just so creative and very funny.

From me, a kid, you know this is a good book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am nine years old and I am a Harry Potter fanatic! Giants, wizard sports, magic wands, evil wizards, weird candy and relatives that make you sleep in a closet....how much stranger can it get??? VERY! In the Harry Potter books it gets much stranger than that. When the Dursleys, Harry's mean relatives, find him on their doorstep at age one, they take him in but do their best to keep him a muggle (a non-magic person), but it doesn't work. One day a giant named Hagrid comes to tell him he is a wizard and takes him off to Hogwarts, the school for witches and wizards. There he makes new friends and even defeats Lord Voldemort (a.k.a., &quot;you know who&quot;) for the second time. I won't tell you any more because I don't want to spoil the story for you. I know you'll like it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As an eighteen-year-old freshman in college I am not at all ashamed to admit that Harry Potter is my new favorite thing. I have all four of the Harry Potter novels and have read each one twice already. They are the most creative, exiting, humorous and enjoyable books that I have ever come across. The adventures are gripping and the characters are priceless. I laugh out loud and secretely wish that I was attending Hogwarts with Harry than my own school. Likewise, sitting down and reading any Harry Potter novel is a refreshing break from a long day of classes. As most of us need a little joy in our lives, I would recommend any of these novels to anyone, of any age or interest. I find it hard to believe that there is someone who is not susceptible to the spell of Harry Potter. These are, by far, the most imaginative and entertaining books that I have ever read. If you enjoy reading and appreciate a good adventure, Harry Potter will give all that you desire and more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Alright, alot of people have praised J.K. Rowling for her works with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I'm one of them. I mean it. This book just grabs you. People say it is from the devil? Ha! Then the devil sure has cut down on his evil works. Sure there's magic in it. But only those who are mentally unstable would actually believe this book is true and start practicing witchcraft (no offenence to anyone who is mnetally unstable and is reading this.) I thought that people left all this witchcraft stuff in the 1700 or something like that. This book isn't like teaching you magic. This book if for enjoyment only!Now about the book. Harry is an orphan. His parents were killed by He-who-must-not-be-named, a powerful Dark Wizard. He then proceed to attempt to kill Harry, but some how his spell was reversed onto himself! Harry, less then a year old, had some how survived an encounter with the most powerful Dark Lord! Harry is raised by his muggle (non-magic people) Aunt and Uncle. It isn't until his 11th B-day that he discovers he is a wizard and has been accepted to Hogwarts, a school for wizards and witches. And that is were the adventure begins. There Harry makes friends and learns to be a wizard. But I'm not going to say anymore. You'll just have to read the book to find out how things turn out for Harry.Now I recommend this book to kids who love fantasy. Ages 9 to 1,330. If you're older then that, then don't read the book. Parents should really consider readng this book to their children. It really helps younger kids understand that is more important to do the right thing. Also younger kids might not understand everything. This gives you parents a chance to show your children how smart you really are. So, if you still haven't read this book, do so NOW! Oh and if you have time, click that thingy there that says,&quot;Was this helpful to you?&quot; Thanks!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I like the spells in Harry Potter.They're complicated to read.

While I found the close-calls a bit repetitive and tiring, I think the ingenuity of the entire concept more than makes up for it. Harry Potter and his friends live the stuff of every child's fantasy. Rowling's use of description of phenomenal. The thought of dual worlds, magic, sorcerer's spells and the like is enchanting to adults with a bit of youth's spark left in them as well. I'm eager to read the rest of the series!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have been hugely impressed with all four HP books, so I bought the audiocassette to see whether I could get my husband hooked. We listened to the first half on a long car trip, and I think it worked. Jim Dale does a wonderful job of reading, differentiating each character in a different, and very characteristic, voice. (Apparently he's had to use 400+ voices for HPIV!)I was surprised to find how much I gleaned from Dale's reading even after reading Sorceror's Stone several times. The slower pace and different emphases of reading aloud highlight points that are easy to miss in a silent reading. Also, hearing the Scots burr of Prof. McGonagall and Hagrid's regional accent (Lancaster? Somerset?) serve to bring out aspects of their characters that were less apparent to this American reader."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was going to the beach one day and saw my little brother's Harry Potter book on the table and decided to take it for reading as a joke. I started to read about how he had to live with such an evil family and his very interesting past and I couldn't stop! I finished the book in about 4 days which seems like some sort of miracle because I hardly ever finish a book. I HAD to have the rest. It is such an awesome book and I don't care how old it's geared for I'm in 10th grade and I am waiting for the 3rd one to come out on paper back. I highly recommend the books to my friends for a fun read. Good luck Harry on your other adventures"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Like another reviewer I'm upset that this book is geared towards kids. This book is amazing. Derivitive yes. But nonetheless it stands on its own merit. For everyone who's ever felt that they didn't fit in this book inspires hope.

And please do not believe those shameful rumors that the book is Satanic and that children who read it will start worshiping the devil. That's rubish!

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone brings us a lot of learning about love, good and evil, friendship and being the child we need to be.... I liked specially a part when Professor Dumbledore says to Harry: &quot;...to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever.&quot; For sure the Potter serie of books will become a classic in the mder literature... and not only children's literature..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a great book.

Bottom line is - they're not. There's a big difference between magic and satanism and these books are filled with the same sort of magic that we love in all the classic fairy tales.For parents who just can't stand the idea of their kids reading about magic, I'd recommend &quot;The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe&quot; even though there is magic in that one, too. However, for the rest of us, the Harry Potter stories are wonderful.

At Hogwarts he is invovled in lots of things to help him train. He meets new friends. He finally learns that his parenrs died protecting him and that a powerful wizard, Vodermont could not kill him. During the story Harry and his friens encounter many things. He even has to face Vodermont in this book. I truly enjoyed reading this book with the group. We would report back and discuss parts of the book and also add ideas for use in the classroom. Students could use Harry Potter in many different ways. They could illustrate many things such as Hogwarts, the troll, the hat, etc. Students could write in their journals about numerous aspects of the story. Science lessons could pertain to making potions. Students could design their own game. I do think teachers would not want to use this book with younger children."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I read &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot;,I was very disapointed in the content and general story.

Rowling brings back memories of C.S. Lewis, Roald Dahl, &amp; also those old-fashioned but brilliant books about life &amp; adventures in english boarding houses. A &quot;struggling single mother&quot; (as the book cover mentions) turns out to be a great talent, &amp; the Harry Potter books are destined to become children classics.

Harry and his friends are a delightful crew and after reading the first book, I bought the next two in the series and can't wait for the fourth one to arrive this summer. I don't even have children yet, but I am saving these for when the time comes.I understand that there has been some controversy over these books and I fully understand that some parents are offended by the thoughts of magic and it is against the religious beliefs of some.If you are offended by these concepts, please don't read these books.

They forced him to live in terrible conditions and his only birthday present ever, was an old sock. His room was nothing but a small cabinet at the bottom of the stairs. For Harry, things were about to change. For eleven years, he believed that his parents were killed in a car accident. Now he will find out the truth about his life. Letters addressed to Harry's closet started being sent to the Dursleys. After the first one was torn up, they started arriving everywhere that they went. Yet on one stormy night, Harry saw what was written on the letters. He was a wizard, and the letter was from a witchcraft and wizardry school named Hogwarts. Harry's mother and father were not in a car crash, but the dark wizard Voldemort murdered them. Hogwarts was a magical place for Harry. He had his own bed and was able to do virtually anything that he pleased. Everything there had magic involved, from classes to food and sports. He met new friends such as Hermoine and Ron, and joined the Gryffindor Quidditch team, which he greatly loved. There was only one problem for Harry Potter, and that was that Voldemort, the most powerful dark wizard ever, was out to murder him and steal a very precious item that the school was keeping secret. That item was the sorcerer's stone! Now Harry must help stop Voldemort from getting the stone or else it could be the end for him and the rest of the good wizards. Can Harry get to the stone first, or will Voldemort steal it successfully? The stone must be destroyed and the future of good lies in Harry's hands. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone had won many major awards and is a fantastic debut for the author J.K. Rowling. I personally enjoyed this book because it is witty and incredibly funny. It's characters are very interesting in their own way and this book is impossible to put down. I recommend this book to everyone no matter what kind of books they like."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved the Harry Potter books because they inspired me and the adventure was fun to read, and my mom and my sister love it too!

Rowling did a wonderful job at it, and I wondered how I ever was without the books.

Rowling, or Joanne Kathleen Rowling, it also talked about the Harry Potter books, it was like on February of 2000, when the summer vacations arrived, there was a lot of hype because of the fourth book, and i was thinking that this books were to childish, but i said to my self &quot;I Cannot judge a book by it's cover, OK, i will give them a try&quot;, so then i buyed the first one at a store, and a kid asked me &quot;You haven't read any of these books?&quot;, and i answered him &quot;No&quot;, and then he stared at me, with a &quot;How dare you&quot; look on his face, &quot;Well, they are great, read them&quot;, so then, i gotted home, and i gotted a call from my aunt who told me about the HP books she told me they were great books for kids and adults, and i told her that i was just going to open it, and she told me that i would love it, so then i started reading it, and i thought they were very babyish, but when i gotted to chapter 2, i started to like it, and by chapter three, i liked even more, by chapter four i definetly liked, by chapter five i loved it, and by six well i was totally hooked, Miss Rowling's styled of narrating it's very Roald Dahl and Charles Dickens style, only with a new &quot;magic&quot; touch, and i really started loving the series, i have only book one and two, but i have readed some excerpts from book three and four, and they look great, and also it looks like if the stories keep maturing, more, and more, and more, and i cannot believe that people are comparing this series with all the books by J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, they really stink, in fact they make sick, the characters in those books are so one dimensional, specially in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, if you want really something to read while waiting for book five , i recommend ya &quot;El Principito&quot; by Saint Antonie Expuire (very sorry if i didn't spell it right), &quot;The Odyssey&quot; by Homer, &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;,&quot;The Time Machine&quot; and &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; by H.G.Well's, you rather read those than that &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trash.P.S.:Here is some info from the Harry Potter fisrt book movie, you can see the trailer, with Quicktime, Windows MediaPlayer, or Real Video, it will be released on November 16th on bothUSA and UK, and it has been rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of The United Kingdom, i think that by Intense Scenes of Peril, or for some fantasy action violence, if you want a lot of more info check it out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"First things first (so I don't confuse those who have come across my reviews): When I write a reveiw for a whole series, like Harry Potter or The Wheel of Time, I usually talk about the whole series, not just the first book. Nevertheless, I must say that I was most pleased (and suprised at that) with the Harry Potter books. When I began my job this summer, I met a 27 year old woman named Jen that found out I love to read. She told me that she highly recommended the Potter books, and I began to think &quot;Oh boy, I work with a 27 year old that likes to read kids books&quot;. That's how much she was into the whole thing. Anyway, I picked up the first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone at her most intense urging. I half expected to be bored out of my mind, because I thought that Rowling had made Harry Potter for a grade level of, oh, around second or third grade. Let me tell you, within the first couple of chapters, I was completely sucked into the plot. Yeah, there are some corny things, like He-who-must-not-be-named and the names of various 'magical' places/people/items (does the name Hogwarts come to mind? Come on now...), but I didn't really pay them any mind. It's a great story for any age, and if your looking for something that's fun to read, I definately recommend Harry Potter for you!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Okay, I'll admit it. I didn't want to read the Harry Potter series at first. I, being 16, thought that the books would be more suited for a child in secondary school. Boy, was I wrong. Two of my friends had recentlly finished the 4th book, and recommended them to me. I decided to try out the first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for myself. The book was a little slow moving in the beginning, but it picked up pretty soon and took me along with it! The characters are great and very, very unique, and the story line is fantastic. I'm currentlly on the third book, and just can't put it down. I even got my dad interested in reading the first book. I hope that J.K. Rowling puts out the other books really soon!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is one great book; I was surprised to learn that. I've been interested in reading the series for quite some time. I played host to a 48-hour virus a few weeks ago and suddenly had extra time. I read this one in a day and a half. Now, I'm not typically a fast reader, but this is brilliant fiction. It strengths don't lie in realism of lucrative description; they lie in character, pace and intricate story. In other words, just plain, old fashioned storytelling.To those who ask, I usually liken this first Harry Potter book, and indeed the next two, by and large, to a magical Hardy Boys tale. The magic is the canvas, but the story is told forthright and is what drives the book.I would discourage anyone from characterizing this book as children's literature. It is not. The near total absence of vulgar language aside, we are dealing with more than just a kid's tale. The plot of the Sorcerer's Stone is intricate and, indeed, I found myself believing that I was experiencing the dawn of one of the great characters in the history of literature. Harry Potter is a flawed, emotional, adventurous, comical child on the cusp of adolescence. But he also has a gift. And that gift shines through in later books.I've given this a high rating because it is fast paced. Because Rowling pays close attention to her story and never deviates from it. Because I walked away from the book feeling like a better person for having read it.To be quite honest, I had fallen into the hype that this was a book for children. I naively set forth into the story assuming it simplistic. I'm 30 years old, I figure. Piece of cake. Benny Hill must have been thinking of me when he defined \\"assume.\\" It was because I'd figured out where the sought after Sorcerer's Stone lay hidden long before Rowling reveals it. So I assumed I would also know who the antagonist had been. I was way off. There were twists and turns there my mind's tires skidded through and ended up somewhere lost in the woods.And that's what makes a good book. When you think you've been on the main interstate the whole time. When the writer takes his or her gift as a light around you that shows you that, hey, this ain't the interstate. I've been driving down an old wagon trail and, look at me, stuck in the mud.I heartily recommend this book for all ages. You're never too old to forget the sense of pre-pubescent wonder and you're never too young to look forward to it. And we all deserve a good story once in a while. So treat yourself. You deserve it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is wonderful. I never thought I would enjoy a book aimed at children. I couldn't put this book down. J.K. Rowling masterfully weaves the plot of the wonderful orphan Harry Potter. As you get farther into the book, it seem as though you are engulfed by the book, and are standing in Hogwarts with Harry and is friends. I would reccomeend this book for any one young or old. If you think your imagination as been in neutral for too long, just buy this ook and you will be back in drive in notime!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My teenaged son recommended these books to me, and I finally started the series. Harry Potter is a great hero for kids, the book has classic elements of good and evil, the setting of Hogwarts is a wonderfully imaginative place, and most of the adults provide good role models for Harry and his friends. I have only read three of the series so far, and I have yet to see why many fundamentalist Christians (of which I am one) are so upset. A child with a good, firm foundation is perfectly capable of reading Harry Potter and determining truth from fantasy. It is always good for parents and children to talk about whatever a child is reading, and certainly any concerned parent can talk Harry Potter over with their child, making sure to distinguish between fact and fiction. If I had an elementary-aged child, I would certainly allow and even encourage him to read these books. The Harry Potter series is not a whole lot different from The Chronicles of Narnia (just without the Christian emphasis), and this book is a great one to make children turn of the t.v. and READ! I enjoyed the book very much, and I only deducted one star because there were a few points in the book in which I became bored. Of course, as an adult reading a children's book, I expected that I would get bored and was pleasantly surprised that I did not get that way much! This is great fantasy reading for children of all ages and adults who love a good afternoon of escapism!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"These days, parents should do ANYTHING to get their children hooked on reading. This series is not the best in the world but the hype surrounding it could convince your children to read it. It's a simple, easy read that kids will love.From an older perspective, the series can seem simplistic, but this is for children. Even YA might be too high a rating for it. The zany characters and simple evil versus good conflict are perfect for the young audience.After kids have become convinced that reading can be fun, they'll be more likely to grow up and become intelligent people. This book and its sequels might be the boost your children need!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is an awesome book! It's fun, adventurous, and funny! People who don't like it because they think it is bad have their right to think so, I mean, no one in the world has the exact same opinion, right? But the stuff about it being anti christ and awefull for your kids is utterly rediculous! If your kids know it's not real, why be so scared it's going to make them stop going to church and worship the devil? The way most kids are influenced by Harry Potter is they want to read more! In other words, it's a good thing! Don't forget, there are OTHER religions in the world, other religions that fing it perfectly acceptable. And besides, if magic is so bad, why are there so many books about it that do-good-soccor-moms havn't freaked about?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This was the first time I have ever properly read one of JK Rowling's famous Harry Potter potboilers. Although I remember skimming the first few books out of boredom many years ago, I remember very little, and I doubt I read closely at all. While not anti-conformist, my tastes tend to be somewhat eclectic and so I usually tend to miss out on the latest artistic fad that people are raving about: I still, to this day, have never seen even a minute of footage from any of the Pirates of the Caribbean films. I have also tended to avoid children's literature, preferring reading material with some depth to it. That being said, my mind has become opened somewhat to the possibility of enjoying children's literature after reading Philip Pullman's stellar His Dark Materials trilogy, and so I joined a challenge to read a Harry Potter book every month of 2011 until I finish the series. Well, here are my first impressions: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*(refer to bottom of review) is a fast-paced, frequently amusing, and enjoyable piece of escapist literature. It also leaves the reader with very little to remember it by beyond some names and personalities that I would presume will be featured in later books. To sum up my feelings exactly: it is a fun way to waste one's time.Our story starts out with some mysterious figures-- who later turn out to be important figures in the novel-- who leave our hero Harry Potter, at this point only a child, with some relatives of his parents. Harry's parents had just lost their lives defending their child from the evil wizard Voldemort. The encounter, which Harry later only has vague memories of, leaves him with a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. It was apparently important that he be raised by muggle parents. Muggles are, quite literally, the 99% of humans who either have no knowledge of the magical world or do so only indirectly, having come from non-magic using families. It is notable here that the progressive Rowling is already establishing new class distinctions in her invented world (even those who aren't snooty about having pure magic-using heritage still look down their noses somewhat at muggles, and muggle affairs, which, I would presume, include all of humanity's famous wars and all of its saints and sinners, are looked down upon as being of trifling importance). One can detect here a hint of none-too-subtle leftist satire that pokes fun at the elitist attitudes that the upper classes have traditionally adopted toward the larger mass of humanity in the form of the insufferable monied brat Draco Malfoy... but I'm getting ahead of myself. Harry is left at the mercy of the abominable Dursley family, the main three members of which are so stereotypically revolting that they cannot even be said to be characters in their own right. Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and their roly-poly son Dudley can be said to be dehumanized to the extent that they resemble the hook-nosed monstrosities which adorned Nazi propaganda posters. They serve their purpose to the plot, however: they make Harry Potter utterly miserable. They feed him little, dress him in nothing but old rags, and make him live in conditions which would make the heart of children's protective services agent skip a beat. It needs to be this way, because otherwise Harry's later liberation wouldn't seem so great and relieving. This is a familiar technique of popular literature: build up tension until it needs to be released and then release it all at once in a great orgasmic burst.Harry's life is miserable until his guardians receive letters addressed to him shortly before his 11th birthday. At first they throw these away so that Harry doesn't get any weird ideas, but the amount of letters that are sent each time Uncle Vernon trashes them unread builds until their house is literally awash in a sea of letters. Vernon decides, again, I suspect, for largely narrative reasons, to try running away from this and hiding in a shack on an apparently deserted island rather than finding a way to deal with the situation constructively. No real shocker, seeing as how these aren't supposed to be human beings, but deliberately dehumanized plot tools. Well, the person who kept sending Harry all of those letters, a stereotypically giant and lovable old oaf named Hagrid, bursts in through the front door, reveals to Harry a small portion of his secret heritage as the son of two famous magic-users, and offers him his path to salvation. Hagrid, you see, is meant to help Harry prepare to attend the famous wizarding institute of Hogwarts.A few more things to note, and then I'll leave off the brief plot summary:- Harry Potter is apparently famous because he was the target of Voldemort and he survived his encounter with him. Harry is famous and is consequently trying to live up to his reputation.- After Harry gets to Hogwarts and befriends a freckled child born into the longstanding wizarding Weasley family by the name of Ron and a studious young girl named Hermione Granger, the book becomes somewhat episodic until the end.- The magic system in this book is limited well, but I'm not too sure how its rules are defined yet. What controls the magic? What are the extent of magical powers? In what ways can it be channeled and what ways can it not? I'll look forward to answers to these questions in subsequent books.This book reminds me a great deal of the famous 1984 sci-fi novel Ender's Game, where a child is born special and selected to attend a grueling training process at a battle academy in order for humanity to win a war against an alien species. Not least of the similarities I've noticed has been the writing style. Like EG author Orson Scott Card's good old fashioned American style of writing, or whatever it was he called it, JK Rowling writes prose that is designed to be invisible and focus attention solely on the plot. Indeed, at times the book reads almost like a screenplay. This is as it should be however. Escapism shouldn't have prose that calls attention to itself. The primary goal of escapism is immersion, to actually feel like you're in this world. JK Rowling evokes the hypnotic state of immersion through her writing fairly well. It isn't especially good writing, but it does its job efficiently. Moreover, because the characters are two-dimensional stereotypes and the plot is simple, she doesn't need to bother with any kind of speculation or introspection, a problem Card frequently encountered in EG, where the plot is reasonably suspenseful and the main characters emotionally complex.The way the plot is resolved is fairly predictable, but I must remember that this is a book for young children. There are some interesting things in the book, however. I love the clarity with which Rowling evokes the ball-and-broomstick game of Quidditch. It can be difficult writing about sports, but Rowling really lets you see how everything happens coherently. There is also a mirror in the book that lets a person see their heart's deepest desire, which is a nice fairytale touch. And although most of his placid, wise'ol'guy sermonizing is tiresome, Albus Dumbledore, the head of Hogwarts, does make one very good point in the book, one which is actually admirably complex for a young children's novel: refusing to address something fearful directly by its proper name only increases fear of the name itself. This comes into play because almost everyone in the book calls Voldemort \\"You-Know-Who\\" and freak out when Harry Potter says his true name. But this only gives him a psychological power that he wouldn't otherwise have if people actually stopped cowering before the name. Dumbledore instructs Harry to always call him by his proper name. This is a potent lesson in the power that fear-mongering can have.The novel has become somewhat famous for stirring up religious opposition to it because it \\"promotes witchcraft.\\" Were these people who protest it actually to read it, though, they would see that this story isn't anti-Christian. If anything, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is one of the most potent affirmations of Western Christian values that I've ever read. It isn't subversive or philosophically challenging like the Pullman books. The story is simple but interesting and the characters are well-sketched, if somewhat shallow. So far it doesn't seem worth the hype, but it is good enough to continue reading to see if it gets better."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"By now the majority of people have either read or seen a movie of Harry Potter, but I sadly was in the minority. I knew Harry Potter was a child wizard and the series was a worldwide phenomenon, but besides that I was as clueless as the most clueless Muggle. However, this Christmas Santa brought the first five (5) books to my 9-year old and so we decided to read the books at the same time. I am hoping that my daughter will follow her old man's review with a review of her own. Only time will tell on that one but check back and see.As a mystery with solid youthful suspense I think J.K. Rowling really hit the mark. The book found its stride when the action took place at Hogwarts (school for wizards) and Harry and his friends found themselves in the middle of a mystery surrounding a stolen item they believed to be hidden at the school. Rowling knows how to pace the action to create suspense, and provide just enough detail to push the mystery and adventure forward expertly. However, it took a little too long to introduce the plot and for Rowling to hit her stride. Once she did the book was hard to put down.The early chapters provided background on the story of Harry but strangely enough you never really understand who Harry is as a person. The chapters are little condensed stories within themselves, and are entertaining, but at the same time they seemed disjointed until the time Harry arrived at Hogwarts. Once at Hogwarts when Harry meets Ron and Hermione the chapters begin flow better and push the plot forward until the wonderful climax. Maybe Rowling is building the foundations for the next books in the series, but I found a lot of information provided was not central to the story or character development. I even found some of the wizardry information (sorry everyone) a bit dull and uninspired.With that criticism out of the way i did enjoy the book. As i said Rowling is a really good mystery writer. Although the characters are not fleshed out to the extent I would expect, she provides us with enough enjoyable characters to create a magical world. I like the budding friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermoine as well as Hagrid, Snape and Malfoy. I am looking forward to the second book of the series. If that book can capture any of the action that takes place during the last 1/4 of the \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" I think my daughter and I are in for a real treat."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have seen all of the HP movies and loved them, however I had not read the books.

Wish I would have read them before the movies came out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first installment in J.K. Rowling's epic seven-part series. This novel sets the initial stage for Harry and the destiny that awaits him. It is a wonderful read because of its remarkable setting, memorable characters, entertaining plot, and underlying messages. Rowling illustrates a unique world in which readers can easily escape. Readers can also easily identify with several of the characters that Rowling has created. However, some may consider the plot too predictable, because the resolution of the novel is apparent. Nevertheless, the challenges Harry overcomes and the battles he wins along the way to his victory make the novel exciting and interesting. Finally, the novel includes two varying central messages. The first message is that love is more powerful than hate. Love, as demonstrated by the sacrifice of Harry's mother, ultimately conquers over the hate and dark magic of Lord Voldemort. Also, an additional message in the novel is that a person's strength is usually revealed when he or she faces challenges in life. Harry Potter overcomes his adversary and the loss of his parents, revealing his determination and strength of character. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone tells a remarkable story of an ordinary boy in the unusual world that surrounds him. It is clear why millions of readers worldwide have fallen in love with Harry Potter and his story."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a book that will leave you begging for more. The author J.K Rowling was very precise on how she wanted her book to sound and feel. When I first picked up the book I didn't think it would be interesting, but I proved myself wrong in the first chapter.The first reason I love this book is because she tells you Harry's beginning before he even knows his own fate, what is waiting for him in this magical world. The beginning also has details like no other book I've read before; it was like you were inside the book experiencing the indescribable magic.The next thing I love about it is it's filled with life, and mystery. It's like the story is never going to end and when it does your ready to jump right into the next book, and see what happens in Harry's adventures next. They're scary, exiting, but most of all Rowling sticks with fiction. She never changes the subject so many times it's unbearable, unlike other books I've read.Harry is made an individual that gets into a lot of trouble because of his life as an unknown 12-year-old wizard. Mysterious thing happen that are unexplainable to him and to others. He's also a protagonist with an attitude, and I love it.JAfter all the excitement, Rowling goes into her ending. School ends in late June, early summer time. When she writes her books she sets it up so that there is nothing misunderstood in the next book. This book is for 10 and up, or if you like adventure with a twist.

When Harry befriends Ron and Hermione that is a good choice and that expresses the theme that I thought J. K. Rowling was attempting to communicate to us. I also enjoyed how J. K. Rowling made the plot unpredictable and irresistible.One quote that I liked and think expressed the theme of this book takes place in Chapter 12 after Harry discovers the mirror. \\"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you....However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge nor truth.\\" The reason I think this quote expresses the theme of this book is that Harry, who is an orphan is seeking someone that he can trust and rely on. During this quote, I think that Dumbledore shows kind actions by taking care of Harry and so Harry begins to rely on him more and believe in him."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What I Loved: I love the first book in this series. For some reason when I pick it up (and I would have a hard time reading the rest of the series without reading this one again), it transports right to a very magical place. It is great to be introduced to the characters and how their friendships were formed.O ne of my favorite moments is learning how the 3 kids became friends: there are some things you just share that you cannot help but become friends and Downing Mountain Trolls are one of them.What I Liked: You have to like that all the characters (good and bad) you are given a chance to learn more about and truly come to feel strongly about! In re-reading the books it is fun to go back for clues of how some situations can look differently when viewed after knowing all the facts.Why I gave it a 5: After reading all the books do I think it is the strongest? No! However, it is the book that started the whole series off and laid a fantastic groundwork for all the books to come! That is no easy feat and this book did it brilliantly. It is worthy of a 5 in my book.Who would I recommend it too: Honestly, anyone. This is a magical story for people of all ages.This is one of my favorite series to read and love my annual re-reading of them.

Harry Potter this, Harry Potter that. that really bugged me, so i thought, &quot;this is just another stupid book that's got people hooked.&quot; well, it's not stupid, but it'll definitely get you hooked! when my sister bought the paperback edition (i suddenly wanted to read it) i read it straight thru in 3 hours, but the bad thing was i started at 10pm and finished around 1am! i got in trouble for that but that's beside the point;) it was suspenseful and INCREDIBLY well written for a first-time author.... actually, for any author, come to think of it. she's got her own creative twist, and after having read all four current books, i want to get writing! J.K. Rowling is an inspiring author and her books have brought me many ideas for my story writing, in school and independently. Also, for you people out there who &quot;hate&quot; it or think its &quot;sloppy,&quot; &quot;a bad narrative,&quot; and &quot;predictable,&quot; well, you try writing a book and promising more! it's not easy, and every book is better than the last, even though you sometimes need a previous book for referance. if the author ever reads this review, i admire you greatly and you have deeply inspired me to follow my passion, which just happens to be mythical writing;)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I just finished this book and it was quite interesting. It took me a week to finish this book. I have never read a Harry Potter book since the 7th of July. A day before the 4th one came out. I saw on the news that lots of kids were having parties for this book. And I thought that no one would do all of this for an OK book so I started to read the first one at home because I have a sister who has all exept for the 3rd one which she had barrowed. This was a great book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is awsome.If you want to start reading the Harry Potter books you should read them in order.

Overall:I give this book a million stars!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have fallen in love with Harry Potter! He's a charming sort of hero -- the lost, brainy sort of fellow, surrounded by people who can't appreciate his abilities, but who manages to find his own kind and use his talents to save the day.This book is very funny, written with a definite British sort of humor. I am pleased to know that so many children are growing up with this book. It's not &quot;dumbed down&quot; like many popular children's books (particularly for this age group) are today.My 9 year old son had gotten bored with Goosebumps and the like, and he was really ready to move on. From the first page in this book he was saying, &quot;Mom, this is really funny!&quot;The first chapter was a bit slow, I thought, but the story really picked up after that. I finished this book myself and went right out to buy #2 in the series. I can recommend this one for any child -- or adult -- who who likes imaginative, funny stories, and doesn't mind a bit of the absurd."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm twenty-seven and I've loved reading great stories for as along as I can remember. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is something that I would have loved to have read as a kid, and something that I love reading now. I just finished this first book and look forward to reading the later books in the series.The story and characters are quirky and interesting. I found the plot of this first book very reminiscent of one of my favorite movies, Star Wars. Think of Harry Potter as Luke Skywalker, raised by his aunt and uncle, unaware of his true potential until the right circumstances invite him to take a step into a larger world.This desire to make more of ourselves and to come in full contact with the magic that we intuitively sense around us is universal to all human beings. It's no wonder that this book and these characters have become so immensely popular.

Once you have read them you will want to know everything that happens to the lovable Harry, and his friends Ron and Hermione. The author is gifted with words, and has you seeing the Hogwarts School of Wizardry in your minds eye. Run, do not walk to get this book!

Mind you, I am 18 years old. I thought Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was excellent. There shouldn't be an age limit to this great read.

To be suddenly recognized and appreciated and forget about the harsh reality."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think that it is a sad sad thing that people are trying to censor this book. I have heard that it contains evil things such as witchcraft and that it was violent and awful book. It was said to teach children witchcraft and sorcery and I find that to be pure BS (bullsnot). The Harry Potter books teach a child only one thing and that is to use his or her imagination, and when that becomes something to be censored I will be ready to move to Antartica. I believe that the Harry Potter book is something to be treasured for the fact that it challenges a child to look at things from their point of view, something that they need to do more often. I believe that these are wonderful books. And if they are to be pulled from the shelves you best keep pulling because I have seen plenty of books that are better candidates for cenorship than these."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, by J.K. Rowling, is anexcellent book even my seventh grade friends read this book! Theythink it's exciting, and so do I. I gave this book a five out of five on my scale because it has adventure, like when he goes on the quidditch team when no first year is allowed to; he gets an excellent broom to fly on it with and a package guarded by a three-headed dog. Harry and Ron, his best friend, get into a lot of mischief, especially with Malfoy and his gang. Harry thinks that Hogwarts is a lot better than the Dursley's.

I finally gave in when the hundredth friend of mine raved about how great this book is. Well, I read it, and for the most part, and could see how kids would really enjoy the fantasy and the plot line (such as it is), but I can't understand why adults love this book so much. The characters were relatively two-dimensional, and almost no background is given for any character besides Harry Potter, so I find it difficult to connect with any of them. It was relatively easy to tell the good guys from the bad guys, with many of the \\"bad\\" characters being reduced to stereotypes (ala Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle).Plot-wise, the story uses some relatively simple gimmicks (straw-man, etc) and seems to have a 30 minute sitcom type of pace (problem, solution, on to the next problem). Great for kids, but I expected something more.Overall, great book for kids, but adults should try something with a little more substance to it. Harry Potter is more of a dessert than a meal. Sweet, but with little substance."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Okay, let me start by saying I am a Christian and I absolutely hate reading (would rather do anything else but that). I probably would never have picked up the book except for the fact that I kept hearing all these &quot;religous&quot; people condoning a book because it deals with magic (oops, a word I'm not suppose to say as a Christian). So, I couldn't help but pick up the book and read it for myself; what I found was SHOCKING!For the first time in my life, I didn't want to watch TV, I didn't want to go online, I wanted to sit there and keep reading and seeing what would happen next. NO book I've EVER read has ever held my interest so much. I found myself glued to a book!This book does deal with magic, but it DOES NOT deal with Satanism at all. Though some people may lead you to believe this book will cause the downfall of an entire generation, I'm here to tell you that it's a wonderful work of fiction, coming directly out of Ms. Rowling's own imagination. This is a great book, with an excellent story and wonderful characters; a book for the ages, not a &quot;how-to&quot; guide to Satanism (as some people might lead you to believe!)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Firstly, I would like to say that throughout this review I refer to the First Harry Potter book as Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone (as opposed to the Sorcerer's Stone), as this was it's original title in Britain, and being English, the name it is known by to me. I am proud to be one of the few people who actually read Harry Potter back in 1997, after it's first release, before it became such a legendary book. The Philosopher's Stone is a fantastic work of modern fiction, and unllike many modern children's books, I feel it was truly written without the intend of adult reading. However, it's wonderful and believable fictitous world has appealed to all ages across the globe, rapidly making it one of the most popular novels of all time. As the first in the series, it can be excused that it perhaps lacks some of the plot complexity and imaginative witty writing more present in the later stories. However, the book, as nearly everyone knows is almost impossible to put down, as the many letters at the back of some eiditons of the second book show.However, despite such remarkable wiritng talent, I have to feel that the hype around the Harry Potter phenomenon may have finally gone a little too far. Without doubt the Phiolosopher's Stone is a remarkable novel, but is it really as great as the originaal fantasy creations of Tolkein or the more modern Philip Pullman series. While I feel that few children nowadays would prefer the Hobbit or Lord of the RIngs to Harry Potter, I still feel that the books themselves where more outstanding and original works of fiction than the Philosopher's Stone or it's companions. WHile slightly slow and tedious by today's statndards, the Tolkein novels have become the basis for almost every fantasy story creation of the latter half of the twentieth Century. Even Rowling, while perhaps unwittingly, has used many of his creations.But perhaps this is one of the great triumphs of Rowling's novels, the ability to draw together creatures and elements from all the fantasy and mythologixal creations in human history and compile them with our universe to create a depth and believability that even Tolkein somehow lacks.To the book itself, the Philosopher's stone has the difficult task over the sequels of explaining the wholw Harry Potter world to the reader. However, Rowling takes as little time as possible on this, with new discoveries about the world of Magic in each of the other books, so more space can be concentrated on the story line. This is good, and not too simplistic, with unusually well defined and styalised characters which spark off true emotion.Unfortunately, I feel that the true threat of Voldemort and dark magic lacks some of the weight which Rowling manages to convery in the Goblet of Fire, and I did worrry a little about a George Lucas influence, with the dangers of Dark Magic and temptations from the 'Dark Side'. Rowling, however, manages to steer clear of copying anyone, really, in her story, and while few of the creatures have never been used before, they are brought into new realism by Rowling's writing.I was particularly inpressed by Rowling's ovious knowledge of latin and ancient word construction, which she uses heavily and inspiringly to create fantastic names for objects and words for spells.Certainly, if anyone hasn't read this book they should have."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After seeing what a furor the 4th book caused in the media I decided to see what all the fuss was about. I, personally, don't see what the big appeal of these books is...but, then again, I'm not 10 years old. I have to agree with the reviewer that wrote &quot;if a so many people think that this is really a great book it is a very, very sad statement on the state of children's education and culture not only in the U.K. but in the industrialised countries worldwide.&quot; It certainly isn't a classic and isn't even near to being so. But I won't complain about it if it gets kids excited about reading. Apparently it has done this. I've only read the 1st book in the series and am awaiting the other three in the mail so these comments are only directed at the very first book:I found it a bit boring at times, but it all came together nicely at the end and I am looking forward to reading the next book. As an elementary school teacher, I would've liked to see a character that had more regard for following rules than Harry does. Everything in the book has been done many times before. We have the &quot;orphan&quot; who was taken in by relatives who didn't want him and neglect him. They have a spoiled-rotten son who gets everything he wants and Harry gets the left-overs...and the cousin generally makes life miserable for Harry. How many times has that been done before in books and movies? Then we have the typical boarding school scene where we have the &quot;snooty big-man-on-campus&quot; who wins at everything and makes fun of the underdogs--with his requisite lunk-head followers. The main character ends up with a motley group of friends who end up &quot;saving the day&quot; in the end. I could make a list of movies and books that have been done around that theme. Hardly anything is new except that this time it has magic in it.I am a Christian parent and didn't see anything in the book that Christian parents need to fear--which has been alluded to in other reviews. I was (and still am) fascinated with stories about magic, and I didn't turn out evil (thank you very much).There are a couple of scenes toward the end of the book that are a bit scary and disturbing for young readers. I had been thinking about reading it to my 2nd graders until I got to those parts. I believe I'd have some angry parents on my hands should I read it aloud to my students. Some children may not be bothered by such things, but I do know that some are.The writing could be a lot better. It gets tedious to read after a while and is not entirely grammatically correct. One should never say &quot;try and&quot;. You do not &quot;try and&quot; do anything. That indicates doing two things. Such as if someone tries AND kills Harry--doesn't that say that he DID kill Harry? It's &quot;try TO&quot;. I hope this is corrected in the next few books. But that's just a pet-peeve of mine.All in all, it's not a bad book, but it's not GREAT, either."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The first Harry Potter is a good book, imaginative and creative. I can see why kids who normally don't like to read enjoy this. However, I'm surprised to hear advanced readers, especially teens and adults, raving about this. I would think they'd enjoy something with more insight and emotional core."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I first heard about these books a few weeks ago on the news, then proceeded to check out Amazon.com...with almost 2000 reviews, this has got to be a good book, so I bought it...it's not good, it's VERY good! It's very consistent and never takes a boring downward spiral...and I'm not even finished! Then come the reviews, which is the deciding point between customers buying it or not. I heard the good reviews and the bad...the bad reviews are probably made by prudish people who want nothing but peace...I can't agree more for peace, but it's never gonna be exactly like you want it. I'm pretty sure kids won't take it that far and try witchcraft, because most likely, it won't work. But that's beside the point. Anyone who wants to read an interesting book should pick this up...I'm sure the other 2 in the series are good, too."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As the Pottermanian opinion holds sway in most quarters, with even the Financial Times favourable in the UK, I have to ask myself: \`who am I to rain on the parade'? Well I have mixed feelings about it all, so I hope I can make a good job of explaining my two out of five mark.I like the traditional downtrodden-boy-hero-triumphs plot with a twist in the end, and there is originality aplenty in the detail. The pace of the story keeps the action alive, and the curious menagerie of characters is introduced at the right speed, and with great variety. I had at least one laugh-out-loud moment with the regular flashes of wit in the dialogue. There are one or two humorous allusions to Greek myth that may only be picked up by older readers, and much incidental fun with words. (My favourite being the mythical London street \`Diagon Alley' - you have to say it out loud to get it.) Encouraging reading in young people is an unquestioned benefit, as is a practical example of the use of a library for research. And I had my vocabulary expanded with the word \`bezoar' (useful to goat keepers, as I was once). But how does this add up to a forty-percent mark?Unfortunately, I find that there is not a single loveable character in the book. Harry is as ordinary as can be, and as wooden a character as poor little Pinochio. The same can be said for his school friends and favourite teachers. There is little about them that children could be safely encouraged to copy. Their descriptions merely say that they are brave, noble, redoubtable, and so on, but the writing fails to actually convince by what they say and how they act. Rowling is only one of a long line of authors who fails to convince when portraying good characters, or the good that they do. It is as if she does not really like the good guys, and her heart is not in them. In a book of heroes and villains this is a serious failing. Perhaps Hagrid, the well-intentioned gentle giant, comes closest to being a sympathetic character, struggling with his stigmas, and surviving, if not overcoming the odds.As to the villains, evil is easy to do, and they are actually more realistic than the heroes when they avoid falling into pantomime postures. The demented cackle of the moustache-twirling, cape-swirling rotter echoes through their petty speeches with a monotony relieved only by the timeliness of their come-uppances. While I am on the subject of weak caricatures I cannot avoid the bizarre Muggles (ordinary non-magical folk). Harry's adoptive family members are not too unpleasant to believe, but they are too stupid. Mr Dursley, hardheaded business manager that he is, trying to knock in a nail with a fruit cake? I just can't swallow it. And then there is Hagrid, the eleven foot giant (see p. 16) who manages to take Harry shopping in the capital city, via train, underground, the streets of London, and a burger joint, attracting stares wherever he goes (see p. 52), and no-one gets a picture and makes headlines? Perhaps all the live TV crews were out at fires, and took all the photo-journalists - but all the tourists were sleepwalking, and the all security cameras were offline too? A quick look at the unofficial HP websites will interpret the other minor Potter contradictions as loveable foibles for us, but we should not be required to take our brains out while reading fiction, only to suspend disbelief.There is an air of irrationality about the whole book. Why are all pupils forbidden to go into the forest: because it is full of dangerous beasts. So, why are eleven-year old boys sent as a punishment for breaking a minor school rule into the forest at midnight to see what is killing all the unicorns? The whole book rests on magic - if you enjoy Tolkien and CS Lewis you might enjoy this book - but just making everything magic and expecting that to explain away every objection is sloppy thinking and writing.Lastly, and worst of all I feel, there is an undercurrent of nastiness throughout, affecting the whole book. Parents might not want the more sensitive child reading the blood-drinking episode. And there is a definite hate theme in there. Hate is the commonest emotion expressed. Before I read this book I was told that Harry is saved by love. This is a common defence given out by Potter apologists. However, the characters are always declaring their hate for one another. A quick count of hates reveals that \`hate' occurs seventeen times throughout the book. The one \`love' passage gives the book a total of four loves in those five lines. Exspellopottybarmus! (Spell for turning poorish storybooks into good ones.)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I REALLY disagree with three opinions about this book:1) It's EVIL. It should be DESTROYED.2) It's one of the best books for children and adults, because it teaches so much and it's so exciting and interesting.3) IT'S THE BEST BOOK IN THE WORLD! MOMMY, GO BUY ME ALL THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS! RIGHT NOW! WHY DON'T THEY MAKE HARRY POTTER ACTION FIGURES? THIS BOOK IS SOOOO GOOD! NO BOOK COULD EVER BE BETTER!I think Harry Potter is an okay book (series). It's sort of fun to read, but it's not that great. I definitely don't think it's like devil worshipping or something. It's just fantasy. It's no different from millions of other fantasies. Little kids aren't going to become evil by reading this book. What do you think they should read, if this is evil? Fairy tales that kids have been reading and hearing for thousands of years are full of magic and people killing each other. Even stories with &quot;morals&quot; that kids are supposed to read have magic and even things like murder. Harry Potter is harmless, even compared to a lot of things that kids are encouraged to read. Do you know any kid who's run out and become a devil worshipper because of Harry Potter? If you do, then please email me and tell me about it.I also don't think Harry Potter is such a good book for children and adults. I mean, it's fun to read, but so many books are better. I saw a review somewhere that said that Harry Potter was a good book for adults because it shows that people who are different can be treated cruelly, like Harry was with the Dursleys. What an amazing concept. I'm sure no one knew that people can be cruel to people who are different, until Harry Potter came along. People know about cruelty already, the question is just whether they try to stop it or not. And I don't think Harry Potter deserves all its popularity. It's okay, but look at so many other books and authors: the Redwall books, Roald Dahl books, Madeleine L'Engle books, and The Golden Compass are just a few of the fantasy books for kids (some are for adults too, at least I think so even though I don't know - I'm twelve) that are much better, more exciting, and more interesting than Harry Potter.I think the coolest thing about Harry Potter is that the author was a single mother who was almost starving and now, because of that book, she's so rich. I really admire her, even if I don't like her books so much."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, J. K. Rowling introduces the reader to the fantastical world that has gripped the world in the last few years. This book is the first of seven planned books, so it sets the tone for the entire series. However, what exactly is the tone of the series? This is a very important question to ask, but to address this fully would be outside the scope of this paper. Instead, this paper will focus on Rowling's own addressing of class issues.The series is laid out in the guise of a traditional bildungsroman, with the protagonist becoming a man after many trials and tribulations of boyhood. Each of the novels let the reader in on one year in the history of Harry Potter's growth from the uncertain boy that we meet in the exposition to his growth, presumably to becoming one of the most powerful wizards in the history of witchcraft (Park 180).This particular book is important, as said before, because it presents the exposition of the entire series, and lays out much of the required background that a reader needs to know before delving into a highly intricate other world. The main plot of this book is the search for the \\"Sorcerer's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal\\" (Rowling 273). It is telling that Rowling choose this as the main plot of this book, as the search and the adventure is based on a mythical substance that the medieval alchemist searched for in vain. In this world, the Sorcerer's (i.e. Philosopher's) Stone had been created, and the evil sorcerer Voldemort hopes to attain the Stone to bring himself back to life, and to make himself rich and powerful. A weak-willed teacher at Hogwarts, Professor Quirrell, aids him in this questIt is interesting that the acquisition of the stone is associated with greed and the dark, evil side of the childish dichotomy. In the short biography in the back of the mass-market paperback version of the book, Rowling's own life is granted a somewhat fairytale aspect (Park 179). The reader is told in the back of the book:J. K. Rowling was a struggling single mother when she wrote the beginnings of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone on scraps of paper at the local caf&eacute;. But her efforts soon paid off as she received an unprecedented award from the Scottish Arts Council enabling her to finish the book. Since then, the debut novel has become an international publishing phenomenon. (385)This version of the story has been romanticized and passed along into the public's consciousness, but one commentator call's Rowling's actual biography one that is \\"solidly middle class\\" (Park 182). Media outlets have tended to romanticize her receiving public assistance and reinforce the Cinderella myth that surrounds the author. They like the point that Rowling was a struggling single mother, but fail to point out that the child was conceived during a short-lived marriage that had it genesis while Rowling was teaching English in Portugal. In addition, prior to receiving public assistance, Rowling worked other jobs with such entities as the Manchester Chamber of Commerce and the international NGO Amnesty International (Park 182). This knowledge informs the reading of the book when exploring Rowling's treatment of class lines. Although she has attained tremendous wealth since the Harry Potter phenomenon took off, the reader is introduced to the \\"struggling single mother\\" in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, and her sympathies along class divisions are rather clear. J. K. Rowling is a champion of the middle class.Many characters and their attributes from the novel can be used to illustrate this argument, but it is most logical to commence at the first page. \\"Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.\\" (Rowling 1). With this sentence, Rowling introduces the reader to the text that is Sorcerer's Stone and the series in general. This sentence and the depictions of the Dursley's that follow make one wonder what Rowling views as normal. One could argue that this is irony, or one could say that this is Rowling's lamentable view about state of today's middle class. Mr. Dursley works as the head of a drill company, a position that to the reader's knowledge, he had holds for at least ten years, from the very beginning where we are introduced to him to the time that Harry is eleven.The Dursley's are an interesting set of characters to be introduced to, as they are the reader's only in-depth experience in this book with non-magical \\"Muggles.\\" That they are presented as \\"normal\\" introduces an interesting aspect of Rowling's social vision. The Dursley's are unsympathetic to the extreme (Ostry 93), written in the vein of children's literature creating a dichotomy between the good character of Harry and their own bad characteristics. Not only are they border line abusive with their own nephew, they deny him almost any material possessions (Park 187), to the point where when Harry is granted to move out from under the stairs to Dudley's second bedroom, he needs only one trip to carry all that he owns (Rowling 46).This is set in sharp contrast to the fact that when Harry moves all his stuff to the bedroom, which was once Dudley's rather large closet, he notices that the only things in the room are the broken relics of Dudley's own materialistic ways. The new room houses a busted television set, a bent air rifle, and a video camera whose novelty had worn away in a shorter time than a month (Rowling 46). This is a highly note-worthy fact because the reader had been entertained by Dudley's own tantrum on his birthday lamenting the fact that for this birthday he had only received thirty-six presents, and he is quick to note \\"[t]hat's two less than last year\\" (Rowling 26). Dudley is not concerned not with the quality of presents, which comes across as extravagant by any means, nor is he concerned with the thought process which was involved in the buying of the gifts, he is instead only concerned with the quantity of the gifts that he receives.The reader knows \\"the Dursleys had everything they wanted,\\" (Rowling 1) but it can also be inferred that they are not entirely affluent. This is best seen in the fact that they live in some faceless suburbia, it could be in Richmond, or maybe on the outskirts of Kent, or any of the numerous inhabitable placed that feed the ennui of the thinking person who feels that the life they live should offer something more. The Dursley's do not have this affliction, and come across as perfectly happy, and would remain so, except for their bothersome nephew.When the reader crosses over to the magical realm, where the bulk of the action takes place, the Dursleys have their magical complement in the character of Draco Malfoy. In the fifth paragraph after meeting Draco, the reader is let in on Harry's impression the Draco reminds him of Dudley (Rowling 96). While this may come across as heavy-handed on Rowling's part, she immediately makes the character come across as unlikable. There are no ambiguities when it comes to these two antagonistic characters.Once inside the confines of Hogwarts, all the students seem to be on Equal footing. The issues of monetary wealth are swept aside from the debate and the dialogue except for characters Rowling has used to be the mouthpiece of antagonism, mainly Draco Malfoy. The only way riches are awarded inside Hogwarts is in the guise of House Points, and from that perspective, every house starts out on equal ground. They do not remain on equal ground, as there is created a large bias against Slytherin, who has won seven house cups in a row, and all the other non-Slytherin students are ready to see them unseated from their high horse. Malfoy personifies Slytherin, and the other houses fall under the name of Harry Potter, at least from the perspective that Rowling is writing.Rowling manages to have Malfoy make Harry feel stupid because of his own lack of knowledge of the wizarding social codes and ways, directly insult Hagrid, who Harry has an affinity for, and to question Harry's own lineage (99-100). Malfoy's character is rather stagnant throughout the narrative. He does not seem to grow or change in response to the affairs of the novel. Malfoy's presence throughout the novel is always aggressive in some way: he is stealing Neville's Rememberall (Rowling 179), challenging Harry to a wizard's duel (Rowling 190), or throwing around curses on his schoolmates (Rowling 270). Aside from such schoolboy taunts that seem perpetuate in all eras in some form, Malfoy had a deeper class antagonism. He is nothing special except for his lineage, and he is more than happy to show off these trapping of being a child of privilege. We see \\"Malfoy's eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table\\" (Rowling 179). Not only is it telling that he opens his treats \\"gloatingly,\\" but he is in possession of an eagle owl, which the reader was not introduced to at Eeylops Owl Emporium (Rowling 101). It does not take the reader much knowledge of avian species to know eagles have a connection with grandeur and beauty, and Rowling takes advantage of this connotation. From this line, and other like it, we learn of Malfoy's own status as an inhabitant of the upper classes. The reader is able to gather the roots of Malfoy's own class antagonism that is illustrated in the scene at the Quiddich match:\\"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\\" said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. \\"Its people they feel sorry for. See, there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the Weasleys who've got no money--you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no brains.\\" (277).If from the beginning he is just antagonistic, by this point of the book, the reader is cheering for his downfall at some point. Malfoy receives his comeuppance when the main characters are caught roaming the castle after the release of Norbert, Hagrid's dragon. When he is caught and sentenced to detention, he thinks that he will be copying lines, but is shocked to learn that instead of this rote and manual task, that the party will be roaming into the forest. Malfoy complains that such work is \\"servant stuff,\\" and initially rejects the idea (Park 184), until he is reminded that he erred, and that to partake on servant activity is far better than to be expelled from Hogwarts (Rowling 311). With this episode, the reader smiles, as the antagonistic member of the upper class finally receives what's coming to him, even though the punishment is shared by the \\"good\\" protagonistPerhaps this antagonism is rooted in Draco's jealousy of Harry, who despite not being of the best family and lineage was obviously the more gifted wizard. While that argument may have some valid roots, the character in this novel is too flat to draw many conclusions about the character's motivations. He is placed as a foil to lend credence to the more sympathetic characters of Hagrid, Ron, Hermione, and Harry.The character of Hagrid, the Hogwarts groundskeeper, contrasts Draco's own upper class consciousness. Rowling sets Hagrid off as lower class from his own first introduction. In fact, even before the reader meets the character, his own reliability is drawn into question by Professor McGonagall (Rowling 17). This, one would assume is in reference to Hagrid's own lower class propensity to drink. In this book alone, there are eleven different references to Hagrid's drinking, and it can be assumed that there is more drinking going on, to the point that he has a \\"usual\\" drink at the Leaky Cauldron (Rowling 85). The only other character that is seen in context with alcohol is Harry's Uncle Vernon, who needs a large brandy after being so exasperated with Harry (Rowling 36). This point is reinforced repeatedly, beginning with Harry's own first meeting with Hagrid: \\"\\"What about that tea then, eh?\\" he said, rubbing his hands together. \\"I'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind\\"\\" (Rowling 39).The previous quotation is also a good example of another marking of Hagrid's lower class status: his non-grammatical speech. All the other characters at Hogwarts speak the language fairly well, and Hagrid's dialect is noticeable. This may be attributed to the fact the Hagrid had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year (Rowling 74), but it still does not explain how Hagrid was able to last those three years, when we learn early on that Hagrid can not spell the word \\"Voldemort\\" for Harry when he was learning about his past (Rowling 68).Rowling uses many other devices to set Hagrid off as \\"other.\\" The first of these is that \\"He [is] almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide\\" (Rowling 18). His size is important as he towers over everyone at Hogwarts and could easily cause them physical harm if he so wanted to, but his kindness is overwhelming (Rowling 108). The kindness could easily be mistaken for a feminine emotion, as it has been implied. He has other \\"feminine\\" traits as well, which humanize him (Natov 317), mostly seen where this large man is reduced to tears at the beginning (Rowling 19) and the end of the book (Rowling 377). He is the only male character that is represented as crying in the book, even those who are physically harmed do not cry, but Hagrid's emotions get the best of him.The final lowering class marker of Hagrid is that he is forced to live in a cabin down by the woods. This house has only one room, an open fireplace, and foodstuffs hanging from the rafters (Rowling 174). This is set in stark contrast to the opulence of Hogwarts, where the students eat off gold plates and live in a well-appointed castle (Ostry 91).Hagrid's status as lower class sets him up for some failings. His drinking leads him to give away the secret to getting past the three-headed dog, Fluffy (Rowling 289). His drinking is also the centerpiece of the Norbert affair, where he attains the dragon egg at a game of cards. He may not be able to be trusted, as insinuated by McGonagall in the very beginning (Rowling 17), but his own failings as a member of the lower class do advance the plot. However, his lower class markers do make him a more sympathetic character (Park 186). He may be a bumbling fool at times, but he is the first character to befriend Harry, and takes Harry through the rituals of shopping for clothes and equipment that are needed for school. With such a kind, fatherly, act, it is impossible for the reader to hate the character despite all his failings.More characters that are sympathetic fall on the other side of the coin as opposed to the Dursleys and Malfoy. While they are going through their own trials and tribulations, the reader is rooting for them. They have the common ground of coming from a different social stratum than do the characters that Rowling sets in opposition to them. Hermione Granger is the most ambiguous of the three friends that create the center of the novel. The reader learns that both her parents are dentist (Rowling 246), but other than this information nothing more is learned of her life away from Hogwarts. It can be assumed that having both her parents in the medical field would provide Hermione with a high level of material comfort, but this is only an inference (Ostry 91). Being the lone female character Rowling presents in any depth gives Hermione the luxury to stand out in a class by herself. It is obvious, however, that she feels that she has something to prove (Natov 317). This is most possibly motivated by her status as an outsider, both as a female and as the child of Muggles. It speaks volumes that Hermione has already memorized all the course texts for the entire class year (Rowling 132), something that neither Ron nor Harry even thought about doing.Ron Weasley is a far more interesting character when it comes to exploring class issues. Rowling makes a point of illustrating that his family is not well to do. There are numerous instances exemplifying this fact. In fact, when we first meet Ron, we learn that not only that he has five brothers attend Hogwarts before he did, but also that \\"[y]ou never get anything new, with five brothers. [He's] got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat\\" (Rowling 124). The Weasleys have not allowed this to stop them from succeeding at Hogwarts. All of Ron's brothers have achieved some level of success, and throughout the novel, Ron attains his own, even though he says that even if he does anything good, its no big deal because its been done before (Rowling 124).Ron's success or failure does not seem to come from the fact that he is from an impoverished family. Rowling stresses this point many times throughout the novel, mainly through the voice of Draco Malfoy, who is constantly antagonistic about the Weasley's class. Harry has an affinity with Ron from the very beginning, the moment they are introduced they both feel like outsiders (Ostry 91), again a fact that Malfoy points out later in the novel, although not directly to Harry. His own poverty seems a very superficial trait. He does not overcome in spite of his apparent handicap, nor does it hinder him from being able to play \\"the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen in many years\\" (Rowling 380). The scene near the end approaching the stone is the only place in Sorcerer's Stone, is the only place in the novel where he succeeds on his merits. The only other place that he overcomes adversity to show the true Gryffindor braveness is with the mountain troll on Halloween, but that was accidental, \\"cry[ing] the first spell that came into his head\\" (Rowling 218), is not the act of the brave, but the desperate.It is telling to note that in spite of their family's poverty, the Weasleys are drawn as the most caring, compassionate family group in the book. This is easy as they are the only such group other than the Dursleys the reader is allowed to see. The reader can draw a dichotomy with the Dursleys on one side of the divide and the Weasley's on the other, and pointing out where one lacks and the other shines. The children reading this will not make such a point-by-point assessment, but rather generalize the feelings overall. The most important scene in this divide is when Harry receives a sweater from the Weasleys. They do not have much to give, but give what they can for the poor young boy who was not expecting any presents. This is set in stark contrast to the present Harry receives from his own flesh and blood: a fifty pence piece (Rowling 248).Harry has his own place in Rowling's class divide. His place, in fact, is the most complicated. For the majority of his live he lived the life of a pauper. He never went wanting of the necessities in life, but he was mistreated and never was made party to the material wealth that was lavished upon Dudley in the Dursley household. He is stuck solidly in the middle where Rowling herself once was. He is not truly wanting, but he is treated markedly different from Dudley. This leads Natov to characterize him as the every child (311). His state can be sympathetic to almost all the readers of the book, no matter what side of the socioeconomic divide they fall on, because he has the manifest traits of an outsider, just like most juveniles feel. This is illustrated in his Christmas present from the Dursleys at Hogwarts, and the passing reference that is made about Harry's tenth birthday, where he received \\"a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks\\" (Rowling 53). It can be assumed that in the Muggle world, Harry is going to remain without the lavish trapping of life, as his horde of gold and silver in the Gringotts is in the currency of the wizarding world (Rowling 93). The reader knows nothing of the exchange rate from Galleons to Pounds, thus Harry will remain the \\"perfect child of the middle class\\" (Park 187), which he was at the outset.Although Harry has suffered the indignity of relative poverty all his life, the newfound riches do not spoil him. Even though he is in possession of more money than he could ever have imagined, he does not hoard the fortune, and allows Hagrid to take out a small handful, that should last him a couple of terms (Rowling 94). This fact is illustrated on the Hogwarts express, Harry is faces with the prospect of the treat cart, but finds nothing familiar. Instead of balking at the newfound foods, he buys some of everything. This would be notable in itself if he were to hog all the candy for himself. This hogging might be expected of any normal boy of eleven, but Harry has a deeper goodness; he allows Ron to partake in his bounty (Park 181). Rowling explains this as the fact that \\"[Harry] had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with\\" (Rowling 127).Harry's inner goodness shines through at the end. He is in pursuit of the professor that has gone to the dark side, so to say, who has supplicated himself to the will of the dark wizard Voldemort. Although this trope is found all over science fiction and fantasy, Rowling uses it well (Ostry 89). She is able to subvert the reader's expectation to find Snape staring at the Mirror of Erised, and instead there is much shock when instead Quirrell is found. What ensues is not the valiant struggle that was anticipated, but is a short scuffle. It ends with Harry in possession of the Sorcerer's Stone, and Quirrell and Voldemort presumably expelled to some place other than Hogwarts.We learn that Harry was able to procure the stone because \\"You see, only one who wanted to find the stone--find it, but not use it--would be able to get it, otherwise, they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life\\" (Rowling 375). This is an important point to make, because it shows that Harry was more interested in doing well by himself, his house, and his school than he was to attain the stone for selfish reasons. He could easily have used this mythical object to his own ends had he so desired, but he could not have attained the stone if he had that desire. In the end, his righteous light won over the powers of greed and evil. This is perhaps the most important theme that Rowling expounds over the course of this novel. It is enough to find the treasure; there is no need to want to use it.It would be a fallacy to say that Rowling's social vision is entirely cut and dried. There are several instances where the class boundaries are seen, and the characters want to move past them or at least express a desire to do so. The first example is Harry shopping in Diagon Alley. Hagrid and Harry are out shopping, and Harry wants to buy a solid gold cauldron (Rowling 100). He is stopped in this by Hagrid's insistence that his list insist only pewter. The second example comes from the scene at Christmas, where Harry is unwrapping presents. The first couple of presents are rather mundane, but then he unwraps his new Cloak of Invisibility. This garment enthralls him, and so is Ron. Ron covets the garment, saying that he would do anything for such a cloak like that (Rowling 250). The final instance is Hagrid's desire for a dragon. He knows that he cannot keep one, no matter how hard he tries to hide it, but he covets one so bad that he is willing to endanger the fate of the wizarding world by giving away the only thing valuable he has, the secret to stopping fluffy (Rowling 289).Despite these small discrepancies, there is an illustrated bias in Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone that shines through with regard to her treatment of the characters that fall on all ends of the class spectrum. Those that fall at the ends of the class scale have their strengths and weaknesses, but it is those who occupy the middle ground that are drawn in the most compassionate light. These sympathetic characters champion the views that Rowling inherently brings into her work, the view that money is not everything, or even what it seems to be. Anxious readers the world over await the conclusion to this series, waiting with baited breath over what will be the eventual end to the characters they have grown to love, and loathe.BibliographyAnatol, Giselle Liza. \\"The Fallen Empire: Exploring Ethnic Otherness in the World of Harry Potter.\\" Reading Harry Potter: Critical Essays.

I had a few unhealthy superficial tendencies against a book about some loser-like kid and his magical land.

RowlingReviewed by: R.ParekhPeriod: 6There is a boy named Harry Potter who lives with his aunt and uncle. His Aunt and Uncle hate him so much. He gets yelled at a lot and has to do a lot of work. One day a giant named Hagrid comes to give Harry a letter to invite him to go to Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry. He then finds out that his parents were wizards. His Aunt and Uncle told him they died in a car accident, but they were really killed by an evil wizard named Voldemort. So he goes to Hogwarts and goes in the Gryffindor group. He meets Ron and Hermione, and they are Harry's best friends. They are trying to find out what Voldemort is looking for. They go pass a three headed dog, through devil snares, a bunch of flying keys that you have to catch to open the door, a real chess game, and finally in a room with a mirror. There they find Professor Quirrel who takes out his turban, which reveals a weak Voldemort. Voldemort asks Harry to look in the mirror and tell him what he sees. Harry saw him holding the Sorcerer Stone. Quirrel tries to take it but when Harry touched him he started to burn. He died but Voldemort soul comes out and goes right through Harry. The Sorcerer Stone makes whoever holding it immortal, Harry was holding it so he didn't die. The year was over in Hogwarts and he went back to his Aunt and Uncle's house.I liked this story because I was always glued to the book. Everything was interesting like when Quirrel took off his turban and you find Voldemort (the scariest name to say in the story) in the back of his head's.\\" Harry would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrel's head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostril, like a snake.\\" It was interesting to read this passage.Another quote that was interesting to me was this one: \\"Yes...\\" said Ron softly, \\"it's the only way... I've got to be taken.\\" These two quotes lead to something big in this story.My favorite part of this story is when Harry finally meets Quirrel and Voldemort next to the Mirror of Erised. Harry was told to look into it and tell Quirrel what he saw. Harry lied, but Voldemort who was behind Quirrel turban the whole time knew he lied. A battle broke between Harry and Quirrel. When Harry touched him he burned and died. But Voldemort's soul comes out and looks like killed Harry. I like this part because the mystery in the story is solved and you know who lived and died.

Late in 2002, I ordered \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" off Amazon just to see what all the buzz was about.I had a broken foot at the time, so I had some free time on my hands. I literally read this book cover to cover in nine hours. I could NOT put it down. This book is so well written, that the young and young at heart will enjoy it emmencely. JK Rowling can write in the voice of a child and the voices of adults. She captures the essence of a child in the voices of her main characters, Harry, Hermione and Ron but can still write menacing characters like Professor Snape and Voldemort with the same pen... or perhaps it's a quill.I would recommend this book to all elementary school children and all adults who love good literature.

Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone (aka Harry Potter And The Sorceror's Stone) may have been the reading world's most valuable entry in years because it started to reverse the decades-long erosion in book-readers - particularly among children - and in doing so has played a role in seeing to it that novels and other written works continue to have a healthy future in the digital world. Beyond all that, though, it's just a tremendously valuable book for a simpler reason - it's a great story well-told, with great ideas and some of the most memorable characters you're ever likely to read about.The gist of the story is almost universally well-known by now. Harry Potter, an unhappy, parent-less, seemingly ordinary boy, living with relatives who really don't like him, suddenly finds out he's from a long line of wizards. Not only that, powerful magic flows through his own veins, he's already immensely famous in the hidden world of magic, and he's just been invited to attend Hogwart's School Of Witchcraft and Wizardry.The reason for his fame is that, in some way nobody understands, the infant Harry played a key role in the defeat of the Dark Lord, Voldemort - the most dangerous dark wizard of all time - on the very night his parents died years ago. But now at Hogwarts, with friends and a hopeful future for the first time in his life, Harry finds that not all the danger has disappeared from the magical world. Although this first volume is a relatively short novel, it marks the beginning of a huge-scale cycle of fantasy, adventure and discovery.If any newcomers to the series are wondering whether they should go for the Potter books or the Potter movies, the answer is simple: go for both. The two enhance each other greatly - the books, as good as they are on their own, are even better after seeing the movies, and the opposite holds true: if you see the movie first and then read the book, you'll likely enjoy the movie even more the second time around. You get huge insight into not only the characters but into the overall magical world, and a host of small but enriching details that didn't make it into the films. A lot of the omissions are because the missing aspects are embedded right into the writing of the books themselves. Take, for example, this excerpt from early in the book, describing some of the reactions by Harry's uncle Vernon to some of his first encounters with the bizarre: \\"...He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination.\\" Perfect. And that kind of dry wit is throughout the book, and sometimes there just isn't an opportunity to transfer those specific moments to film. Likewise, the movies have enriched the books, in large part by the perfect cast which have truly made the roles their own. On re-reading this first volume, for example, if it's a scene between Harry, Ron and Hermione, I see and hear the characters as they look and sound played by Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. Not just those three, but the whole cast, and seeing and hearing the different expressions, mannerisms, and voices, livens up even the smallest scene.The books are whimsical and fun, but are as intricately plotted, rife with excellent characterization, and as long-lasting as anything outside of the 'Young Readers' section. In fact, if you're an adult reader, especially one who enjoys Fantasy (Tolkein, Robert Jordan, William Horwood, etc.) and related fields, but still avoids the Young Readers section of the bookstore, you're missing out on a good chunk of the best in the field.The Harry Potter books aren't really children's books, they're All Ages books. Because to call them children's books would imply that few people over twelve or so would likely enjoy them, and that's just not the case as has been evidenced by millions of much older readers around the world. They're as fit for a ninety year-old as a nine year-old. Some critics have charged that the Potter series is too dark and scary for younger readers. That's not a problem with the early entries, although those elements are present. The later entries - in both the books and movies - do get darker and scarier: one of the most interesting aspects of the series is that it advances at the same rate as the main characters and their experiences. When they're eleven, the style is one way, with things seen very much through children's eyes; when they're sixteen and seventeen the 'feel' of the books has changed greatly. But still kept the key points that drew you in in the first place. Almost like a diary written over many years, from childhood on up (but never losing that spark of childhood, just like a person doesn't have to lose it even if they live to be a hundred). If you're wondering if they're too scary to read to a five year-old for their bedtime story - no, not the first ones. The latter ones - eh, start them out on the first couple and see how that goes. If they're not old enough right now for the latter installments, they will be before too many years, and you can enjoy the first ones together right now. Kids aren't the simpletons some people think they are.For myself, the addition of darker materials later on isn't a bad thing, but the relative abscence of those elements in The Philosopher's Stone isn't a bad thing either. They're just different, and they had to be that way to make the cycle fully realized throughout its evolving stages. This one is a delightful tale chock-full of adventure, imagination and mystery, and it introduces most of the saga's most famous characters - the central trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione; Hagrid, Professor Dumbledore, and so on. A truly must-read book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I had been looking for these CDs for a long time (here in Italy you can't find them).

Harry Potter thinks Snape the potions teacher doesn't like him but in the end Harry Potter finds out that Snape was trying to protect him,a lot of people thought Snape wanted Harry's team to lose. I saw the movie before I read the book, however I enjoyed the book better. The book has more details than the movie and tells Harry's story more in depth. I feel like I got to know the characters better after reading it.

From the beginning his family are so unbelievably cruel, I wanted to see him free of them. And then he's introduced to Hogwarts! It's more of a home to Harry than his \\"cupboard under the stairs\\".

It has everything a book could need. It is, of course, a fantasy book.

Even if you have seen all the movies 200 times, I'll still recommendthis book any day. Also, with this being the first book in the series, you have lots of magic to come!It's all i ever wanted... a cup of hot cocoa, while I'm lying on the couch with a good book in my hand, listening intently with open ears, just relaxing...So i rest my case.PS: BUY THIS AUDIO BOOK.

True, he's not living in an orphanage, but his uncle and aunt treat him horribly. He has to live in a closet and watch as his spoiled cousin gets everything he wants.All that changes one day when he starts getting mysterious letters. Every day, his uncle tries to destroy them, but more keep arriving. Finally, Harry learns the truth - he is a wizard and a relatively famous one for surviving the attack that killed his parents. Arriving at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry begins to make friends for the first time in his life.But all is not as it seems at the school. Harry begins to pick up little clues that evil is lurking somewhere in the building. And one of the professors seems to have it in for him. What is going on?Yes, I'm coming rather late to the party, but I can certainly see what all the talk is about. These are fun, escapist books. J. K. Rowling has written a book that can capture the imagination of kids of all ages. My complaint is the pace of the plot. The first half moves rather slowly as we are introduced to Harry's world. While that background is needed and fun, I was certainly ready for things to start moving forward by the second half. Fortunately, the second half picks up speed.This book will entertain the kid in anyone. I already have plans to enroll in the next year at Hogwarts."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Do you believe in magic? At Hogwarts you do. This is a fantastic, fictional book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. J.K. Rowling is the author. She has three main characters: Harry, Ron, and Hermione. All of these children go to a magical school, where they learn how to be a witch or wizard. J.K. Rowling made this book from a dream she had.This book makes me feel curious if there really is school like Hogwarts. I like this feeling because it always keeps me thinking. I also wonder why J.K. Rowling decided to make her dream into a book. Sometimes I wish I could have a dream like J.K. Rowling did. I just love feeling this way!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is an excellent begining to a wonderful series with the makings of a classic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Get the books and either the tapes or the CDs. Read them to your kids and nieces and nephews. The author eases the reader into an expanded vocabulary painlessly. I have stopped reading many times to explain a new word, only to find that the text shows the meaning of the word in the next couple of lines. We have read the books at campfires, in tents, at parks, over the phone and in motel rooms, listened to the tapes on long drives and on the way to school. We have been through the whole series several times, out loud and on tape. These books are so wonderful to share! We are glad that we read the books several times before we saw the movies. Our favorite book and movie is the Prisoner of Azkaban -- but don't read it first, read them in order. We were not into anything like this before the Sorcerer's Stone. What a wonderful gift J.K.

The main characters are Harry Potter and his friend's Hermione Granger and and Ron Weasley. I like this book for many reasons. I thought this book was a good way to iintroduce you to the other books. It all fits together. I love the storyline . I also like this book because every time I read it , it instills an image in my head, so as I am reading I could picture what's happening in the book. This is the reason I love the series and I await each new book. I also want to know what happens to Harry. She has the ability to write something and create an image in the reader's mind. An example of this in the first book is on page 112. \\"And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding acrfoss the lake, which was as smooth as ice. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.\\" As I read this I created an image in my head. I would recommend it to people who like fantasy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Few books have every touched my inner child. This first book most definately has. I read it after watching the movie and having a co-worker suggest that I sit and read the whole series. I enjoy the imagery which slips off the pages and can feel myself with the characters at each turn of the page.This is a story of joy and pain. Loss and gain. But most importantly, it's a story about growing up and feeling like a misfit only to find out that we are special. One only needs to read it to feel the magic that the author has, a magic that others call talent."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As someone in my mid 20's I'm almost surprised to find how much I truly enjoyed this book. I saw the movie and was so impressed with the story, I had to see for myself what was written in the book. Well lets just say I wasn't able to put it down from the moment I started reading it. If you think you know the story after seeing the wonderful movie, you don't realize how much you truly are missing out on.The story is pretty straight forward and develops nicely. Harry Potter a young boy with a lightning bolt scar on his head, lives with his aunt and uncle who despise him and don't even treat him as a human being most of the times. Harry for some reason has been known to do 'weird' things with no explanations all his live. One day though after his 11th birthday he recieves a letter telling him that he is a wizard. Now a whole new world has opened up for him. No longer does he have to live with his aunt and uncle and their greedy spoiled and chubby little son. He is rescued by Hagrid a gentle giant who enlightens him on a magical school named Hogwarts, where all the young children go to learn magic.Harry is no regular boy though as he will soon discover as he starts his new life away from his aunt and uncle and in the world of magic. Besides having to learn spells and potions and making new friends, every move he takes seems to lead to another adventure, narrowly escaping danger and trouble from the teachers and bully who would love nothing more then to see the great Harry Potter shown up. J.K. Rowling writes a brillient and well thoughtout book to start off the series. Not only do they give us enough information to lead the reader into understanding what is going on but it is all continuously building on much more that will be used later on in the story. Everything just seems to click together nicely and what seems quite obvious turns into not at all as we had suspected.I can't say enough how enjoyable this book is. I already can't wait to read the next one and believe me when I tell you this, this is no kids book. This book truly is something that anyone can enjoy and get into. It has a deep story, good characters, lots of fun moments and everything ties together wonderfuly. We go from a boy who is abused and has nothing to a hero who shows no fear when he has to face his biggest moments of courage. I don't want to give away too much as even the movie leaves out a lot of things that you will find very interesting in the book and it may even help you to make sense of things in the movie that may have confused you. You won't be sorry adding this book to your collection, it's a magical world to enter and one you won't want to leave any time soon."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The first book in this series is a refreshing splash of positive thinking. The themes of magical regions beyond our limited senses, of never giving up, and of exploring ourselves and our future, are very strong, sometimes overwhelming the logic of real space and time, while sometimes seeming to crush the logic of the very plot itself.Everything is here - dangerous dragons, invisiblitiy cloaks, owls, flying brooms, bubbling cauldrons, magic potions, ghosts, evil family members and lost parents.This is the candy, the pop corn, the comfort food of the mind. Good for children and adults alike, it is something you just pick up, sit down and read in front of a warm fire, while drinking tea and stroking the cat in your lap. The characters are as bright as falling stars, the action swift as a roaring river and the words as delightful to the tongue as cotton candy.This is only the FIRST course in a meal that J.K. Rowling is still setting out for the readers, her guests to her lovely party, and the lightest of the fare. The books will become heavier, darker, more filling as you go along, but with this one just enjoy it. THIS is the salad - light, designed to prepare your palate for the rest of the meal.ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Cheap Cheap price. Best way to buy books.

It was in the middle of the First Great Flood of Hype in the late nineties and everyone from your five-year-old niece to your postman was reading it with inexplicable fervour. It was the Fifty Shades of Grey of its day. Er... sort of.I remember immediately being bored by it, and I remember thinking, even then, that it was poorly written. But what would a fourteen-year-old have known about prose? I came back to this book recently, and it seemed quite different from the text I recalled. Not only was the wording subtly altered, but it was full of Americanisms. Now, I don't have a problem with American slang or spelling, actually I kinda (see what I did there?) like it. But it just seemed to jar with what was supposed to be a distinctly British book. Trash can lids? Regular? Wut? Did the publishers think that American readers would not be able to understand Britishisms (Philosopher - Sorcerer?)? I don't know what possessed them to do that. Would you translate Charles Dickens' books into American English? No.Just so that you can be as annoyed about this as I was, I'm going to include alternative (alternate) spellings in the rest of this review.Anyway, back to the style of the writing. The edited version I have here isn't too bad, to be fair. It doesn't have the long, rambling and contorted style of Dan Brown, and it's not quite as irritatingly brainless as E.L. James. But... it is... pedestrian. There are a great many (a whole bunch of) adverbs and verbs that are unnecessary. Yes, it's a kid's book, but they've got to learn about nice writing somewhere. And there are so many fabulous examples of literature, aimed at children, that are beautifully written.Here is the first line of Chapter IV, taken from Oliver Twist: \\"In great families, when an advantageous place cannot be obtained, either in possession, reversion, remainder, or expectancy, for the young man who is growing up, it is a very general custom to send him to sea.\\"It's an old-fashioned style of writing: lots of commas and wordilicious. But it has rhythm and it has eloquence. Note also that it has the same structure as Jane Austen's famous opening line in Pride and Prejudice. The vocabulary is great, not too complex and not too simple. Children are very good at working out the meanings of words through context, and this is a great example of something with a touch of (a whole bunch of) a challenge to it.Here is the first line from Chapter 4 of Alice in Wonderland: \\"It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself \`The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She' ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?'\\"As with much of this book - utter madness. The language isn't very challenging or poetic in this example, but it does have that rhythm that makes it pleasurable to read. The clauses are short, similar lengths and they are punctuated. This is what gives the sentence instant animation.Now let's look at the first line from Chapter 4 of Harry Potter #1: \\"BOOM.\\"That's it.Want some more? Okay (OK), let's give Rowling a chance: \\"BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \\"Where's the cannon?\\" he said stupidly.\\"Yes (yeah), that's a great way to open a chapter. Let's start off with a bang (this is permissible), and then list a load (a whole bunch) of actions. Whom was this written for, a three-year-old? Because that is what it reminds me of - one of those picture books with really simple sentences that list the main characters' actions. Bah (gah)!Maybe I'm being too critical. After all, this is a book that has sold millions and millions of copies. What I write here will not change that, and probably won't harm future sales a jot (a bunch). It has to have something going for it, surely?-It has a plot that has captured the imaginations of its many readers.This must be true. But then I think of the sitcom Friends. That captured the imaginations of millions, but it was unfunny and crap, and didn't really improve my life or the lives of society at large. Also, I wanted to punch Ross in the face.-It has humo(u)r.Yes (yeah). I will give Rowling some kudos for that. Wit is one of the greatest indications of intelligence and serves to unite us all. Let us rejoice in her sense of humo(u)r. Ho ho (ha ha).-It has a plot with no holes or areas of improbable logic.Google \`Harry Potter Plot Hole' and you'll get 408,000 results. Be sure to leave your \`safe search' on.-It entertains people.Okay (OK), I have to give Rowling her dues (props) here. She's entertained millions of people around the world and given them something to talk about other than chips (fries). There has to be more in the world to talk about than cooked potato. I suppose (guess) that, if something gives someone joy in their life than that must be a good thing.I think I'm just upset that, even after picking this new, edited version up thirteen years after I tried the original, I still get no joy out of it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I admit that I truly loved this book and the entire series.

I would recommend these books to any and all who ask.It is important to consider, however, when a sensation like this comes along - is this series truly a classic. I define a classic as something deserving of the full five star rating. It is at least clear to me that the fact that it is popular dies not warrant a 5-star rating. Harlequins are popular, John Grisham is too. But hardly are they classical works of literature.When I think of children's classics, I think of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (or James and the Giant Peach) C.S.Lewis and Narnia and Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time.

I have a full time job, three active boys, and a part time job in the Nebraska National Guard. If I had any spare time it was spent gardening, remodeling, or paging through a magazine.However, I recently was deployed for six months in Macedonia. My son sent me his Harry Potter books. Being deployed in this area of the world is much like spending time in a minimum security prison. Just work and exercise. No television, no leaving camp--except official business, a USO show every 2-4 weeks. That is it!Every night I looked forward to crawling into my bed and reading Harry Potter as a pleasant diversion from my day to day duties. It was the highlight of a very long six months in the Balkans. I was particularly amused that Albania and Bulgaria were both mentioned by name in Ms. Rowling's books. My duties took me to both of those countries, but I didn't see any dragons. I am anxiously awaiting another book and when I get home my sons and I are going to see the movie."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers StoneImagine a world of wizardry and magic. That's where Harry Potter lives in the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. The author is J.K Rowling. In the story a lot of suspense built up to the climax.Bad things were happening at Harry's school but no one was quite sure why. Evil trolls were let into the school and everyone knew something was up. The reader is never quite sure who is doing all these horrible things. The author is always confusing the reader by making it seem like somebody else did all those bad things.Somebody was also causing trouble during a quidditch match. Quidditch was a game that they played at the school. Some one was planning on killing Harry Potter. Nobody knew who was doing it and nobody knew anything was going to happen. Only two people knew about, the person that was doing it, and a teacher that was going to stop it. Luckily for Harry, nothing happened to him. He still had no clue who was doing all the bad things at the school and neither does the reader.I think people that like fantasy and science fiction would enjoy this book. The book was mainly about magical and amazing things. I really enjoyed this book and I know lots of other people will too.So as you can see this was a very great book and there was lots of suspense built in the book. I think that many people will like Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am not ordinarily disposed to being drawn into overly hyped fads and Harry Potter certainly seemed like one such to me. Add in that it's a series for juveniles and it's not hard to understand how it took over a year for me to give Harry Potter a chance. But someone close to me suggested I might enjoy them, so I picked up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and gave it a shot.I am very glad that I did. It has been a long time since I enjoyed a book so much. I am in my 30's and found it as fun and enchanting as any teenager. Sure, it's written at a middle school reading level and is lacking in the kind of great depth one would expect of &quot;adult&quot; literature, but providing that is not its function. Rather, it exists to draw the reader into a unique and delightful world where magic actually works and the good guy can win with heart, grit, and imagination.Harry's miserable existence is transformed overnight upon the discovery that he is a wizard and heir to a magnificent repuatation. But that reputation has a dark side, since he has earned not only widespread admiration but some dark and implacable enemies. To save himself and his friends, Harry must seize hold of his legacy and use every trick he can learn, despite his youth. A tried and true formula for adoscent fiction, to be sure, but the Harry Potter series is one of those rare examples that rises above its formula and presents the reader with something truly brilliant.Harry's journey of discovery begins here and I encourage anyone to join him for a few hours of very pleasant reading. I found myself completely drawn in and, even though I knew it was a juvenile work and that no serious harm would ever come to Harry or his friends, Rowling nevertheless had me on the edge of my seat on numerous occasions as Harry finds himself in seemingly insurmountable difficulty. Extricate him from such trouble with wit and creativity, while maintaining the reader's interest and faith in the narrative, is one of the hallmarks of Rowling's achievement in creating this wonderful little universe. Another is a terrific feel for creating character-driven humour. Harry Potter books are full to the brim with flashes of wit derived from the foibles and idiosyncracies of their exquisitely drawn and thoroughly knowable characters. I found myself plowing straight through all four books in short order (and they really do get better as you go, too). I now find myself anxious for the next (and, of course, the upcoming film) to be released.Sometimes things attract a lot of hype because they truly deserve them. Rare though they are, this is one of those cases. I encourage anyone who wants a delightful read to pick up this brilliant beginning to the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I would like to take a moment to write a short review for this wonderful book. My son started reading the Harry Potter series just this year and when he completed the first one I decided to pick it up and start reading. I was transfered straight to Hogwarts where Harry himself was attending to learn to be a wizard. This book help my attention from start to finish. There are not many books that I have read in the past that have been able to do that. I highly recommend all children to read this book, and the rest of the series. Please take the time to read at least one of them I am sure you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is one of the most brilliant books of all times because of its ability to reach out to all audiences and instill them with an emotion that serves as a basis to which everyone can relate. The story serves as a median through which children and adults can bridge similarities. Adults can be taken back to a time when the world was new- becuase everything is indeed new in the world of wizards- and once again experience childhood innocence, making it easier for them to relate to children in general. The tran-generational aspect of this book portrays an aspect of immutaion by perpetuating itself in the minds of all readers."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have to review along with everyone else, even though I know my review will be swallowed up among the thousands of other reviews of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. The book and all of the hype around it is just too fascinating.First of all, I think that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (and all of the other Harry Potter's) is marvelous. J.K. Rowling is a very good writer. She creates some complete characters alongside some comical stock characters. She uses some brilliant word play, and the atmosphere created in the book is extraordinary. It, at least, is incomparible to any other children's novel. She is very good at incorporating pieces of Greek mythology into the novel. The plot is vastly entertaining.There has been a lot of backlash against the popularity of the Harry Potter novels. But, this really happens to anything that becomes popular. Sure, there are better fantasy novels, and there are much better fantasy novels written for children. I don't think that there is a better place to start reading children's fantasy (or children's lit. for that matter). I also think that any fan of children's fantasy would have to enjoy this whether or not they think there are better books out there....Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a great book, and I think all of the controversy and hype just make it better and more appealing. I think everyone (including adults) should read this novel. It is well worth the time and money. Then, I think fans should definately move on to some of the other great childrens/adult fantasy classics like Lloyd Alexander's perfect Prydain Chronicles, C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia, J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings Trilogy and Smith of Wooton Major, and Ursula LeGuin's Earthsea Trilogy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is an exciting book for all ages from the young ones to elders reading this in nursing homes. I myself am in the tenth grade and as soon as i finished reading all 4 of the Harry Potter series I set out on a mission to get my whole school into harry potter. I didnt fully suceed but everyday more people come in and tell me that it was great. I started a harry potter fan club in my school and we all greatly recommened this book for its great variety of fantasy, wits,comedy fun and much MUCH MORE. We cant wait till harry potter 5 comes out and trust me after you read this neither will you. So what are you waiting for order a copy from the best online store!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter series is supposed to be for children. However, a lot of adults, myself included, have read the series and are absolutely delighted so far. The last time I've read such page-turners in the genre of fantasy was back 20 years ago when I read The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings trilogy. Since then, I considered TH/TLOTR to be the best crafted tale in its category. Well, no longer!I'm a slow reader, but I couldn't put the first 3 Harry Potter books down and I read them all in 2 nights, over a weekend. The fourth book took an entire week, simply because my week has other responsibilities to be attended to.Speaking of book 4 (Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire), I feel I have to say it would have been considerably better had it been shorter. A few chapters towards the beginning are just too slow, almost boring, and add little to the advancement of the story. Book 3 (Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban) suffers a little bit from the same problem, but nowhere as much as does book 4. Nonetheless, the last 2/3 of book 4 are just insanely intense!Except for those extra chapters, all 4 books are packed-full of action intermingled with lots of important information for the development of the story. Pay attention to every character, because you WILL meet them all again later.I look forward to the remaining 3 books of the series, but hope that the author isn't getting paid by the number of words she's writing and will, instead, stick to the racing style of the first 2 books.Note: I'm writing this same review for all 4 books currently out. My ratings for them are simply 5 stars for each. Read them and you'll understand why over 3500 people so far have written similar reviews here."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerers Stone is the best book I have ever read! Harry is a young boy who's parents died when he was little, he was sent to live with his mean aunt, uncle, and spoiled cousin Dudley. Harry recived an invitation to Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Durring his first year at Hogwarts Harry makes new friends, and rivals. Harry along with his friends finds himself in some trouble along with his friends. I thought this book was GREAT! It is full of excitement and enchantment, it is sure to spark anyone's imagination weather you are 10 or 97!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If you haven't read the Harry Potter books, you are missing out. They are a treat that adults and children can enjoy equally. Don't be afraid to dive in and lose yourself to the wonder and thrill of the ride. There are meaningful lessons about the good and evil in humanity that apply to our lives today. Reading them once is fun, twice even better. Do yourself a favor and get your hands on this book and START THE JOURNEY!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read this book because I had run out of other books to read.The book had been a present to my brother, who will _not_ read, and Ihad originaly dismissed it as a kiddie book, but when pressed with boredom I read it. It was surprisingly good.The only fault I could find with it was that Harry seems to learn nothing in a year at Hogswart other than how to ride a broom. Admittedly this is minor, but it troubles me seeing the characters relying on Hermione to think them out of trouble. What did they go to school for? To watch other people learn?Despite, and maybe even because of, the low reading level, I found this book enjoyable. Perhaps this is so because it seems to hark back to my age of reading Lewis Carol. The two authors' writing styles seem similar to me, or maybe it is just the audience."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Having grown up on C.S. Lewis, Lloyd Alexander, and such novelists, I find myself repeatedly thanking my good luck that another such talented writer has appeared on the horizon.Rowling has a way of transcending the barrier between children's fiction and adult fiction. I'm 39 years of age, and an engineer, and I read The Wall Street Journal, but I also highly recommend the Harry Potter series.When I was growing up, my mother read all the Narnia chronicles onto tape for us so that we could listen to them over again. Rowling's Potter series lend themselves perfectly to the same sort of activity; they read beautifully out loud, and they will have the whole family in stitches!Even if you don't read them in order, which is how I've done it, you won't be disappointed. Rowling's imagination and wit have no bounds."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Speaking as a mother of a child you hated to read. I love the Harry Potter series and will reccommend it to anyone who has a child that does not like to read. My son would always complain when I would tell him to turn the TV off and pick up a book.I bought the book to read with him and his sister then his teacher started reading it to the class. He then got so engrossed in the book that he started reading it on his own.My son now goes to bed early so that he can read for 30 minutes. He is actually turning the TV off and picking up the book. I now have to tell him to put the book down and go outside for some air.He is about finished with the second book and impaitently waiting for me to buy him the third book so that he can start on it. Thank you J.K. Rowling."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is one of the best books I have read in my 17 years of life. It kept me going and I could not put it down. This book will definately keep you reading. Harry Potter takes you along with him on all his exciting adventures. You go with him into the forbidden forest and you travel through all the secret passages in the Hogwarts School for young wizards. You get to read about unicorns, dragons, giants, trolls and get to feel the excitment of the adventures Harry and his friends experience. I definately would recremend this book to any person, young or old. I must say that I can't wait to read the rest of the Harry Potter books J.K. Rowling has written."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is a Mystical, Magical, Marvelous book! A great read for anybody, parents and children a like. J.K. Rowling tells a spellbinding story. With characters that dance on the page in front of you. Like Dumbledore, Snape, Hagrid, and of coarse Harry Potter. A lonely ordinary Muggle/Human. Living with his nasty old Aunt &amp; Uncle. Until one day when a mystery letter appeared. Saying he was to report to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry by September first to start his classes on becoming a world class wizard. Thus begining Harry Potter's great adventures....."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After my ten year old daughter read a small bit of the first book out loud, and after an adult friend of mine told me she'd read them, I decided to listen to the first audio book.Not only is the book a terrific mystery/adventure (take this from someone who's been reading science fiction, fantasy, mystery, and adventure for 30 years), but Jim Dale does an absolutely unbelievable job of bringing it to life.Read the book, listen to the audio book, but don't miss this book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought that reading this book would be a waste of time. But I heard people saying that it is good and that I should read it. I tried and now, I'm so frantic about her fourth book! It is very exciting for kids and adults of all ages. J.K. Rowling's plot, characters and theme is really enchanting. This book is not just the same as everyday books pertaining about everyday life, everyday work, everyday place and everyday time. It occured during everyday time but, it transports you to another place, at another life. J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter is just plain enchanting and it is truly magnificent. I have written a bunch of reasons of why this book is interesting, so why not buy it,read it, and see for yourself why it is The Extraordinary New York Times Bestseller?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It was truly refreshing to see a children's book that opened achild's imagination and yet, taught them values. The Harry Potterseries has a strange effect on the children I've seen read it. They sit transfixed for hours just reading. It's remarkable. The story itself is not so terribly clever. It has somewhat of a cookie-cutter plot, it's all the extras that truly make Harry Potter a great children's book. All the intracate details weave together to form a world so realistic you begin to wonder why you never recieved a letter from Hogwarts. In short if you haven't already read it, buy it now!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved this book. I read a lot of books and this one is definitely going to go under the heading 'favorites' in my files. Anyone else who reads the book will definitely like it. J.K. Rowling has a way of writing that makes you really feel for the characters. I liked it because it's an original concept for the wizards and witches idea and you're always trying to guess what will happen next to Harry and his friends in their studies of magic at Hogwarts. Or what happened before the story. I can't wait to read the next books in the Harry Potter series!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is one that reaches the soul of everyone who reads it.

When you read the book you get this awsome, vived picture in your head.

If I had a list of my favorite books, this would be number one. I herd their will be 8 altogether, and they will probily keep getting better and better and better.

Or until the next book comes out!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter was a great book. l liked it so much because of several reasons. One of these reasons was that it kept me entertained from cover to cover. There was not one chapter of the book that was slightly boring at all. Another reason why l liked it so much was because there were ideas in it that were completely new to me. These ideas lead me to want and read more and to get interested and inolved with the book. The crazy ideas were the names of the characters, the postal services and techniques used to create specfic potions. l also found the book very interesting. Harry Potter interested me because l could relate to a lot of his emotions. For instance, he grew up with his aunt and uncle and they did not like him at all. l am sure that thousands of people who read this book can relate to him and his emotions and that is why they like the book so much. That is why l think that Harry Potter is such a good novel."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When people in America started dying over these books, I decided I wanted to see what it was all about. So, I picked up a copy of this book and went home. I didn't stop reading for about ten chapters. Some books I hate, some books I love, and this one I love. Rowling is wonderful at describing things and at characters--HArry, Ron and Hermione act just like me and my friends (sans the magic...). I am an aspiring writer myself, and J.K.

One thing that I find intresting is that almost none of these extreme critics have even read the book! Where do they come from saying all of this?

While I am not in the age group for which the book is recommended, I am in the age group which this book satisfies.

Yet Harry must face Draco, Snape, Peeves,Mrs. Norris and many other challenges that stand in the way, for the sake of the school, and the wizard world.

I'd totaly recommend it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"We just finished reading &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; at our house and it was a big hit with both adults and the 7-yr.-old kid. This is a book written on two levels: the adults will appreciate the humor and the well-defined characters. The kids will be able to cheer for Harry through all his trials and triumphs.Who hasn't wished for something better out of life? For Harry, it's a valid wish, when he is raised (abused?) by Muggle (non-magic) relatives for 11 years before being accepted at Hogwarts, a school for witches and wizards. After cheering for Harry as he leaves a home he despises, we commiserate with him as he learns to fit in not only the new school, but an entire new world, as well. A magical new world, one where the rules have changed - and it is also the world his parents knew, but he never did, until now.This is a school where the dorms are entered through pictures of fat women who insist on a password to enter - and sometimes you can't get in because the woman in the portrait has gone &quot;visiting&quot;! This is where your professors teach potions and spells, and one of the pieces of student equipment is a cauldron.But Harry is the hero, after all, and despite a few setbacks (one of the professors hates him, &quot;detention&quot; includes traipsing through the forbidden forest looking for unicorns, someone is trying to steal a magical object and Harry himself has to learn to live with being a legend since birth - something he didn't know until he turned 11), Harry finds friends and acceptance in the magical world (not to mention in Quidditch circles!)We are looking forward to reading the next book, which is as strong a recommendation a reader can possibly give."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone was an amazing book that I would strongly recommend to anyone who enjoys thrillers.

Rowling is about a boy who turns 11 and finds out he's a wizard. He also finds out that he is going to a school called Hogwarts School for Witch Craft and Wizardry. There he meets two friends and learns magic. At the end of the year he relies just how much danger he's in BY this evil wizard named Voldemort.I think Harry Potter was a good book. One reason is that it was about wizardry. Another reason is that it was an easy read but got harder as it went along. Thirdly because it was 7 series long so it just kept getting better. Harry Potter is a really good book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Anyone who likes magic or anything to do with fantasy has to read this book, it's not just for kids, adults will fall in love with it too. HP Sorcerer's Stone is the first in the 7 book series but this one gets you hooked. When I read this in middle school I loved everything about this book, it was perfect. Years later, I still reread my set of HP books and still can't find anything wrong with them but every time I do reread them I always find something I didn't pick up on the first time around. This has action, drama, suitable amount of romance, and the list goes on. One of things I loved about the novels is as I read them I grew up along with Harry; it was like I had a best friend throughout my child hood that just lived in a book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is someone we all wish we knew. He seems to be all the things that we wish we could be. He is brave, honest and humble, even in the toughest of times.The thing that makes Harry so likable, is that he is real, even in a world of magic. He does have his flaws, as we all do, but he is constantly showing us that he can be his best even when things are at their worst.I have read the entire series twice now, and I can only hope that there will be more books like this in the future. Every time I need to escape, Harry and his friends are always there for me.

I thought it was a good starter because there are many laughs."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have to admit upfront I don't feel qualified to review this book. It's simply brilliant, and it gets even more so each time I read it. For those who don't know, it's the tale of an orphaned boy whose uneventful life turns upside down when he learns he's a wizard. At Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, he joins loyal Ron and brainy Hermione in balancing schoolwork, rivalries and illegal dragons...all while trying to prevent the return of the most evil wizard known to man.The novel has its share of familiar fantasy elements - an orphaned boy, a wise and kindly old wizard, and a collection of dragons, unicorns, centaurs, ghosts and spells. But creativity abounds, from the wizarding game of Quidditch to the mirror of erised. Add to that Rowling's sense of humor, magical descriptions, penchant for details, and web of foreshadowing, and you have the ingredients for a classic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is very cool.I have read it 10 times and still find it to be fun."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Funny and delightful.

It's a shame that I hadn't started earlier.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is one of the best books I have ever read, bar none. I will not question that. It was beautifully written and crafted, well thought-out, and insanely exciting. Foreshadowing hinted well, and it was done superbly...you think that this detail is extraneous, but then it turns on you and becomes the most important turning point of the story.Harry is also a character we can all relate to. You know the times when your parents (or aunt and uncle in Harry's case) tell you something that you never knew. Every parent does that, purposefully or inadvertently. This was incorporated into the novel in a way that makes your spine tingle with delight when you think about it.The reading is fast-paced, exciting, and inventive. Word choice kept you on your toes. Characters were deep and had meaning--even the Dursleys had some depth and relatability to them.Definitely a huge must-read. I look forward to the rest of the series!You might also try:HolesDouble LifeArtemis Fowl (Artemis Fowl, Book 1)Eragon (Inhertitance)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Book ReviewHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first book out of seven in the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling. Harry Potter, the main character, lives with his aunt in uncle in a small home in London. The family despises of him and treats him with much hatred. One day Harry receives a letter in the mail explaining his acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Unlike at home, Harry as a hero in this new world and for defeating an evil wizard known as Voldemort. While attending Hogwarts, he becomes acquainted with a girl named Hermione Granger and a boy named Ron Weasley. While at school, the three try to uncover valuable information about the Sorcerer's Stone and in doing so they get themselves into quite a bit of trouble.I was introduced to the Harry Potter series during the second grade. The year was 1997 and I barely understood the text. Eleven years later, my friend Bethany told me I should listen to the CD's during my free time. Honestly I hate reading and this was a great way for me to truly experience the Harry Potter series. I recommend this book to everyone for numerous reasons. Listening to the book on CD's is much easier for those under the age of eight or those who simply do not like reading. Even though the setting of the book is in a magical world, the book is not simply for children and applies to all ages. I can almost promise you will enjoy the Harry Potter series.After successfully completing the first book, it is intricate to distinguish any flaws in the J.K. Rowling's book. However the book's list of strengths is extensive. J. K. Rowling planned every minute detail of the Harry Potter series prior to writing her first Book. Little details such as Harry talking to the snake at the zoo eventually become important in the later books. Her style of writing is magnificent. The book flows very well since she correctly planned the entire series prior to writing it. She does such a splendid job of bringing the reader into the lives of the main characters. When Harry Potter is disturbed by character such as Malfoy, we as the reader feel similar emotions such as our hatred for Malfoy.The novel is quite an easy read for those over the age of eight. J.K. Rowling uses an extensive vocabulary in her writing, however the context clue enable most readers to easily determine the meaning of the words. Many people, as did I, find it hard to stop and take a break from reading/listening to the book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers stone is an amazing twist of action, adventure, and mystery. When I read this book I feel like I'm in an enchanted school of witchcraft and wizardry, sneaking around with Ron, Hermione, and Harry, playing Quidditch, fearing Snape (the potions master), and talking in the Griffindor comon room. This book leaves you trieving for more. Nathan"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Socerer's Stone was really good.

I give this book a #5.I think this book is adventurous.Andrea"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I've read this book last year during summer vacation, and I was blown off by the light yet magical narration of Rowling. The book was easy to read, but that detail didn't stop me from staying up until the wee hours of morning satiating my hunger to unravel the mystery. I love the book because it mixes wizardry and adventures with some reality of school life. Even my big sister, who doesn't even read school novels for class just because they're boring and doesn't read that much of fantasy books, loved this book. The series is worth a read for anyone creative who wants to experience a whole new world of reality and make-believe."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J. K. Rowlings is most certainly a literary treasure of our time and will be for years to come. Her amazing gift for storytelling and the ability to create a living world for the imagination is extraordinary and meant to be shared with readers both young and old. The fabulous creative energies that make Harry Potter and his world come to life are refreshing, ingenius, and thoroughly enjoyable. I recommend the entire series to everyone and pray with high hopes that J. K. Rowlings will continue producing more books even though when the Harry Potter series is due to end with the 7th installment. Harry Potter is a gift to the world in an age when technology often forgets the simpler forms of communication and expression. The magic of Harry Potter is the inate ability to touch the hearts of all readers, regardless of age or backround."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Just as my heading indicates, this book is one of the best fantasy novels I read in my life. Even though some might consider this novel as immature and childish, you will have to check that again!...this book is made to enjoy from children to adults, and all would definitely enjoy it. J.K. Rowling is a marvelous and creative author for sure. He reminds me of Roald Dahl's type of writing in which the words try to create imaginary shapes through one's minds.I was able to read all four of the series, and each one is good as the other. So, if you started reading Part I, you can be sure to continue on with the next three books. Again, a book definitely worth to read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; deals with the story of an orphan who manages living in the sorcerer's school &quot;Hogwarts&quot; although there are a lot of people who are against him and who try to destroy his glory and his life. In my opinion J.K. Rowling was very successful in writing this story, because she created a whole new world with a lot of strange things in it like the giant Hagrid or the sport &quot;Quidditch&quot;. She describes everything in detail so the reader can imagine what the things look like and for this reason he feels like being a pupil of Hogwarts. Another positive aspect is the fact that there's is a lot of suspense till the last page. All in all one can say that this book is very fascinating and interesting for children and also for grown-ups. I could not stop reading the book and when I had finished it, I directly wanted to buy the next."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"We found this book very entertaining. I have a daughter in the second grade and we both read the book. It was so much fun reading it outloud. The book kept her attention, made her laugh and at some points put her on the edge of her seat. She read some on her own and seemed to understand most of it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'd been hearing the name Harry Potter bandied about for a little while when I finally happened upon a copy of this first book. I was curious enough to take it to work and read it (it was an extremely slow day) from cover to cover. When I finished it, I was smiling from ear to ear -- and I went back to the beginning and started reading it again! J.K. Rowling really has a firm grasp on how it feels to be a kid who isn't sure about fitting in or finding new friends. Her knack for inventing clever words and names (c'mon, you didn't smile the first time you heard of a street called Diagon Alley?), her attention to just the right amount of detail, and her obvious appreciation of the weird, absurd, and just plain silly all lend themselves to creating a work of fantasy genius. The best thing about this book is that, as good as it is by itself, you get to put it down knowing that you've only just begun your journey on the Hogwarts Express -- and that it only gets better from here!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have resently finished reading all four Potter books. All lived up to high expectations. They all have action, adventure and best of all a gripping storyline. Each book is able to hook the reader for hours with their exciting and twisting story. I have also read the books which were brought out to raise money for Comic Relief which also had the some enthusiastic and gripping reading qualities as the main books. I hope to enjoy the movie and many more Potter books to come. I recommend everyone to read at least one Harry Potter book whatever their age, but then once you've read one you'll what to read them all."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter, a seemingly ordinary boy, leads a very unhappy life with the heartless Dursleys: Uncle Vermon, Aunt Petunia and their terribly spoiled brad Dudley. His real parents supposedly died in a weird car accident. Harry's room is a dark cupboard under the stairs, and that is okay for him, because that's at least one spot where the Dursleys won't bother him. When one plain day a mysterious letter arrives -addressed to Mr H. Potter, The Cupboard under the Stairs- Uncle Vermon refuses to let Harry read the letter and immediately throws it in the fire. Next day another letter arrives, and another. Although the Dursleys try everything to escape the flow of letters, Harry is finally rescued by Hagrid on his flying motorbike and taken to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When Harry enrols at this mysterious school his adventures have only just started.No-one is capable of ignoring the recent hype around the character of Harry Potter. This is clearly a showcase of how far merchandising can get and gives rise to the question if this circus is really necessary or even justified. One quickly tends to forget that behind this commercial vehicle is one of the most refreshing and inspired stories told in years. Rowling has created with the Harry Potter saga a world filled with a set of unforgettable characters. It is not without reason that Rowling is often compared with Roald Dahl. The strength of these characters becomes even clearer when you look at the high quality of the sequels. The Philosopher&#65533;s Stone (american edition: Sorcerer's Stone) is so well plotted that it can stand the comparison with a first-class whodunit. It is amazing how all those little details fall together at the end and bring the reader a denouement that is both fair and utterly surprising.But above all Harry Potter is a fun read, and to my knowledge it is one of the few children&#65533;s novels that can be read on the train by adults without them having to blush with shame. Something one can only applaud: there is absolutely nothing wrong with admitting you&#65533;re still young at heart!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I see no real reson to tell everyone that this is an absolutely positively wonderful book because basically anyone who lives within 100 miles from a T.V. would know this.Few people have such great writing techniques that people actually believe with a small grain of there heart that these things are real. Tolkien had it, and so did C.S.Lewis and Philip Pullman. Now we must add to that sadly short list a new writer.For Harry Potter has such reality that everyone who reads it will believe that they can walk through a wall between platforms 9 and 10 and be in the magical world.Just be warned before you read this book that if ou read this book you will absolutely have to read the second and third and now forth books or you might very well spend your lifetime wondering what happened to Harry ,Hermione and the rest of the wizarding world."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"harry potter's books are the best! i had never been interested in reading a book before! i used to hate reading until this book came to my hands. it is awesome. at the beggining, i was not interested because i used to say that by watching the movie was enough, but i was wrong!! i started by reading the first pages thinking that i was not going to be able of finishing it, but byu the contrary, i read it really fast. at nights, i could not stop reading. it was like a sort of magic that pulled me to keep on reading until i finished it! then, i had to run to get the second book, and the thierd and then the fourth! and i am so impatient to read the fifth book!, i cannot wait anymore! thinking that i am going to have to wait until this coming june to read the fifth it's killing me! i really apreciate the imagination of this excellent woman that entartain not only kids but adults by writing these books and hope she can continue doing it!!

I won't go into the story as everyone should know it by now, and the fewer you know before reading the better it's anyway. I'll talk about the characters instead.There is one respect in which The Sorcerer's Stone really is a children's book, namely that every character in it has to be either really good or really bad, with one exception but I won't go into that since it would spoil a lot of the story. Joanne K. Rowling really takes this black-and-white drawing to a high extent. Dudley Dursley, for example, is not only a bullying idiot - no, he's fat AND mean AND stupid AND looks like a pig AND has really bad marks at school and so on. It's fun, but sometimes it's a bit much. The same, only the other way round, goes for Harry. Personally, I like Hermione Granger a lot more than Harry. This could be because I'm a girl and because I know very well what it feels like to be brainy and not accepted because of that, but still, I think she's more credible than Harry and certainly nicer than Ron, who treats her really unfairly up until the Troll incident.I also have a slight problem with the Sorting Ceremony. As we are informed, the qualification for Gryffindor is Bravery, and the qualification for Slytherin is Ambition, yet all the Gryffindors turn out to be really nice and get along magnificiently, while all the Slytherins are evil and cruel. That's a bit much, and it gets you into thinking why Dumbledore doesn't simply reject the Slytherin students, seeing that many of them have turned Dark before, or why he has to put all of them into the same house with Snape, who openly favours them all the time, as their Head. Also, I don't see any reason for Hermione to be in Gryffindor (as opposed to Ravenclaw) except for the fact that she was destined to be Harry's friend.Still, the book's excellent (though not as good as Chamber of Secrets and Goblet of Fire). Everyone says so, and in this case, they're right."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is a wonderful book that is getting people of all ages to read.

She didn't explain it too well, and i looked at the cover and said to myself, &quot;Nah, that's not for me...&quot;Well, my friends started reading them. They had already been out for a bit and most of my friends had read them all. I got curious, so one day at lunch i read the first chapter. I was instantly hooked, especially after it got into how horrible the Dursley's were. Over the time of about a week and a half, i had borrowed all three books from my friend and couldn't get enough Harry. I was all over the web and the library and the bookstore, nothing could appease my hunger for the wonderful world of magic i had been sucked into.I went onto Amazon with my mom and ordered the three books, meanwhile pre-ordering the fourth. I was restless for the few days until i got a big cardboard package with my books inside. I read them again and again, maily focusing on the first one, and picturing myself getting a yellow parchment envelope, with my name on the front in green ink. I imagined myself opening it and seeing the list, flying down to Diagon alley to collect my equipment and then stepping onto the scarlet train to meet my fate.I can say only this: Harry Potter is a MUST HAVE. If you haven't read them, DO, I beg of you. There is no way any books can compare to the wonder i feel every time i read these books. I've read them up to six times now, and when i did get the fourth one i holed myself up in my room and read it in a day. Everytime i read them i get sucked deeper into the eternal hold the wizards and witches have captured me in. It's the best thing that has ever happened."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"All the Harry Potter hype as certainly paid off with this book. Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#65533;s Stone is nothing short of brilliant and with its descriptive language and full-bodied personalities of it&#65533;s unforgettable characters, it is a book that is bound to entertain all audiences for a thousand years. It certainly has the power of longevity, I&#65533;ve read this book 3 times already and even though I know what is going to happen, I&#65533;m tense throughout reading. What&#65533;s that, I hear? Harry Potter is just for children? Certainly not! This book is entertaining for all ages, and even though it is classified as mostly recommended for about 8 &#65533; 13 years, I think adults will enjoy this book just as much as children will. The book is quite violent near the end, and even the description of &#65533;You-Know-Who&#65533; will chill the bravest of spines. I can&#65533;t praise this book enough, I just think its fantastic and I&#65533;ll be shocked if there is even just one person on this Earth who hasn&#65533;t heard about the fantastic phenomenon."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I started this book and thought it was boring but I started reading more and I got hooked! I love the enchanting imagination of J.K. Rowling. This book is breathtaking in its literary achievements. It is in so many languages that I've never even heard of some of them. Also, it has been read by almost every kid of America. It's not only a children's book though. Almost all of my friends who are Harry Potter fans have had their parents and older brothers and sisters read it too. There are very few books that can reach out to that big of an audience. I would definitely recommend this book for ages 10 and up."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What is Harry Potter about? Well, it is mainly about this boy (named Harry Potter of course) who found out that he was a wizard. All his life Harry had been a nobody. And then suddenly he found out that he was to become a great wizard and learn all he needs to know at Hogwarts School. But, I am sure that you already knew that (lol).I think that the Harry Potter series is great. Why? Well, Harry Potter is getting younger children to read. Yes, it is getting younger children to read! Even High School students are reading Harry Potter because it is that good (even though the reading level is for Elementary School children)! I read the first book only to see what the big deal was. Then I had to read the second and third and fourth. The characters are so interesting and the plot keeps you stuck to your seat. But, if you think that it is boring, remember that the reading level is for children in Elementary School!However, people are constantly claiming that the Harry Potter series is evil because it mentions witchcraft and wizards and stuff. There were even people burning Harry Potter books because they thought that they were evil (I laughed when I heard this). First of all, the books are not evil. Second of all, if someone takes them that seriously, then they have a problem and you should teach your children that it is make believe. It is fiction and is not real. Third of all, fantasy books are interesting because they help build the imagination and when the world seems boring, they take you to another world. I believe in God and I didn't turn away from God when I read the series.For those who enjoyed the Harry Potter series, I recommend the following books to you. However, some have a higher reading level and they may be hard for younger children.-Chronicles of Prydain...by Llyod Alexander-The Dark Is Rising sequence...by Susan Cooper-Redwall...by Brian Jacques-The Chronicles of Chrestomanci...by Diana Wynne Jones-The Chronicles of Narnia...by C.S. Lewis-Sabriel & Lirael: Daughter of the Clayr...by Garth Nix-His Dark Materials trilogy...by Philip Pullman-The Lord of the Rings...by J.R.R. Tolkien"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In popmusic/boyband-world we call ourselves &quot;mature fans&quot;. I don't know if there's such a thing in Harry-Potter-world but if there is, then consider me one of them.I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone because I know I will have to watch the movie coming out in November. It's been a habit of mine to read the book version first before watching the movie (which often leads me to conclude they should have left the darn thing as a book). Anyway, by chapter two of this first book, I was hooked. In a span of two weeks, I finished three and am finishing the fourth. Sorcerer's Stone is my favorite so far, and Prisoner of Azkaban is by far, the saddest one.Parents - you should read it so you can experience the magic yourselves. The words, the story, the idea is simple and fantastic enough to hold a child's interest. But it's sophisticated enough to excite the older readers. I found myself longing for more each time I finish a book.I'm almost done with the Goblet of Fire. Can I stand the suspense of waiting for the fifth book? And when I finish that one - how long must I wait til the sixth and the sevent book? And after the seventh, what next???"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"OK, let's get straight to the point- Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone ranks quite high among my list of favorite books. I first got hooked in fourth grade, when my friend INSISTED that I read this book, and wouldn't stop bugging me until I had read the last page. And it didn't take me long to do it. The story of an eleven-year-old wizard was particularly appealing to my 10-year-old Muggle self. The captivating story of Harry Potter, the nobody-turned-famous, caught my attention from the very first page. As soon as baby Harry was left on that doorstep, I left my couch behind and was suddenly transported into the world of British wizards. I felt as if I could taste those pepper-flavored Every Flavor Beans along with Harry and Ron. J. K. Rowling is a spectacular author: her action-packed books are well-written and detailed.Naturally, Harry Potter craze soon took over. I have read all 4 books that have come out so far, as well as the filler &quot;schoolbooks&quot;...in fact, my mother is reading Chapter 3 of this book to my younger sister as I write this review. It was not much later that I discovered the next great thing in the Harry Potter line- audio tapes. My family currently owns the audio tape sets of books 1-4. Jim Dale's voice gives this magical story a new twist. His wonderful voices for all of the characters make the story much more lively and exciting. Car rides are no longer boring (or eventful- a word of advice--audio tapes are a great distraction for otherwize carsick riders!) Both book and audio tapes are phenomenal, and I would reccomend them to readers age 6 to 136!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J. K. Rowling's first book in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, hardly needs any more praise but I may as well add my voice to the throng. This book may lack some of the emotional interplay and complexity of the later volumes but all of the mystery and imagination that went into forming this series are clearly in evidence even with this first volume in this remarkable reading experience. The author does a marvelous job of balancing the exposition with the adventure, with always a hint or more of mystery thrown in, right from the first few chapters. The most enjoyable aspect of the series is the way the author has been able to maintain it strengths throughout every volume and that is largely because the series was set on such a firm base as this first book has turned out to have become."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Although I have found many reviews too enthusiastic about the book, I have to agree that it has been very well written. And I think that even if the subject is more suitable to children, the language is not, so it represents a good reading exercise to non-English mother tongue readers. A pinch of fantasy, another one of thrilling and one further of humour make the book an enjoying reading, streaming with ease, that an even adult can perform, and he will not have wasted his time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a 13 yr old who absolutly loved the book!!!!!

And besides, what fairy tale book about wizards and witchcraft is worth reading? Well,was I in for a surprise. When I first picked up the book, It was impossible to put it down. From the very begining this book was loaded with suspense and mystery. The characters were of fantasy, but they seemed to be bursting with real life problems and personalities. I learned to hate the evil characters and love the lovable ones. I even played the wizard's improved combined game of soccer and football right along with Harry, and I wandered the halls of Hogwarts in the invisable cloak alongside Rob and Hermoine. I never knew so much imagination could be put into a book! Everything in this book made me wonder, &quot;Is there such a place in this world where wizards and witches are around every corner?&quot; The way the spells were cast, and how magic wands were picked out made me wish I could be a witch.I finished this book in no time, and the time certianly flew by when I was reading.So don't waste time and pick up this book at a nearby bookstore and join the magic of, &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.&quot;"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"IT IS THE BOMBIST BOOK OF ALL TIME IT IS THE BEST book I ever read it is great!!!I like the plot and the characters I like at the end when he gets past all the obsticles and kills Quireill stops Volldamort!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was the best.

Harry is the one of the greatest characters ever invented in a book. I think that Speilburg , or someone who can work with J.K.Rowling, should make a movie about this book and then the series, kinda like star wars. Harry and his new friends Ron and Hermoine are definetly some kids I would like as my friend. READ IT!!! It's the #1 book of a lifetime. I hope Rowling will come out with another series like Harry Potter after he's done with the remaining 4 books in the Harry Potter series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone because of the way he didn't know about his past until it just jumped out at him unexpectedly.

What was it that made children, college students and adults all sing the praises of a....children's book? I dismissed it and went on with life.Then one evening a family member rented the movie for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I fought it even with the TV on....oh wait...that looked interesting...oh no...I'M ENJOYING IT!!!!!!! The next day I bought the first book, it couldn't be that bad, but it still couldn't be as good as everyone said.I Bought books 2 - 4 the next day even though I hadn't finished 1.It's almost impossible to put into words what it is that makes you get so wrapped up in the story. Maybe it is the little slivers of things untold (what is Snape's connection to the Potters? What is the history of Hogwarts? etc), maybe it is the fact you could see yourself as a child devouring this book.The settings are richly unfurled before you, the emotions are vibrant and the characters are...words can't begin to describe how well you feel you know them when this story has come to an end. I have walked away from many books feeling as if I have not learned one thing about the characters, or gotten to know them in any meaningful way. With the Sorcerer's Stone I came away caring for the characters, analyzing their motivations and most of all, wanting to see what else their time in the wizarding world would hold for them.Ms. Rowling has created a rich and full tapestry of a world. While this book works perfectly well on it's own, you do get the feeling you have just gotten your foot in the door of Hogwarts and you must contiue down the path she has set to see just what it is she has planned for us."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"At first, I didnt want to see the movie because I thought it was a blatant rip-off of Disney's The Worst Witch, & while there were similarities, (esp. learning to fly brooms) I enjoyed it far more. The similarities dissapeared in book 2 after I'd read book one, & in truth, I don't think Rowlings ever seen Worst Witch, just coincidental.Now I notice in my own home town that Anime & Doujinshi fans like this book, mostly teens & adults read it, & that people who both like or were thouroughly bored by Lord of the Rings like Harry Potter. I dont reccomend the books for children unless your aiming to improve their reading skills & open their minds to more mature things like distraught families & life threats, either way it's all in fun. You wont learn any witchcraft, but it will improve your Latin^.^"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This was a great first Harry Potter Book. A must-read in order to read the rest of the books. I love JK Rowling's style- so easy to read and fun. A great book for adults and kids."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Imagine you've spent the first 10 years of your life sleeping under the stairs of a family who despises you. Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor imaginable, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J.K. Rowling's enchanting novel, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. In the nonmagic human world--the world of \\"Muggles\\"--Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who unwillingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he's quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, cousin Dudley.One Day Harry is sent a strange letter from his friend to come, Hagrid, who is a giant and gamekeeper at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He willingly follows his friend Hagrid who had to come and rescue him from his dreadly Aunt and Uncle. There he learns that he's a Wizard and has many classes that he takes to learn magic. Classes like Postions and The Dark Arts.Harry is very well known at his school. He is very honored to become the very first, \\"first year\\" seeker in the very popular game Quidditch. During his stay at Hogwarts he has to defend himself from the evil Voldemort to protect the Sorcerer's Stone, to keep Voldemort from taking over power again. This book is a wonderful story with great description and wonderful adventures."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, by J.K. Rowling, appeals to people of all ages. It seems that the only audience would be students and young children, but I found that adults, as well as teenagers, find comfort in this book. Although, the ideal audience would be kids from ages 13-18. This was a great book! The characters were believable and the plot kept me interested from page one. J.K. Rowling has one imagination! For not knowing exactly what witches and wizards are like (since they are imaginary) she gave a perfect description. I could visualize specifically what the characters looked like. Harry and his scar, Ron and his red hair, and Malfoy with his sneaky look. At the beginning of the book it was a little hard to follow because we as an audience do not get the entire background. This would be the only down fall in her plot. This book was full of suspense and mystery! I found myself wanting more, and thinking of what I would do in that situation. I was scared for Harry in parts and upset at the fact of how Malfoy degraded Harmoine and Ron. I went through every emotion possible, or so it seemed. I absolutely loved this book and cannot wait to get my hands on the others! At times I wished that I could have gone to a school like this, where you took classes like Potions and Defense Against the Dark Arts. Where there was points awarded for the best class, and adventures around every corner! I give this book ten out of ten stars because of all of this, the wanting for more excitement, the great description, and the characters. I would not only recommend it to teenagers but to adults who want to believe in magic and the enchantment of a make believe world."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Have you ever known a secret but couldn't prove that you knew it? In the book, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\\" Harry Potter, the protagonist, knows a huge secret but nobody believes him. Not even the teachers at school. In order to prove that he knows the school secret Harry and his friends, Ron and Hermione, go to the 3rd floor corridor where another door is located. Hermione magically opens the door and inside is another huge suprise! A three headed dog! The dog's paw was over a trap door. Harry, Ron and Hermione go through the door and fall into the devil's snare.Another favorite scene that kept me on the edge on my chair was when Hagrid had a baby dragon. When the dragon hatches and almost catches Hagrid's beard on fire is a really funny scene. This is because Hagrid doesn't think anything of his beard being caught on fire; he just looks at the dragon and says that he's cute.The final scene that kept my reading was the scene whenHarry and his friends had detention and had to go into the dark forest with Hagrid. In the forest they see a dead unicorn, and Hagrid says they should split up to see if there are any more. Ron and Hermoine go with Hagrid but, Harry has to go with Malfoy, a person he really dislikes. Harry and Malfoy find a unicorn, but there is something with it. There was something eating it's blood! Malfoy ran off to go find Hagrid and left Harry all alone!If you're really into adventure, I encourage you to read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'll be the first to admit to my skepticism of the &quot;Harry Potter hype.&quot; I figured it was just a silly children's story that happened to become popular.

Very vivid and discriptive making it easy to picture and this great story allows the reader to exercise his mind with amazing accuracy he will find out when he sees the movie. I had intentionally not seen the first movie until I read the book.

In the story, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#65533;s Stone, by J.K.

Then Hagrid told Harry why everyone knows his name. Hagrid explained to Harry, &#65533;&#65533; an evil wizard named Voldermort took many wizards and turned them bad. One night Voldermort came to your house ,Harry. and whoever he wanted to kill didn&#65533;t stand a chance. Your parents fought and fought but he killed them. He also tried to kill you but his spell backfired. Something about you ,Harry, had stopped him that night.&#65533; After that Hagrid gave a letter to Harry telling him that he had been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He also gave him a very weird list of school supplies. Harry started to frown and replied sadly, &#65533;but Hagrid I don&#65533;t have any money.&#65533; &#65533;Don&#65533;t worry about that&#65533;, replied Hagrid. Hagrid got Harry&#65533;s money out of Gringott&#65533;s Bank, and he also picked up a very scruffy package. When Harry got to Hogwarts the first few months went by very quickly and smoothly, except for Harry and his friends detention in the Forbidden Forest. As he was walking through the woods he saw the most fearful sight. He soon would find out that the monster he had seen was Voldermort. Harry also found out that the scruffy package Hagrid had picked up was the Sorcerers Stone, which gives you eternal life. Harry thought Voldermort wanted it, so Harry told Ron and Hermione about his discoveries, and they had to stop him that night. When they got to the corridor on the third floor, they ran into one of the things guarding the Stone, a three headed dog.Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew that if they got passed the dog, there would be many more tasks for them to accomplish.

He bring each character to life in a way I never could when I read the book myself! This Audiobook comes highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"There are a lot of reviews for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone on Amazon.com -- more of them than I could hope to read, in fact -- so I'm going to skip through the description of the book and what it's about and get right to the heart of the matter.I am not a Harry Potter fan. In fact, for the last five or six years, I've struggled against all things Potter. This has less to do with the books themselves and more to do with the hype that surrounds the work. There was a point where I was once nearly dragged with a girlfriend to see the film adaptation of The Sorcerer's Stone, but that ended up falling through, and we went and saw Lord of the Rings instead.I'm also not a fan of getting into long-running franchises because I don't like waiting for the next book (the one time I've broken this rule, the author of the series passed away and the series was left unfinished).Now that the final book in the Harry Potter series has hit shelves, I decided I might as well give the books a try. I sat down and dedicated a couple of hours each day for three days into reading the first book in the franchise, and coming from the point of view of a person who has struggled against all things Harry Potter, I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised.The story of Harry Potter's fist year in wizard's school is the kind of tale that many of us can relate to despite the fantastical setting. Most of us have experienced the awkwardness of showing up on the first day at a new school, most of us have suffered through classes with teachers that dislike us, and most of us have come toe-to-toe with the school bully. Many of the situations in The Sorcerer's Stone are relatable on a personal level in spite of the fantastical spin.The book reads like a series of mini-adventures that for the most part stand alone, although they ultimately tie together in the book's finale. It's not amazing, but it is an enjoyable read. Rowling's use of descriptive prose is vivid but not overly wordy, making the first book a breeze to read.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone feels like a prologue to bigger things to come. The book is suitably dramatic, but utilizes the kind of humor you can only find and appreciate in children's literature. If you've found yourself hesitant to dive into the world of Harry Potter, take it from this non-fan: if you ignore the hype and enter into the series with an open mind, Year One is bound to leave you pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Don't kid yourself into believing this is a series only for children. There is a great deal of imagination at work here, and plot lines, and it's the simple ideas that capture us immediately -- discovering you're a wizard, taking a ride on a train to reach your school (which is a fantastic castle), and finding out you have the talents for a game that is unknown to the muggle world (Quidditch). Harry meets his allies and some who are not into his fame. This keeps his ego from getting big, which helps the book tremendously. Take a chance. The hype is worth it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The movie of this book hooked me on the series (books & movies). Just wonderful."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Unless you've been living under a rock for the past 8 or ten years, you should have heard about Harry Potter by now. J.K Rowling has created an impressive cast of characters, and she has done a tremendous job of creating interesting and engaging storylines. The first in the seven part series, H.P. and the Sorcerer's Stone sets the stage for a terrific plot. Plenty of twists and turns, this book (and the six that follow) are true page-turners.If you haven't read it yet, read it now!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I went ahead and jumped on the bandwagon, obviously later then others. A friend of mine let me borrow the first book and it was far better then the movie, but most of the time the book is. So, now I guess the next few weeks of reading material will devoted to the rest of the series. If I'm lucky they'll keep getting better or at least keep me as entertained as the first one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"One of the best children's book i have ever read. i am 19 and i read it to my whole family.

The Dursleys were as horrible as a human can be, and Harry hated them. One day, Hagrid the gamekeeper told Harry that he was accepted to go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and Harry was overjoyed-finally he can have a break from the Dursleys! But when he got to Hogwarts, he found out about something that students weren't supposed to know-the sorcerer's stone. Between Quidditch practices and school work, he had little time. But he was determined to know more about the Stone. When he found out that a teacher of his is after it, he goes to stop him.

They told me that it was a really great book and that I should read it, and one day as a surprise, my mother bought it for me. Once I started to read it, I couldn't get my hands off of it. My hands were glued to it.

I've read it 7 or 8 times, along with all of the others, too. When Harry Potter is a baby, he's left on the door step of his selfish aunt and uncle. They have a spoiled child who always gets better things than Harry. When Harry becomes older, a messenger tells Harry that his parents were a witch and wizard and that Harry is also a wizard. He goes to wizard school and the book just gets more exciting by the minute! I could hardly put it down. I'd fall asleep in class the next day from staying up to read it. Definitely a good read for everyone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I never imagined as a then 23 year old woman that I would enjoy Harry Potter. I thought the book was just a fad, and I've never been one to follow fads. But then, one day, I saw the Harry Potter movie when I was coherced into going by my sister-in-laws, and I actually thought it was great! And so, I went and got the book to see if the book measured up to the movie. I was blown away.The plot is intricate and the characters are loveable, once you get to know them. It seems that there is at least one character in the world of Harry Potter you can relate to. Hermione who is the geek and not very popular child who comes from a classic suburban lifestyle, Ron who is the friendly but poor kid who comes from a very loving family, and then there is Harry who is your typical child from a completely disfunctional family (even if he is an orphan). All three kids are alienated to one degree or another from their fellow children and I think all people, children and grown-ups alike can relate to not fitting in at one time or the other.I would recommend getting these books and reading them all. They get better as the books go on, but the first one still holds a special place in my heart because it is the start of the entire series and contains, in my opinion, the most magic and innocence of youth (which is a fun read). If you get these books I do not think you'll ever be disappointed."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter books have been very controversial. J.K Rowling makes use of different types of magical devices, such as the famous Quidditch broom, owls that deliver mail, and invisible cloaks. This book is developed in a fictional point of view and this is why it is so controversial. They live in a fantasy world called Hogwarts, which is a school for magic. All of this magic is placed within the fantasy world. Every reader that I know, including myself, creates a passion for this book and the rest of the series. Even though this book is controversial, I believe this is the greatest book to help children create their imagination and picture themselves in the fantasy world."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I would have never guessed that I of all people would have liked this book. I am not much into the wizard and warlock books, but this one caught my eye. I thought the book was completly a kids book, but I realized my suspisions were wrong.I saw the cover and was greatly intune to it. It made me want to read more books like it. This book made me feel like the character. Everything that would happen to Harry, Ron or Hermoine made me feel like I was actually there and it gave me a clearly vivid sight ot what was happening. I couldn't put the book down I read all weekend long to finish that book and I was ready for the next the only problem was that I had to wait. I thank J.K. Rowling for writing a book that not only children can sit down and enjoy but also adults."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This review is about the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K.

They would treat Harry very poorly. One day his luck miraculously changes and he is admitted to Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry I think this story is great and I would give it five stars.

Harry is just a normal kid in the normal world, but he is famous in the magic world. Due to some lucky accidents Harry is on the quiddicht team and finds a three headed dog guarding the sorcerer&#65533;s stone. The authors purpose to write this was to show people not to let fame and money get to you. I would recommend this if you like fantasy books with a lot of fake stuff, and a good imagination."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"All Harry Potter has ever known is his miserable life at the Dursley's House, but now he has a chance to leave his terrible life and go to a school of magic called Hogwarts School of Magic.

When he finally gets to this school he finds out what it is like to have friends again but he still has problems with other students as well. He finds that he is so good at magic that he is given special priviledges by the faculty and the other students become jealous of him and some do not like him anymore.

We all found it captivating and engaging. The children got more enthralled with each chapter. One night, they couldn't wait for the end, and we read the final four chapters. I only logged in this morning to find out when the sequel would be available. It's apparently out already in England. I (and they) can't wait. We recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am 9 nine years old and my dad read this to me before bed each nite. I really liked it. I think J. K.

This is one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think Harry Potter And The sorcerer's stone was a great book! I hope J.K.Rawling writes a whole series of these books. I read it in only two days, and I'm 10 so this is a lot of reading,cause I was so into it!!! More books like this should be writen. If J.K.Rawling is reading this &quot;Keep the great etc. work up&quot;. It is worth 100000000 stars."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Rowling has certainly produced one of the greatest books of all times in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

I was very pleased overall from the ordering process to receiving the merchandise."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"HARRY POTTER by J.K. Rowling. The audiobooks are amazing, but not the Jim Dale versions. His voice is bland and has no flavor. The original, British versions by Stephen Fry are astounding and far surpass anything Jim Dale could spit out. Plus, it's un-Americanized. I personally think Scholastic effed up and ruined the books integrity by demanding such differences as THE TITLE of the first book. HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE, anyone? What the hell is up with this Soccer's Stone crap? Psh! NEXT."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Hands down, this book was one of my favorite books when I was a young girl. It's been quite a few years since I've read the Harry Potter series, but I recently found the first three books at Target; I decided to take a chance to see if I would still love them. Considering that I gave the Sorcerer's Stone 4 stars, I still love Harry Potter very much and that may never change.Before I read the first two Harry Potter books, I used to hate reading a lot. I had a learning disability, and I used to be stuck reading below my grade level most of the time. When I first read Harry Potter, I did struggle a little bit; however the book held my interest for me to want to read all of them.What held my interest is complicated to explain; I think it was the mixture of realism, mythical creatures, magic and courage combined to make this series so addictive. I loved how cheerful and upbeat the book was, despite how the dark underlying themes present. As an older reader, I enjoy some the more adult humor that I didn't understand as a kid.Some of the characters, like Harry and Hermione, I could relate to as a young reader. Both Harry and Hermione were bullied, yet they didn't let that get them down. I admired Harry for his bravery for standing up to his bullies and knowing when to pick fights.I would definitely recommend this book for almost anyone. However for Harry Potter fans, I would also recommend reading Rachel Hawkins's Hex Hall series and both Diana Wynne Jones's Howl's Moving Castle and Chrestomanci series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter seems to have survived a depressing existence together with his auntie and uncle, the Dursleys. The guy snoozes inside a storage room and seems to have never had a birthday celebration as well as Christmas gifts. A whole lot worse, he has got to withstand life along with his nasty pampered cousin, Dudley. After that time Harry's 11th birthday celebration, things change as soon as a mail arrives, (by means of owl), enticing him to go to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. All of a sudden Harry sees himself amongst close friends, understading about potion-making and also magic-wand waving in addition to broomstick driving. There are chocolate frogs as well as Every Flavor Beans plus a three-headed canine and Quidditch-a sport a lot better than football. Furthermore, Hagrid, a loving gamekeeper who befriends Harry; Hermione Granger, a witch who has read every one of the school books as well as knows all of the policies; and there is Ron Weasly, Harry's closest friend who has a significant history of his own to fill. Hogwarts deals with him well, despite having the abomidable Malfoy's mean strategies or Professor Snape's apparent hatred of Harry. The particular Harry discovers himself in the center of a puzzle at Hogwarts, and along with his two new buddies, embarks on escapades he in no way imagined feasible.The publication is actually interesting with its images, sense of humor, plot turns as well as real-life child issues. The book does not just entice young children but grownups at the same time. She is an expert on fantasy. She can actually, without any problems at all, think herself back to eleven years of age. You are going to enjoy the elaborate descriptions, hilarious quotes as well as the enjoyable personas."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The cupboard under the stairs at Number four privet drive gives an excellent setting to the compelling and adventurous first novel Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling. An adventurous novel with surprises at the turn of every page. The stories main character finds out that he is a wizard and now all of the extra unordinary things that have happened in his life are finally starting to make since.Harry is a great main character. He is intelligent, thoughtful, adventurous, a hero, and just wants to feel like he belongs somewhere. He is a character that everybody will see a little bit of in their selves. Harry has to make new friendships at his new school, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, deal with bullies, and overcome extreme obstacles to get he wants. The novel features so many characters that have a lot of quality traits. Hermonie, the smart and witty one, Ron the sidekick living up to his older brothers footstep that seem unreachable, Harry treacherous, brave, courageous, and trustworthy. Everyone can at least connect to one character featured in this novel whether the character is good or bad.The novel is very well put together it has a setting, a conflict, solution, and a hero. Harry Potter has eighteen chapters in the first book that have an illustration at the beginning of every chapter regarding to what the chapter is about. The cover of the book does a very good job of providing illustrations that are big themes of the book. The outside cover is full of pictures with things like the three-headed dog, quidditch broomstick, the snitch, the forbidden forest, and the lightning bolt scar on Harry's forehead.This book does an excellent job of broadening the imagination so that anything is possible. It also does a good job at creating many obstacles, and having a solution to overcome the obstacles with. For example Harry, Ron, and Hermonie have to get past the three headed dog in order to see what it is hiding that Snape is so curious about. After snooping, and researching on how to get past the three headed dog they find that music is the way to get past it, and found out it is hiding the sorcerer's stone.J.K. Rowling has done a marvelous job in writing such an adventurous story that sets your imagination on a journey. This book is so realistic that anyone could believe Hogwarts is a real school full of wizards and magic. This book is the first of such an amazing series that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"great what better way to spend passing the time on a road trip it is too good to sleep through"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone is really a fantastic start to the series.

My father then continued on to read me the second and third, but decided that the fourth would be to scary for me. Well that was unacceptable. It was such an amazing story and he stopped in the middle, so as soon as I was old enough to read the fourth one, which was pretty young, I picked it up and read through it as quickly as I could. It was the first book that I ever read through fully, and then read it again, and again, and again.It's a great story for children to read if they are looking for an adventure that is out of this world, but it's also a great story every other age groups. For teenagers it covers friendship and love interests and can even help you handle them in real life. For adults it is a great story about segregation and politics(if you look deep enough).I guarantee that no matter what age, you will be able to enjoy this series and everything it has to offer."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"\\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is the first book in the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowlings. The first three books are written, in my opinion, for a younger audience but I still recommend this book to everyone. Read it to your babies, toddlers and pre-schoolers; have your kids learn to read with it. Parents and Grandparents will also love.In this book we see a young Harry Potter through his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The first ten years of his life have not prepared him to deal with the new world in which he finds himself. He is just beginning to learn about the events that occurred that brought him to where he is today.This book sets the stage for a wonderful tale of bravery and personal fortitude."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter has taken the world by storm over the last few years. If you are one of the few who has not yet been caught up by the magic, now's the time to start. The story should be fairly familiar: Harry is raised by cruel relatives until he turns eleven, when he is transported to Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. There, we, along with Harry, are introduced to a host of lovable and memorable charcters, from brainy Hermione to bratty Draco Malfoy. Don't mistake this for just a kid's book! Plenty of grownups have gotten in on the fun, too.

This book and the rest of JK Rowling's saga, are just fantastic. They're interesting, adventurous and smart; not just a children's book!

The first chapter was a very long introduction about the Dursleys so I thought that the rest of the book would be the same but when I got to about the 2nd to 3rd chapter I realized that this book was very interesting and I couldn't put the book down. It was very interesting because if you like something that is there to surprise you and every moment that you think you have got every thing that is going on you are mistaking every time you read it again you realize that you had miss something like a clue or just read it and didn't get it as you thought you did but that's the great thing about this book it brings new things. I really recommend this book because if you like suspense and adventure and just playing it simple it is great if you like reading something out of this world this book is the right one for you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I believe that this is a pretty good book. It has a lot of stuff to think about. Even though some people refer to it as a stupid fanatasy, make believe book; it's not. When you go beyond the story and start thinking about how Rowling thought of all the names of people, or places, you'll be surprise. She put some religious beliefs in there that you can't think of until you actually stop and think about it.Rowling has put a lot of effort into this book. She has attracted kids and teens into reading her books. She has also an excellent way of writting books, bringing a lot of meaning to books. This can prove that her books can bring joy, fantasy, and other things, that people can enjoy to read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"well i just finished the book of harry potter and the sorcerer's stone and it is a good book. you have to read the book and then watch the movie to see what is the difference of both.J.K Rowling has a british accent and hermoine has a hilariuos voice.First i didn't like harry potter and since i read the book it was very intresting and then watch the movie, it was good movie.you have to pay attention to the story and the movie closely.because there are things that i didnt understand what they mean and now i do, it is pretty interesting.it had like action in the book and the movie because harry and his friends went to get the stone and they had to see what is happening and what is going on.its like forshadowing when parents die and he looks back and think what is all with parents and proffesor snape.so it is a pretty interesting book and the movie."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book I just finished reading was called Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by the author called J.K Rowling. This book is about a boy named Harry who is a wizard and learns many new things about his life.To begin with, some other people in this book are interesting. They are Ron who is Harry's best friend, Hermione who is another friend of Harry's, Professor Dumbledore who is the Headmaster of the school Harry goes to, Professor Snape who is a mean potions teacher, and Professor Quirrell who is the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. It all starts when Harry lives with Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia who are very mean to him. Harry gets a letter that invites him to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When Harry arrives at Hogwarts he is sorted into the house of Gryffindor. On Halloween night a troll is let in but by who??? It was let in for a person to steal an object that is guarded by a three-headed dog. A game of Qudditch is played on broomsticks. All of the sudden Harry's broom is acting funny. Ron and Hermione figure out it is Snape who bewitching the broom. Snape runs into the woods with Quirrell. He threatens him to help get the Sorcerer's Stone. That is what the three-headed dog is guarding. Harry comes upon a mirror that shows his parents. Dumbledore tells Harry the mirror will be moved near the Stone. Dumbledore is sent away. This is Snape's chance to get the Stone. Will he be stopped??? Read the book and find out.Finally, the message of the story is to stick with friends. I would give this book a 100%. It was a great book!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book promises to be the start of a witty, satisfying series for all readers, young and old.

Once my teacher asked&quot;Guess what my husband is reading?&quot; We all said &quot;Harry Potter!&quot; Harry Potter is the bestseller in the New York Times. I was surprised that all three Harry Potter books were the bestsellers. It might even be a bestseller in the kid's books. I first read Harry Potter when I got sick.

But if you never read this book, then do it quickly. I reccomend it for all ages - in my family, for example, I had to beg to my father (aged 52) to give me my book back.

I mean it is indeed and excellent book but I reckon all the kids just ran out and bought it because everyone else did. I, personally, was displeased with the book - it was too slow, unimangianable and uses up it's talent too quickly. I was displeased but all the same I loved it.Harry Potter is a &quot;human&quot; who has been taken away from the abusive Dursley family to be taken to a school called Hogwarts. Why? Because he is a wizard. But it's not that fun when you have a dark lord and a huge scar on your trail.If your looking for imaginative fun, a chilling and thrilling plot and a huge amount of violence and awesomeness - I totally recommend Harry Potter.Anyway, wasn't the title of the book actually HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"anyone who says that the harry potter collection is &quot;just for kids&quot; or &quot;not for kids at all&quot; is CRAZY! that was one of the greatest series of books i have ever read and i am 20 years old. its a collection for readers of all ages and Ms. Rowling really captures your heart and puts you right at the wonderful Hogwarts or the miserable Dursley's. like i said 'Truly Enchanting!

Rowling introduced fantasy early in thenovel, capturing your interest about a magical world that could exist in your mind and maybe in reality.

The &quot;boarding school&quot; setting of both and people sneaking around getting into mischief caused this connection for me. Neither book causes great intellectual stimulation, but both are enjoyable. The Sorcerer's Stone is not a literary masterpiece, but it is definitely a good read.The value of the book lies in its appeal to kids. Hopefully more kids will be reading because of J. K. Rowling's books. Maybe the children that read her books will find themselves to be more than what they seem to be, just as Harry Potter found out that he was more than a simple boy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought is was a well written book.

Not only does he bring each character life with a unique voice he captures the reader with his own story telling skills. I was listening to one in the car this morning. Even though we have listened to all three of them several times, I was still captivated by a Quidditch match and had to hear the end of it before going in to work.

It's easy to read and it makes you want to keep reading. Time flies while reading it, and it's easy to understand and picture what is going on. It's basically about a wizard that grew up as a normal human or as they say in the book a muggle. He eventually finds out he's a wizard and learns about his past and it tells what happens throughout his life. He parents are dead and he doesn't know exactly how they died and he is trying to figure it out. He meets lots of new people and a lot of exciting things happen in his life and it just a great book to read. I recommend this book to everyone who likes to read and even people that find reading is boring cause after you read this book you will love to read. So what I am saying is that this is a great book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The story Harry potters Sorcerer's stone is a very exciting and interesting book. It has a lot of mischief as well as humor and action. The story starts out with Harry a young wizard who lives with a muggle family. Harry's parents have died in what he was told a car accident. His life is far from a paradise living with the muggle family; he is treated more of like a pet than a relative. The Dirsley's, harry's family have kept the real story of his parents death and that he is a wizard from him for his whole life up until one peculiar day. On that morning Harry was basically kidnapped by a giant named Hagrid. The dirsley's have been hiding hundreds of letters sent to Harry from Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry. Hagrid was not very happy the dirsleys have been hiding such a big honor from young Harry.In the story Harry meets a lot of new people some that are friendly and some that are not so friendly. There are two people who come out to be harry's best friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley both are first year wizards like Harry. There are two people that Harry has major conflicts with. The biggest one is Lord Voldemort one of the greatest wizards of all time who switched to the dark side of wizardry. Voldemort is harry's nemesis, he is the person who really killed harry's parents. He also tried to kill Harry when he was a baby but failed, Voldemort is still on the prowl for Harry through the whole story. Draco Malfoy a first year wizard who causes Harry and his friends great troubles. I would highly recommend this book for young teen readers who like fantasy tale books. I really liked this book due to the adventures, mysteries and drama"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I only read this book after my daughter and all of her friends talked about it.

It's good healthy fiction."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This will always be my favorite HP book just because it's the beginning of the magic and it's just pure fun. Rowling stirs up a whole pallette of believable characters, both pro-and antagonists. There's a charm--a magical world of wizards with their own laws, culture and wizard school--and the darker theme of Harry having to confront the Dark Wizard who killed his own wizardly parents when he was a baby. This is such a witty, fresh, funny, exciting book. Great literature? IMO, no. Fun? Absorbing? Well-written? YES! I read it when I was 12 and I read it now!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The first two chapters was a little boring though, but as you read on it creates a feeling of suspense. Harry has to solve a deep level mystery about the stone. You will try to guess and guess all over, but you would be wrong. He has to face danger and discovered a lot of things the others didn't know. As the story goes on and on, things and puzzles makes much more sense. He then will find the facts about this mystery."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book is just amazing there's no words to describe the epicness that is Harry Potter yeah this book is a MUST read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What else can you say ?

Thanks Harry!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I had heard about this book from people that I worked with and decided to see what was so intriguing. What I found was a refreshing and exciting surprise. The Harry Potter series is much more than I could have ever anticipated. I first started reading the book to my 3 young sons, then found myself being drawn into the world of Muggles vs the Wizardry. For those that say that the series is encouraging the occult are missing the general premise behind the scenes. Mainly, you find yourself cheering for a boy who knows no loving family, but finds not only love but a heritage of magic. The book propels the young and old alike to a place of great imagination and possibilities. It also teachs the lesson that even though areas of life may be harsh, there is moments of great hope. You, as the reader follow Harry Potter from his miserable existance as the child in the closet of his Aunt's and Uncle's home to a school of magic where his destiny lies. You find yourself caught up in the day to day life of boy who was treated like dirt to one who is respected as every child should be. So, give yourself and your family a treat and try the Harry Potter series. You might find yourself caught up in the Great Magic as Harry is."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is packed with adventure.

When I first saw one of these books I wasn't interested. But I bought it this year at a local Barnes &amp; Noble store, to give the book a chance. I wasn't dissapointed. It offered all the fantasy a fantasy buff could ask for. It all starts when a boy named Harry Potter escapes from the grip of an evil sorcerer called Voldemort. From that moment on, Harry is famous among witches and wizards. They all raise their glasses to him(To Harry Potter, the boy who lived). Wow. That's fame. Well, he lives a miserable eleven years with his horrible Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and Cousin Dudley Dursley. Where do they come up with these names. Well, I don't think Vernon is that un-known, but Petunia and Dudley. Man! Anyway, one day a friendly giant of a wizard named Hagrid comes to tell Harry he's supposed to be awizard. Harry goes off to Hogwarts(What a name) School of Wizardry. There, Harry finds magic, friends, excitement, broomstick sports, and mystery around every corner. I love this book.

He is amazing! I think people can really relate to him, I mean, he thought he was normal until one strange day. And he's adjusting to being this amazingly famous and talented wizard he never knew he was. His friends are the best. I love Hermione. Plus, which is so great, the book has these funny parts that make me laugh out loud! It's got suspense, mystery, and all that good stuff.

It is the best book I have ever read, even over the other Harry Potter books. The plot in this book is wild and crazy...what seems like the impossible comes true, and this book has the coolest characters, like Harry, Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, Professor Dumbeldore, and Lord Voldemort. And it's great how even outside of the main plot, there seems to be many small plots the characters engage in, which is very good so you are not stuck with the same old plot during the whole book. It's also neat how nearly everything in the book is totally different than anything we know, like wands, cauldrons, spells, even stones that can give you life forever.

Rowling's Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone is a must read for all ages. With its simple language, it becomes an escape from reality. It is simple enough for 3rd graders but also very enjoyable for adults. My first impression of the book was that is was going to be presented as a children's book, but that wasn't the case at all. I am the type of person that does not like to read. The only time I read is if it's a school assignment. Certainly enough I chose Harry Potter as my book report. I happen to be in an advanced English class and was surprised to see Harry Potter as a choice. I started reading Harry and as I progressed in the book, a force inside me wanted to keep reading. This has never happened to me before. Reading is a burden to me and all the sudden I was joyfully reading a 300 page book. The thing that astounds me is Rowling's simple use of words but description is vivid. . A reviewer named Leslie King says, \\"Hardly a challenge for anyone over the age of ten, these books do not leave anyone (including brainy know-it-alls like myself).\\" Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone is about a young boy with magical powers. He grew up not knowing his parents and lived an unhappy life until he discovers what he possesses. But when his 11th birthday came, things started to change. Harry makes friends and experiences wild adventures. Voldermort, the evil antagonist, is after the Sorcerers' Stone, which turns anything to gold and gives the individual eternal life. He confronts Voldermort and goes into battle. Read and find out what happens. The characters have been &quot;fleshed-out&quot; by Rowling to the extent that one might wonder if they were not possibly real. Rowling created the book to where as the character develops as the book progresses making the reader feel as if he or she actually knows Harry Potter in person. \\"J.K. Rowling could have easily opted to use a word like &quot;Oompa-loompas&quot; in place of wizards and thus avoided all this hearsay and hubbub over immorality and book-banning\\" commented by a reviewer. In the book, Rowling uses cute, unique, and simple vocabulary. She uses words like \\"Muggles\\", people without powers, and \\"Quidditch\\", a type or aerial soccer. What is amazing about this book is Rowling's vocabulary. She uses simple vocabulary to explain but outputs a strong, vivid description to capture our imaginations. Overall, Harry Potter is a great book to read. J.K has earned all the recognition she received."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"While the later books in the series are satisfying because they are long, complex epics, the first book in the Harry Potter series (\\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\") is sort of like hot chocolate in winter. It's warm, cozy, sweet, and just so good. It's clearly evident why this book launched the Harry Potter franchise off from the ground, and why it is different from all other modern fantasy. Harry Potter is just on a whole different level.One can tell that J. K. Rowling wrote this book with the entire series in mind. She already knew what would happen in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and the yet-to-be-released 7th book. That is apparent from the narration, the way the characters talk, the things they say, and the symbolism of the events that take place. Not only is this a very smart book, it is also entertaining beyond compare to any other series. The amounts of quotables from this book is amazing (especially from Dumbledore).This book goes down as a modern classic. That is simply undeniable.10/10 Classic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was unhappy with this product as the book came with a LARGE discount sticker on the cover which I was unable to removed without tearing the jacket.

My 25 year old sister (23 at the time) told me they were so good, but that still didn't change my mind. She even took me to go see the Chamber of Secrets when it was in theatres, and I still didn't like it too much. When I chose to read this book as a part of an English 12 project, it was awesome.The characterization that J.K Rowlings uses, especially with Snape, it almost makes YOU hate him as much as Harry does! I also noticed that in the other books, it stays the same, but it's remarkable how she characterizes Professor Dolores Umbridge in Book Five, Order of the Phoenix. Again, it makes you absolutely DESPISE her! The theme is focused on the world of wizardy and witchcraft for most of the books, shifting rarely to the Muggle world. There aren't that many symbols in the book, other than the Invisiblity cloak and the Mirror of Erised. The cloak, which Harry recieves on Christmas by Dumbeldore, however unknown at the time, used to belong to James Potter, Harry's father. Dumbeldore later tells him that James gave it to him right before he died, and Dumbeldore passed it on to Harry. It symbolizes a father's legacy to his son, and also symbolizes both of their rebellious behaviors by using it to sneak around. The Mirror symbolizes Harry's greatest desires, beacuase whenever he looks in it, he sees his parents. The setting of the story begins at Four Privet Drive, in London, England. But most of the story takes place in Hogwarts, the school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The plot, I would LOVE to explain, but I don't want to spoil it for all of you who haven't read it. Personally, though, I think it has an OUTSTANDING plot line! I hope you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the sorcerers's stone by J.K Rowlin;scholastic: New york, october 1998ISBN: 0-590-35342Magically EntertainingDid you ever wish you could go to a school where you learned magic.\\"You knew,\\" said Harry \\"You knew I'm a wizard.\\" This is an exert from the fiction book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K Rowling. The name Harry Potter is not a famous name in the \\"muggle\\" world, but in the wizard world it is big. Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone is about a boy Harry Potter who didn't know he was a wizard until the age of 11 when a strange big man told him he was a wizard. He goes to Hogwarts, the best school for wizards and witches. The reason why he didn't know he was a wizard was because his Guardians were hiding it from him because they didn't like wizardry.When Harry goes to Hogwarts strange things happen to him, someone tries to kill him. Harry is treated wickedly by his own guardians; other kids around the world are treated wickedly too. I think the book was great it was a page turner it also had a good storyline. The reason it's a page turner is because you always want to know who is trying to kill Harry Potter.Something interesting about this book is it has been given 12 different awards. The author's language is really good; when I read it I could see a clear picture while I was reading. Also so some books are so boring that I lost attention but not with this book. The author's word choice is different than others she uses made up words. Something I liked in this book is the author puts pictures in the beginning of each chapter that helps me get a better picture.I recommend this book to any one who likes to read about fantasy and about books that end goodBy Brian Dorado"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K. Rowling was a struggling single mother looking for a way to entertain her children with bedtime stories that would help them escape their tough reality. She not only provided escape for her own children but also for millions of people, children and adults, around the world. Rowling created Harry Potter. This book is the first of seven in the Harry Potter series. In this book, we are not only introduced to Harry and the world of wizardry, but we are plunged into a mystery regarding the Sorcerer's stone. I had originally picked up this book because everyone around me was raving about it. I soon discovered that their positive reviews were with good reason.Harry had spent his first 10 years of life with his aunt, uncle, and despicable cousin, not knowing his true identity as a wizard. Then, one day, he receives an acceptance letter to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, one of the finest schools for wizards. Even the journey from home to school is an exciting journey. Once at Hogwarts, this element of fantasy is abundant. Rowling immerses us into the life of a wizard. The reader's imagination is stretched to the limits with the descriptions of the people, the buildings, and mostly the magic. The tables set themselves, the pictures talk, ghosts wander the halls. This place is definitely worlds apart from the cramped room Harry was used to.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is not merely an introduction to the following six books in the series. Instead, this book sets the bar for the books to follow. In this book, Harry begins to discover the meaning of the scar on his forehead; a permanent reminder of the day his parents died. He also meets Hermione and Ron, his two best friends and cohorts against evil. This book truly takes you to another place. Though this book may seem a bit long for a children's book, I didn't even notice the length once I was whisked away into Harry's world. The twists and turns that Rowling puts in the story kept me turning the page until I was finished, and none of the pages include \\"fluff\\". I don't think Harry Potter is simply the new craze. I think this book is a classic in the making.If I had to choose something negative about it, it would be that some themes are recycled from other great fantasies like the Lord of the Rings and the Chronicles of Narnia. The idea that a mistreated, orphaned child can become a great hero is an idea that many writers have played with. However, I believe that most stories are interpretations and adaptations of new ones anyway, and this is Rowling's perspective on these ideas. Personally, I could read stories like these again and again without tiring of their repeated themes. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in no way lacks originality. The main characters are so real and unlike any others I've read about. Harry Potter will have even the most stubborn readers begging for more - luckily, there are six more books following this one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Of all the books that I have read, not one has caught my attention as much as this book has. This highly entertaining, and extremely vivid book kept me up all night until the very end. This book teaches several lessons to the children it is aimed at. It is a story of an orphan whose life magically changes. Harry Potter learns that he is actually a magical wizard with many powers which he is unaware of. At first his horrible uncle tries to stop Harry from attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft. With the help of an unwelcomed visitor, Harry is swept off his feet and taken to this magical school. He then meets up with two of his fellow classmates, who he shares most of his adventures with. From school bullies, to saving the school from extreme disaster, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone shows that children can make a difference in this world. This book also teaches children lifelong lessons they could not find in any ordinary children's book. This book contains the \\"intellectual backbone\\" which most books lack. Kudos goes out to Rowling in creating this book. He has really captured the essence of what a children's book should be. I consider myself a very selective reader, and if this book caught my attention as much as it did, I can only imagine what it did for avid readers. I encourage any person, young or old, to read this book. It would be time very well spent."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Well, I liked this alot. My copy is the Deluxe hardback of 'The Philosopher's Stone' with the velvet pagestrap. I prefer it to the cartoonish American copy with the illustrations.Too many people tell me that they do not want to read the Harry Potter books because they are overhyped. Well, they are. But they are not oversold. It's such a relief to see a children's book with such imagination and invention. Most of them seem to insult their intelligence or have dated characters. But the Harry Potter series takes place in it's own universe with it's own laws.I found this first novel to have a better mystery and set of circumstances than 'The Chamber of Secrets'. Some of the characters here did not seem to have a decent amount of space in the sequel. I haven't read 'Prisoner of Azkaban' yet but I hope that Hagrid, Dumbledore and even the Dursleys (comic relief) get a bit more room.If you're afraid that you won't enjoy the Harry Potter series because you are totally unfamiliar with them and feel kind of behind the rest of the fans then I must assure you that this novel is a gradual and enjoyable initiation. It's not a birth of fire, trust me. Everything is easy to get to grips with and sets up the characters for deeper story developments. If you want an introduction to this universe then 'The Philosopher's Stone' is a great start. Some say that you can read the Harry Potter books individually but I can't see the sense in this. Buy this 'un. You'll very much enjoy it and want more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This review is broken into two parts, the first section is why I enjoyed the book the second part is the book summary (DON'T READ THE SUMMARY IF HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK AND PLAN TO!)WHY I LIKE ITHarry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone is probably the best book I have ever read. The story keeps you reading page after page. This book is humorous, haunting, and suspenseful all at the same time. Even though there is no such thing as magic you can easily relate to the story. One example of something that you can relate to is Harry's commitment to sports when he has to get up for 6:00a.m for practice. Another thing that you can relate to is the rivalry between each house at Hogwarts (Hogwarts is divided into four houses which compete for house points and in Quidditch matches). This rivalry is similar to the rivalry between schools. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a humorous, fascinating, and captivating story to read. This book would be good for anyone whether magic is a topic of interest to you or not.SUMMARYHarry spends the first 10 years of his life sleeping in a cupboard under the stairs of a family who could not stand him. He believes his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon when they tell him that his parents had died in a car crash, and this is also how he received his lightning shaped scar.A mysterious letter is delivered by the friendly giant named Hagrid. Hagrid informs him that he has been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Hagrid also explains to Harry that his parents had died because of the evil powers of Lord Voldemort. The giant tells Harry is famous in the world of magic because he is the only one ever to survive after trying to be killed by Voldemort. The curse he attempted to set on Harry backfired at Voldemort and caused him to become so weak that he must live inside someone else.Soon enough, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig and that's where the real adventure begins. Hogwarts is a lot like English boarding schools, except that instead of classes in math and grammar, the curriculum features courses in Transfiguration, Herbology, and Defense Against the Dark Arts. Harry becomes the star player of Quidditch, a sort of mid-air ball game. With the help of his new friends Ron and Hermione, Harry solves a mystery involving a sorcerer's stone, a substance with astonishing powers that can make a potion that will make the drinker immortal. Harry must stop Professor Quirrell from reaching the Sorcerer's Stone so he does not give it to Lord Voldemort. To reach the Sorcerer's Stone, you must make your way through a maze which takes you past Fluffy, a giant three headed dog. You must try to find the correct key to the door out of hundreds of keys, and win a game of wizard's checkers against live pieces that could leave you flattened with one wrong move."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Best book I have ever read.

Please."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Jim Dale does an excellent job dramatizing the first book in the Harry Potter series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"i finally got to read a book without being told the ending before i finished"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As a youth, fantasy lit was for me a way of making a seemingly mundane life more interesting. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the kind of book that would have intrigued me at age 12 or there abouts--a young boy who's something of a misfit in his everyday life, suddenly discovers that he's actually much more. There's something secret, special, and interesting about him that nobody dared guess.As far as this theme goes, this book is one of many, nothing special. Heck, for a while, almost every Disney movie carried exactly this trope. What makes Harry Potter stand out is the creativity of J. K. Rowling. Is she a prose-master? Not exactly. But as fantasy lit for kids goes, the writing is intelligent, yet fast-paced and readable. The characters, both major and minor, are vivid, sympathetic, and brilliantly developed. Rowling's world-building skills are also incredibly good. The profusion of funny incidental items she introduces into the story, from the Nimbus 2000 flying broom to Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans help add a certain quirkiness that is undeniably charming.However, my opinion of the value of mainly escapist fantasy literature has changed substantially in the 25-odd years since I was 12. In the interim, I have realized that life itself is interesting enough and that if you're easily bored with it, it's most likely because you're a boring person. Therefore, for a book of this sort to have some real value--especially for younger readers--it needs to teach them something good and noble about real life outside of Hogwarts Academy. It is on this point that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone stumbles. My main criticism of the book can be summed up in one sentence:\\"Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking the rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it.\\" (pg. 181)Upon finishing the book, it was that sentence that stuck with me. To paraphrase the apparent message: rules are for stuck-up prigs, and if you want to get anywhere and have people like you, you need to break 'em with abandon, even if you lack the experience necessary to fathom why the rules are there in the first place. Again, this is a standard Disney-style trope that I have always hated. And to make matters worse, Harry and his friends are rewarded repeatedly in the aftermath of their rule-breaking. It was a disappointment to me (and a literary mistake, if I may be so bold) at the end that Harry and Gryffindor were awarded enough points at the last possible second to give them the House Cup. It actually made me feel bad for Slytherin--as a Philadelphia sports fan, I know that feeling of being ripped off by the officials all too well.This annoying element is mostly balanced out, however, by the overriding sense of good and evil that is present throughout the book. \\"There is no good and evil,\\" says the slavish and simpering Professor Quirrell, servant of the evil Voldemort, \\"only power and those too weak to seek it\\" (pg. 291). To its credit, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is not a relativistic book. Evil is well defined. Good is also presented, though perhaps a bit more vaguely and occasionally with a Machievellian undercurrent--in the fight against evil, the rules are not all that important. Love, particularly familial and self-sacrificial love, is also extolled.Having only read the first book in the series, I'll give Rowling the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the rule-breaking stuff. Perhaps she's got a reasonable explanation for it in the future volumes. I'll be looking for it as I read volumes 2 through 7. I must say, though, that there are plenty of fantasy lit books for young people out there that do a much better job of tackling the subject of good and evil than this one, among themNiamh and the Hermit: A Fairy TaleandDream of Fire.As for the common criticism that the Harry Potter series is a gateway to the occult, both Fr. Amorth, a famous exorcist, and Pope Benedict XVI (albeit before he was elected Pope) have warned about this, so the subject shouldn't be taken lightly. As far as I could tell, for a well-catechized young person over the age of 13 or 14, this book should cause no problem in that regard. However, if the reader is an impressionable child of 8 or 9 who is not well-catechized, I would be a lot more cautious. If they must read it, I would strongly encourage a parent to read along with them."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Like all of the Harry Potter books, they are a joy to read.

However, around that time I also heard that there was a planned 7 books that would deal with the adventures of Harry Potter and co. and of all of their cavorts in Hogwarts. Having always been inclined to marathon read series, and overall despising reading open ended series and waiting in anticipation for the next one, I did what many of the people in the world opted not to do... I waited until knowing the release date of the final book before I ever bought the first one. I kept telling myself all year I would start reading them in May, to give myself time to get geared up... and my co-workers at the book store I work at all hoped that I wouldn't be disappointed... not one iota. Potter is such a fun and delightful read how could I be disappointed? These books are right up my alley, and I look forward to cracking the next one later today.Now, as a bookseller, I constantly hear that people love or hate these books. The dividing line here is simple... they are fantasy books. Period. Not everyone gets there kicks on reading about the exploits of wizards, dragons, dealings with magic spells and curses, and the ever present uber bad guy ttrying to control all. I repeat... THESE ARE FANTASY BOOKS! Not everyone jives on fantasy. I however, reared on Narnia and Prydain and the likes of Baum and Wonderland and Earthsea appreciate Rowling's addition to what had become a stagnated genre. I also appreciate that her work has paved the way for the efforts of other authors who have done great things with the genre in her wake (Riordan and Obert Skye are the two that leap to the forefront of my mind).I'm going to go against my normal grain with reviews and not write a summary about the Potter books though, because realistically you can read a much better synopsis on Wikipedia if you choose to do so. However, I am very happy to say that 7 years of waiting on my part have been rewarded thusly.

That was at least what Aunt and Uncle Dursley told him. Harry was the uncool kid both at home and at school, hence constantly jumping from the frying pan into the fire. At home, \\"the Dursleys often spoke about Harry (...) as though he wasn't there--or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug.\\" Their spoiled son, Dudley, also did his best to bully Harry around. And at school, \\"Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.\\"Hence, when Hogwarts' half-giant gamekeeper told Harry that he was a wizard, he could hardly believe it. And when Harry stepped through the Leaky Cauldron onto Diagon Alley, everything was new and exciting. He had not had the slightest clue that such a world existed; accordingly he saw everything through the eyes of an amazed and hungry learner.And since I as the reader always walked by Harry's side, I, too, had this \\"sense of awe.\\" Together with Harry, I marveled at Gringotts Bank and its goblins, the power of the magic wands, the magic broomsticks, Platform 9 and the steaming Hogwarts Express, the gigantic school castle, the meeting hall with its enchanted ceiling, the moving staircases, the \\"living\\" paintings, the ghosts, the owl post, and numerous other things.Harry became like a two-year old toddler again who is excited about discovering the world, and as the reader I was a toddler with him. This is Fantasy at its best. The fact that J.K. Rowling made Harry an \\"outsider\\" to the world of magic is of great importance to the experience of the reader. Otherwise I would not have been nearly as astonished about the details of Mrs Rowling's world as I was. It also prevented the technological aspects of the Harry-Potter magic from totally disenchanting her world.Now to my re-reading of the \\"Philosopher's Stone\\" (I still like the original British title better than the \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\").I read the story again shortly after I finished the seventh book. Knowing where the story and characters are headed, many scenes now took on new significance. It was fascinating to read a particular passage and think: \\"Ah! Now I know why she put that in there.\\" I have to complement J.K. Rowling on having planned the seven books so well.Furthermore, reading the first book from the retrospective view of the whole series also makes a difference for the moral custodians among us. If you only read the first book, you might come away thinking that Harry Potter tries to justify the means by the end a little too much. Harry's magic is at first set into motion when he is \\"upset and angry\\", the toffee-nosed know-it-all Hermione turns likable by lying on Harry's behalf, and one of Harry's chief character traits is that of a rule breaker.Aside from the point that novels--including juvenile ones--don't have to portray their main characters as saints, the series has, in fact, turned out to be of great moral depth. Given Harry's final moral choices at the end of Book VII, Book I can now be seen as the beginning of a \\"Bildungsroman.\\" That is, a Coming Of Age Story in which Harry goes through all the stages of childhood and adolescence, to finally arrive at moral, social, and psychological maturity.If that is not an ideal way of making teenagers aware of their own journey to maturity, I don't know what is.- Jacob Schriftman, Author ofThe Crack Beneath the Worldsand Other Books"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"No surprise on the book being excellent, but Jim Dale's performance in reading the story is captivating. He adds voices, emotion, and excitement which make this far more enjoyable than watching the movie."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I write this review from not only the viewpoint of a mother but also as an avid reader and new JK Rowling fan. I had bought the American (Scholastic) version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for my then 11 year old child several years ago. I, like many other parents, thought it nothing more than a children's book and did not really have much interest in reading it at that time.It took 7 books and 5 movies, before I began to realize that maybe there was something to the Harry Potter books then just a children's tale. The 5th movie left me with a lot of unanswered and confusing questions to which my 17 year old replied,\\"If you want to know who, what, where, and when Mom, you NEED to read the books! I'm not going to tell you ANYTHING else!\\"So, I picked up her first book and proceeded to read the rest of the books in a matter of two months. By that time, I found myself addicted. These books literally are quite difficult to put down once you start. So here I am with my OWN Harry Potter book for my own collection.I find the UK version quite similar to the American version with perhaps a change in a handful of words here and there. I'm not sure why they felt the need to have an American version when the UK version reads perfectly fine.As it was JK Rowlings first venture, I think there a couple of areas which could have been better developed, but otherwise, I find the Philosopher's Stone a great read for readers of all ages with more emphasis to the teenage to adult population. With it's recurrent dark themes, it's definitely NOT a children's book.I recommend this book and this entire series to anyone who likes to read about a whole new world that exists in our imagination."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"EDIT: Some people mark audio reviews as \\"unhelpful\\", which I found strange, until I realized what Amazon does.-- They pool audio and text reviews and place all of those reviews on each of the products' pages, regardless of form the material is taking. You wouldn't expect a book review on the DVD's page. In this case, every word is the same, but a book review tells you only about the story, not the quality of the audio product.-- But any regular audiobook listener has experienced a great book poorly read, or hammed up, or a voice that grated on your nerves, or found a book you loved to listen to, but couldn't find the time to sit and read (Lord of the Rings for me).-- A review of the author's work tells you NOTHING about the audio, and yet, if you try and find what you're getting into, you have to sift through MANY book reviews before finding out the quality of the voice work, as most people have reviewed the author and the book, rather than the audiobook.-- So, here's a small review of the audiobook, if you're interested in purchasing that. If you're looking for a review of the author, I am not being unhelpful, but Amazon is. I will request that they change their policy and display the reviews separately.... Jim Dale is one of the best voice actors I've ever listened to and he brought the books to life an a way that reading could never do. I like reading, but it's really incredible to have someone put a different voice to every character, displaying the emotions and tone of the interactions.... They are a really phenomenal experience, and I've listened to them over again and again."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think she (J.K.Rowling) wrote a wonderful story. I have seen my own university life in this book. Friendship selection , the goods and bads , hated lessons and teachers :D , happiness and sadness all inside.I bet that first you think this is a children book. Yes it is but it is for adults who would like to return their young ages. Just ignore them whom says it is only for children because they are too old to understand being and living like a child in about their whole life.Happy reading ..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am re-reading Harry Potter from Book 1 after having finished the last instalment in the series recently. Almost a decade ago, when Harry Potter first exploded onto the literary scene, I was quite skeptical that a children's book could generate such interest. It was only upon reading [initially out of curiosity] that I found I loved it!Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a great book for any child and adult who loves stories about fantasy, magic, magical beings, and the themes of friendship, loyalty, and courage, among many others are sure to endear the book to future generations of readers. The character of Harry Potter in the first book is quite endearing, as he discovers his true identity, that of a gifted young wizard in the making, and not just a poor unloved orphan. Together with his two new friends, Ron Weasley & Hermione Granger, Harry unearths dark secrets at his school for magic, Hogwarts, and they embark on fascinating, dangerous adventures into a world of magic, good & evil.For those who 'dumb' down this series, I would like to say that I am a serious reader & book collector, a teacher and mother whose reading interests range from classics of literature [Austen, Bronte, Hardy & Dickens] to contemporary fiction and non-fiction, including of course, children's literature, and the Harry Potter series is truly deserving of its place in the annals of children's lit - any series that enraptures and captures the imagination of young and old alike deserves praise!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"this is the first time that i have read this book. yes i do know i am extremely late in reading these books; but there are some upsides to reading series alot later. the first and foremost importan reason is that i can read most of the books without having to wait for the other books to come out. i have seen the movies which has established the faces and the voices to the characters.. the only major problem i have now is not listening to people when they talk about the book in my presence. and yes i plan on reading the rest. i am surprised (but not really) that i did not pick this book up before. my mind has been filled with the grandeur of who jk rowling is and the beautiful imagination that she has. she is a captivating writer and has an extreme talent getting people to read again and actually enjoy it. thank you for that. i look forward to the next couple of weeks to finish these books. remain a kid at heart and see with it and the world will be whatever you make it to be."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I started reading Harry Potter when I was babysitting this ten-year-old, after he fell asleep I took his copy of the Sorcerer's Stone and read the whole thing in like two hours.In this book you meet young Harry Potter who lives with his Uncle and Aunt (The Dursleys) in London. The Dursleys hate Harry, especially their only son. Harry is forced to live in the small closet under the stairs, and is tormented by all three of them.One day they take Harry to the London zoo, where Harry hears snakes talking to him! He can't believe his eyes, and after that strange things begin to happen. Letters begin to pour into the Dursleys' home addressed to Harry. His uncle tears them up, and throws them into the fireplace without letting Harry read them. Finally, after the fireplace is flooded with letters, all addressed to Harry, his uncle makes the family spend the weekend at a lighthouse. That night the door is kicked open by a giant named Hagrid. He tells Harry that his is a wizard, and that his family (mom and dad) were also wizards, but they were killed by an evil spirit, and that is why he had to go live with the Dursleys.After that Harry is taken off to a hidden wizard's world, where Hagrid prepares him for his first year at school at Hogwarts school of Magic. Once at the school Harry makes friends with a boy named Ron, and a girl named Heromine. He also makes an enemy in a cruel boy named Draco Malfroy.Anyway, I'm not going to write spoilers incase you're the one person left in this world who hasn't read this book.All, I have to say is that this is a great series for kids, I don't care how old you're!!

I read them all in about a week and have been a fan ever since. These books are brilliant! As for the whole devil issue, does it ever say to worship witchcraft in the book? There is a certain element of choice in this. If you don't want to read the book, thats your choice and I'm not going to make your choice for you. But before you stop your kid from reading the book, you have to remember that everyone they know is going to be reading it, and that its not like they're going to become evil anti-christian devil-witchs just by reading a book. At least sit down and give them a fair chance to convince you to let them read the book. It's just a book, remember. The kid might not even like it!

Maybe so, but it just might motivate school-age children to read those authors after reading Rowling's novel. I personally applaud Rowling for rising above such nonsense as the Goosebumps books, and for spawning new interest in the genre of fantasy which carries messages about good v. evil, making choices, adopting principles and following one's ideals as well as one's heart. Although I think the book adopts a rather Star Wars-like feeling, including the use of the term the Dark Side, I would rather see young people READING about important themes than sitting in front of a movie or television screen WATCHING their portrayal. Rowling has a great imagination, and by reading her books, children (and adults as well) just might revert to using their own imaginations instead of ingesting what's thrown at them across a screen. It is much better to envision things in one's own mind by reading; Rowling helps save this endangered skill by motivating young people to read quality material.

Having read much on both sides of the debate (some of it seemingly written by persons who never read the book) I decided to read it myself and weigh in.As a Christian parent and homeschooler, I found the book far less dangerous than the (sometimes hysterical) nay-sayers. By the same token, while I thoroughly enjoyed the story, I can't find myself supporting those who suggest that the book (and the series) is the greatest work of genius in children's literature of our day!The issue of \\"witchcraft\\", \\"wizardry\\", etc. is a key for Christians, based on many teachings from Scripture and from the writings of the Early Church Fathers. By the same token, most Christians have learned to differentiate between actually engaging in the dark arts and fantasy literature. Time and space prevent me from going into detail here, but I would suggest that the interested parent would be well served by reading JRR Tolkien's excellent non-fiction essay \\"On Fairy Stories\\".Is \\"Harry Potter\\" a modern-day fairy tale? I'm not yet sure -- and this is a judgement I'm not prepared to make until all seven books have come out -- and I've read them all. However, it is quite clear that \\"Harry Potter\\" IS fantasy -- and fantasy literature cannot be judged in the same fashion one would judge real-life.In my opinion, \\"Harry Potter\\" contained many elements of satire -- satire which I feel sure goes over the head of most children readers. The stereotypes seem deliberate and just a bit over-the-top, which for me, was quite enjoyable. Such satire and social commentary is one of the delights of British children's literature -- and \\"Harry Potter\\" exhibits such in spades. Nevertheless, JK Rowling is NOT JRR Tolkien or CS Lewis. Don't go expecting a particularly high level of literary merit or you will be disappointed.My counsel to other Christian homeschoolers? Exercise caution; don't immediately condemn without first yourself reading a volume; and realize that the book IS fantasy. Your children will quickly realize that the book is fantasy as well, and the book could be used as a tool for sharing and reinforcing your own belief systems with your children.Use judgement. Use discernment. And use good common sense."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter & the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone is one of the great books of our era. Please do not interpret this review as concerning the BOOK; it concerns the PRODUCT on offer - the Kindle version that forces you to buy through Pottermore.My experience with Pottermore is perhaps the worst e-commerce experience I've had in half a decade. I attempted to buy the book from my Kindle, failed, then tried from my PC using Chrome (failed) and IE (failed). The result was the same on each attempt, a seemingly-endless churn followed by \\"The Webpage cannot be Displayed\\". This amazingly frustrating experience was followed, 12 hours later, by the discovery that Pottermore had charged my card.Okay, I thought, maybe the purchase went through and the site just glitched. Yay! I can get my e-Hogwarts after all! But no, Pottermore says that I have nothing in \\"My Books\\" and \\"My Orders\\" says that I never made a purchase. In other words, to add (financial) injury to insult (or at least aggravation), they took my money and gave me no book.I have no idea what business decision drove Scholastic and Rowlings to build Pottermore, nor what e-commerce newbies they chose to build it. I only hope that they will eventually come to their senses and sell through Amazon, a company with the ability and experience to actually fulfill eBook orders (and customer expectations). Until that time, I will content myself with my tattered paper copies when I need a wizarding fix."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter series is entertaining for the target age group and a nice diversion for the adult crowd. There is nothing overly difficult about reading these books and they are a quick one day read for most adults. There are some interesting child-sized philosophical questions for children (i.e. in the second book Rowling exposes the superficial as nothing more than a moron with a nice smile in Gilderoy Lockhart.) These books send a clear message that money, good looks and a fast broomstick are not the end all--that there is more to life than just the material.The only problem I have with Rowling's writing style is that she is not very tidy. Rowling leaves loose ends untied like how Harry got his invisible cloak back in the first book or how Harry got his wand back at the end of the second.Otherwise, Rowling is a natural with a knack for detail and wit. There is a great deal of tongue in cheek humor that had me, along with other adult readers I know, rolling. The books appeal to both children and adults with humor a child would not be able to understand, but presented in such a way that a child would never know they had missed something. This is a very sophisticated way to appeal to a larger audience and something Rowling should be applauded for.These books are great for reading outloud to children."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Well if you're looking at this product you're probably like me, busy and not the biggest fan of sitting down to read. I've always been a big fan of stories but I could just never find the time to read because of work and when I did I am admittedly an abysmally slow reader. After years of hearing how amazing these books, the Harry Potter series, were and loving every movie immensely it finally dawned on me to see if there was an audio book and there obviously is.When I first started listening to the series I must admit I was a little turned off because Stephen Fry came across as a little dry and I was beginning to think the audio books weren't going to be much more tolerable than simply reading the books. As new characters are introduced though I was pleased to find that he managed to give most of them a unique personality and even more so that he maintains these personas not just through this single book but all the way to where I am now, The Half Blood Prince. Aside from just their vocal definition Fry also manages to display a diverse range of emotion for each individual character as if there is a separate actor for each character, it's really quite an amazing performance in my opinion. At certain times various audio filters are added for dramatic effect like echo and things of the sort and I guess that's really the only place this audio book comes up short for me is that there really isn't a whole lot to it other than Stephen Fry reading the books. This being my first audio book I can't really compare it to anything but I guess I was expecting at least some music between chapters or maybe some ambient sound effects but I still find the overall experience enjoyable without them.There are probably hundreds of reviews for the books themselves so I'll keep my opinions on the series short and sweet. I believe the thing that I like most about the Harry Potter series is the overall charm of everything and the connection Rawling maintains to both the real world and real life. She really seems to nail human archetypes and the teenage inner dialogue and I can't help but think there are many pieces of her own children in this book. It showcases such an amazing insight as to the way people think and feel that I really can't help but be awe inspired. Like I said though, I'm not a big reader/listener so I imagine there are better books out there but that really doesn't take away from this series' ability to crack a smile on my face at work. I guess my only gripe is that it sometimes appears as if she has some favorite words or a limited vocabulary or perhaps people in England just find these words more common but there is an obtuse overuse of the words incredulous, glower, and one other that I will add in a couple of hours when I remember it. This obviously isn't a big deal but it can make me cringe a little.Anyways, I work in science and listen to these all day when I don't have to read for work and I'm actually doing lab work and they have improved my enjoyment at work immensely so they come highly recommended by me. Each book is probably about 18-24 hours long off the top of my head so the whole series should take you a while to get through. I hope you enjoy!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"JK Rowling has a knack for showing inner emotions of her characters, as well as justifying their responses to those emotions.Harry Potter is a young man who has been living with abusive relatives following his parents deaths.

As a baby Harry was orphaned and sent to live with his mean aunt, uncle, and cousin also known as the Dursley's. When Harry turned ten he learned the truth about his parents' death. He discovered that his parents were wizards, and that he was a wizard too. He also found that his parents died at the hands of an evil wizard, Lord Voldemort, but somehow Harry had survived and killed the evil wizard. Harry was then sent to the top wizardry school, Hogwarts, to learn how to perform magic. Harry adjusted to his knew life at Hogwarts quickly, but he started noticing strange happenings, and took it upon himself to find out what was hidden underneath the castle. He found out it was a Sorcerer's stone that could create gold and make it possible for the owner of the stone to live as he or she wants. The rest of the book is filled with the adventures of Harry and his friends trying to find out who had been planning to steal the sorcerer's, stone while at the same time trying to learn as much as they can at Hogwarts. There are many good things about this book. It is fresh, creative, and different from any other I have ever read. The author used a combination of mystery, adventure, and magic to come up with this wonderful book that anyone can enjoy reading. The book always keeps you in suspense so it is very hard to put down. I personally have a hard time finding a book I take pleasure in reading and so if I found it fun to read, most everyone else will love it too. The best part of the book would have to be its creativity. The author created an imaginary world full of witches and wizards who play Quidditch and cast strange spells on each other. There is always something new for Harry to learn about and a new mystery for him to solve. \\"A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence - the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note.\\" Page 206. This book is full of surprises. It has everything from screaming books to ghosts that haunt the hallways. There is never a dull moment. There is no way to describe how enjoyable it is to read a Harry Potter books, one just has to read it to understand how enchanting it is. The only downside to this book is that the beginning starts off slowly. There is a lot of background given describing what Harry's life was like before going to Hogwarts, which is not as interesting as the rest of the book. After the first few chapters the book becomes very engaging and is very hard to put down. I highly recommend this book to kids, teenagers, and adults. Everyone I know that has read this book has thoroughly enjoyed it and so will you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was very entertaining and realistic.

If literary quality depended upon majority vote, surely Rowling would be lionized as the author of the decade. I stand against the tide, I'm afraid, since I think that the attraction of the Potter series is that they are inferior rather than superior children's stories and thus better suited to a public more used to dealing on the level of half-hour sitcoms than with intellectual or literary challenges.I've collected children's literature since I was a child myself (30 years now, and the books overflow the shelves). Like many other kids, I was always fascinated by fairy tales, fantasies and stories of the supernatural. We didn't have Harry Potter back then, but we did have Tolkein's THE HOBBIT and LORD OF THE RINGS. Granted, the Rings series is a little tough for a ten-year-old, but for the pre-teens there was always ALICE IN WONDERLAND as well as Lloyd Alexander's wonderful BLACK CAULDRON and its sequels, C.S. Lewis's Narnia series, Carol Kendall's THE GAMMAGE CUP, Madeline L'Engle's WRINKLE IN TIME, Joan Aiken's WOLVES OF WILLOUGHBY CHASE and, for lighter fare, Eleanor Estes' delightful tales about the Witch Family.These were books that kept me and my school friends delighted and amazed. They fulfilled the charge of fantasy: challenged our assumptions, made us think about the world, and taught us to appreciate good writing. Harry Potter is a frothy, pleasant read but it does none of the above. That adults in the U.S. are reading it as well as children and that all are hailing it as some modern miracle of story telling signals only the poverty of our own literary experience and imagination and the power of a great marketing campaign. The U.S. has one of the most poorly-educated populations in the developed world (and falls well below many developing countries in literacy skills) and the apparent belief that Rowling's work is a watershed moment in literary history seems to bear that out.There are many wonderful and far less well-recognized writers of children's fantasy today. As an example, I particularly recommend the wonderful work of Virginia Hamilton, whose stories stimulate the imagination and feed the intelligence of young readers. Compare her remarkable SWEET WHISPERS BROTHER RUSH to Rowling's work. Also check out Philip Pullman's exciting series starting with THE GOLDEN COMPASS."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Fantasy and science fiction stories have always been a good choice to read and escape reality and create a mystical world to stimulate one's imagination. &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; is a exciting story about a young orphan boy who finds out he has mystical powers and is being chased by a renegade wizard. He also has all sorts of adventures at the school in which he was accepted to. There is never a dull moment in this story, there is always someone causing trouble or amusing magic that the children have to try to perform in thier class. For example, the kids have to turn one thing into something else for an exam. Almost around every turn there are other mythical animals around that get involved in the plot like centaurs, dragons and unicorns.

You don't have to read just one and figure out what will happen to Harry you can find out by reading the rest of them.

I was there on a mission's trip and could not put it down. Since then I have read it at least 30 times and have lent it out to as many people as possible, and all have loved it. My aunt, who is an editor, loved it as much as me! The reason I think most people find it so enjoyable is the way J.K. Rowling reveals things to the reader. She adds things that you just skip over, thinking it is just part of the book, then you get to the end and think &quot;Oh yeah! So that's what it was!&quot; Then you re-read it and find clues throughout the whole book. It is just as good the second time you read it. (and the third and the fourth and the fifth...)

Rowling is an amazing author who uses many literature techniques to keep the story interesting and entertaining. Her character development and descriptions are amazing. Many criticize her for writing about witches, spells, and pagan ideas. Many also criticized Roald Dahl and other outstanding authors for similar things. Take it for what it is: a well-written fantasy story involving fictional characters and events. Don't ascribe real-life moral statements to it or you will start motivating weak-willed people to try to turn it into reality! Here's my view: Rather than censoring this book from your children (thereby motivating them to read it anyway---those of you who have kids know this will happen), read it before them and read it with them. Teach them to distingish between fantasy and reality, and what it means to have both. What is really real? Certainly not Harry Potter and his friends. Teach them the necessity of having some fantasy in your life, whether it manifests itself in writing, reading, singing, or playing music. As a conservative myself, believe me when I say that book-burning and censoring statements get us nowhere.Read this book and read the whole series. Take it for what it is: an extremely well-written and entertaining piece of fiction. Enjoy it!

Rowling is one of the new greats in children's literature. Harry is abused physically &amp; emotionally, little-knowing that he has a heritage to be proud of. The far-reaching love of his parents &amp; the steadfast (but far from perfect) friends he makes at school give the story life &amp; depth. Nearly every name has a deeper meaning. Excellent reading for anyone 10 or older! FYI, this is NOT a primer for Neo-Pagan religion (Christmas &amp; Easter are celebrated at Hogwart's). If this is a concern for a parent, read &amp; discuss the book with your child. But this book by no means deserves to be banned for that reason."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone's easy vocabulary and astounding, imaginative idea makes it one of the best books for all ages ever written.

They don't respect Harry too much(they make him sleep in a tiny room under the stairs).

We just finished HP and the Sorcerer's Stone, and we thoroughly enjoyed it! I loved hearing the girls laugh out loud throughout the novel.

I haven't had this much fun since &quot;STAR WARS.&quot;(If the movie can catch even a fourth of the magic it should be a big hit!) This book has a lot of wisdom and entertainment for both kids and adults and bridges a gap for the generations, like a good Disney movie only better! I like a a lot of the insights and philosophies that the book gives through the use of a great story and characters, one of the biggest being (for me) that 1.)things are not always as they appear to be and 2.) pure evil and take on many forms. I can't read the rest in the series it sounds like they are also fun and well thought out.

I wanted to see what all the hubub was about. I was taken by surprised....this book is about a 10 year old boy who is a wizard and has a great adventure at wizards school. I am an adult and I read this book cover to cover in a single night (about 4 hours). The story flows and is easy to read. Like I said in my title; a fun book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I may be there very last person on the planet to jump on the Harry Potter bandwagon, but that doesn't mean I'm any less ardent of a fan. Sure enough, this is a children's book that appeals just as much to adults as to children of all ages. J.K. Rowling has successfully woven together all sortsof cultural icons, myths and legends and created a wonderfully appealing world inhabited by dragons, vampires, unicorns, griffins, trolls, witches, centaurs, warlocks, ghosts and giants. Its a place that will appeal to any child's imagination, and adults will be impressed with Rowling's blend of reality and fantasy.Harry Potter is an engaging lead character. He is an outcast at home who discovers he is famous in a world he never knew existed. He's clever but modest, loyal to his friends but not above holding a grudge against those who deserve it, brave in the face of danger but scared of failure. The secondary characters are broadly drawn, but subtlety would be misplaced in this forum. They are by turns outrageous, humorous, frightening and silly. If only people in the real world were so easily classified!In many ways &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a long introduction to the entire series. The first half of the book basically consists of introducing Harry, explaining the world of magic, and describing life at Hogwart, the boarding school for budding witches and warlocks. The plot doesn't begin to coalesce until about two thirds into the book and then it moves quickly and its filled with thrilling adventures. Parents, you may be buying this book for your kids, but don't miss out on this great read yourself!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As the editor of the children's section in our local newspaper, I had heard a lot about the Harry Potter phenomenon. I never even considered reading the books for myself until one of my co-workers recommended I read 'The Sorcerer's Stone.' He had just finished reading it and was impressed with it. A few days later I saw the book in the store and bought it on impulse. Three weeks later, I've read all four Harry Potter books and can't wait for the next one. As an adult reader, I was impressed with the thought Rowling put into her characters and their world. She takes the time to create a magical world so vivid it's hard to believe it exists only in the books. Her use of word roots is amazing. Above all, she seems to honestly respect the kids who read her books - she never talks down to them or oversimplifies her stories. I can't say enough good things about the Harry Potter books and J.K. Rowling. These are the best new books I've read in a long time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My daughter (11) received the first Harry Potter book &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; for Christmas in 1998. On our travel the next year she read the book 19 (nineteen!!) times. She got completely hooked! All I heard was Harry Potter this and Harry Potter that... At the end I was fed up, wondering what all this fuzz was about and I decided to read the book myself.To my surprise I really enjoyed the book. The book put you in this wonderful imaginary world, filled with suspense and mystery. In Harry Potters' world we meet a constant battle between the good and the evil. There are not too many characters that could confuse children, and there are some very interesting twists in JK Rawlings' novel. This book was a pleasant escape from reality and a very enjoyable read.Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Being a lover of good books and a hater of trends and pop icons, I wasn't very interested in the Harry Potter craze. When I finally broke down, however, I was more than pleasantly surprised. Harry Potter is a bright character who's joy and sadness can reach out beyond the pages of the book and pull the reader into the world of Hogwarts. No, it's not The Lord of the Rings, but who would want it to be? It's meant as children's literature. The hyperbolic exageration is for effect, and thought it seems unrealistic, it merely makes the underlying morals and values less ostentatious. It's a story of friendship and of acceptance, of fitting in when you most want to be like everyone else, and yet still being an individual. I would recomend this book to anyone, any age. Everyone can learn from the innocent, childlike charm of the Boy Who Lived."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I was in middle school I was fortunate enough to fall into a series of books by Piers Anthony. The adventures of the generations of characters in the magical otherworld of Xanth swept me along adolescence. I read and re-read &quot;A Spell for Chameleon&quot; and &quot;Castle Roogna&quot; and wanted to learn from Good Wizard Humphry and try and avoid dragons and ogres in a land that strangly resempbled the Florida peninsula. I would become addicted to the fantasy genre. These books were funny, whimsical, and loved to poke fun at the unmagical, &quot;normal&quot; world of Mundania.I heard about the Harry Potter series a couple of years ago and I was reminded of my young love for the land of Xanth. In many ways, us adults could learn much from our young people. After reading &quot;The Sorcerors Stone&quot; I know that I will run out and get the other 3 books and the rest of the series to come. We should hold on to those fantastic childhood imaginations.We have too many Muggles (unmagical persons) today. They have lost that magical enjoyment from their childhood. Remember when we were kids we would have vivid battles against wizards and dragons and knights--riding to the next castle for another adventure? Sometime around 5th grade we begin to become conscious of the &quot;adult&quot; world and want to read &quot;young-adult&quot; books &amp; magazines. We began to dream about having a nice hot-rod or falling in love. We desired to be adults and began to act older--or tried to. But in the growth we began to lose the &quot;magical qualities&quot; in our imagination. Heck, anymore I am noticing parents, like myself, of young children who actually want their kids to &quot;get ahead&quot; on their education with prestigious schools or day-cares. Or they put them in skating or swimming or gymnastics classes at age 3 and competitive sports camps in the summer. They are starting earlier in robbing their kids' magical childhood!Now consider this--what if about that same year--about age 11, you were sent to a school that would not allow you to lose your magical talents? Not only that, it encouraged it. HA! I would have wanted in that school in a heartbeat. The funny thing is, that with how many parents want their kids to grow up too soon, I can understand how their own kids have made the adventures of Harry Potter even bigger. He's the hero they may have always wanted to be.This is a great book because it is a great story. It's simple (why do too many Muggles think great books have to be complicated?), the characters are thought out (simple? yes, but NOT two dimensional like in some young adult stories) and lovable. And the greatest praise one can heap on to any fantasy classic from &quot;The Hobbitt&quot; to the C.S. Lewis' &quot;Narnia&quot; Series to Terry Brooks' &quot;Shannarra&quot; Series (and my favorite Xanth books) and the Potter books is that they are BELIEVABLE! All great novels are believable, but for a fantasy book it is what makes it an absolute classic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The whole Harry Potter series of books is a must read for people of all ages. It's tremendously entertaining characters and plot twists keep the reader on the edge of her seat throughout. One doesn't need to be a child to enjoy the entire series (I'm 38). There are at least 3 more books yet to come. I can't wait!!The person who wrote &quot;WHY would you let your child READ this???&quot; is obviously a twit. Not all people have the same paranoid beliefs that you have lady."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Dear JK Rowling, I want to write to thank you for starting this series that has gripped the world. I admire you for your imagination. I have only read the first book in your series, The Sorceror's Stone, and I was delighted to read about characters that could do magical things, and and where the good guys always win. I am happy that kids all across the country, and probably all around the world are trading in TV for one of your books. Thanks to you, reading has become fun for kids of all ages. Kids? Yes, even adults like your books, so they have fun reading to their children. I am looking forward to reading your second book. I, and many others, hope you go writing about your adorable character Harry!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was pleasantly surprised when I started devouring this masterpiece.

I could say so much about this book, but I don't want to give too much away. I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series. I predict a classic in the making.

His cousin is a spoiled brat. then after his eleventh birthday some wierd unknown person sends Harry so many letters, but his mean uncle wont let him read them. In the end Harry manages to steal a letter from his ucle . The letter turned out to be an invitation to a much happier place than living in a closet card board box that was his so called room.

I think everyone should read the series in 7th grade to forever."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is an entertaining read for adults and kids. It uses quirky charaters and a sense of humour to keep you interested. If you like Potter books, you must read early James P Blaylock, especially The Elfin Ship (1982), The Disappearing Dwarf (1983), and the Stone Giant(1989). In fact I think Rowling is borrowing largely from Blaylock (who borrowed largely from Tolkien)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I simply love Harry Potter books.

This book will leave you 100% speechless, until after about a week, when you can gain composure! LoL!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is totally awesome! It works in so many different ways. The book has elements of mystery and fantasy, and also has a sense of humor. Hogwarts sounds like a really cool place. The best thing about this book is that Harry Potter had a really hard life before he went to Hogwarts, with his parents and school and stuff, and now he has friends, adventures, is famous and is good at a sport. I certainly wish I could get away from the Muggle (non-magic) world and go to Hogwarts, where I'd have friends and a lot of fun. I'm not much of a reader, but I enjoyed this book a lot. I got addicted and couldn't wait to read the second book. I even enjoyed this the second time I read it.

Everyone talks about the boy who lived which was Harry Potter. Harry Potter comes to the Dursleys when he is just a baby. Over the years, Harry lived in a cupboard under the stairs of the Dursley's home. As the days pass by, the Dursleys receive letters by the hundreds that were for Harry, though the letters didn't say who they were from. They eventually have to move away from their home and end up in a shack. While they stay at the shack, Hagrid, a Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts, comes to the shack to deliver the letter that Harry never opened. Hagrid describes the letter and the school that Harry will be going to. Harry will be going to Hogwarts: School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry thought that something like this never existed. Hagrid and Harry leave the shack and go to Diagon Alley to get the supplies Harry needs for Hogwarts. After, Harry returns with the Dursleys and counts the days until he goes to Hogwarts. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley (the Dursleys) drop off Harry at the train station. Harry can't find the platform from which the train will leave. The Dursleys leave Harry all alone. Mrs. Weasley, a mother of children who will also go to Hogwarts, helps Harry find his way to the platform. Harry has to run into a wall that is between platforms nine and ten. Harry catches his train and meets one of Mrs. Weasley's sons, Ron. They meet many people and have candy. After the train ride, Hagrid leads the fist years to the entrance of Hogwarts. Then, Professor McGonagall leads them to the Great Hall where the will be sorted by the Sorting Hat. The students will be sorted into houses. The four houses are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. After the sorting, the students and the teachers have a great feast and the students go to their designated house areas. The next day the students go to their classes and Harry's enemy at the school, which he first meet at Diagon Alley named Draco Malfoy, tells him to go to the trophy room to have a duel. Draco never shows up and during that same day, Harry gets chosen as the Seeker for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. On the day before Halloween, Harry receives his new broomstick. On Halloween, while the students and the teachers have a Halloween feast, a troll comes into Hogwarts and everyone goes to their designated house areas. Harry and Ron see that Hermione (their friend) is trapped in the bathroom with the troll and both boys save her from the troll. Harry has his first Quidditch match and wins for his team. Christmas comes around and the students get presents. Harry, Ron and Hermione look up Nicolas Flamel. During the night, Harry goes to the restricted area of the library to see if they have anything on Nicolas Flamel. Harry wears an invisibility cloak to get there. Someone notices he is there and Harry makes a run for it. He comes across a room where there is a mirror that showed his whole family. He goes to the mirror several times after that. Harry, Ron, and Hermione finally find out who Nicolas Flamel is. Then the Gryffindor team plays another Quidditch match and win. Hagrid wins a dragon and then has to give him away because the dragon was illegal. Harry and Hermione get caught in the hallway after they gave the dragon away. They get punished and their punishment is going to the Forbidden Forest. Harry spots a hooded figure drinking unicorn blood and is suddenly rescued by a centaur. After, in the boys dormitory in the Gryffindor house, Harry finds the invisibility cloak under his bed sheets. All students at Hogwarts take their final exams. Harry decides that he should go through the trapdoor under Fluffy (a three- headed dog) to get hold of the Sorcerer's Stone. The Sorcerer's Stone is very powerful and if Voldemort gets hold of it (a powerful wizard who takes form in someone else's body as well as killed Harry's parents) he will have ultimate power. Harry, Ron, and Hermione get under the invisibility cloak to go to the trapdoor. They get past Fluffy and through the chambers which lead to the Sorcerer's Stone. Harry finds Voldemort in the form of Professor Quirrell. He forces Harry to tell him where the stone is but Harry refuses to say. The side of Professor Quirrell grabs Harry's arm and Harry falls down unconscious. Harry is taken to the hospital wing at Hogwarts and is greeted by friends and Professor Dumbledore (headmaster of Hogwarts). Professor Dumbledore says that the stone has been destroyed because it was for the best. Professor Dumbledore also said that Voldemort still lurks around, but not in Professor Quirrell's body because he died. All the students and teachers have the end-of-year feast. Gryffindor wins the house cup and the students are packed up to go back home on the train. Everyone says goodbye to Harry. Ron and Hermione do as well when they get off the train and are at the regular train station. The Dursleys pick up Harry and he says he will have the best summer ever."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"An orphan boy, a magical school, and a noseless villan.

My mistake. Sure, it's written for a younger audience, but I found the writing to be very good and the story was engaging and lays the groundwork for what I assume will be the more complex plot elements to come."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"That I am just now reading the Harry Potter series would surprise no one who knows me. I'm usually a good 3-5 years behind trend. Harry Potter has legions of adoring fans and noted detractors, who are in turn drowned out by the passion of Harry Potter fans. I understood nothing of HP before I read my first book, which was ironically book three: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. After reading the first book I'm now proud to say that I am a fan, maybe not to the extent that some people are, since I've largely missed being on the ten year journey of most Potter fans. I'm also living proof that you can still get something out of the books, even if the wave has driven past you.What impressed me is that J.K. Rowling didn't fall into the trap of many authors of young adult literature by creating these clich&eacute; stock characters that appear built out of cardboard. Furthermore, every detail of the world of Harry Potter feels as though it was meticulously crafted by a painter or a sculptor rather than an author--true talent indeed. Even seemingly minor characters are intimately fleshed out. I think its' these two factors that give Harry Potter its' unique place in contemporary literature. I decline to provide a plot summary, because so many reviewers have done those already, and plus Harry Potter is really about an experience that goes deeper than a book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I finally gave in and read my first Harry Potter book. I haven't seen the movies, but thought that it's time for me to finally read this new children's classic. I found it light, entertaining, and fun. But was it as great as many people claim? Unfortunately, I wasn't as hooked as many others have been. I enjoyed it, but am not sure if I need to read the rest of them.I'm a much bigger fan ofJ.R.R. Tolkien Boxed Set (The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings). These books are masterpieces, in my humble opinion.

Because of JK Rowling's style and excellent imagery, it is easy to immerse into Harry's world, and any person with a heart will want to root for Harry as he leaves his miserable life with the Dursleys and enters into the magical world of Hogwarts where he will find new friends and enemies. From the lovable Hagrid to the hatable Malfoy to the confusing Snape, Harry's world is filled with fascinating characters. Compared to other books that follow a hero on his journey, Harry Potter stands out because the characters and themes that are easy to relate to, and you just want to keep reading. The classic plot of \\"good versus evil\\" is appealing to most people, and Harry's innocence makes him a character that we really feel that we get to know. There is really nothing that I did not like about this book. From the opening pages to the suspenseful ending, I was hooked on the story."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter had me hooked from the beginning. I remember being skeptical about this series, but I decided to see what all the fuss was about, and was not disappointed. A great story, and a great series. I had read it several times, and never get tired of it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an exiting and adventerous book and I highly reccomend it for people who have never read the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"At this point, over 2000 people have reviewed this book. As I opened the review form, I wondered what the chances are of anyone actually reading my review, however, I decided I should give it a shot. I got a copy of this book quite by accident last summer, and took it along on vacation as some light reading. I started it one day, and finished it within a matter of hours. I decided that this was a really good book. Now, me reading a book and liking it is not unusual. I'm quite a fan of fantasy, and of childrens books, and of British humor in its various forms. However, the fact that I read the book three times straight through during the next week is unusual for me. I'll recommend this book to anyone, regardless of age, gender, or whether or not you like to read. There's just something about Harry Potter. . . hmm, must be magic!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book is easy and fun (for the most part) to read, somewhat addictive.I also thought it was simplistic and low-quality work. Definitely not a classic.It does not come close to good ol' Lord of the Rings or A Wizard of Earthsea (a less well-known but very exciting and thoughtful magic adventure from which Harry Potter borrows some of its plot, but unfortunately not much more)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After hearing so many recommendations on a Georgette Heyer listserv I belong to, I tried out HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE. I was quickly drawn into Harry's world, and I just had to read the others in the series.J. K. Rowling has created a very detailed world that people of all ages will find enchanting. Harry quickly earns our sympathy when we meet his horrible family, the Dursleys. We share Harry's joy when he escapes their clutches to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he is appreciated for the first time he can remember. Hurrah for Harry Potter and J. K. Rowling!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"These books are not only for children. I am in my 50's and the mother of 5 kids. We all need a great escape once and a while and these books are marvelous! You will not be able to put them down! What a great kid Harry Potter is."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Originally, I was loath to succumb to all the mania surrounding the Harry Potter series. However, recently I was lucky enough to come across a copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I initially began to read it as a last ditch effort to fend off the encroaching boredom of Summertime, but, much to my own initial horror, I began to enjoy the thing!Rowling's first book is a clever, moving, and surprising narrative squarely-set in the distinguished tradition of Roald Dahl, C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien. (She even abbreviates her name like them, which is cute.)I'm glad that, for once in this age of N Syncs and Britney Spears, mainstream American pop culture has seized upon something with a refreshing measure of intellectual and emotional heft.I will soon be acquiring the remaining books in the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter has lived a dismal life with his aunt and uncle, the Dursleys. He sleeps in a closet and has never had a birthday party or Christmas presents. Even worse, he has to endure life with his horrible spoiled cousin, Dudley. Then on Harry's eleventh birthday, things change when a letter arrives, (by owl), inviting him to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Suddenly Harry finds himself among friends, learning about potion-making and magic-wand waving and broomstick riding. There're chocolate frogs and Every Flavor Beans and a three-headed dog and Quidditch-a game better than soccer. Also, Hagrid, a lovable gamekeeper who befriends Harry; Hermione Granger, a witch who's read all the school books and knows all the rules; and there's Ron Weasly, Harry's best friend who has quite a legacy of his own to fill. Hogwarts treats him well, even with the abomidable Malfoy's mean tricks or Professor Snape's obvious hatred of Harry. The soon Harry finds himself in the middle of a mystery at Hogwarts, and together with his two new friends, embarks on adventures he never dreamed possible.The book is engaging with its imagery, humor, plot twists and real-life child problems. The book doesn't only appeal to children but adults as well. She's a master on fantasy. She really can, with no difficulty at all, think herself back to 11 years old. You will love the whimsical descriptions, humorous quotes and the fun characters."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"You can not imagine what a good fantasy book is until you've read the Harry Potter books. It made me stay up till midnight reading because it was so suspenseful. I'm a big fan of fantasy books and Harry Potter is by far the BEST I've read. I can't wait for the 4th book to come out!I guarantee that people of ANY age would absolutely love this book! You may think that a magical school for witches and wizards that has magical creatures and such could never be realistic...but the author(Rowling), puts in great descriptions and characters and there are surprises almost every time you turn the page. This book made me BEG my parents for the other 2 and I(very excitedly) recieved them at Christmas. I got started the next day. You may think this book is just for little kids but I've been reading some of these reviews and there're quite a few adults who gave this book high ratings.If you were to get this book, you would probably fly through the chapters not being able to wait for what's happening next. All of these questions started to build up in my mind in every one of these books. It's a great book...period."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is the best I've read in years. J.K. Rowling can create characters children can relate to and still write a book that you just can't put down, unlike other fantasy stories. It wanders from the classical good X evil stories into creative situations. Details are explained gradually, building a storyline that never bores or confuses the reader. This book is as perfect for children as it is for teenagers, and it deserves every award it won."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After wondering what the big fuss was all about, I went and picked up a copy for myself...and I must say I'm quite impressed! Even for a very discriminating longtime fantasy fan like myself. Hey, I haven't even reached the very ending yet, but I am still quite swept away by J.K. Rowling's very wild and colorful imagination despite the much simpler sentence structure and lower vocabulary level obviously intended for the younger audience.Harry Potter's very first adventures all begun when wizards all over a hum-drum English town suddenly began celebrating joyously at the very news of a baby being saved from an evil warlock's deadly clutches. Unfortunately, the innocent little boy had to be placed with a rigidly conservative family who didn't want anything to do with anything out of the ordinary. So for the next ten years, Harry had to live in the shadow of Dudley, a very selfish, overcoddled brat of the pig-headed Mr. Dursley and the prissy Mrs. Dursley. But his unhappy life suddenly takes a very unexpected turn when a mysterious letter came through the mail slot - addressed to HIM! So Harry finds himself a celebrated young hero being groomed for his enrollment at a very special wizarding school! Now Harry has lots of friends, good food to eat, and very hair-raising adventures in the dark halls of the great castle where he now lives and studies! But that's not all...Harry Potter is suddenly faced with a whole army of enemies ranging from an arrogant classmate to a mean old teacher to a HUGE three-faced monster guarding a very secret treasure that he himself must uncover!A very wacky roller-coaster ride through Harry Potter's startling experiences that all kids can very easily relate to, like the very first days of school and dealing with cruel relatives who don't really love you at all as well as the even crazier parts of life in fantasyland such as a bank ran by goblins, a dormitory haunted by ghosts, candies full of trading cards, a talking sorcerer's hat, and a wizardy version of a basketball game where the players all ride on broomsticks! Very rollicking indeed!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"At first, I thought that the idea of Harry Potter was a little hokey... I wasn't a big fan of fantasy books when it came out. I mean, sure, I liked The Chronicles of Narnia, but that was about it. So, I finally got the courage to get Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for myself. Let me tell you, it's a good book. Most people, by now, have at least some idea of what it's about: an orphaned boy lives with his mean aunt and uncle, where he lives in a tiny cupboard under the stairs. But then, he gets accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There, he finds out that he's well-known all over the wizard world, and that he himself is a wizard. It's at Hogwarts where he finally makes friends, and gets involved in many fun adventures. Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down until my mom knocked on my bedroom door, worried that I might have passed out or something. The ending of this story (which I won't spoil) is very surprising, and unlike many books and movies, where I can always guess the ending, J.K. Rowling had convinced all the way up to the last chapter of the book where the big secret is revealed. I don't care if you're a kid or an adult, you've got to read this book! If you don't, then you have no idea what you're missing out on."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"&quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone&quot; by J.K Rowling is the best book I have ever read. It is suspensful, entertaining and just plain wonderful. From my view, every child by the age of 14 should have read if not the first but all of the Harry Potter books. My older sister (age 13) did not want to read this, although her two best friends read this book and loved it. By the title it seems not very interesting to older kids! But as soon as you turn the first page you get hooked. Some people are sarting to try to &quot;ban&quot; Harry Potter because of the black magic mentioned in the book, but after reading, it made me less scared of the scary things 10 year olds imagine, such as goblins, ghosts and witches. I have been able to go to bed without looking under the bed. Harry Potter does not influence anything bad. It says how black magic is evil and bad but it does not promote it. Anyone who thinks that these books are woryhless, they are CRAZY! Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is a wonderful book that everyone should read... even adults."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"superb, delightful, magnificent, a majical journe"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Some people may criticize this book for it's portrayal of wizardry.

It is amazing the imagination J.K Rowling has (considering the fact that she's an adult). I am a huge fan of Mrs. Rowling and I hope she continues writing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a book full of magic and adventure. The book begins with the Dursleys, a family who likes to be normal. Mrs. Dursley has a sister whom she never likes to mention. Mrs. Dursley's sister was a witch and her husband was a wizard. The reader soon learns that Mrs. Dursley has a nephew, Harry Potter, who is the same age as her son. Voldemort, a bad wizard, murdered Harry's parents. They lived in a totally different world; a world full of witches and wizards and magic, somewhat different than the world Harry will be encountering. Harry comes to live with the Dursleys because of the death of his parents. The Dursleys are not happy about his presence in their home. Harry begins to receive letters, but he is not able to read them. Mr. Dursley will not let him read the letters because he does not want Harry to know about his parents. The Dursleys are too worried about their reputation to even allow Harry to know the truth about his parents. Along comes Hagrid, the groundkeeper at Hogwarts Academy, a school of magic. He has been sent to fetch Harry and bring him to school at Hogwarts. Once Harry meets Hagrid, his journey has begun. Harry is not aware of this, but he is a legacy in this other world. His name is known by everyone because Voldemort, the powerful and bad wizard did not have the power to kill Harry. The book continues with the adventures of Harry and his friends at Hogwarts. The beginning of the book is like an overview which leads to an encounter with Voldemart in the forest. Voldemort is on a mission to get the Sorcerer's Stone, \\"the Elixir of Life.\\" Harry's determined to get the Sorcerer's Stone because Voldemort wants it. The reader is taken on a mission/ a game to prevent Voldemort from getting the sorcerer's stone. Harry is able to overcome Voldemort because of his friends' help. Harry's friends, Ron and Hermione, help him with the chess game and the logic puzzle. This allows Harry to advance to the next level of the mission. Essentially, the help of Harry's friends allows him to be victorious over the evil forces.This book is such an adventure. I'm surprised that I enjoyed it so much, since it is a children's book.

For example a \\"three headed dog\\" or \\"invisibility cloak\\" which made Harry invisable whenever he put it on. That is why i believe that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a great book.

I found this volume, perhaps, one of the weaker. It's villain is not quite as dark and scary as Rowling will provide us with later. But I really enjoy her jokes.

Being an adult, the obvious resistance to reading a &quot;children's book&quot; was evidently there, but once the barrier was broken down, the first chapter read, I was hooked.'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is the first of seven books (four completed at the time of this review) which center around a young boy named Harry Potter. He is a wizard (though he doesn't know it yet), and comes from wizard parentage. His parents are dead, having been killed when he was a year old by an evil Dark Lord, Voldemort. Harry was the only one to survive the attack by Voldemort, which left him with a lightning scar on his forehead. Voldemort's failure to kill Harry pushed him into hiding, and the wizard world has been a fairly safe place in his absence.The book begins on Harry's 11th birthday, when everything starts falling into place. He begins to learn about his true identity, and is soon whisked off to Hogwarts (the school of wizardry). How he gets there, and what happens *after* he gets there, I will not disclose here - that is the entire fun of this wonderful book.Though this is supposed to be a &quot;children's book&quot;, I found it terribly engaging as an adult, and even wondered if some aspects of it would go over the heads of alot of kids. It is written crisply, cleanly, and with much heart. I was awed by so many of the things which happened in the story, every chapter revealing a new magical journey. The author, J.K. Rowling, has invented some new wizards and creatures, but has also borrowed some, most notably from Greek mythology. They are all meshed together well into a beautiful book full of good values, and a smashing showdown between good and evil.Parts of 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' were sometimes frustrating, because you wanted to yell at the protagonist kids &quot;Go and tell one of the adults what's going on!&quot; The book is littered with wise wizard professors, but rarely do the kids (who are, of course, the main players) go to them for guidance. I found that aspect a little grating, but then realized that this is a &quot;children's book&quot;, and as such, the &quot;children&quot; must be the heroes, solving the puzzles (mostly) on their own.The book works well on its own, so even though it is the first part of a seven-part work, you will not be left with huge loose ends. However, *some* things are left unanswered, and the desire to read the second entry, 'The Chamber of Secrets', is most high. This is a nice, magical, adventure-filled story which has alot of proper values to teach to children, underneath all the magic. I also suggest reading it aloud, if you have a reading partner (child *or* adult) - it makes the experience that much the better."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My youngest brother read this book and loved it.

Well, finally I agreed to read a few chapters. I couldn't put it down. When people came into my room to talk to me, I would get mad at them. I only wish that all of the books children read to-day were as well written and excercising of their imaginations."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is a fantastic character! Everything about this book was so cool. I loved all the characters and all the details in the book. It was so much fun to read and I can't wait for the 4th book to come out. If you haven't read these books you don't know what you're missing......"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Every one will love this book. It's very funny and suspensful. When I read it I found it almost impossible to put down. I recomend it to any one whatever age they are."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Imagine being the most unpopular and misrable person in all England, But in the fantastic and Magical world you are popular and famous. That is what life is like for Harry Potter in Harry Potter and the Philosophers stone. Harry Potter is about a boy whos parents were killed by an evil wizard thats when he goes to live with his Aunt and Uncle who treat him very very badly! Then he gets a letter that changes his life forever. A few hours later he finds himself on a train going to Hogwarts and strange and wonderful school where he has many adventures with his two friends Herimone and Ron. From dragon eggs, trolls and giants to men with two faces and magical mirrors. I highly recommend Harry Potter and the Philosophers stone to everybody! It has everything you would want in a good fantasy. This Book is fantastic!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I first read the Sorcerers Stone before all the hipe about it came. I thought it was a wonderful book and it was one of the few books I finished in one night. It fully deserves its five stars. But it does not deserve all the hipe. Harry Potter is very fun to read but once its over its over. It never makes you think at all. People who say it is their favorite book have not read enough (or the right) books. In the few emotional or sad parts of the books you really don't care. You don't feel anything in the entire book. For a book to be a favorite, you have to feel something, somewhere in the book. That never happens in Harry Potter. If you somehow haven't read the book yet, buy it. It is excellently written and is really enjoyable to read. If you have read the Sorcerers Stone and it is your favorite, read some real books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was a joy to read. It's easy to see how it has caught the intrigue of readers of all ages. On the surface Harry Potter chronicles the adventures of a boy who spends the first 10 years of his life living in a cupboard under the stairs of his aunt and uncles home, to his exciting adventures while attending a boarding school for withcraft and wizardry. After being ignored and told he is nothing, he comes to discover who he was all along. On a deeper level this story mirrors a sad reflection on society and our loss of the natural inquisitiveness and optimism inherent in children. Many of us have become &quot;muggles&quot; as is termed in the book. A muggle doesn't believe in magic. A muggle doesn't make room in their world for those who are different, be it in thought or belief. A muggle has been convinced after a lifetime of conditioning that the dreams and magic of childhood never existed. What a wonderful world it must be for the non-muggles who still believe that life is a magical wonderful journey! Are you a muggle? After reading Harry Potter you may want to reconsider. I know I did. There is something is this book for children of all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harrry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful book for children and adults alike! I see no reason at all to ban these books from shelves. You can identify with the characters in many ways. The situations are very real. It deals with real problems such as school and friendships,courage and knowing who you are. To ban these books is denying our children,our future, a wonderful work of litearature. A great start to Ms. Rowling's writing career! My suggestion: kids, read these books to your parents!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter was one of the best books I have ever read in my entire life!

I highly recomend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This, the first book in the Harry Potter story, is a definite page-turner. The fast-paced adventure never seems to end. It goes on to the very last page.I've heard much about how younger readers (7-9 years of age) may find some of the things disturbing. This is not true. Everything in this story is suitable for anyone to read. Therefore this book should be read by everyone.You are guaranteed to be left satisfied. Harry Potter is a character you will quickly come to love, for his is an icon for bravery. The boy that I would like to be.It doesn't matter what you're looking for, you'll find in this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read this book whenever I was seven years old. Now, at 19 years of age, I just wanted to thank you J.K. Rowling for inspiring me to find an interest in books. It is so important nowadays that children find this interest early on to promote learning and imagination later in life. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone will always be the first actual book that began my interest in reading. Several years ago, I finished the entire series and it is by far the best series of books I have ever read.Now to all who have yet to read her series, I highly encourage you to put all seven books on your bucket list. Parents, please expose your children to this series! It stimulates their imagination, their interest in books, and improves their reading level significantly at a young age.Anyway, thanks again for everything J.K. Rowling!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is the first Harry Potter and my first Harry Potter book and it really bring me to a magic world. At first I read it in China, in Chinese translation, now reading it in English helps me to better understanding its culture and its words use are just amazing! Whenever I read it I'll close my eyes and image that I'm also a friend of Harry and experience the adventure in that magic world. This is the most wonderful story book ever, period. Every child will learn about it and enjoy the fun and happiness it brings."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is the first book of the best book series I've ever read. Harry, Hermione, and Ron are an inseparable bunch of friends at Hogwarts who use their own smarts, teamwork, and even disobey the rules to help out.

You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I heard about this book I thought it was for 4 graders. Well my neighbor leant it to me and I read it in two days! I couldn't put it down! The amount of adventure and tension is great! Each character really sets there own personality and is described very well. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an amazing book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As a children's librarian, I am delighted to see kids going nuts about reading, especially a long book like this. To be sure, it is well done and entertaining. Yet I still feel at a loss to explain why this book in particular has become such a mania, especially among adults, when there are many other equally good books out there. Surely the fad aspect has something to do with it, though as I say it is nice to have a fad with something basically good at its heart. I just hope kids will be moved by this to find the myriad other magical books out there for their own discovery, and not to be pied pipered simply because everyone seems to be doing it in a kind of Oprahlike frenzy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm a 38 year old Mom, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and also the sequel, ...Chamber of Secrets. They are imaginative, funny, pleasant stories, with very little seriously frightening or unpleasant content, which in my opinion, makes them great books, especially for children.I read quite a number of the other reviews, especially those who gave less than 5 stars -- those reviewers generally wanted more serious content. I for one am glad that there is actually something on the market for kids that doesn't include a lot of fear, violence, etc. I look forward to reading the next book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkhaban."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Exciting, exciting exciting!!!

We were always pleading with her, Please? Just one more chapter! Harry Potter is a very interesting character, and also realistic.

It includes adolescent fiction, mystery, comedy, survival, plus good volcabulary, and much more!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I remember when I first started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. This book is so good it is worth reading again and again, and as soon as the sequel came out I bought and read that to.

I must have been under a rock because I had never heard of it before and decided to check it out just for a well-deserved break from books we read in my english class. The next day I saw some elementary school kids reading it and I felt pretty stupid. Well, over the course of the next couple of days all I heard about was the Harry Potter books, and I meet many individuals, most of them adults and teenagers, confessing to reading this wonderful childrens book. I've finished this book in about three days and I can't wait to start the others in the series. Don't be afraid, adults! This book is not just for kids!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a WONDERFUL book!:-) It is my favorite and will be for a long time! Gryffindors, Slytherins, Hufflepuffs, and Ravenclaws? I have got to say that J.K. Rowling has a very clever imagination. But there is one problem! How can people say that these books are for 4th graders? I am in 7th grade and I still had trouble understanding it! I think that you would have to be at least in 6th grade to appreciate what this book has to offer. Ms. Rowling, keep 'em coming!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book will keep you on the edge of your seat. I couldn't put it down. I even got cought in class with it several times. If you read one book in your whole life(which I don't recomend) this should be it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After many good reviews I decided to read this book as soon as I got the chance to buy it.As soon as I started I couldn't stop reading it.It was wonderful and there was practically nothing that bored me.The ending was very original and unpredictable.I recomend this book if you have children, or even if you don't read it anyways.That's how wonderful this book is. Once agian marvelous!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I enjoyed this book. I usually am not interested in fantasy books, but this is the first fantasty book that I have enjoyed in a long time. It is full of fun and mystery. And the main key, magic.

Rowling is a very excellent author!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was a phenom at my summer camp, i personally had never heard of harry potter. so when i got home i had my parents take me out to buy it. IT WAS AWESOME. this is probably one of the best books i have ever read (for fantasy) ms. rowling is an excellent writer and is almost up there with roald dahl and dr. suess. the dursleys are somewhat similar to the witches by roald dahl. i wouldn't want to live with either of them but i would like to be a witch instead of a muggle. i can't wait to see the movie and watch the quidditch matches. go griffyndor! please read this book you will be craving for the sequels."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was very good. I'm going to read the second book because the first one was good and funny. It's about Harry Potter and he gets a letter. He goes to a wizard school called Hogwarts and learns spells, gets to play on a Quidich team, and has a good time with his friends, Ron and Hermonie."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved this book! It's just one of those books where you can't put it down. I couldn't wait to see what kind of adventure or trouble Harry would get into next. I also recommend the next two books. I can't wait untill J.K. Rowling writes another book in here series about Harry!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Book 1 is a creative book that kids will enjoy. I read it to find out if the &quot;witchcraft&quot; would be a problem for my kids (we are Christians). This book falls under the genre of The Lord of the Rings; although it is much more simplistic. Rowling keeps the characters simple and the plot simple, but she provides a few twists and turns that are not expected. I'd recommend it for kids - and us old folks as well - who enjoy fantasy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book deserves 100 stars! Harry Potter is my all time favorite book! When I first read this book I was amazed, never had I read a book that caught my attention so strongly and so fast. With in the second chapter I was hooked, nothing could distract me from reading it. Harry Potter changed my perspective of reading, it caused me to read thicker and smaller printed books. All in all, Harry Potter is a must read book, and if you can't read it, SEE THE MOVIE!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I dismissed the HP craze as nonsense until recently. Needing refuge from a very difficult situation, I immersed myself in Sorceror's Stone one evening and enjoyed every minute of it.As if by magic (laugh), my troubles were completely resolved a few days after finishing this enchanting story. Looking forward to reading the entire series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was pushed into this book by my wife, a 4th grade teacher, who wanted me to get into the series before going to see the movie. While used to reading mostly history and adult fiction, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the story.Although I am not head-over-heels pumped to read the next volumes, I see how kids and adults alike can lose themselves in this fantasy, far-fecthed as it may be.I disagree with those who discount Potter on religious reasons because it supposedly sensationalizes occultism. There is more than just magic in this book. Kids can learn the lessons of trust and friendship, among others, Rowling weaves into this adventure."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I've just finished re-reading this first Harry Potter book to refresh my memory in anticipation of the movie soon to be released. I was delighted all over again with the rich imagery and vivid imagination of the author. I can visualize the Hogwarts castle, flying broomsticks, witches, wizards, cauldrons, 3-headed monstrous dogs, owls that deliver the mail, unicorns, the invisible cloak, magic wands, dragons, Hagrid the hapless gamekeeper, Draco...Harry's mean-spirited adversary, staircases that move, paintings with disappearing subjects, feasts in the grand hall, spirited Quidditch matches, lessons in sorcery, alchemy, potions and spells.It's a whole new world for Harry, who until his 11th birthday didn't know that he was a world-famous wizard. After being orphaned as a baby, he was raised by his stingy aunt and uncle along with his piggy, selfish cousin, who were Muggles without any special powers. They had tried to deny and hide Harry's true calling, but the letters that started arriving before his 11th birthday, inviting him to attend Hogwarts, were unavoidable, and Harry was whisked away on the Hogwarts Express to a world he never knew existed. Join Harry and his new-found witch and wizard friends in this great adventure that will thrill and delight you and have you waiting for more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Since I'm a Fantasy fan of the Tolkien-eque variety, I thought that I would give the much-debated Harry Potter a try. It's a children's book, but I felt the need for something a little lighter than usual, and this delivered on that count. Though it's not a great piece of literature by any means, The Sorcerer's Stone is certainly a great way for young readers to cut their teeth on fantasy writings.First, some good points:*Humanity: Harry and the characters he interacts with in the world of Hogwarts have very believable and realistic emotions, faults, and personal discoveries. This is probaby the best coming-of-age story in Fantasy that I've ever encountered.*Mystery: A reader can be easily drawn into the unknowns of the plot as they unfold. The whereabouts of Voldermort, the reasons for his leaving, and the secrets of the castle are all well written.However, the book does have some problems. The most glaring of which is the dialog, which is sometimes forced. Hegrid's glaring accent, in particular, is written in such a way as to confuse anyone under 10 yrs. old who wouldn't know what the author was trying to do. The effect here and elsewhere with both dialect and speech just doesn't work at times.Another very serious flaw in the beginning of the book is the very stereotypical portrail of Harry's abusive Aunt and Uncle. The Dursley's are very uncompromising, ignorant of the world outside their lives, and hateful of anyone they consider &quot;different&quot;. Perhaps it's not so much the portrail of witchcraft, but the portrail of these characters in the books that have upset religious right-wingers so much about this series. Plus, making these characters antagonists in the plot doesn't really add anything of great worth to the text other than to garner more sympathy for Harry. But, since we feel it anyway by this time, it's not necessary (and in fact hinders the story overall).So, other than a few minor language issues and some very mean-spirited stereotyping at the beginning, this is a good read for kids and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Being a 22 year old woman of sound intelligence &amp; body I throughly resisted getting into the whole Harry Potter rage. It seemed like another simple children's story with another mixed up world (I remember thinking the word &quot;Muggle&quot; seemed a bit harsh) and wrote it off as nonsense. Finally a friend of mine convinced me to just read the first book.That night I sat up, read the book and immediately decided I needed more.That's the beauty of Harry Potter. It sucks you in unsuspecting and refuses to let go. I found myself smiling throughout the whole book and fascinated by the characters. Adults don't be put off by the fact this book is found in the Children's section...it's definitely worth picking up when you need an escape or just want to have fun.As for me...I'm throughly smitten with Dumbledore :)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potters personality is very outgoing and adventurous.He is a curious boy. The plot is about how he goes to Hogwarts and finds out that Voldmort is after the Sorcerer's stone.One reason why I think someone my age should read this book is because it is a thrilling book and once you start you can't help but read the whole series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is one of my favorite books ever. I have read the whole series and I like each of them for seperate reasons. This one I like because you really get to know Harry and all of the other characters. J.K. Rowling is an awesome writer and this is an awesome book. I loved it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I love this book. Before reading this book I hated to read and now you can't stop me from reading.At first when I was introduced to this book I thought it was a dumb kids book. But when I started to read it I couldn't put it down and I was able to finish it within 2 days, which is unheared of when it comes to me. When I was done with it I went out and bought the second one and loved it as well. Then I finished it and bought the third, loved it, finished it, and bought the fourth. I am currently reading it now and I think it's great.You must buy this book, you will love it. Trust me."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I first read Harry Potter when I was ten years old. I loved it! It was just what I look for in a book. It had humor, (George reckons he had a boggy flavored one), desciption ( all of the things and topics were so well explained that I could picture myself at Hogwarts) and the overall idea of the story (how did she come up this idea?). I have now read this book 4 times, I've read #2 3 times, #3, 3 times and #4 2 times. I am afraid it will very hard for me to wait 'till June 2003 for the next book. If you have not read this book, get reading! I hope you liked this book just as much as I did. In case your not into reading I will summerise book #1. Harry Potter thinks is an ordinary boy. His parents died in a so-called car crash when he was 1 so he went to live with his evil aunt and uncle and his cousin, Dudley. Harry was forsed to live in the cupoard under the stairs and sometimes goes without food for days at a time. One day when Harry is twelve, he gets a letter. Uncle Vernon won't let him have it but they just keep coming. So the hide out on the \\" hut on the rock \\". This does no good, as the gamekeeper of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Hagrid, comes and gives him his letter to the school ( 'cause harrys a wizard. Hagrid tells him that his parents were killed by the evil Lord Voldemort. Lord Voldemort tried to kill Harry, but could not. since then he has been unheard of.Hagrid takes him shopping and then Harry goes to school, he meets Ron and Hermione and battles with Lord Voldemort again."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The first Harry Potter book is like an introduction to the rest,but its great,anyway.Its about Harry Potter,who at the age of 11 discovers that he is a WIZARD!Already famous for surviving The dark Lord's curse,Harry has a delightful year at Hogwarts,but comes to face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone isn't a good book until Harry arrives to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardary. Harry's parents were murdered so Harry had too move in with his mean Aunt and Uncle, the Dursleys. The Dursleys had a son named Dudley. Dudley always picked on Harry and made fun of him, but one day Harry got a letter that said he has an invitation to a wonderful place he never thought or dreamed existed. So I think that you should read this book because it's great."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I love Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone and the other books in the Harry Potter Series. The books are wonderful jsut today Memoral Day i went to the Harry Potter Triva Contest were i answered Harry Potter questions very sucsessfully. I have many favorits series but my probally my favorite is Harry Potter. The book is about a boy named Harry whos parents die from a evil man named Voldemort. He goes to live with his Aunt and Uncle and one day when there in a run down house on a rock in the middle of a lake harry potter resives a letter telling him that he is excepted to a wizard school called Hogwarts. The rest you must learn yourselves hope you enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I heard about this book in the summer and was going to read it but thought that I might not like it, and then in fourth grade, I read it. I loved it so much that I finished it in one day. I just could not put it down. It is about an 11-year-old boy named Harry Potter who suddenly finds out that he is a wizard. He goes to a magical school called Hogwarts were he learns to be a wizard and makes friends and enemies. The plot moves along very quickly and it has a surprising twist. I would recommend this book to anyone. You have to read it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"All of the J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter books are \\"GREAT\\". I have read all four and await the publishing of book five. They are a good change of pace. I would let my children read these books with ease. They are not filled with the filth and bad language used in music and school. A good change of pace reading."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Raised in the mundane everyday world by an aunt and uncle who detest him, young Harry Potter's eyes are opened to a universe of magic when he learns that he is actually the child of famous wizards and the sole survivor of an attack by Voldemort, a being so evil that other magical folk hesitate even to use his name. Thus, JK Rowling begins an entertaining saga that has become a publishing phenomenon. Like so many others, I have also been enthralled by Harry and his world. I like the meticulous way that Rowling constructs a world that coexists with everyday reality, complete with its own sports, economy, and political organizations. She peoples it with colorful, memorable characters, all of it anchored by the tight friendship between Harry, Ron, and Hermione. I'm looking forward to seeing how Rowling develops her story over the next six books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was good. It wasn't as good as the others though. Probably because i read this one second. It's sad how Harry has to grow up thinking he is normal, with an aunt and uncle that doesn't like him. His cousin treats him worst of all. After all the years he lived with them he finally found out that his parent where murdered and not killed in a car crash.That is just the begining of his extrodanary life as a wizard. In this story he will make some friends and make some ememies, and best of all become a hero to most who come in contact with him. i'm not going to mess up the story for you so maybe you should just read it on your own it a page turn every second."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"and buys this book!! I'd resisted for several years, & didn't go to the movie when it was in theaters. Then, during a long hot weekend of a business trip, I ordered this movie up on the hotel tv... and if the movie was that good (with some of my favorite Brit actors), I just HAD to go find the book!This excellent series is very engaging for all readers who like a good adventure that also gently reminds us how one should behave towards others. I hope to share these volumes with my children as they grow in hopes they will appreciate them as well.Well-written, just scary enough for the kids, and with fun for all! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read this book back in 1997 when it was first released in the Uk and knew something extraordinary was to come. Despite being crticized for \\"too much plot, not enough narrative\\" this is an amazing debut novel with an incredibly extensive appeal, and issues that can be understood on a number of levels. The characters are deep, with both flaws and positive aspects; their actions are comprehendable and they are so easy to relate to. Harry, who has suffered so much, is given a chance to be happy - a light at the end of the tunnel for us all. Ron, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers for his whole life, is given the chance to shine and show the true brilliance of his personality. Hermione, always isolated due to her intelligence, can prove that she is also loyal and brave: a wonderful character on a number of levels. This book will make you cry with laughter and despair.

Harry, Hermione, and Ron wanted to find out about the sorcerers stone. But nobody would tell them about it. So they went to find out themselves. Then Harry didn't expect somebody late at night to be with him.What I always love about Harry Potter is that once you start to read it you can't stop because the author just gets your attention and pulls you in cause it has a bit of a mystery in it and lots of action. I think it's a good book for kids and adults.This book has all the big surprises and so does the series. Since .J.K. Rowling invited me into the exciting world of magic I bet she will do it to you to."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Best book I have ever read and its keeps you in suspense I couldn't stop reading until it was finished"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Read this book over 20 times and I still lose myself in the pages and live in the world of witches and wizards.

Several of my co-workers (adults, obviously) had read it, and they said it was excellent. I have to agree.You know the plot by now: Harry's parents were killed by the evil Lord Voldemort, and he was raised by his Muggle aunt and uncle until the age of 11, when he is accepted to Hogwarts.What some parents may not know is that this book will amuse and entertain adults just as much as it does the kids. I laughed out loud several times while reading it, and I stayed up far past my bedtime to finish it (something I haven't done since I was a kid!).I also was interested in reading the books because I wanted to see what some Christians' problems with them were. (I'm a practicing Catholic, for the record.) I found nothing that concerned me -- there's absolutely no religious content here, not Christian or Wiccan or anything else. Sure, your kid will wish he or she could do magic after reading this; so do I. But unless you're just plain anti-fun, there's nothing wrong with a little harmless fantasy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have read all sorts of fantasy and sci fi, but this is one of the best I have ever read. Henry Potter is a character you instantly love. His relatives are the bad guys that you love to hate, and his school is every kid's fantasy. My mother read this and suggested it to me. I read it and thought it was great. Now my little brother is reading it and he loves it. I couldn't put it down. It's great for every age range. It's just a really good story. It comes highly recomended by everyone I know who's read it. If you haven't read it you should."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"JK Rowling started her famous series with this fantastic book on the Harry Potter character.

Great books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In the beginning, I loathed Harry Potter with every fiber of my being. At the mention of his name i would run away screaming.I couldn't understand how so many of my friends in high school loved this book. My friend eventually forced me to read the book knowing that I would like it. Needless to say, I loved it. the story is wonderfully told with as many twists and turns as any mystery book I have ever read. The characters trials and tribulations were real, even if the plot was not. I'm a lover of fantasy books and this, admittedly, was one of the most incredible fantasy stories I have ever read. I;m glad that my friend forced this book down my throat, and am looking forward to reading the rest of the series. For all of those who don't want to read this book because it is for 'children', don't overlook this beautiful story. I felt that way too, but I am glad I read it and recommend this book to any fantasy lover, regardless of age."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"First of all, let me say that I'm a college student majoring inEnglish and these books are wonderful. I read the first one because itwas on our booklist for a &quot;modern British Literature&quot;class. As i read it I found it &quot;un-put-downable&quot;. The plot is watertight and intricate. And as you continue to read the other 2 books in the series, you find the characters more complex and the plots more twisting and surprising. The author, J.K. Rowling is being compared to C.S. Lewis and I completely agree. Her tales, like Lewis, have a dark adult streak to them. Rowling is in league with not only Lewis, but Dahl's style and is in no way inferior. And sorry to say, Golden Compass doesn't appear on the New York Times Bestseller's list, but amazingly all three Harry Potter books do and have held spots one, two and three at the same time, beating out Jeffery Archer and John Grisham. It was the first time a &quot;children's&quot; book has topped the charts in years! What does that tell you? The books are marked by an inventive wit and vivid characterization. And there are undercurrents to the adventures, a sense of morality that is subtle and emotions that run deep."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Since I am a semi-adult (actually 28) I knew ahead of time that these books were aimed at younger readers but I could not resist and thank goodness for that! These are some of the best books I have read in a long time. Certainly the most fun books I have read in ages...J.K. Rowling obviously wrote these to entertain a younger audience but I found that the writing and the plot kept me involved as well. I read the whole thing in one day and had to wait for the other two books to arrive. I then polished those off in a few days and can't wait for 4-7!I highly recommend these books - it has been a long time since my imagination has been fed such a good meal!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I've been a series reader for as long as I'v been able to read. From the Sweet Valley Twins, to Fear Street and Everworld, I rarely strayed from my strict regimen of series books. That is, until I saw Harry Potter sitting haphazardly on the shelf, the very last one of it's kind, at my local bookstore. I couldn't help myself; the promise of wizardry and dragons intrigued my every atom. I began to read it a few days later (only for the sake of an extremely chaotic weekend.) From the first page to the last, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone never ceased to amaze me. The author emits the talent of Roald Dahl, and even excedes him in her work. I was extremely amazed to hear that this is a first try of a struggling sinlge mother (as it said in About the Author.) But about the book: It starts off in our basic world; one filled with Muggles (as the wizards call us) and, gasp! no magic. Harry Potter is an emotionally abused boy who was left at the doorsep of his Muggle Aunt and Uncle's house, after the tragic demise of his parents. But even at his youngest age, Harry was a celebrity in wizard terms. The most powerful and evil wizard ever known to set foot upon the earth murdered Mr. and Mrs. Potter, but somehow failed to kill Harry himself. The only thing this wizard, timidly named You-Know-Who, left in his wrath was a lightning shaped scar on Harry's forhead; the only interesting thing about him, or so Harry thought. Harry is treated as the red-haired stepchild of the family, physically abused by Dudly (his cousin) and completely ignored by everyone else, Harry had a pathetic existence. Locked in a cupboard he lived, until the first of the letters came. Harry went to open it, but his Uncle Vernon snatched it away before he had the chance. Vernon and Petunia (I think that's the aunt's name...) forbid Harry to read it, and they dispose of it. The next day, Harry finds TWO letters, addressed to him, seemingly identical. These too are ripped away from him. Day after day Harry recieves letter after letter, the amount doubling each time. Finally, Uncle Vernon gets fed up with this, and he moves his entire family, including Harry, into a hotal room. There, Harry recieves another letter. Outraged, Vernon moves them to a ramshackle house (generously named so) for surely no one would be able to reach Harry there! But again he was mistaken; a huge giant named Hagrid stormed in their little haven, and whisked Harry off the second Harry's birthday hit. Hagrid told Harry all about his wizardry roots, and that the myth that his parents died in a tragic car crash was completely untrue. Harry goes back to live with his Aunt and Uncle, but then goes off to Hogwarts, a wizardry school. There, he meets the good, the bad, and the disgustingly ugly. He forms wonderful friendships with Ron and Hermoine. Together, the trio get themselves in many a jam, but they always manage to pull through. Things ran rather smoothly for awhile, if you exclude Draco, until the three learn of the Sorcerer's Stone, hidden deep within the castle of Hogwarts. They form suspicions that a certain teacher named Snape is plotting to steal the stone, that contains the Elixer of Life, which would make anyone immortal. So, they go off on an adventure to capture the stone before Snape has the chance. You'll have to read the book to find out what happens, but look out and beware, because this book is filled with action, adventure, and a moral that every child, literal or at heart, must learn to know."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What a wonderful book! I ordered it simply because I needed to see what the phenonomen was about. (I understood it less than even Pokemon!) And much to my suprise, I could not put the book down for two straight days.

It's a keeper--and a classic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"~Not allowing kids to read this is like not allowing them to dream! ~I'm 12 and I absolutly LOVE this book.

Which kid hasn't dreamed of hatching a dragon or flying or doing magic? (not devil's sorcery as others refer to it) There is no gross killing or anything else that should be ofensive.

I can't wait to have kids myself.As for the book, there was nothing I wish more for kids to see how Harry Potter can control himself. Him being different and showing respect to his elders and control over magic and friendships.

They werealso great to read outloud...my 8 year old chose listening to Mom read all the Harry Potter books over ALL television shows! Now that's entertainment! A final note...it didn't even matter that we read them out of order. I had loaned Sorcerer's Stone to a friend, so I started my 8 year old off on Chamber of Secrets. No problem at all; in fact, I think he understood Sorcerer's Stone better after hearing Chamber of Secrets. We are EAGERLY awaiting the next installment of Harry!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This has to be the best book I have read in a very long time. I pity kids who are not allowed to read this book. There is no bad language in comparison to teenage words (I can talk, I'm 13). This book has friendship, critical thinking, and promotes nonviolence. I think people trying to ban this book have real problems. This book shows kids that you can start at rock bottom and become the most powerful being in the world. I would not have read this book if my friends hadn't. But I started in first period at 8:00 and finished by 8th period at 3:15. I could have read the whole book in an hour but those darned teachers kept trying to make me learn. (That was a joke.) If you have any reason not to read this book, ignore it. You will be glad you did. P.S. If anyone knows J.K.Rowling, tell her she needs to write about a female charecter.

The humor brings a smile to your face as you follow along with Harry, Ron and Hermione through their first year at Hogwarts."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I do not consider myself to be one of the intelligencia, nor do I consider myself to be as well-read as I'd like to be, however.......Then again, I never understood the Pokemon phenomenon either. Big budget marketing is all I can think of to create such hype. I do, however, find the covers of the books to be very attractive. All marketing related toys and paraphenalia are very attractively packaged as well and seem to be of good quality. Perhaps this is what draws the kids? Can this possibly be the reason why adults enjoy the books as well?I was hoping that Hollywood would come through for me. The movie was as bland, and an exact replica (except for some missing scenes) as the book.It is refreshing to see others have rated this book with 1 star. I was thinking about reading this book again to see if I had missed something. It happens. I didn't have to do this, however, as I subsequently read Chamber of Secrets with my son to find boredom rear its tired head once again. I found that all I'd really missed was the time I could've spent reading something else.Harry Potter, as a character, is a bore. This is probably due to Rowlings lack of character development, however, she seems to have done a better job at it with Hermione and the Weasley's. This is not to say that I think they are interesting in any way, shape, or form.I do believe I've just written an uninteresting and perhaps not very descriptive review, however, I couldn't help putting in my two cents. I would not even bother to write this review if not for all the hype and attention given to this series of books.To be fair, my son enjoyed reading this book at a time I was trying to introduce to him the joy of reading. To put a positive spin on the HP phenomenon; the publishing industry is doing our children a favor for you can never really know what good literature is until you've read the bad."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The HP books are a great deal of fun, and it's hard to imagine anything else I could say about them that hasn't been said ten thousand times already.I do however want to say something about the *Audiobooks.* For reasons beyond my ken, Amazon.com does not let you know that there is an infinitely better version than this available, read by the delightful Stephen Fry. According to J.K. Rowling, her daughter listens to the (Fry) audiobooks constantly. Stephen Fry's gorgeous voice is a pleasure any time, but these books give him grand scope for mimicry and vocal characterization.Choosing to record a new version of these books for an American audience when Stephen Fry has already so brilliantly done them is perverse in its idiocy. Don't bother with this version; go over to Amazon.co.uk and buy the real thing!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In truth, I could live without all the Harry Potter hype. I'm tired of these books, the characters, the author. Sometimes I wish I could wave a magic wand and make everything related to Mr. Potter disappear.For one thing, they are very unoriginal. Everything in the books, all the elements of magic, have been seen before. So here's my Harry Potter alternatives list...IF YOU WANT A BOOK ABOUT A BOARDING SCHOOL...Don't do Hogwarts, do Spence Academy. Libba Bray's A Great And Terrible Beauty is a splendid story, along with its sequel.IF YOU WANT A STORY ABOUT MAGIC...Don't wave a wand, simply read The Goose Girl and its companions by Shannon Hale. Harry's magic is unexplained, while Ani and Enna's is so very real.IF YOU WANT A BOOK ABOUT FRIENDSHIP...Look no further than the Warriors series by Erin Hunter. Her characters are far more real than any of JK Rowling's.IF YOU WANT A BOOK ABOUT A KID WHO'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN EVERYONE ELSE...read A Mango Shaped Space by Wendy Mass.IF YOU WANT A STORY ABOUT THE DEATH OF A PARENT: Read One Of Those Hideous Books Where The Mother Dies, by Sonya Sones. And to make you think of magic spells, its written in verse.IF YOU WANT TO READ ABOUT AN ADVENTURE...Read Halfway To The Sky by Kimberly Brubaker Bradley.IF YOU WANT A STORY ABOUT AN ORPHAN...Read Heaven Eyes by David Almond.IF YOU WANT A BOOK ABOUT A MYSTERY...Read The Sammy Keyes books by Wendelin Van Draanen.IF YOU WANT A BOOK ABOUT ANOTHER WORLD EXISTING NEAR OUR OWN...Read the Stravaganza books by Mary Hoffman.IF YOU WANT TO READ THE ONLY BOOK ON EARTH WORSE THAN HARRY POTTER...Might I suggest something written by Paris Hilton?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a fifteen-year-old girl whose friends adore Harry Potter. I read this book in an attempt to see whether this book would live up to all the hype surrounding it. I thought that I would perhaps enjoy this book, as I am normally a big fan of &quot;different world&quot; stories. Boy, was I disappointed.I do not think that this book will induce others to practice witchcraft, etc. The reason why I don't like Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone is because IT ISN'T A GOOD BOOK. This story moves like a television series, each storyline acting as an episode. But there is one difference: television shows do a much better job at depicting characters and storylines. J.K. Rowling's use of description is bland and amateurish. I realize that this book was written for children, but couldn't Rowling have at least attempted to use a higher sense of vocabulary? Roald Dahl uses very simplistic vocabulary in his stories, too, but he comes off as charming - Rowling just seems to be somebody who CAN'T use a nice vocab word every now and then.Let's move on to the actual story. This is where the &quot;unoriginal&quot; trait comes in. Can we say &quot;Cinderella&quot;? The story of Harry Potter is too contrived. We've all seen the main storyline before: kind orphan boy/girl who just so happens to be whisked away to someplace &quot;magical&quot; for them; is great at everything and wins the admiration of practically everybody, with the exception of a few jealous enemies here and there. This storyline has been DONE TO DEATH, and Harry Potter doesn't make it any better.This book is definitely not a classic. The Chronicles of Narnia - that's a classic. A Wrinkle in Time - that's a classic. Harry Potter doesn't come even close to those or many others. My literature teacher once put books into two different categories: thinking books and non-thinking books. Harry Potter belongs in the latter. This is a book that will go in one ear and out the other, not something that will stay with you for years on end. If this book ever becomes as &quot;classic&quot; as Cinderella or Snow White, the world will have had lost its mind.This book definitely does not live up to the hype."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"So I decide to buy this book for my kindle because I enjoyed the series and I'm directed to the \\"Pottermore\\" site and they force you to accept cookies into your computer, which is essentially a virus, before you can purchase. No cookies, no purchase. Keep the book..and you're cookies."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I can say that I was hopelessly sucked-in as well. But that was just the problem. After finally finishing the book I realized \\"Oh, wow, that was such a page-turner, I'm surprised it wasn't some cheap dime-store pulp.\\"I agree with many of the comments that I've read (but mostly the negative ones, which are severely lacking):*The plot is nothing new, and I've only read the first one*There are many elements that, far from being a \\"tribute\\" to great books/series such as Tolkien's LOTR and Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia, are merely lifted straight from the best elements of the said books.As examples, compare Dumbledore's suspiciously Gandalf-ish character description. Another is the troll scene in the girls toilet: this is almost so plagiaristic that there should be a lawsuit. And finally, how do you like the scene at the end where Harry wakes up in bed, after a few days in respite from his exploits, and low and behold, Dumbledore is sitting beside this supposed \\"hero\\".Along with the \\"Scooby Doo\\" ending (I thought of this myself before reading the reviews), severe lack of moral focus, and just generally mediocre writing, I wonder why any adult would get excited about it and infect their children with the same.There is truly a gigantic corporate/media hype about this series that is simultaneously ungodly and unnatural. I'm glad, though, that I have read the first book; now, if anyone hears me criticizing the book, at least I can't be accused of not reading it.There is so much more out there in the world of literature: don't start here. In a century, and maybe as soon as 20 years, J.K. Rowling will surely be forgotten. Her writing is far from classic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is not the best book in the world but its not a bad book!

I have all the Harry Potter books on cassette and after listening to them several times the extremely poor quality of the cassettes came through. Every book has one or more cassettes that are ruined. I own over 50 Audio books by Brilliance and have listened to many of them 100's of times and only had on problem with the tape and it was promptly replaced. Listening library does not stand by their produce at all, instead of replacing a single cassette they replaced the whole book with very poor grace, and now 3 cassettes are ruined in that book. The representive told me they would replace the tape but that would be the last time. So now I am stuck with all 7 books on cassette which was a big mistake on my part, get the CD's instead. I will now have to invest big bucks to re-buy the books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It isn't that it's BETTER than other books in the genre; it's full of predictable devices, and at heart is your basic British boarding school story. There is nothing here we haven't seen before. Will someone please explain this to me? Why is it better than Diana Wynne Jones or Roald Dahl?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If the alleged hero of the story acted even =remotely= heroic, instead of reacting to things happening to him with an \\"okay, sure\\" tone, it might have saved this book. Accent on the might, there. Picked it up purely because the the hype, and only forced myself to finish the thing just to see if the author ever figured out how to write a lead character that did something other than react to everything going on around him. Rowling didn't. The fish-out-of-water concept backfires, in that the only time Harry's actually out of his element is in the opening chapters with his Muggle family. He's perfectly at home and pretty comfortable at Hogwart's, which is a true waste of story potential. The supporting cast are far more interesting and well-developed as characters than Harry, and I'd actually seek out a book with Hermione or Hagrid. Unfortunately, they're not lead characters. I can't find myself caring enough about Harry to read book 2."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said already? I think labelling this book as purely &quot;children's literature&quot; is limiting. Good literature defies both the age barrier as well as any time restrictions. Therefore, I have little doubt that my great grandchildren will be reading and enjoying Harry's adventures years from now. I've been a big fan of fantasy fiction over the years, from Tolkien to CS Lewis to Dahl, and I think Rowling will take her place among these greats.

Why would perfect Albus Dumbledore let \\"bad\\" kids join the school when they might commit crimes there (i.e., students like Voldemort)? And why would snakes side with Voldemort in symbolism and literalism (you find this out in the later books), simply because he's evil!?!In fact, I don't see what's to like about the book (in terms of things that I like): Snake prejudice (HOW COULD anyone!?!?!), witchcraft, geeks like Ron Weasley as perfect brats!?!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"they sent me the wrong book. though order has correct title. from reading other reviews, i see this has happened to other customers also"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Really great book. great vocabulary used in the text. good plot line. ron weasley was very funny in several ways. over all,great book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"i bought Harry potter, and about 30 pages in the middle of the book is binding poorly. even some sentences are missing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone was the worst book ever, or one of the worst.

And everything that made Harry Potter so successful is all first shown, though hardly fully explained, in this book, HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSPHER'S STONE.The novel opens with Harry living under the cupboard with his abusive aunt and uncle. He has had a mean, depressed life, and though an active boy, the sheer amount of trauma he must have endured would scar any child. But the door opens out of this lifestyle. I've read an interesting theory (obviously not true), that a much different writer than Rowling would have ended Book 7 with Harry having imagined all this fantasy world, where he was so prominent and famous, to help escape the neglect and abuse from the Dursleys.He gets a letter (actually, hundreds) saying he is in fact a wizard. So he is enrolled the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Him, along with his new friend the giant Hagrid, go to Diagon Alley, a magical bazaar, and thus he is thrust into the magical universe so captured the imagination of millions. We soon learn Harry is world famous among wizards for conquering an evil Wizard named Vo - um - He Who Must Not Be Named. Sorry \`bout that slip. =). Along the way, we learn that Voldemort is after a magical artifiact called the Philosopher's Stone (which was, unfortunately, changed from the UK original title to \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" in all other regions). So much of the novel is driven by the three main characters defending this stone from Voldemort.In this novel we get the first ever glimpses of Hogwarts, Voldemort, Quidditch, Dumbledore, Severus Snape, muggles, the Forbidden Forest, the Invisibility Cloak, and any other number of thins Rowling's magical confectionary of an imagination has cooked up for us.One of the best things about this book, and indeed about the whole series, is how Rowling plants details which, when reading, you may not necessarily pick up on, but are later rather important in later volumes. Who would think Griphook and Hagrid's admonition no one breaks into Gringotts would have such prominence in Book 7? Or the importance of Harry being able to talk to the boa constrictor, something which is not referenced again until Book 2 and then not fully explained until Book 7? Or the Invisibility Cloak, a device first introduced in this novel, but you have no idea of its importance, or even that it has real significane, until Book 7.Another great example of this planting of clues is Neville Longbottom, who, but by fate, could easily have been the main star of the series, though you don't find out that information until much later in Book 5.The book also introduces the relationship dynamics that would continue throughout the entire series, from the interplay between the three main kids (Harry, Ron, and Hermione), to the ambiguous Severus Snape, the wise mentor figure of Albus Dumbledore, bumbling Hagrid with his love of nasty creatures, prim and reserved Professor McGonagall, evil incarnate Voldemort, Draco Malfoy, etc.Overall, there are numerous memorable scenes in this novel. As the novels progressed, the children aged and the target audience would have aged as well. In this novel, they are still very young and immature, but already at this early point in their career, there are seeds of greatness for Harry, Ron, and Hermione.The same can be said of this debut novel as well.This is my order of Potter books by preference:Deathly HallowsPrisoner of AzkabanOrder of the PhoenixPhilosopher's Stone/Chamber of Secrets (I rank them both the same)Half-Blood PrinceGoblet of Fire."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Now and then, A book comes along that makes people enabled to remember every luscious detail.

Wednesday evening I began the first book and I finished the third today, Saturday morning. I am writing this review before I order the fourth Potter book. Will my friend be surprised to get 4 books back! The author's imagination is vividly presented in a cast of almost believable characters attending a school we all wish we could attend. Classes like &quot;Defense Against Dark Arts&quot;, &quot;Divination&quot;, &quot;Transfiguration&quot;, &quot;Arithmancy&quot; and &quot;Care of Magical Creatures&quot; are written as if the author actually attended them and certainly enjoyed every minute of class. More than can be said for most of the classes I have attended. Each book in the series encompasses one year of Harry's fascinating life. The Potter books are written in a way that can charm any age reader. I am 64."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter has lived a dismal life with his aunt and uncle, the Dursleys. He sleeps in a closet and has never had a birthday party or Christmas presents. Even worse, he has to endure life with his horrible spoiled cousin, Dudley. Then on Harry's eleventh birthday, things change when a letter arrives, (by owl), inviting him to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Suddenly Harry finds himself among friends, learning about potion-making and magic-wand waving and broomstick riding. There're chocolate frogs and Every Flavor Beans and a three-headed dog and Quidditch-a game better than soccer. Also, Hagrid, a lovable gamekeeper who befriends Harry; Hermione Granger, a witch who's read all the school books and knows all the rules; and there's Ron Weasly, Harry's best friend who has quite a legacy of his own to fill. Hogwarts treats him well, even with the abomidable Malfoy's mean tricks or Professor Snape's obvious hatred of Harry. The soon Harry finds himself in the middle of a mystery at Hogwarts, and together with his two new friends, embarks on adventures he never dreamed possible.The book is engaging with its imagery, humor, plot twists and real-life child problems. The book doesn't only appeal to children but adults as well. She's a master on fantasy. She really can, with no difficulty at all, think herself back to 11 years old. You will love the whimsical descriptions, humorous quotes and the fun characters."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What a wonderful book! I read it after my 11-year old son suggested it as a change from my usual reading fare of history and biography. It turned out to be much more than just a springtime reading diversion...it became for me a &quot;magical&quot; reading experience in more ways than one. I was quickly captivated by Harry, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Hermoine, and yes, even the nasty Dursleys, Snape, and Draco Mafoy. Hogwarts came to life for me. I found myself unable to put the book down because it was so exciting and much fun to read! It's easy to understand why my son (and so many kids just like him) love Harry Potter so much.J.K. Rowling proves herself a gifted writer of children's books, not only because the plot is good and the characters come to life, but also because her writing fires the imagination and teaches positive values.&quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; is a great book for kids of all ages...from 9 to 99. It's destined to be a classic of children's literature."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Granted, I lack the basic criterion for being an expert on children's book--I'm 26 years old. For old times' sake, I do try to stay current on what's new in children's book. Compared to almost everything else I've read, Ms. Rowling's Harry Potter series stands far ahead of the pack.Ms. Rowling takes a classic scenario in British children's literature--adolescent children going to boarding school--and turns it on its head. Usually, all of the exciting stuff happens during school holidays (as in C.S. Lewis' &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; or Enid Blyton's &quot;Five&quot; and &quot;Seven&quot; series). In Harry Potter's world, school holidays are spent among the &quot;Muggles&quot;--the non-magical world--while school is where the magic really happens.And magic there is! From the wizardly sport of Quidditch to classes in potions to a three-headed dog named Fluffy, Ms. Rowling throws in enough magic to keep the interest of children (and adults) who don't usually like reading. A sparkling plot, realistic (if you can imagine a magical world, then these people belong in it) characters and a fully-realized world combine to create a true gem of children's literature. This one can easily share a shelf with &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and even &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.Don't miss Harry Potter and his adventures!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Ever since my wife coaxed me to read the Harry Potter books, I have been an immense fan of the series, right down to the Hogwarts notebook that I take to business meetings. So, when I saw a display for the Sorcerer's Stone Collector's Edition, I just had to check it out. What a disappointment. ... [Y]ou get a leather binding, shrunken cover art, and some pressed gold. Oh, there's the illustration of Harry drawn by Rowling, but that's not really worth this cost. I found the book to be rather too flashy, gaudy even, and much prefer the simplicity of the UK special editions (which, by the way, cost half as much as this book and that includes the cost for shipping). Please know that I don't mind spending money on good editions of books I already have. The fact that I own 6 copies of Lord of the Rings will attest to this. But, I just am not excited about this pricey collector's edition. So, instead of purchasing this book, I would recommend popping over to Amazon UK and getting TWO of *those* special editions (keep in mind when you're looking that the original title of Sorcerer's Stone is Philosopher's Stone), because, really, part of the joy of collecting is that you will have something unique and rare. How many kids on your block have the unedited UK editions of this great story?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone is one of those rare children's books that seems to be utterly wasted on children. The plot is engaging, the characters are likeable, and it's a good quick read for those older than the specified ages. I'm 18, and I finished it in a few hours, then handed it to my mother, who is 39. After she finished it, she agreed that we needed to get the rest of the series. In a family that regularly reads Shakespeare, that's high praise! It's a refreshing and enjoyable way to get your mind off the overly serious Muggle world and bring back a bit of wonder and magic. If you're a parent considering getting this book for your child, please do... But get a copy for yourself as well, and enjoy revisiting your own childhood."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In today's economy, customers buying books need to know exactly what they're buying. In this case, what your thirty bucks buys is -- apart from the previously published text (the novel itself) and the previously published art (interior art) -- is, essentially, a new cover by longtime Harry Potter cover artist Mary GrandPre, and a black-and-white illustration by Rowling (quite the cartoonist!), which comprises the \\"bonus\\" material Scholastic has been touting but keeping under wraps.The wraps are off and, while the illustration is nice, Scholastic would be better off issuing either an illustration edition with more art (which, by the way, exists), or taking the momentous occasion of the 10th anniversary to celebrate it in a significant fashion: Rowling, why wasn't there an original interview in which you looked back at the ten years of Harry Potter in the media? Why wasn't there a long essay by a respected literary critic looking at the Harry Potter phenomenon? Why wasn't there MORE text?If this was simply a reprint edition, the omission of new text would be understandable. But when you're celebrating ten years of Harry Potter in print, how, exactly, does a new cover, a previously published (to the best of my knowledge) illustration for the colored endpapers, and a black-and-white illustration by Rowling \\"celebrate\\" the book's publication?As there is no historical retrospective here, I'd have to say that Scholastic missed the boat: This edition could have been so much more, but it suffers (ironically) from a failure of imagination.I have rated it five stars because the first novel is a literary classic in the children's field. The publisher, however, needs to think about how to ADD VALUE to the existing edition when touting its \\"anniversary\\" status, esp. if they intend on reissuing matching volumes in the future. Otherwise, it comes off as being just another edition to get the fans' hard-earned money, instead of offering something new, different, and significantly improved."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"First of all, I am 52 years old.

While the plots and storylines are not complicated, they are completely captivating. Cover to cover the book is entertaining. I always thought that a wizard's land (Hogwarts in this case) would be a perfect idealistic place; when in fact it is full of good and evil, much like our real world.

Between the amazing characters, the world that you can't help but become immersed in, the fun adventures, and the amazingly delicious sounding food, this book is fantastic.Welcome Harry, the boy who lived. Also the boy who doesn't know what he is. After the tragic death of his parents Harry is sent to live with his only living relatives. However, this isn't exactly a happy life considering his Aunt, Uncle and cousin don't treat him like family but more like a servant. However, at the age of eleven, Harry is accepted to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and embarks on a magical adventure where he learns about friendship, love, and himself.Harry is a great MC. He's treated like crap, yet keeps his head high. He knows what its like to be the underdog so he doesn't judge people but gets to know them instead. He's kind, funny, courageous and has no shortage of nosiness. He may get into trouble a lot, but thats only because he's trying to help out. I admire that he stands up for what he believes in and isn't afraid to get his hands dirty because of it.I love Ron and Hermione. They may be just the friends of \\"The Boy Who Lived\\" but they take center stage just as much as Harry. Ron is the youngest of 4 brothers and is just trying to prove himself and he doesn't fail. He's funny and adventuresome and knows how to play a wicked game of wizard's chess. Hermione, the brains of the bunch, may be a bit high and mighty, but when it comes to Ron and Harry, she's willing to do anything to keep them safe.The Weasly twins? Oh goodness, I loved them from the beginning! The funny pranksters are definitely a great addition to this story. Neville may get picked on often, but when its time to be brave, he definitely lives up to it. Dumbledore may be a bit \\"off his rocker\\" but he's wise and witty and makes an awesome Headmaster. A lot of thought went into these characters to make them unique and I can definitely say that Ms. Rowling did a fantastic job.The writing is simple, yet beautiful. I really enjoy that the story sounded almost like someone telling a story. I could easily imagine sitting in a circle listening to someone tell this story.The world building was fantastic and so well thought out. Honestly, J. K. Rowling though of everything. But don't think that you'll be bogged down by details. She gives just enough to really let you see what its like without going overboard. She obviously put so much thought into this world and was able to create something so incredible. Also, I actually liked that I had seen the movie because as I was reading it, I was picturing the movie in my mind. I love to compare the books and movies to see what was kept in the movie and what was left out. Let me say that they did a fantastic job to bringing the book to life.The plot will not let you down! There is so much adventure and action and fun that is in these books. Also, since I've read all the books before, I've now realized how much thought had to go into these books. This story arc stretches across 7 books, which takes a lot of thought to keep things organized and flowing. There are references in this book that you recognize in later books and things that they talk about in this book that happen in others. Although the plot may seem simple in this book, once you read them all you'll realize how complicated and intricate it all is.If you can't tell from my long (sorry bout that btw) review, I absolutely adore this book. I want to go to Hogwarts and visit Diagon Alley thanks the wondrous descriptions given by Rowling. I want to meet Ron, Hermione, Harry, Neville and all of the other characters that I've fallen in love with because of reading this book. I want to eat the delicious sounding food. Harry Potter is such a great story about love and the power of friendship and I encourage all who have yet to read it get their rears in gear and head to the bookstore to buy it asap."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is about a famous wizard named Harry Potter. In the beginning, Harry is trapped with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, along with his cousin, Dudley. While he is with them, he gets no respect. One day, a wizard named Hagrid comes and tells Harry about how he is a wizard, and how an evil wizard named Voldemort murdered his parents. Hagrid brings Harry to Hogwarts, a famous witchcraft and wizardry school. While there, Harry meets two of his new best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Together, they go on a quest to find the sorcerer's stone, locked in the midst of Hogwarts...This is one of my most favorite book series. It has everything I like. Such as magic, mystery, fear and adventure! This is a famous book series, and it is also made it to theaters. I have watched all the movies, too. But anyway, this is a good series for someone who likes magic, mystery, fright and adventure. I think J.K. Rowling did a great job with this series!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When the Harry Potter series first came out I vowed I would not jump on the Harry-bandwagon and read these books with my son's. When my middle son was diagnosed with dyslexia, my stance changed to anything that would get him to read, I was willing to try.After watching the movies, he fell in love with Harry and wanted to read. I was ecstatic and together we cuddled up on the couch and entered the amazing world of Hogwarts! The book draws you in from the very first page. You can't help but want to see what happens next. Each chapter introduces you to new characters, spells, intrigue, danger, and adventure. The story is non-stop action, a page-turner. The worst part of the book, is getting to the last page. It is also the best as you know there are more books to come.I now have a voracious reader in the house that is reading above grade level. I would recommend these to anyone who has a child who hates to read and needs something to hold their attention. I have recommended this book to hundreds of students who were once reluctant to read and now they can't put down books. My one problem is what to read after the series is completed."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Do you want to read a book that will blow your mind away? Or maybe you want one that will sweep you of your feet. If you want a book that will do those things read, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. This book is by J.K. Rowling. In this book there is an eleven year old boy named Harry Potter. Harry is a wizard but he doesn't know it. The book states that Harry lives with his aunt, uncle, and a horrible cousin named Dudley. After one little problem with Dudley. Being a normal boy will change forever for Harry Potter.This book is about an odd boy that nobody likes. Harry doesn't even like himself because Harry's parents have died harry and he feels lonely. He has no friends, and nobody will talk to him. It is a surprise when Harry gets a letter saying that he has been accepted at the school named Hogwarts. (Hogwarts is a school for wizards and witches.) Harry goes to Diagon alley with another wizard named Hagrid.Harry buy's his wand, cauldron and other things he needs for school. On the train, Harry meets an owl named Hedwig, a boy named Ron, and a girl named Hermione. When Harry gets to school his teachers tell him about a very dark wizard named Voldemort. Harry tries to catch Voldemort because he blew up Harry's parents. He ends up into some deadly situations. One almost kills him. His friends try to help him but in the end there is only one person that can defeat Voldemort. That person is... Harry. My favorite part of this book was when Harry meets Draco Malfoy in Diagon alley. Malfoy starts to talk about Quidditch (Quidditch is a wizard sport.). Harry doesn't have a clue about what Malfoy is talking about. I think J.K. Rowling does a very good description for how confused Harry is.The most important thing I have learned about this book is how to stand up to people with come backs.If you liked this book and want to know what happens in the next book read the other books in the Harry Potter series. I recommend this book for nine year olds and up because there are some words in the books that seven and eight year olds wouldn't understand. Otherwise this is a great book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Point: The author leads you through the struggles and adventures of a normal teenage boy in an abnormal world. A misunderstood, unbelieved, and constantly picked on boy can come out on top.Path: A small, clumsy, ignored young man, Harry Potter finds out that he is different. He is out of place and unwanted in the world of \\"muggles,\\" but in the world of magic he is known and respected by all. This young man enters the world of magic, finds friends, and faces his fears and enemies.Agreement: The story has interesting imaginative work and you are kept in suspense the whole time. The characters were better developed than most other current works for this age group.Disagreement: The most frustrating aspect is that Harry Potter is a clear picture of teenagers today, yet is held as an example. He feels what most most teenagers feel (alone, misunderstood, under appreciated) and acts as too many do today (sneaky, deceptive, disrespectful, disobedient). Instead of giving an example of how he can change and do right, he is basically presented as doing what was wrong in a particular instance so he could do what was right in the long run.As for the whole magic emphasis, I am not planning on buying a broomstick, owl, or wand. You can read the positives and negatives on Andrew Peterson's post and Dr. Bauder's essays.I don't think it was worth another read.

I have seen this trend for most of my life: TSR's Dungeons and Dragons games, Scorcese's Last Temptation of Christ--heck, I even remember hearing a sermon preached about Pac-Man, and about Ravel's Bolero. Over the years, I've come to decide for myself, with Judi's opinion mattering greatly of course, what is (or is not) appropriate for my eyes, or my children's. So, in 2001, I picked . This was 10 years ago, to this very month, when Daniel was in first grade. I wanted to see all the fuss for myself. I wanted to introduce Daniel to a genre I loved and, maybe deep inside myself, I wanted to disrespect the decrees of the fundamentalist Morality Cops just a little bit.You probably know the plot of the Potter novels. You've probably seen the films, swore loudly as you stepped on the Lego pieces in the dark, and maybe you've even bought the vibrating Nimbus 2000 broomstick--it was pulled from Toys 'R' Us shelves, when an alarmed public realized more naughty adults were buying them for themselves than for their children.I need not have bothered worrying about the Morality cops. Rowling is an amazing writer (Her name, by the way, rhymes with Bowling, not Prowling). I knew, going into the series, that the story was about a boy wizard. I did not expect her adeptness at setting a tone. Take, for example, the opening sentence of this famous novel: \\"Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.\\" With less than 25 words, she captures the attention of the reader, sets a stage, and divides her world into two camps: those who are normal, and those who were not. She employs a light irony in her narrative that neither mocks the reader nor her characters. Moreover, this was Rowling's first novel. Each character introduced--the boorish Dursleys; Hagrid, the hairy motorcycle-riding giant; Professor Dumbledore (a Merlin/Gandalf analogue, if there ever was one); and thin-lipped Professor Minerva Macgonagall, followed by the hero of the series, who is maltreated by his Aunt and Uncle.We follow the young lad as he meets the wizarding world, and is accepted into Hogwarts, Britain's foremost school of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and confronts the malevolent Lord Voldemort, who created such havoc at the time of Harry's birth that the magic community still refers to him as \\"You-Know-Who.\\" Her sentences are usually pitch perfect, and she has an uncanny way of blending genres with excellent writing.A word about genre literature in general, and fantasy literature in particular: it is no stretch to find other series (Machale's Pendragon series, and Riordan's Percy Jackson and the Olympians series both spring to mind) written for young adults, where a young person of unknown magical powers are introduced to a world with an evil overlord that only he may slay. I'm okay with this: it's the mark of genre literature, in the style 12th-century heroic balladeers. The story isn't the plot, so much as how it is told.I think I'm letting my head get in front of my fingers a bit as I type, so let me rephrase: genre literature is supposed to be fixed in form. Potter falls neatly into the heroic category, as well as fantasy genre, as well as the bildungsroman (coming-of-age novel). I say this because we expect genre literature to fall inside a genre. We expect Harry to confront The Dark Lord, and probably to lose Dumbledore along the way (in much the same way as George Lucas penned his Star Wars series). We expect him to find allies along the way, and for Potter to make enemies. Rowling does something substantially more: she writes her characters skillfully and believably, in every single page. Harry Potter and his friends are comfortable in their genre skin, in an unforced manner. Hermione is now a famous name because the frizzy-haired, brainy 11-year-old witch was written with letter-perfect precision. Many other authors of Young Adult fiction fail at the same task Rowling set for herself.I can think of no better endorsement for Rowling and her work than the following anecdote. My son Daniel was unable to read his own name at the beginning of first grade. By Christmas day of that same year, he had completed the first two Harry Potter novel. Say what you will about the witchy, supposedly-non-Christian values of her magical world, she taught my son to read. His blinders were lifted and it set him on a lifelong track that makes this librarian not only proud, but amazed. A person rarely gets to see literacy actually happen in a person. I have JK Rowling, and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, to thank for that gift."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved this book, despite its slightly odd start that almost turned me off. This was back before all the hype about the books, so it was fortunate I completed it back then, rather than putting it back on the shelf of the bookstore.But this series is rightly a classic. People look at the hype and are inclined to think the book is over-rated. Sure I have read more profound works, and indeed I have read books that have stayed with me just as much as this one. Again, other works may contain better writing (although many contain much worse). But Harry Potter deserves to be a world wide phenomenon because it brings together careful use of tried and tested plot elements, a wonderfully imagined world, accessible writing, bags of humour wrapped in a completely captivating tale.No doubt other stories deserve as much attention as this one. But that does not detract at all from Harry Potter. There were moments of this book that had me falling about laughing - which really rarely happens.I think the conquest of the troll in the girl's loo was one of the funniest things I ever read.Surely my review will make little difference to anyone who has not already read this book, but still I thoroughly recommend it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After all of the above nasty comments made about Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I would like to put in my two cents. I first came upon the Sorcerer's Stone when I was looking for a book to read.... I thought the premise looked interesting, therefore I bought it. Mind, this was before the books were a national craze. I read the book, and I must admit, it took me a while to get through the first chapter. But as I read on, I was lunged into a world full of wizards, witches, ghosts, Quidditch finals, raving professors, owls, crazy Muggles, and a series of interesting happenings which lead up to the exciting climax.Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't judge this book by the fame it is being showered with, or it's five-star reviews by the New York Times or what have you, but you should actually give it a chance. The characters are interesting, indepth; though they may be fictional, they sure seem real to me."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a pageturned if I ever saw one. You can't put it down. It has good charectrs and plenty of events to keep you enthralled. It even has some good plot twists. The only thing its sometimes lacking is orignality. Often predictable, and any of the orignal animals are just revised names of others. However, all and all, this is worth your time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Hi! I'm Brittany. I'm from Minnesota. I have read all 3 books. They are the best books I have ever read! I like the way Harry Potter gets into trouble! My favorite part is when they play Quidditch! I love this book and I hope you will too!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am 52. I liked the book a lot. I'm reading them all, even though the news says that J.K. Rowling may have borrowed very heavily from a 1984 book of someone else's. Still, the books are great fun. I feel, however, that certain things are not for children's hearts and minds. For example, at least three times in this book, malevolent characters sneer at Harry Potter that his parents died violent deaths and that they deserved it. This in my mind is not fare for eight years olds. It is fairly violent and scary reading for youngsters. I'm having a great time reading them all, but I won't give it to any children I know."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was a fun read, with an imaginative flair. However, the plot was more episodic than integral and the characters were dull stereotypes. I'm not sure why it's so popular, but anything that gets kids reading is OK in my book. With regard to its magical content: religious persons might want to remember that magic isn't real."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry potter was a great book. I am disapointed that they translated the original english version into an American version. but I hope you will like this book very much."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It is a great book and I think that everyone should read it. I loved it and everyone else will love it, too. It deserves 50 stars, not only 5. And its not only for children either. I also think that the author has a great imagination and is very descriptive, she makes you feel that you are right in the story with Harry, Ron, and Hermione! I would recommend it to everyone, so if you didn't read it yet, you might want to buy it right now and get reading!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In a world that has seemed to produce crummy serial books for children in the last 10 years, the Harry Potter series by Rawlings stands high above. The books are similiar to those of Roald Dahl and will appeal to anyone who has read him. These books are written on topics that will appeal to the 7-12 year old age group but are written well enough that adults will want to pick them up too. This is a perfect book for &quot;read-aloud&quot; time with your children and the fact that it is just the first in the series means hours of enjoyment ahead."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter has grown to be somewhat of a phenomenon, and I am one of the many who happens to own a copy of the first book. I read it with fairly low expectations, and afterwards, found myself with about the same impression.This was not a bad book, in fact I was actually surprised with J.K. Rowling's writing: it was cute, clever, and imaginative. It's just that everything in the book has been done before, and 'The Sorcerer's Stone', while imaginitive, had little to offer.The beginning was a weak version of James and the Giant Peach, and the rest was a somewhat imaginative account of wizardry. One of the problems I faced was that I had no feeling towards Harry Potter, and the end account with Voldemort (sp?) was as strange as it was uninteresting. Also the quasi-romantic relationship bewteen Harry and Hermione has been done better.All in all, Harry Potter is cute book, derived from elements of common children's literature, but nothing spectacular. It's a good book to start kids into the habit of reading, but I am surprised by the enormous hype and sales."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is the best book of the Harry Potter series so far! When Hagrid tells Harry that he is a wizard it's just so exiting for him and you don't know what is going to happen. I think it would be so good to be told you're a wizard (or a witch) and be famous too. J.K. Rowling is a really fantastic author! She makes up the most interesting names for the people and places, like platform nine and three quarters. My favourite character is Ron Weasley. Also I like his pet rat Scabbers! I'd like to taste the lollies and food in the wizard and witch world and especially butterbeer. I think it was interesting how you didn't know what was going to happen next. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone is truly the best book in the series so far, in my opinion! I would recommend it to anyone from the age of six to sixty and over! J.K. Rowling is the best author to come up with a book that would be loved so much all around the world. Keep up the good work and keep writing those Harry Potter books, J.K. Rowling!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"this is a great book i didn't want to put it down. I tried to read it in between classes that didn't work.

Read the other reviews."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As a mother, I wanted to see what all of the fuss was about. After reading this book, it was obvious. I then read a chapter of the book to my 10 year old daughter. She hung on each word. This was an opportunity to spend a quantity of quality time and gave us a great deal to talk about, including discussing the &quot;clues&quot; that the author interwove throughout the chapters. We couldn't wait to read the &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;. This book is a definite must for all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What a splendidly imaginative book. Only those with the most closed of minds could rate this book anything less than five stars. Harry Potter an unloved and unwanted child enters a wonderfully exciting world of magic and finds friendship, acceptance, and a sense of self. It is a wonderful book which can teach children the value of self-love and self-worth. Of developing good friendships and accepting those who aren't exactly the same as everyone else. Everyone belongs no matter who you are. Kudos to Rowling for an absolute gem of a book. From a devoted and caring christian Mother who is careful about the materials I allow my children to read, this rates right up there with Charlies &amp; The Chocolate Factory, and The Hobbit. BRAVO!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is soo good, I read it in about 2 Days! one night I read it till 3:00 in the morning because I could not put it down!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think that this book is very good.

Well, there's a reason the kid made the cover of Time. The stories are great, with all the wonderment of Roald Dahl, whom I adored when I was younger. Here, J.K.

I've read the first three times - I just can't put it down for long!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am 23 years old, and more than a little embarrassed to have received the first Harry Potter book as a christmas present.

I'm 44 and can't remember reading a book I am so enthusiastic about in years. I only wish I had a child to share it with but I'll just push it on my adult (and young in attitude) friends. What a pleasure to escape in such a magical and mysticle world for unfortunately too short of a time. Thank you Ms Rowling"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book and the rest of the series is by far the best books I have ever read. A couple weeks ago, my mom gave me the first book, but I was convinced it would be too childish and I couldn't understand all the hype about them. I finally saw the movie and (although I am embarressed to admit) I then read the books. As proof of my love for these stories, I finished all 4 of them in a matter of three days. In school I couldn't put them down and read them through English, lunch, and then French (not something that encourages the parents, huh?) I have seen the movie 3 times and will be seeing it for the 4th time tomorrow night. &lt;BR(...)Through the next three books, you will follow Harry and his friends through their adventures at Hogwarts and will learn about a world you never thought possible, and it is described in such detail, you will wish it was real. Bottom line: this book is for all ages of people who can open their minds and envision such a place as Hogwarts and this magical world Rowling has so carefully planned out. The reading level on this book should be ages 6-106. This is a book for everyone. You will never once regret reading it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I bought this book because a 30-year old friend talked me into it. My expectations were minimal (after all, it *is* a children's book!); but what a pleasant shock! I couldn't put it down -- it's clever, imaginative, suspenseful, and funny. I feel sorry for the unfortunate children whose misguided parents forbid them to enjoy Harry's magical journey from the cupboard under the stairs. There are lessons in friendship, honesty, and bravery -- and consequences, when things go wrong. My 4-year old son loves to hear about Harry and I'm looking forward to when he's older and we can read these delightful books together."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Although I have read many great fantasy books such as The Lord of the Rings and The Once and Future King, I found Harry Potter the most enjoyable. The idea of being whisked out of an intolerable existance is very appealing. Harry Potter is forced to live with his cruel relations, the Dursleys, from the age of one, after his parents are murdered by the Dark Lord Voldemort. The Dursleys loath Harry with a passion and they would do anything to make his life miserable. Harry has no friends and is utterly alone. On his eleventh birthday, a letter arrives for Harry inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Hagrid, the friendly giant who delivers Harry's letter, tells Harry that he is a wizard and is famous for surviving Lord Voldemort's curse. At Hogwarts, Harry meets his two best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry's friends and enemies are well developed and realistic. Background characters are often amusing and represent types of people in the real world. The book is very suspenseful the first time you read it. Later, you can read it again and identify many clues that foreshadow the events of the book or future Harry Potter books. The world of Harry Potter is rich with fantasy and it is fascinating to follow Harry as he discovers it. There is something desperate, lonely, and brave about the character of Harry Potter that draws you into these books.My favorite book ever!!!!!!!!!!!!! Go J.K. Rowling!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Can't wait for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was an alright book. It started off slow, but got better as you read on. This is not a book that I probably would have chosen as my first choice book. Nothing really sticks with reality. Its all about flying on brooms and casting spells. I think that the reason people read this book is because they like to beleive in the unreal. That can be a good thing until you are to far away from reality. A book should take you away from reality and the veryday life, but not to actually beleive the in the unreal. Harry Potter is about a boy named Harry, who is invited to attend a wizard school. One thing is that this book should show that if there is something out there that is ment for you then it will find its way of finding you. Like when all of the letters kept on coming to Harry, until he finally got them. When you got closer to the end of the book it did get better. Harry didn't mind going home, partly because he had his magic. All in all it wasn't the best book, but it wasn't the worst book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I always hesitated to read any Harry Potter book because I thought they were only for kids. When I went to see the movie, I was afraid that it was going to be too much of a kids movie. I was wrong and I ended up enjoying the film very much. After seeing the movie, I decided to give a book a try. I was pleasantly surprised by \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone.\\" I really enjoyed the book, and I&#8217;m not afraid to admit it.Rowling has written a book that is able to take us to another world that we have never experienced before. Keep in mind that being a fantasy writer isn&#8217;t easy. You have to have the tools and the imagination to be able to pull off writing a fantasy classic. Well, Rowling does not disappoint and does a magnificent job of telling us a story about magic, danger, and courage. You too will be amazed with the imagination that this successful author possesses.This is a story about young Harry and how he comes to realize that he is a wizard. He also learns how his parents died and exactly who, or what, killed them. Harry goes to Hogwarts to learn the craft of wizardry. There he meets new friends, as well as enemies. He also learns what it takes to be strong and courageous, and what it takes to face his deepest and darkest fears once and for all. This is a tale of good versus evil in a magical setup, with interesting characters, both funny and scary.To the parents who are tying to say that these books are evil and should be banned, give me a break! (...) There is nothing dangerous about this book. Let your kids have an imagination. Sure, you don&#8217;t want very little kids to read these books, but this is a great book for older children. I bet that the parents who are protesting this book have never even read the book. Jeeze, there are worse things out there. (...) This book shows kids that there are good people in this world and there are very bad people as well. Believe me, there are worse things our kids can be doing. (...)This is a book that both the young and old can enjoy. For anyone who loves fantasies, this is a must-read. I loved every word and was pleasantly surprised by this wonderful novel. I&#8217;m anxious to read the rest of the \\"Potter\\" books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is possibly the greatest book written ever for young readers.

What is all the fuss about? Well, let me tell you. This first novel in the phenomenally popular series, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, is by far one of the greatest novels I have ever read. And no, I don't just mean children's novels. Author J. K. Rowling abruptly begins the story and does not hesitate to create mystery upon mystery upon mystery. The reader will have so many questions by the end of the second chapter that he or she may be tempted to call a friend who has already read the book to find out what is going on. What follows in the next chapters is a wonderfully imaginative story full of suspense, depth, action, and mystery that are certain to keep a reader genuinely interested in what every page has to say. Not once was I ever bored or unenthused while reading. And not only is the book entertaining, it is also intelligent. Most adult readers will think they know the conclusion of the novel half way through the book, but they will be pleasantly surprised to discover that Rowling has more up her sleeve than meets the eye. Also, the characters (especially Mr. Potter himself) are written with such depth and dimension that the reader cannot help but feel compassion, hatred, or both for every single one of them. The best way I can describe this book would be to call it a Roald Dahl story on steroids: a novel with more symbolism, depth, character development, and plot than the excellent books (James and the Giant Peach, Stuart Little, and The Witches to name a few) by the master of children's stories.Note: Check out the three sequels to this novel; with the exception of #2, they are all highly worthy sequels to this masterful work."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Ok here I go.

I finally got around to checking this out of the library last year. It was so cute, adorable, etc etc. Of course I had to rush out and get my own copy, and books 2, 3, and 4! This is a wonderful start to the Harry Potter series. It's gentle enough for younger children but fun enough for everyone else. My daughter is five and is begging me to read her Harry Potter. I think this is an excellent book for parents to begin reading &quot;chapter books&quot; to their kids. (You know, you read one chapter a night?) Any parents concerned about the themes in the series should read it themselves first. I would save the later books for older children, but The Sorcerer's Stone is perfect for the little kids.

There is something here for folks of all ages ... clever plots and humorous writing for the adults, and a group of heroes to whom children can relate. Rowlings is an extremely talented and entertaining author. I believe the Harry Potter books will help a lot of kids with self-esteem issues. From Harry's extremely humble beginning, living in a cabinet under the stairs in his step-parents' home, to becoming a wizard-in-training, the young hero demonstrates that kids can grow and become anything they want.

I thought I would find it to be disappointing after all I had heard, because when something is built up and raved about, you get your hopes high and they fall. Not in this case, however.I found Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to be just as wonderful as it had been proclaimed time and time again.It's a new-aged fairy-tale with lots of plot twists. Though it's labeled a children's book, anyone with imagination can find themselves plunging head-first into a wonderful story about magic, witches and wizards.I couldn't set this book down, and I rarely make that statement.

This book was worth every penny they spent making it. It's one of the best fantasy books out there. Everything came together wonderfully.I know it probably wasn't scary to most people,but I found myself getting a little bit spooked in some parts. The best parts about this book were all of the details,such as,the character's names,all of the magical aspects,the names of all of the candy,the suspense created towards the end,and the way the story comes together. Let's face it. If most people tried to come up with all of the creatures,names,foods,magic classes,games,and mysteries and put them together into one story,and of course make the story make sense,they would be ready to jump out a window! Although this book,and the rest of the series isn't supposed to be a mystery type novel,the plot does seem to come together that way.This is a book for all ages.One thing to keep in mind.The books start to get thicker, and thicker.Don't they? The latest(Goblet of Fire) is all the way up to about 735? pages long. If you have a kid who doesn't mind sticking with a long book,I recommend you give this one a shot.Because,trust me if you start this series(this book)you're going to want to continue it to the finish!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a 15 year old girl and I am caught up in the Harry Potter pandemonium. I received this book as a Christmas gift and i started reading it and I just could not put it down. It is very magical and something about the characters and the way you get to know them gets you hooked. You feel you actually know brave and famous Harry potter, his loyal and trustworhty friend, Ron Weasley, and brainy Hermione Granger. Yes there are many magical books and I have read many of them but something in this book just captured my attention and has held it for 2 years now. And as for them being evil and having to do with a cult is one of the silliest thing I have heard. The books only explore a world that exists only in our imagination and everything in that world is unpredictable and magical. It is just a make believe world and has nothin to do with teaching people evil. Yes there is evil in the book but there is also good just like in the real world. The magic they use and teach in the school Harry Potter attends is not evil and there have been so many stories about magic and spells it makes my head spin how people have attacked these books when there are so many other books with magic in them. There is also nothing satanic about the books. In the books the good fights the evil everyone who reads roots for the good side. ...

I love a book that you can imagine is actually happening... imagining that there really are wizards and witches and sports on broomsticks. It sounds like so much fun... so when you read about it it's like being a part of it. It's kind of like reading a piece of history or the newspaper. It's easy to get into.

A classic, for all ages, invigorating my faith in the fertility of human imagination, reaffirming that there's still a lot left for mankind to look forward to, from this and other worlds that exist just beyond the realms of our senses. This book brought my childhood back, along with a desperate urge to acquire some magical skills so that I could accompany Harry in his exploits, not wanting to believe that for this life (at least) I'll remain a wretched 'muggle' waiting for the sequels to keep myself abreast of the future adventures of my dear friend, Harry Potter. If you want to know more about the book then you may read the other 3659 reviews (at the time I am writing mine, and am sure this no. will swell some more), but my advice is forget the reviews, just start on with the book, and ENJOY."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"First off I don't see why the US should changethe title of this book, the real title is &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&quot;. Sure the Philosopher's Stone is &quot;real&quot;, yep J.K. Rowling didnt' make it up, but still I see no point in changing it.Well enough ranting, this book is like my title say is for EVERYONE just because you a teen (like me) doesn't mean you can't read this book, some of my friends have read it too and they also like this book. There are so many twists and turns that you probably won't get the culprit until the end when it's all revealed to you and when I found out who it was it all fits together (this is the same with all 4 books and probably all 7 if I'm right).Oh to all those schools and people who want this book to be band for children, think first this book although deals with magic helps children to read (this might be the first book under 10's read which is over 200 pages), and for that reader tell you son not to take this book seriously, this book is just for entertainment and for the imagination nothing else."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is the best ever book. It is a thriller, comedy, drama, action, and adventure! It is all about a boy named Harry Potter who is always bullied by his cousin Dudley, and is disliked by his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. His parents supposedly died in a \\"car crash\\" when he was a baby. Ten years later, on his brother, Dudley's birthday, he goes to the zoo with him, since the woman who was meant to look after him, Mrs. Figg broke her leg. When they were looking at snakes, Dudley and his friend found the biggest one, a boa constricter. Harry starts talking to it! A few weeks before his birthday, he gets mysterious letters addressed to him, but he's not aloud to read them. When he finally does get to read them, he finds out they are from wizards, and before he knows it, he is at Hogwarts School of Whichcraft and Wizardry. You'll have to read on from there!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read this book many years ago when I was about 11 years old.

One two three words to finish this stupid ish up ugh am I done yet? Nope ok"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As a young reader the spell of Harry Potter has caught me. Iremember the day so well in grade four when my teacher decided to readthe book to us. I remember the teacher telling us the title of thebook and all of us kids moaning and groaning over the title thinkingit sounded really dumb. Then I started listening to the book andbefore you know it I'm enjoying it. Then came the chapter of thesorting hat. All of us sat waiting to know what house Harry would bein. And then when the sentence said &quot; Not slytherin? Are yousure? Well then you better be in&quot; My teacher then stopped. Shesaid we'd have to wait until tomorrow to find out what house he wasin. Well after school I ran right to the bookshop and bought it andfound out for myself. This book is very enchanting and I like it somuch I decorated my room like a quidditch field it looks awsome! Ialso have a Harry Potter webpage! I hope you like the book as much asI do!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Reading this book brought back so many happy memories of getting lost in a wonderful fantasy tale as a child. Harry is a nice, unassuming boy being raised by his unimaginative and mean aunt, uncle and cousin. He is treated as a burden, forced to live in the darkened cupboard under the stairs (complete with spiders), and forever living in the shadow of his piggish, spiteful cousin. Then one day an owl delivers a letter to Harry that leads him to a grand adventure as well as allowing him to discover more about his background and true parents.Obviously I can't say any more about the storyline than the nearly 4,000 people have already written here. Let me just say that I found this book to be delightful! It's a captivating story for children, and the wit and warmth make it equally appealing to adults. I finally understand the reason for all the fanfare surrounding these Potter books. I am happily moving on to the 2nd book in the series, and I've recommended this book to numerous friends, acquaintances and strangers on the street...ok, I exaggerate, but the book really is that good! If you've avoided this series because you either think it's only for kids or because you don't like anything that has this much public attention, stop depriving yourself!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have read this book and it is excellent. I only have a limited time to read and found this book very exciting and enjoyable. The charaters are quick and funny with some of there remarks. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Or at least, that's the feeling I get from talking to my friends. What can I say about the book that hasn't already been said? If you loved fantasy as a child (or discovered it as an adult) you need to read this book. A breath of fresh air in children's publishing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Reporter: Good evening ladies and gentlemen! We are here today with Harry Potter from the book &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.&quot; Harry where do you go to school?Harry:Well, Julian, I go to school at Hogwarts the wizarding school. I'm not suppose to tell you where Hogwarts is found, but I will tell you that it is located somewhere in the hills in Londan.Reporter:So, Harry, in your book you play Quidditch. Could you tell the folks at home what Qudditch is?Harry: Qudditch is a game that we wizards play on broomsticks. There are four balls that you play with and the most important ball is the snitch. It's gold and it has wings. It needs to be caught to add an extra 150 points onto your score to have the game end.Reporter:Well, that soundlike a very fun game, but I have another question. Do you enjoy living with your human aunt and uncle?Harry: No I do not. I can't talk about majic or do anything magic at my muggle house. I have to wear my cousins clothes that are way to big.Repoter: What does muggle mean Harry?Harry: Muggle means in wizard languge human. To most wizards muggles disgust them.Reporter: Harry, are you scared that Voldamort will come back and hurt you?Harry: If voldamort does come back, I will be ready! I'm learning more spells and if he does come back I will try to out smart him and win!Reporter: Well, it is time to go! I'm glad you watched the 6:00 news with our guest Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is my all time favortie book. It talks about a boy named Harry Potter that is raised by his mean and ungrateful relatives, the Dursleys. But Harry is actually a wizard. When he was a little boy an evil wizard named Lord Voldemort killed his parents and tried to kill him as well but fortunately he didn't succeed. Since the incident he was sent to his aunti and uncles house to be raised (the Dusleys). When he grows older he finds out that he is actually a wizard and gets sent to a wizarding school named Hogwarts. He goes to Diagon Alley to buy school supplies and what knot. At Hogwarts he meets two very nice friends, Ron and Hermione. All three of them goes to Gryffindor, which is one of the four houses at Hogwarts to be schooled. During the school year he finds out that he is very good at quidditch (a wizard sports game) and becomes their team seeker (a position in the game). But evil strikes soon and Lord Voldemort is behind it all. Harry finds out that he is trying to steal the Sorceror's Stone, which is believed to give you eternal life. So he sets out to stop him from stealing it with his trusted friends. In this fun filled book you will expierence drama, action,and humor in every corner. I read this book at least three times and I still don't get bored of it. J.K. Rowling, the author of this book has lot's of imagination to make the wizarding world come alive. This book truly has it all. This is a master piece. One of a kind. Absolutely not a every day book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought this book was very good. There are many different moods in the book, like suspense, humor, and adventure. There were many stuff in the story that made me keep wanting to finish it. Like when Hagrid (Harry's first friend in the story) told him that he was a wizard and that his parents died because of the evil wizard Voldemort. That made me wonder if Voldemort was going to appear. For all the people that didn't read this book I won't type if he did or not. I would suggest for anyone to read this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful read. Fun for all ages, it is easy enough for my 12 year-old sister and her friends to read, yet fun for my 36 year-old cousin to read as well. Much like the TV shows we watch as children, Harry Potter can be enjoyed by all, for the content as well as for the simplicity. Another reviewer, burcuka from Greenbelt, MD, said, \\"...that one of the great things about this book is that everyone can read and enjoy it.\\" As an avid reader, some people might think that knowing that younger kids can read and understand this, might cause me to not read this novel, however, I find that being able to discuss books, this one in especially, to be a wonderfully rewarding thing. This book has given my sister and I a little common ground, which for us is hard to find. Harry is the perfect example of how you can overcome any background, be it poverty, abuse, or just being teased on the play ground as a child. Harry encounters trouble from the time he is born; yet he works with his friends to overcome each problem that arises. This helps to teach all of us that no matter how hard we may think our life is, we can still overcome all the problems and adversity that arise in normal life."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is one of the books that you want to read in a trice. The imagination is great, and the excitement never ends. I can't think about anyone who will not sympathize with Harry... I am sure after reading this book, you will wonder about the next volumes, and want to read them, too.I think one of the great things about this book is that everyone in the family can read and enjoy it. You can share the adventures of Harry with your child, parents, or friends."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a fantastic book! I am 56 years old and was fascinated by the book immediately. Not because I want to be a child again. But the author has all the story-telling skills that it takes to tell a good old story, exciting and simple at the same time, with lots of fantasy and a charming protagonist. It is a fairy tale, so we do not have to worry about the credibilty of characters, action or plot. We read the story for the fun of it. It is back to the basics: a modern Scheherazade at her best!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Soceres Stone is a great book.

(aside from The Secret Garden) but thats beside the point. This book is excellent from ages 9+ because it gives so much detail and its the greatest adventures! It's fun to read and I couldn't put it down at camp! I read and read until my eyes hurt! Hope you read it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think that this is a very interesting book because of the way the author tells the story: he makes it very exciting and makes you want to read on and find out what happens next."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After hearing my 48-year-old father rave about the Harry Potter books for months (he had originally bought it for my little brother but ended up reading it himself), I finally broke down and started the first one. I am a 22-year-old college student and I have not been so entranced by a book in a long time. While I am sure children would love this book too, I highly recommend it for all adults.

One thing that I thought was really funny was when Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia always locked Harry in his cupboard. It was kind of mean though.

It had all the elements of a fantasy with amazingly clear characters. even the least mentioned characters seemed to be old friends by the end. how Harry was trapped at his &quot;Evil&quot; uncle's house was great. I knew that I honestly hated Dudley. The best element was how he was to be the hero for the era butwas kept in the dark. The school he attended was excellent; I wish mine was like that. Finally, this is one of the finest books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K. Rowling does a most excellent job of keeping the book suspenseful. The book leaves you longing to become Harry Potter and hope there is another book so the story doesn't have to end. I read this book and loved it.

With Harry's limited wizarding skills, can he do it? It is a test of courage, and the support of his newly found friends.

Since I was a Christian my parents never allowed me to read it. But then Looking for God in Harry Potter by John Granger came out. I made my mom buy it and read it. After she read it and the first book she allowed me to read it. I was immediately hooked.Now some people say that the literature is simple and easy in this book but it is the simplicity of this extraordinary book that we all love! And for those people who say this book is not good for Christians or that it is demonic (my grandmother thinks this about Harry Potter and Twilight. She refuses to let me read it in her house) then I say read Looking for God in Harry Potter by John Granger. It will hopefully change your perspective and allow you to enjoy this wonderful book and the rest of the series like I have."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Let me start like this.. I was never into Harry Potter. Well, at least not like I am now. I was a fan of the movies but that was about it. Then I was told to read the books, I figured, what the hell. So I started with Half Blood Prince and then Deathly Hollows. Wow. If I read pretty much the last 1/4 of this series and got so sucked into it, I owed it to myself to take the whole trip through this world that cannot be described in words.I finished The Sorcerer's Stone totally forgetting about the movie so it was like I had never seen it. The SS is the perfect stepping stone to get the series started. It introduces most of the main characters and gives you an idea of how to understand whats going on (which considering the twists and turns of the series, you'll need all the info you can get.)From beginning to end, you're thrown into Harrys life. You feel everything he feels, his emotions, his thoughts. You feel sorry for him when he's living with his family, and you can't wait to find out what happens the next year at Hogwarts. And that is what makes this an amazing story, your connection with him and the anticipation for what is going to happen to him next. This book is a must buy for any fan of fantasy stories, don't let the fact that it's in the childrens section of a book store throw you off. The road Harry walks will get a lot darker. See this as the calm before the storm."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J. K. Rowling introduces to us in this fabulous story, the tale of a young boy who is anything but average. You see Harry is a wizard who has been sent to live with his muggle relatives after the death of his parents. His relatives try to thwart his becoming a wizard by any means possible. This causes Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to send Hagrid the game keeper to bring him to Hogwarts and thus begins the magical tale of how a young oppressed boy finds friendships, danger, and a mortal ememy who wants nothing less than his death. This is the fast paced tale of a high-flying sport, Quidditch, potions and spells, and intrigue where things are not what they seem. Highly recommended as the start of a classical series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The first time I picked up this book, the first in the Harry Potter series, it was with great hesitation. Firstly, it had been a few years since I had done much reading for pleasure, so I was out of practice. Secondly, and more importantly, I had heard a great deal of hype about the series in the media, which automatically made me feel that the books were probably overrated--and I didn't want to be disappointed. In the end, around the same time the film version of this book was released, two of my close friends convinced me to give the series a try, and lent me the first book, which I read shortly thereafter.Within a week, I had purchased and read the rest of the series (at the time, books 1-4), and was itching with anticipation for book 5. I have since purchased and read the entire series, and just recently decided to reread them all in one go.So what makes Harry Potter so magical? For me, it was the bare simplicity of the central premise of the series that drew me in instantly. Who hasn't dreamed of having some magical powers to spice up life a bit? Not that magical powers are unique to Harry Potter; far from it, in fact. But it's much harder to really relate to grand tales of epic battles in faraway, long ago kingdoms like Tolkein's Middle Earth or so many others that have followed. What Harry Potter touches is that little daydreaming part inside of us that believes that maybe magic could be real... that it might exist right alongside us in our own \\"real\\" world.Book 1 (The Sorcerer's Stone) will always have a special place in my heart, as it really was the book that brought me back to reading (as stated above). It is imaginative, fun, and has splashes of humor throughout. It introduces many lovable characters who will be with us throughout the series, and does a brilliant job of setting up our journey. It has a comparatively light feel (the later books get progressively darker, without question), but still keeps the reader engaged with elements of mystery and rivalry to generate conflict. And, unlike some of the later books, it is a quick read.There are, I admit, a few times when one must employ the willing suspension of disbelief (lest the grown witches and wizards of the story seem horribly inept), but otherwise, it is a charming story and a great introduction to the journey ahead. I give it 5 stars, even though it is not my favorite in the series, mostly because this one drew me in so effectively and made me want to read the rest."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Writing a review on the first Harry Potter book seems superfluous, as it must surely be one of the most reviewed books in the history of literature.I will therefore refrain (more or less) from summarizing the story, and instead compare my first reading to my recent re-reading of the book.In my first reading, I met a boy called Harry, who was the quintessential \\"uncool kid.\\" He grew up at his aunt and uncle's because his parents were supposedly killed in a car crash when he was a baby. That was at least what Aunt and Uncle Dursley told him. Harry was the uncool kid both at home and at school, hence constantly jumping from the frying pan into the fire. At home, \\"the Dursleys often spoke about Harry (...) as though he wasn't there--or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug.\\" Their spoiled son, Dudley, also did his best to bully Harry around. And at school, \\"Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.\\"Hence, when Hogwarts' half-giant gamekeeper told Harry that he was a wizard, he could hardly believe it. And when Harry stepped through the Leaky Cauldron onto Diagon Alley, everything was new and exciting. He had not had the slightest clue that such a world existed; accordingly he saw everything through the eyes of an amazed and hungry learner.And since I as the reader always walked by Harry's side, I, too, had this \\"sense of awe.\\" Together with Harry, I marveled at Gringotts Bank and its goblins, the power of the magic wands, the magic broomsticks, Platform 9 and the steaming Hogwarts Express, the gigantic school castle, the meeting hall with its enchanted ceiling, the moving staircases, the \\"living\\" paintings, the ghosts, the owl post, and numerous other things.Harry became like a two-year old toddler again who is excited about discovering the world, and as the reader I was a toddler with him. This is Fantasy at its best. The fact that J.K. Rowling made Harry an \\"outsider\\" to the world of magic is of great importance to the experience of the reader. Otherwise I would not have been nearly as astonished about the details of Mrs Rowling's world as I was. It also prevented the technological aspects of the Harry-Potter magic from totally disenchanting her world.Now to my re-reading of the \\"Philosopher's Stone\\" (I still like the original British title better than the \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\").I read the story again shortly after I finished the seventh book. Knowing where the story and characters are headed, many scenes now took on new significance. It was fascinating to read a particular passage and think: \\"Ah! Now I know why she put that in there.\\" I have to complement J.K. Rowling on having planned the seven books so well.Furthermore, reading the first book from the retrospective view of the whole series also makes a difference for the moral custodians among us. If you only read the first book, you might come away thinking that Harry Potter tries to justify the means by the end a little too much. Harry's magic is at first set into motion when he is \\"upset and angry\\", the toffee-nosed know-it-all Hermione turns likable by lying on Harry's behalf, and one of Harry's chief character traits is that of a rule breaker.Aside from the point that novels--including juvenile ones--don't have to portray their main characters as saints, the series has, in fact, turned out to be of great moral depth. Given Harry's final moral choices at the end of Book VII, Book I can now be seen as the beginning of a \\"Bildungsroman.\\" That is, a Coming Of Age Story in which Harry goes through all the stages of childhood and adolescence, to finally arrive at moral, social, and psychological maturity.If that is not an ideal way of making teenagers aware of their own journey to maturity, I don't know what is.- Jacob Schriftman, Author ofThe Crack Beneath the Worldsand Other Books"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is the first book in the series- but listen to Jim Dale's narration when the character of Hagrid is introduced for example.

Amusing, fast-paced and easy to read. Also extremely well-plotted; all independent events converge on the Sorcerer's Stone. That's very skillful. It is quite enjoyable, but not fascinating for me.I don't think it is so good as a fantasy novel. It is not so imaginative, rather too realistic as a fantasy. It doesn't describe an another world, but a mere variation of our real ordinary world. It's rather a traditional school-life story. However, I think that makes this novel readily acceptable to so many people, even to those who doesn't like fantasy novels very much.The characters are rather two-dimensional. Harry, Ron and Hermione are relatively well described, still I feel they are not flesh-and-blood people but chessmen of different roles. And I don't like the description of the school houses rivalry; the house points are up and down like a computer game. I might be fascinated, if this novel were more like a novel."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Looking for a good book? Try Harry Potter. The book is by J.K.Rowling.

Needless to say, I was hooked right away. The books are fun, and remarkably complex for \\"children's stories.\\" As much as I liked the first movie, I've liked the books even more ... but I still can't wait to see the next movie made! I hope they do a little bit better with the characterizations this time (am I the only one who thought the movie-Malfoy and movie-Snape didn't seem anywhere near as evil as their book counterparts?)As creative as the Potter series is, it boils down to old-fashioned good vs. evil battles. Which is why I don't understand the cries that this book promotes witchcraft and the like (especially when the people who say this haven't read the book or seen the movie). Harry Potter does not promote witchcraft any more than the Wizard of Oz or Cinderella does (and I don't think anyone would consider the Fairy Godmother a challenge to the Christian faith ... I sure don't).The best thing about the Harry Potter series is that it has gotten kids (and adults!) of all ages into reading books. I think it's wonderful that kids are sitting down (voluntarily!) to read books. It's just a shame that well-intentioned adults are trying to take away the joy of reading from their kids."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved this book and I recommend it for all ages.If you want to learn about yourself read this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I liked this book alot!

Last week, I decided to revisit the world of Harry and his wizarding companions, this time in audio format while I was going about my workday. I was delighted to find that this book is just as magical and engaging as I recalled. I've read through the entire series previously, and this first adventure has always been my favorite of all the Potter books. In Harry's debut, the world of Hogwarts and the adventures of the children is presented in such a manner that it truly captures the imagination, and it is full of inventiveness and pure FUN - something that the series went away from as time progressed, and Rowling decided to tackle more serious subject matter.In my second reading of \\"The Sorceror's Stone\\", I had an even greater level of appreciation for the efforts of Rowling. Not only is the story remarkably fun, but it's also a first rate middle grade mystery. The way by which Rowling cleverly inserts clues throughout the novel is quite brilliant, and the payoff toward the ending is fantastic (though the climax is a bit muddled). The characters are also very well drawn, creating true empathy in readers for the bespectacled protagonist and his loyal friends, as they struggle through the challenging world of magicking. Though I don't agree with the more depressing tone that the series took as time went on, there's no denying that Rowling has a brilliant knack for children's literature, and for triggering the imagination. Likewise, it's no wonder that the story of Harry has become the largest reading phenomenon not only for this generation, but quite possibly any previous one, as well... Muggles, rejoice! Harry Potter is still fun!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Great book I love harry potter and I wished the series wouldn't have ended last year but still great!M"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I haven't read all the books in sequence before.

Worshipped by kids, enjoyed by adults, this modern myth has become an accepted classic worldwide. Pull any copy of the series off a shelf anywhere in the world and you're holding magic. It's not hard to see why. Right from the first page of \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" (or \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\\" for those reading in the UK) Rowling proves that she knows a thing or two about the kind of magic that brings stories to life. The book starts with Harry as an infant, the child of a wizard and witch. He is suddenly left orphaned after an attack by the evil and powerful wizard Voldemort, a villain so dastardly that most wizards and witches refer to him as \\"You-Know-Who\\". Mysteriously, Harry survives and Voldemort, his power apparently broken in his attempt to kill the child, disappears leaving many to think he's gone for good. News spreads fast and Harry is hailed as a hero. Even though he's just a baby his victory over Voldemort makes him an overnight celebrity among magic users the world over. As a result, the Headmaster and Deputy Headmistress of Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry step in to decide Harry's future. They decide to take the child out of the spotlight and allow him to live a normal life with his only remaining relations, a Muggle family named Dursley, until he is of age to attend the Hogwarts school. They leave Harry on the doorstep of the Dursley's home, with no more than a letter of explanation. The story truly begins nearly ten years later, after Harry has endured a childhood of constant scorn and hatred at the hands of his new family. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia are embarrassed by the fact that Harry's mother considered herself a witch and married a man who claimed to be a wizard. The Dursley's simply don't hold with such nonsense. They consider themselves respectable. As Muggles go, the Dursley's may not be prime examples of the worst of their kind, but they rank pretty high. They force Harry to sleep in a cupboard under the stairs and to wear their spoiled son's damaged cast-offs. Harry is little more than a servant and a punching bag to his cousin Dudley. But worst of all, Mr. Dursley has not read Dumbledore's letter to Harry, leaving the boy unaware of such things as his heritage, the truth about his parents death and his emerging powers. Then everything changes with the delivery of a letter in a very unusual fashion. From that point on, Harry's life is never the same again. The letter is actually an acceptance letter, a notification to Harry that he has a place at Hogwart's school. Literally rescued from the Dursley's and taken under the wing of Hagrid, the school's lovable giant of a groundskeeper, Harry embarks on the adventure of a lifetime in the hallowed halls of Hogwarts where in addition to his studies he makes close friends and a lifelong enemy, discovers a talent for a very unusual sport called Quidditch and solves a mystery that threatens the world, not to mention his very existence. The magic potion Rowling herself concocts starts solidly with Harry, a remarkably unassuming kid who's got \\"hero of mythical proportions\\" written all over him. He's courageous, clever and resourceful. He's got a special talent in the form of magical powers, and a noble and mysterious birth. He's wounded - a big one in myths - not just physically as evidenced by the scar on his forehead, but emotionally as well due to the death of his parents, not to mention a tortured upbringing by uncaring relations that rivals Cinderella's. But most of all, as was hinted right from the start, he's got one heck of a destiny. All this comes together to introduce a character the reader immediately bonds with. You *really* want to be this kid's friend and hang out with him to see what happens. Next into the potion goes a heavy dose of down-to-earth realism - the kind of everyday stuff recognized by almost every kid in the world... but WAIT! You, gentle reader, are never allowed to get comfortable in the world of the often stupid, ever boring Muggles, because you're not one of them, are you? Of course not. You know better, because Rowling blends in the essence of magic fantasy with such skill that Harry's world literally shimmers with it. Because you're not a Muggle, you can see it all around you as you read. The rest of the ingredients are just as high in quality, from the magical, mysterious yet somehow familiar Hogwarts School to the friends that help Harry get through it all, to the exciting conclusion. Rowling serves it all up with a deceptively simple and straight forward writing style that sparksa response deep in the subconscious, drawing the reader in and holding on tight. The fact is, this story is not just read, it's experienced and that's the magic right there. Of course, adults have to fight their Muggle tendencies and indulge in a little suspension of disbelief to get full enjoyment of the story. For example, those of you who read a lot of Tom Clancy might have trouble getting past the fact that such occurrences as motorcycles flying over London and entire groups of people who vanish into thin air at train stations, go virtually unnoticed. The exact purpose of the wizards trained at Hogwarts in relation to the world is never really explained, except in some vague reference to the further study and possible control of the other preternatural type creatures such as dragons, zombies and vampires who also go unnoticed by the Muggle world. Apparently, when it comes to Muggle mind control, it's everyone's game. Those readers with sci-fi leanings might start picturing Hogwarts as existing in an alternate dimension of sorts but that's not the point. The point is suspension of disbelief. It just all happens because it does and no one in the real world knows about it but those involved... and that's that. Though I thoroughly loved this book, my only off moment came near the end, where I began to wonder exactly how suitable the images depicted were for the impressionable minds of Rowling's younger readers. Still, at the ripe old age of 32, I might just be over-reacting. \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is a fantastic book, well plotted with strong characters that not only talk and act like real kids, but are also great role models as well. These kids do their homework, brush their teeth, study for exams and still have time to get into trouble in the name of a good cause. There is one excellent and well spelled out moral in the story that doesn't detract from the plot and if the reason why Harry survived Voldemort's attack doesn't leave you with a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye, I suggest you read it again.

I, like many others, waited for Book 2 and then Book 3, to come out so that we may pick up a copy for our own. Considering that it is for children, J. K.

It is a captivating best-selling novel that is all-inspiring for all ages. I am not a reader and as soon as I started reading I refused to put it down. You will instantly find a favorite character and living Harry's life from the first word to the last. You will laugh and sometimes even feeling very sorry for Harry. J.K. Rowling slowly reels you in and you get to know every character like a friend...or foe.As for the movie it is great as it follows the book and can even be more thrilling at times. However I reccomend you read the book before you see the movie.And after you finish the Sorcerer's Stone you may want to sink your Muggle teeth into the equally terrific sequels.

The reader is extraordinary.

A tried and true story indeed and unfortunately, that is where Rowling falls short--she is dealing with a story that has been told hundreds of times and doesn't do it masterfully. Certainly her imagination is apparent throughout but at the core of the story is an idea that has permeated literature for decades. One only has to look at the works of C.S. Lewis or Roald Dahl (fellow British authors of old) to realize what can truly be done with this story archetype.Each chapter feels like its own seperate story causing a jumpiness that I felt to be rather jarring. It's almost perfect that the book is being converted to a movie because it feels like a scene-by-scene screenplay, not a flowing work of children's literature. Her representation of the awful Dursleys (Harry's guardians) almost reads like Dahl's &quot;Matilda&quot; or &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;--except it isn't as well-written.It is obvious that Rowling is trying to capture a magical feeling and present it to the reader, but falls painfully short. Is that to say Harry Potter is not worth reading? Certainly not. I enjoyed the book, but I saw how much more amazing it could have been. It doesn't lack in heart and that is probably what attaches people to it. One can't help but cheer the ill-fated Harry Potter as he romps along with his friends. It's a wonderful story in the hands of a less than able storyteller. If you enjoy the adventures of Potter, I would highly recommend checking out Lewis or Dahl if you want a book told by the true &quot;wizards&quot; of children's literature. You'll realize what you've been missing all along."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is a warlock. He attends Hogwart's School of Wizardry. He learns to cast spells, fly on a broomstick, and play Quidditch. Harry also makes friends, has a pet, hates his homework, and loves jellybeans (well, maybe not the vomit flavored ones). It is through these recognizable traits that J.K. Rowling makes the story believable. We, as readers, may not know any wizards, but we know little boys--little boys just like Harry.Except for the witchcraft, (okay, and the dragons, and the unicorns, and the ghosts, and the trolls, and the, well, you get the idea.) Harry and his friends are normal, average kids. They go to school, get into trouble, get out of it, play games, have fights, make up, and have fun. The author is consistent in the abilities of her characters as she has created them. And she has created a story that, while not unique, is the best of it's type.If Harry has ancestors, they are much less realistic. Comic books from the 60's and 70's gave us Wendy the Good Witch and Casper the Friendly Ghost. Television brought us Samantha Stevens and her daughter Tabitha. And, more recently, Sabrina the Teenaged Witch. All witches or other &quot;immortals&quot; trying to fit into an American society. Harry, on the other hand, is a fully formed, fully functional, pre-adolescent wizard-in-training. And he is being taught that it is okay to be different. He is the most fully realized fantasy character of this type that I know of.It is this aspect of Harry that espresses the universal truth underlying the metaphor of the fantasy. Harry may be a wizard, but he has real kid problems. He is an orphan who does not like his foster family. He has a spoiled cousin who makes his life miserable. He has friends with whom he likes to play ball. He has teachers he likes and ones he does not. He is the boy next door--only with a wand and a pet owl.For these reasons, the Harry Potter series is one of a kind. It combines the best of many genres of children's fiction, and does any and all of them well."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I found this book to be a great introduction to the series.

But, at the beggining Harry is living with is uncle Vernon, his aunt Petunia, and his cousin Dudley on Privet Drive. They make up the Dursleys. Harry gets accepted into Hogwarts(a school for wizards/witchs) and isn't allowed to go. But, the key keeper Hagrid comes and tells Harry he is to go to Hogwarts and that he will come with Hagrid to buy school supplies. The Dudleys were to take harry to the train where he is to be taken to Hogwarts. When Harry arrives he meets another wizard named Ron who shows him how to get to his \\"unknown\\" platform.On the train he and Ron meet a witch named Hermione. All of them get drafted into the house of Gryffindor. Later on they find out about a evil sorcerer named Voldemort and a special stone that could make people emortal. The students suspected their potions teacher Snape (who they thought tried to kill Harry in his Quittich match) to be the one who was trying to steal the stone. They began to investigate and went into a chamber where all sorts of wild things went on...Harry then found that the person who was trying to steal the stone wasn't Snape. It turned out to be one of their teachers Quirrell.........This book was excelent and i recommend it to every one.

The Character that Rowling create are really good how she discribe the character, and how they are a big part of Harrys future. I like how Rowling made the magical world, and the muggle world. the are both the same in so many ways that they dont know. How Rowling gives the names of the characters that has a meaning to it. like snape his name stands for neck and he i guess he is going to die with a slice neck. Almost every character has a meaning of their name and how in the the future is going to effect them or others. so this book I like so many things too think about."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was a pretty good book. It was better than the movie that's for sure. The book had things that the movie didn't have. It would of been better if the movie had these things included. For example the very fist pages of the book weren't in the movie. I think it would of been better if they were. Another thing was the way Harry, Ron, and Hermoine found Fluffy.Harry Potter is a about a boy who has no clue of who his parents are and he spends ten years of his life beign treated like a slave by his aunt and uncle. His cousin is a brat and is always hitting him. Then finally all this turned around when Hagrid, the school gamekeeper, told him he was a wizard. He was accepted into the best school of magic. Everyone new him, but he didn't know why.At the school there was a lot of trouble because of the Sorcerer's stone. The wizard who wants to kill him wants that stone to regain power because he lost it on his first attempt to try to kill Harry. Harrry has to stop him from getting the stone, but he doesn't do it alone. Harry has two wizard friends Ron and Hermoine.This is where the story begins to really get exciting.I think that everyone should read this book because it has action and suspense. There is also some irony, because it seemed like this person was the bad one, but he wasn't. This book is a book for any age and everyone should get a chance to read it. If you haven't seen the movie I suggest that you read the book first. This way you can find out what is missing and make the comparison for yourself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book had many wonderful things to offer. The fact that it made a person like me think outside the box. I am not a thinker but when I was reading the Sorcerer's Stone I was kinda obligated to think. This was a really thought prevoking kind of novel. She made the readers think about who the bad guy really was and didn't find out until the end. Suspense was dealt with a lot here but we still love it!Rowling made it fun and exciting for the younger children but also added a hint of religious affairs as well. She is completely in tune with her religious affairs as am I. Since we are both of different religions I got to learn a bit more about her beliefs. She seems to like sharing her beliefs and distributes them out into the world. I have come to that conclusion simply by reading some of her other great works and the rest of the Harry Potter series. I have only but one thing left to say, I can't wait for the rest of the Harry Potter books to come out!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I recommend this product to anyone who has read the Harry Potter series and cannot seem to get enough, or to anyone who simply does not have time to read the books. It is the complete story, word for word. The way it was written by J.K. Rowling. The Narrator has a British accent, which lends to the feel of the series and he does all the voices as well. Hagrid is on the money and Hermoine's voice is hilarious. Having someone else reading it on CD, which is the only thing I was worried about when I bought the audio books, does not take away from the feeling in this book. If you cried the first time you read the book, get ready to cry again. A friend recommended the audio books to me and I would like to recommend them to you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful book that is perfect for any child between the ages of 10-18 and adults. I think this because it has some complicated literature, but back to the point. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was written by J.K. Rowling who did a wonderful job on telling a story about a boy named Harry Potter who's parents died in a horrible accident when Harry was only a baby. Afetr this, he is forced to live with his only living relatives left, the Dursleys. As awful as life was for Harry, a magical and unexpected event lie ahead of him, one that will change his life.Throughout the book, Harry meets many new characters and makes a few freinds who each have interesting personalities. He also experiences a thrilling adventure filled with many challenges. Over all, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a great book to read, and I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As the title says, anyone can enjoy this book. For fans of fantasy titles, and sorcery books. I would recomend the book to anyone and everyone because it is simply a book that caters to every age. It introduces you to the character of Harry Potter and his struggles under the supervision of not so nice uncle and aunt Mr and Mrs. Dursley and their son Dudley. He recieves a letter from Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft and his life is changed forever. He also learns the fate of his parents.Personally, I could read this book over and over again. Some people say it's overrated and it sucks but I think otherwise. A great intro to harry Potter, I wouldn not recomend seeing the movie first. Buy the book, it's waay better."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Rowlings first book is a real gem. You meet Harry and his closest friends, and you learn how his story began. It's a really quick read, and by JK Rowlings standards is a short book. As are all of her Harry Potter books this one is totally original and the characters just jump off the page. I always suggest anyone being introduced to the series to read them in order..and to read them before you see any of the movies. The movies are really good, but dont compare to the books and Ms. Rowlings great writing. The gentleman who reads the books on audio, Jim Dale is fantastic, he makes the characters really pop, and his Hagrid is hilarious. As for as the books go id rate them...* The Goblet of Fire* The Prisoner of Azkaban* The Half Blood Prince* The Sorcerer's Stone* The Chamber of Secrets* The Order of the Pheonixbut really they are all good in their own way..I mean I consider them all five star books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After watching the first four movies I finally decided to have a look at the books to see things at their source, so to say, and I found it satisfying.The first point I wish to stress is that the first movie is a more than adequate rendering of the book: some of the plot has been changed but the atmosphere is just the same. Where the movie clearly surpasses the book itself is in the visualisation: Ms Rowling has no outstandind talent for -or is just not interested in- the settings while the scenographers of the movie clearly have. Hogwarts and the other minor locations, which are so very much alive and impressive in the movies, are rather dim in this first book.As it is well known (this is the 00000th reviews) the author had the brilliant idea of mixing the depiction of a typical British institution such as public schools that has already been source of inspiration for hundreds of works with the love for magic and fantasy stories that was budding at the time.Apart from this (a \`this' that earned its author many millions of pounds) there is nothing outstanding in her book: the writing is neat, at times witty, the plot straightforward, characterization consistent, but there is no trace of genius in all these pages: we are not faced with a new Shakespeare nor with an irresistible entertainer: we have a clever story (clever, not honest: there are many cunning devices here) that flows unerringly to its end providing a fair amount of satisfaction.An outright flaw is one I needed a little time to grasp: style inconsistencies. It seems to me that Ms Rowling started writing with a children's story in mind but later her true inspiration, which is a much darker one, overtook her pen giving birth to gloomier paragraphs. I love dark fantasy, I really do, but this continuous shift between two different attitudes is not pleasing nor show a complete control of writing skills."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's StoneJ.K. RowlingScholastic IncorporatedDo you ever wish that you could make someone you don't like go away, or open a locked door to see what is inside? In the world of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, by J.K. Rowling, you can. Harry is a ten year old boy living with his Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and cousin Dudley Dursley. He has been living with them since he was one year old when his parents were killed. Harry was receiving letters, but his Uncle just took them and got rid of them. But when the letters got out of hand, the Dursleys and Harry go out to a shack on an island in the ocean and stay there for the night. But an unexpected visitor, named Hagrid, comes to inform Harry about the letters and that they said that he has been accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Then he takes Harry to this school where Harry has to get sorted into one of the four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, who becomes a competitor on the Quidditch field. Harry is chosen for Gryffindor, forming mortal enemies with Draco Malfoy, a Slytherin. The first flying lesson is where Harry learns that he is a natural born Quidditch player, a wizard game played on broomsticks with four balls and three goal posts. It ends up to be all thanks to Draco Malfoy that Harry gets to play, because Harry is chosen for the house team of Quidditch and will be the youngest player in a century. It ends up being very important when Hagrid accidentally tells them (Harry, Ron, and Hermonie) about the things that students are not supposed to know that are going on in the school.Harry, this story's dynamic protagonist, has a lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead which is from the dark wizard, Voldemort, that killed Harry's parents when Harry was just a baby. Since Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon do not feed Harry very much, Harry is very skinny and gangly. He is also very brave. Harry is extremely famous because he was not killed by Voldemort. Harry wears glasses that are constantly getting broken by Dudley. Ron, Harry's best friend, has the flaming trademark Weasley red hair. He is also tall and skinny with big hands and feet. He comes from a big wizard family with five older brothers and one younger sister. He loves wizard chess and is a fan of the Quidditch team, the Chudley Cannons. Hermonie is from a muggle family, but is a very good witch. She is very smart and the top student of their class at Hogwarts. She also has a lot of common sense. She hates lying to teachers. She also has dirty blond, curly, and pooffy hair. Other characters include Neville, George, Fred, Hagrid, and Draco Malfoy.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, by J.K. Rowling, is a wonderful fantasy book that I would recommend to everyone of any age group. This book leaves you hanging and wanting to keep reading at the end of every chapter. J.K. Rowling also makes it so my attention was never lost, but always on the book. This book is part of a series of Harry Potter books that are all amazing. The mood of this story is always changing and that is part of the reason why this story is such a good story.

I'm looking forward to the rest of the books..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When a person who has read numerous novels of fantasy and science fiction first begins to read \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" it may be difficult to align with J.K. Rowling's universe. Rather than build upon existing mythology, J.K. Rowling started from scratch and created a self-consistent universe unique from all others. The result is that some readers may initially attempt to fit their paradigms of magic, wizardry and witchcraft to Rowling's story, and become frustrated until they wipe away those paradigms. It is for this reason that children enjoy Rowling's universe so well. They have yet to acquire the preconceived notions of adults, and Harry Potter is so fun to read that they fall into the story immediately.When Harry was a baby he encountered Voldemort, considered to be an evil wizard. Voldemort was nearly destroyed in the encounter and Harry Potter became famous, even though he was removed from the world of magic until he turned 10 years old. Unfortunately, Harry's parents did not survive the encounter and thus Harry came to live with his cruel aunt and uncle, both \\"muggles\\" who despised and denied the existence of magic.Harry Potter is stereotypical of the classic nerd. He wears broken glasses, his clothes fit poorly, and he is put down by his aunt and uncle. Into this rather mundane and pitiless world comes a mysterious letter from a place called \\"Hogwart's. \\" Suddenly Harry realizes there is more to the world than living under the stairs, and we travel the road to knowledge and a better life with Harry because we want to BE Harry.Harry attends the first year of seven years at Hogwart's school, and learns there is a world of magic that exists all around, but which is protected by a multitude of resources lest muggles become alarmed. Harry learns much about magic and that there are mysteries in the world of magic that affect him. Harry also begins to learn the amount of magical ability that he has inherited from his parents, and that with that power he has the ability to control the outcome of situations.J.K. Rowling has written a book that compares favorably with other children's book. Her characters are likable and accessible, and her world is fun. There are moments of amusement and moments of fear, and children of all ages should find this book a treat. Highly recommended reading for anyone over the age of 8 years old."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is my favorite character in a book.

Thankyou for my key."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I bought this book on impulse. For some reason I was not made averse to the book by all the hype surrounding it. Even from second-hand accounts I could tell there was something genuine here.This is a sweet, funny and even occasionally moving story. J. K. Rowling's prose is without pretension or artifice. There is nothing in it to distract you from the telling of the tale. The thematic aspects borrow a certain amount from Tolkien and the rest of the British fantasy tradition in that it is a story of good versus evil wherein the personifications of evil are all formerly-good people who have been corrupted by greed and a lust for power. The cast of characters is borrowed freely from all of European folklore. The randomness of having goblins and centaurs in the same story seems merely to lend credence to Rowling's conceit that an entire world exists parallel to our own.There are many delightful details in this book including the Mirror of Erised, the personality of Hagrid the giant, the choice of names for the characters, the &quot;wizard pictures&quot;, the rules to the game of Quidditch, and the succession of rooms and travails that lead to the Sorcerer's Stone. Rowling is able to be original in all these details while at the same time evoking tradition. That is, the devices are fresh and familiar at the same time.It was the emotionally moving passages of the book that surprised me the most. Rowling conveys feeling without the least suggestion of maudlin and shows us the consequences of good and bad behavior without a trace of hectoring.I will without hesitation read every book in the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone has finally confirmed to me something which I have long thought. That is, that within every adults' heart and soul beats that of a childs wonderful imagination. And it could also be that for grownups who read and enjoy the Harry Potter books, it allows us to rememebr back to when we first discovered authors like Madeline L'Engle, Roald Dahl and C.S. Lewis.By now unless you've been stranded on some deserted island, most people are familiar with the young wizard Harry Potter. And even if you haven't read the books, you would at the very least be familiar with the circumstances surrounding the writing of these books and the enormous popularity of them.As a new reader to the world of the Hogwart school, wizards, spells and games played on flying brooms, I am happy to say that the two days I spent reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone were absolutely delightful ones for me. And if I began the book with some skepticism, or doubts, it didn't take long for me to fall in love with Harry or his friends, Hermione, Neville and Ron. As for the villains they were portayed so well and were just so good at being bad, that these parts of the book caused me to cheer even louder when Harry and his cohorts were victorious. By the time I finished this book, I was running out the door to buy the next three titles. Now I'm sitting on my hands not to gulp them all down but rather space them out and savor them. Hopefully Ms. Rowlings next addition to these books will be ready by the time I am finished with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.A first rate book and read for children and adults alike. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As a Library Assistant, I know first-hand the power Harry Potter holds over the kids. No less than five children a day ask for these books, and they are never checked in. The waiting list is a mile long. I decided to see what all the fuss was about. Am I ever glad I did...What a wonderful beginning to what I'm sure is a fantastic series! Harry Potter is at once a fascinating and engaging character, one I can't wait to read about further. The writing is simple enough for the younger children, but is entertaining for those of all ages.Not only was Harry interesting, but all characters introduced were fun to get to know and spend time with. This is a book worthy of all the attention it is getting and more!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a 57 year old software professional I bought the unabridged book on tape read by Jim Dale to entertain me during my long commute to and from work. I quickly became charmed, amused, and totally involved in this delightful story and found myself sitting in the garage not wanting to go in the house until the chapter was finished. You will laugh out loud at some of the droll throw away comments by characters in this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"There once was a boy named Harry, who's parents met their demise because of a man of dark arts, but Harry was far to wise.As a baby, left with a lighning bolt scar and no parents to find retreat, Harry was brought to the muggle world his aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon to meet.They took him in without love, keeping hatred for him in their courts and all the while unknowing he'd be sent to learn at Hogwarts.Hagrid, the game keeper, found Harry and helped him collect all his stuff for his very first year at Hogwarts The express came and went in a huff.This school of wizardry awaited the day for Harry to arrive. He came upon the sorting hat &quot;...to Gryffindor...&quot; with slightest surprise.He soon met up with two others, both students just like he, Harry and Ron and Hermione, they soon were best buddies those three.Through the classes of the school year Harry obviously learned a whole lot, yet trouble always found him whether he looked for it or not.The sorcerer's stone was guarded by a big huge dog with three heads someone was trying to steal it so Harry saved it instead.I won't give away the story and how the ending came about you should be sure and read it so you definitely do not miss out!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This was a fun book and is a wonderful story for younger readers. Beyond the 'good' versus 'evil' core, there are many Aesopian morality lessons throughout. That's good. What I find great is that J. K. Rowling takes the younger readers on a special journey. She frees their minds to think with creativity and flare. I think that's what most teen books lack.Rowling has a rich imagination. She packed loads of funny, thrilling, and suspenseful situations into this already classic book. But in doing that, the book thins out. It's not nearly as rich and full and deep as I think it could have been.As I was reading, I could almost see the book outline she was writing from. There is no situation where you wonder if Harry is going to make it out okay or if he's going to be affected in a profound way, as in by a great loss. It seemed to be a paint-by-number plot.Rowling's major characters, though cute, are the least imaginitive part of the book. They're generic--cookie cutter characters on a great ride. I wanted to know and care more for Harry's best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, but there was little to hold onto. Maybe they'll be developed more as the series progresses.As far as grabbing the reader, Rowling is truly gifted. She has great pacing and ends every page with a 'hook', to make the reader want to see what is on the other side. This is a good beginning to the Potter series, I just hope she enriches the reading experience to the deeper degree I believe is attainable."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As a senior in highschool, I was persuaded to read Harry Potter by the validictorian who read it in our AP Economics class. The style of writing struck me as lighthearted yet articulate, being incredibly humorous while keeping wordiness at a minimum. The universe captured in Harry Potter enthralls young and old; an imaginary world of which 'muggles' like you or I are completely unaware. This book is a marvelous first chapter book for a 1st-3rd grader, or a fun filled novel to read in between chapters of Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina (as I did). I would recommend this book- and indeed the entire series- to anyone, anywhere. Also, the Harry Potter books remind me greatly of those written by another English author- Roald Dahl. If Harry Potter interests you, I recommend Matilda, the BIG, or the Twits, all by R. Dahl."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My husband and I are in our forties, and we LOVED listening to the first Harry Potter on audiotape, read by Jim Dale (a British actor). He did an incredible job, keeping all the characters quite individual and recognizable. We look forward to hearing all the books. I want to own the books in the print version, but I've heard so much about differences in the British and American versions that I don't know if it changes the content. I might want the originals - but I don't know enough to make a decision."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"They said this book was for children, but the hoop-la was so fantastic I just couldn't resist. Since I have no children to read it to and all my friends got to read it with their children, I have to say I felt left out. Who was this Harry Potter? Everyone I know was talking about young Master Harry, and there I sat - uneducated - overaged. So, throwing caution to the wind, I read my first book this weekend and I'm buying the second book today. Who said children had to be aged 9 - 13? This is some of the best reading I've done in years. The writing slides across your mind forging images that no movie director will be able to recreate. This Harry Potter series is sheer genius. I love it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter series has to be one of the most popular children's fantasy series, since CS Lewis wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\\". Most people have heard of the series, and many have read the books and/or seen the popular blockbuster films.When the final book in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, came out, I opted not to read it with everyone else. So now I am re-reading the first six books, before tackling the final book in this great series.For those not in the know, Harry Potter is just a boy, who is orphaned and is living with his unbearable Uncle, Aunt and their son, Dudley. He lives a miserable existence, where he is forced to live in a tiny cupboard under the stairs. However, his life is about to change. He finds out that he is in fact famous, and a wizard! Unknown to Harry, his parents died when they came up against the evil Lord Voldemort, and it was Harry that killed Lord Voldemort, with only a lightning bolt scar on his forhead to show for it. He is \\"the boy that lived\\". As Harry enrols at Hogwarts School Witchcraft & Wizardry, he meets new friends, and comes up against old enemies.This series is really wonderful, and the first book is exceptionally good. JK Rowling has created characters that everyone can relate to, and more importantly, everyone adores. Right from the first page you find yourself hoping that Harry will conquer over the evil Voldemort, and even over his ghastly relatives. The storyline is simple yet effective, and there are enough twists to make it a good read for adults, as well as children.I've re-read the first book several times, and each time I do I always remember how much I love this one. The whole series is great, but the first one is one my favourite. Its like taking that first delicious bite of a piece of cheesecake! Harry Potter is definitely one of my guilty pleasures in life."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a book to be enjoyed by young and old!

This series has influenced many other writers, including Stephen King! It has helped children to bond with adults in a fun and magical way. It has introduced a new world to all who read.In the first book of this series, we are introduced to many of the main characters that play a crucial role in Harry's life. We travel to Hogwarts, a school of Magic where truth be told, I think many of us would like to attend. We meet deep characters, some good and some bad and we learn of magical villages that can be accessed only by those \\"in the know.\\"If you haven't done so already, make the HP series part of your library and share it with your children, friends and family."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"There is no need for reviews. You would have to be out of you mind to dislike any of the Harry Potter books. They lack nothing and are absolutly perfect. You know somebody must like them the writer went from barely making it to being a billionaire within a few years."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Unless you've been living under a rock for the past few years, you're heard the kerfuffle over J.K. Rowling's series of books about a boy wizard named Harry Potter. Some people have vehemently argued that the books are evil, because they present a pleasant face to all kinds of occult practices, and others have argued with equal vehemence that they're perfectly harmless children's books. Now, I have a few prejudices to confess right up front when it comes to this kind of argument. For one thing, when some preachers were all up in arms over alleged &quot;backwards masking&quot; hiding satanic messages backwards in rock songs, I had to ask, &quot;Have you ever tried listening to them forwards?&quot; In my opinion, there is plenty of evil right out in the open, broadcast night and day through our television sets, and practised openly on street corners. We don't need to go ferreting out evil as if it were some kind of secret. The real trick would be finding someplace where evil is absent. For another thing, I have a real problem with people who go around denouncing (or, for that matter, defending) a work which they have never, in fact, read. It seems pretty clear to me that many of the most strident voices on both sides of the argument betray absolutely no sign that they have, in fact, read any of Rowling's books. There's a word for talking about people on the basis of second- (or third-, or ninth-) hand information: gossip. When people argue that nobody should read Rowling's books because they contain witches, monsters, magicians, and giants (all of which, I can't help but point out, are also contained in the Bible), rather than getting to grips with whether this character, that action, or the other value is held up for censure or blame in the book, all they convince me of is that they don't know what they're talking about. God is not afraid of evil: He conquered it. What matters is not whether a book contains evil elements, but whether evil is made to seem attractive, or portrayed as destructive. Well, after much too long, I have laid hands on Rowling's books, and can form my own opinions based on what she actually wrote.My first impression is that, above all else, the Harry Potter books are morality plays, something like George MacDonald's stories such as The Princess and the Goblin. Characters who are greedy, arrogant, prejudiced, or just plain mean are caused to suffer. Characters who are generous, friendly, tolerant, or just plain nice are rewarded. This is particularly clear when Harry's uncle takes his family from a pleasant house in Surrey to a grotty hotel, and finally to a damp, draughty, &quot;most miserable little shack you could imagine&quot; (p. 37) on a deserted island, just to keep Harry from getting his acceptance letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry's aunt and uncle claim that they treat Harry the way the do to keep him away from magic, so he can grow up to be normal, but the story makes it clear that they mistreat him the way they do because they hate him for being different. Since I was the class weirdo most of the way through school, I particularly enjoy seeing intolerance punished, and the fact that Harry's uncle essentially punishes himself through his meanness just makes the moral that much clearer. (Actually, this moral content is so pervasive that it makes me wonder why the books are so popular. Maybe this world isn't quite so corrupt as I tend to think it is, and people really do still believe in virtue.)That is not to say that the books have no issues at all. Probably the most glaring problem is that Harry and his friends seem to be developing a persistent tendency to regard rules as applying to everybody but themselves. As a long-time security guard, I can bear witness to the fact that, in our society, the vast majority of people tend to assume that very same thing, which makes me wonder why anybody bothers formulating rules at all if nobody thinks the rules apply to them. If it is true, as seems likely, that part of Rowling's agenda is to encourage virtue in children, this is one very important area she should address before the end of the series.As for the magical elements which have caused so much controversy, I am reminded of a saying coined by science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke, &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&quot; Rowling seems to have flipped that saying on its head. Her magic is indistinguishable from technology. There is no sense that, when the characters perform magic, they are making contact with any kind of spiritual power, good or bad. In Rowling's world, you either have a talent for magic or you don't, and even if you do, you need to practice it like any skill, and you acquire powers, not by any kind of spiritual experience, but by study. In other words, Rowling's school for witches and wizards is like nothing so much as... well... school. Far from leading children down twisty occult passageways, Rowling's message seems to be, &quot;Do your homework.&quot; The fact that she has dressed up her story with fantastic elements is, apparently, the spoonful of sugar which makes the medicine go down.So, far from being subversive, Rowling's books are almost shockingly supportive of the whole parent-teacher establishment. Maybe, just maybe, the real conspiracy is that those who are decrying the books as evil are really part of an insidious plot to convince kids to read the books and absorb their lessons. Forbidden fruit tastes sweeter, and all that..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone is about a boy named Harry who finds out that he id a wizard. at the age of one his parnet are killed by He Who must not be named.

It is not a happy childhood for Harry, always in the shadow of his oversized bullying cousin, he sleeps in the cupboard under the stairs, wears worn out, second hand clothes, which are too big and never receives any love or treats from his Aunt and Uncle, Harry is led to believe his parents were killed in a car crash and he survived. Odd things happen to Harry without explanation, like the day his Aunt and Uncle took Harry to the zoo, a birthday treat for his cousin, and Harry discovered he could talk to a snake.It is approaching Harry's eleven birthday and a letter arrives for him, Harry has never had a letter before, his Uncle is furious and will not allow Harry to read the letter, letter upon letter arrives and they are kept from Harry and the family go into hiding to avoid more letters, eventually on Harry's eleven birthday an enormous man called Hagrid turns up and tells Harry he has been offered a place at a boarding school, he is not an ordinary boy and the school is Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Hagrid is the gamekeeper at the school, a wizard who was expelled from school in his third year.Harry is told his parents were a wizard and witch, that they were murdered by Voldermort, the dark lord who is so terrifying all but one or two wizards are frightened to even say his name, and that when Voldermort tried to murder Harry something happened, the spell failed, Harry was left with a lightning scar on his forehead and Voldermort became very weak and lost most of his power. Harry was famous in the world of witches and wizards. The Dursleys have always known the truth about Harry but they have an intense fear and hatred of anything abnormal, they believed they could keep the truth from Harry and he would never discover his magical powers.Hagrid takes Harry to London to buy everything he needs for the start of term and his new life at Hogwarts. They enter the Leaky Caldron pub, which can only be seen by witches and wizards, go out the back and into Diagon Alley a street full of magical shops, he discovers that he has a wealth of money in the bank, although the money is in a currency used only by witches and wizards, he gets his cloak, books, caldron, a pet owl and is measured for his wand. Harry returns to his Aunt and Uncle's home until the start of term at his new school.Harry has to get the Hogwort Express to school, it leaves from Kings Cross station out of platform nine and three quarters, between platform nine and ten and only accessible to witches and wizards, but Harry does not know how to get onto the platform, he meets a women with her children and asks for help; here we are introduced to the Weasley family, Mrs. Weasley is a witch, she has four sons and a daughter with her, Percy is a prefect at Hogworts, Fred and George are twins, also at Hogworts and both are practical jokers, Ron is starting his first year and little Ginny is seeing the boys off with her mother.Once on board the train Harry shares a compartment with Ron and Ron's pet rat scabbers, they look forward to their first year at Hogwarts and meeting Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, a great wizard and the only person Volermort fears. The school is in an old castle with hidden rooms and secret passages and Harry becomes best friends with Ron and Hermione Grainger, a very bright girl who is a bit of a know it all; he is introduced to flying on a broomstick, the wonderful sport of Quidditch, mystical creatures, spells, ghosts who wander around the school and he receives a cloak that makes the wearer invisible as an anonymous Christmas present. There are rumours that Voldermort is gathering strength and could regain power. Along with his two friends, Harry is led on an adventure of mystery, riddles and intrigue in an attempt to discover the Philosopher's Stone before Voldermort.The book is full of clues and you think you know what's coming next but you never quite get it right and at the end of the book everything you have read in the two hundred and twenty three pages just fits into place.

I've seen children in their single-digits unable to sit still as they feverishly turn the pages. What I really like is the fact that J.K.Rowling hasn't been unneccessarily patronizing (a problem with most writers for children) and has also been bold enough to use good vocabulary. It's been very refreshing to see my neighbor's 6 year old keep a big dictionary next to him while reading.However, having grown up on a massive diet of books by Enid Blyton, I found this book interesting but not impressive. If parents in the US want wholesome entertaining books for their children, I would strongly encourage them to visit [the Uk Amazon.com site] and try a few of Enid Blyton's books. Trust me, they'll be blown away.Something that puzzles me - why was the books original name changed?

Rowling uses her inventive mind to create a magical novel. Rowling's plot includes simple ideas with an added touch of creativity, which catches the reader's eye. The use of many distinct characters gave humor and conflict in the story line. Imagination was an essential key in the readability of the novel. The strengths of the plot, characterization, and readability all surpass the weaknesses.J.K. Rowling takes ordinary topics such as sports, student rivalry, and strange faculty members to the next level by elaborating on these topics. Harry Potter is introduced to Quidditch, a sport like soccer except it is played on broomsticks and there is more than one ball. Harry Potter becomes a Quidditch champion. Like any other school, at Hogwarts student rivalry exists between competing classmates. Draco Malfoy instantly becomes the bully and with magic involved the story line becomes humorous and clashing. Then you have the teachers who are in control and discipline the students. Professor Snape, a mean and strict teacher, have Harry Potter and his friends, Ron and Hermione curious over Snape's involvement with Voldemort, the mysterious and unknown person who killed Harry's parents. Rowling's plot has humor, action, and suspense, which keep the reader entertained.The huge cast of characters gives the book plenty of laughs and adventure. Conflicts and brawls between Neville, a clumsy and cowardly student, and Draco added enjoyable scenes. Neville could never stand up for himself when he was picked on but at the end he stood up for himself, when it was for the wrong reason. Hagrid, the keeper of the keys at Hogwarts, added comedy because of his forgetfulness and the fact that he was an enormous man and acted like a kid, shocked many students. When Harry and his friends were trying to get the sorcerer's stone before Voldemort, they had to go through rooms filled with adventures. One room was a human chessboard and another was one filled with numerous keys and you had to select the right one to get passed the door. There were so many characters in the story it was hard to remember who was who at times, however the unique names added a splash of diversity in the book.J.K Rowling captivates the reader's interest through her descriptive details and different characters. Fantasy is a genre that she fulfills without hesitation.

I also like this book because it is a fansty and advenyure book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry potter #1 is the best book out of all three. My favorite chapter was Quidditch. I have all 3 books and I'm very eager for the 4th one to come out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I decided to read the book to determine what all the Christian agitation was about. I am a Christian and I believe I have the gift of discernment. I found this book a GREAT read! Family values are upheld, like Ron's family, who does not have to be rich to be happy, and abusive family systems are ridiculed, like Harry's relatives. Good and evil are distinct in the muggle world and in the magic world. A very entertaining series!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think that this is a wonderful book. It is exciting and very entertaining. Never a dull moment. It keeps you in suspense and has a great ending. I highly recommend it for all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Even though thisbook starts slow at first and may even be a little boring at first, keep reading.

I watched all the movies but it wasn't until we started planning a Harry Potter baby shower that I finally started reading just to get a feel for the props. I am totally enthralled and will order the rest of the books now."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Unfortunately, I was never into these books as much as my peers were until recently. I got a free month of amazon prime on my new Kindle Fire and I thought: \\"What the heck, Harry Potter's free, might as well give it a try.\\" I didn't expect to enjoy this book as much as I did. Harry Potter really does deserve all the recognition it gets! This book took me on a journey that I never imagined experiencing. J.K. Rowling' s writing and use of detail are flawless and extremely captivating. I strongly suggest reading the books if you've only just seen the movies. The books make the movie experience just that much more amazing, and I look forward to enjoying the rest of this series. Again, I honestly regret not hopping on the bandwagon sooner!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A perfect introduction to the series. So well written you can imagine being there yourself. Since the first time I read it over 10 years ago, it's still one of my very favorites."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book Harry Potter by J.K Rowling is a good book. The main characters in the book were Harry Potter, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley's and their son Dudly. The setting of the book mostly took place in the Dursley's house. In the begining of the book Harry Potter get's sent to his reletive's the Dursley's,and he really doesn't like it that much because they didn't treat him right so that's why he didn't like them that much. Harry finds out that he is a wizard. At his school he wanders around and gets in trouble. There was a lot of action and suspense through out this book. The ending was a very surprising and made me want to read the next book to see what happens next. I recommend this book for any age group. You will find this book interesting and fun to read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry is a little boy who leads an absolutely MISERABLE existence living with his aunt, uncle, and atrocious cousin Dudley. But Harry prevails, and his adventures will leave you happy, smiling, and feeling 12 again. Let your imagination enjoy this magical gift, and stop being an adult for awhile! You will find your heart lighter, your thoughts brighter, and your spirits soaring as you whisk around on a magical broomstick playing Quidditch in the sky, or battle three headed dogs in an attempt to stop the forces of evil. I can't wait to read the next in the series!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, but I fail to see how it can quite reach #4 (or thereabouts) in the Millennium pole. JK Rowling's writing reminds me of Enid Blyton's (a favourite of mine when I was a child). Older readers should look elsewhere for more meaty reading satisfaction (any of the SF classics should do the trick).Having said that, am happy that children are turning to books because of Mr. Potter!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter was a great book. Harry has a lightning mark on his forehead. From when he was a little kid and you-know-who killed his parents but couldn't kill him. As he tries to find out who's trying to still the stone. While he's at a whitch school. He also has had a hard time at home before he goes to Hogwarts with his horrid aunt and uncle. Don't forget His couisin. Read it you'll love it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is the most incredible read ever! J.K Rowling has a brilliant imagination, the character are so detailistic that I thought I was in this genious work of J.K Rowling (and it is written in 3rd. person!) It was so incredible I couldn't put it down. I didn't eat at dinner, took it with me in the bathroom, and I was done with it in 7 hours!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is about a young boy who one day finds out his parents are dead.

I like this one so much that I would also like to read the second and the third book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My son was introduced to this book in his 3rd grade class. Because it was so well rated, and included in the school curriculum, my wife decided to purchase it for bedtime reading. After reading several chapters, I developed a concern that portraying witchcraft, wizardry, and sorcery as normative, positive and embraceable was inappropriate for the impressionable mind of a nine-year old."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I had hoped, given the reviews I read, that this would be a book great for bedtime reading to my two sons. I bought the book and started to read at night. I had a hard time keeping interested. And my sons lost interest shortly into the book. Just not a lot of new characters or story line to speak of. Seems to be a lot of rehashing of other better written books. Dialog of characters very elementary. And I know this is a kids book, but not too much stimulating converstation. I am sorry that I seem to be an outsider in my opinion of this book, but I think my standard for &quot;great book&quot; might be a tad bit different than prior reviewers."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I've debated writing this review for some time now, but at last I think I can summarize what my thoughts are on this book. Be forewarned beforehand that I'm a Christian (Oh no! One of them! *crowd hisses*), but don't let that fool ya, I'm actually a decent guy.I don't know when this book was written, but what I do know is that the media has innundated us with it. You know what I'm talking about...Harry Potter books, t-shirts, puzzles, toys, lunchboxes, and more paraphenilia than you can shake a broomstick at. This I think is amplified when you have Jerry Falwell banging on a podium (where 99% of the rest of we Christians hold our collective breaths and hope he doesn't say something embarrassing) and calling it evil. After well over a year of seeing this constant deluge of &quot;Harry Potter is sooooo wonderful!&quot; hooplah, I finally gave in and grabbed my niece's copy of it, and sat down one weekend to see what all the fuss was about.At the end of the weekend I looked up from the last page and thought to myself, &quot;Did I miss something?&quot;. That was the experience for me...I walked away from it one single word on my mind. Hype. Now before I'm accused of being a closed-minded witch hater, there's a few things here that should be cleared up before some of the fans here burn me at the stake.The plot is a bit hazy at times. It gels up at small certain times throughout the book, but never really solidifies until the end. This isn't to say JK Rowling is a bad author (or authoress, if you will)...there are times within the book where her talent really shines through. She, to me, has a special gift for describing places and people especially, making images of them come to mind without effort. But let's face it...the people within the book are pure stereotype. The kids are either all good or evil, no in between whatsoever, and the adults are just plain inept. And to the chagrin of all the fans here, let me say I didn't really much care for the character of Harry Potter himself. There is no stoic character there, just a mouthy one who, in my humble opinion, goes looking for trouble. I liked Ron best of the children, just a good all round kid, followed by Hermione, much the same. But I never did quite get a good connection with any of the others to be honest.The &quot;adults&quot; running the school, including the headmaster, are portrayed for the most part as simpletons, unaware of some of the most blatant activities taking part practically right in front of them.Before I get lambasted, I understand this is a children's book. I went into this thing with an open mind, expecting a really gripping story and plentiful visualizing. But the book was only partially successful in this to me. I'd sooner recommend the Narnia series or Lord of the Rings, but there seems to be a large enough CS Lewis vs. JK Rowling slugfest going on as it is.And before I cease my diatribe, I'll shortly explain that the reason that the average Christian doesn't recommend this book is because it's forbidden for us to dabble in the black arts. That's generally accepted as the domain of &quot;the other guy&quot;, and so witchcraft is chronically avoided. So when a book or series of books comes out that candy coats the subject, making it more palatable for young minds (and more than a few parents), we instantly go on our guard. Bear in mind that 99% of us don't think Teletubbies or Barney are evil. Just annoying. ;)It's not personal against anyone who reads and likes this book or the remainder of the series. My niece tells me that of the 4 released books, this is probably the most non-thrilling one, and proclaims that the next 2 are the best. But after this I just don't have the desire to read anymore of them.

A boy discovers he's a wizard. Need I say more? Most children day-dream about that sort of idea. As to the plot: the narrative never gets bogged down by excess prose, and there are always surprises. AND the book is funny. My problem with the this book -- and the series as a whole -- is that the witches and wizards of the magical world are never very pleasant to (and sometimes awful to) the magical creatures. It's funny when garden gnomes (live ones) are pulled up like weeds and, unhurt, tossed over a fence. Somehow, though, whether mandrakes are being repotted (later to be made into a potion) or cornish pixies escape (I'm mixing incidents from different volumes), there seems to be almost war between the human magical world and the magical world of creatures. I still think this is a wonderful read -- and what has been said about the book being bad for children because it's about witchcraft (satanic!) is absolute nonsense. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling has had a lot of success and it is no wander why. The book has many elements to it that make a good book just that. The plot is well thought out and extremely well developed and has many small conflicts along the way to keep the reader entertained. It has many surprises and parts that will make you think, and it has an outstanding ending that makes the reader want to read the other books. J.K. Rowling creates a world of witches and wizards believable and a lot of that is the characters in the book. The characters are round and seem real which is one of the best parts about the book. She does an excellent job of making the reader connect to the characters and does great job of building their personalities through the book. This book is good for readers for 10 to 18 years old because the plot very good and I think many older teenagers would like Harry Potter as well. This was a book made me feel s though I was not reading. I am not a big reader so me liking Harry Potter is a big deal and a credit to the author. I give this book a five out of five for a great plot and great characters. I plan to read the rest of the books because the first one was very good.Marc B."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling is not just a children's book, as some feel it is meant to be, but offers something that a reader of any age can enjoy. As I read I came to find two literary elements that set this book apart from many others in it's genre. First, that the imagery in this book was fantastic, great detail was put into every scene in order to create a clear image for the reader. When it came to the movie a great deal of things were exactly as I had imagined them to be. Meaning that the director of the films had taken the same image from the book and saw it in his mind's eye as I had when we both read the book. And, when it came to the book's characters, they were very well developed as well. Rowling gave such a good sense of his characters that by the end of the first chapters I actually wanted to beat up Dudley and the rest of Harry's family. Because of how they had been spoiling Dudley rotten and letting him go unpunished no matter how horrible his attitude was. The other thing that it does is that it keeps you interested throughout the book. It does this in a couple ways, first the details that I mention before, secondly by providing the reader with a world, words, people, sports, animals, and lifestyles that s/he has never seen or read about before. This great creativity on Rowling's part then leads the reader through an adventure that s/he will find hard to put down. Overall, this book is fantastic, and it will undoubtedly keep your interest, and keep you craving for more of Harry's adventures, regardless of your age."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I just ordered the latest book for my Grandkids.

This book inspired me greatly. Each time I've read it, I have felt as if I'm in the story. I have felt like I'm standing there as I turn each page and read each word. The adventure, the thrill, the heart-warming setting that Rowling creates in this book is wonderful! I loved this first book so much I had to read the rest of the series. I have now read the whole series 5 times. It gives me absolute joy. I know that I will never forget the feeling I get when I read these books. I will make sure that Rowling's tales never end.

The other books in the series were also great, but this one was definitely the best of all."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I owned this book for about two years before I read it. I bought it on a recommendation from a friend and because of its huge buzz when it was first published. But, when I read the first few chapters of it, the whole \\"Harry Potter\\" thing seemed to me like a knockoff of Roald Dahl books, which I'd read when I was a kid.The book sat on my shelf after that first attempt, collecting dust. When someone would ask me about it, I'd honestly tell them that it didn't seem all that revolutionary to me. At the time, before I'd completely read the book, I just assumed that J.K. Rowling was doing her own version of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" or something like that. The book became one of those things that I'd hoped to eventually read, but it wasn't a priority.That changed when another friend of mine recommended it to me, telling me specifically that he'd never, ever been able to guess the surprise villain or twists at the end of any of the books. He dared me to figure out the mystery myself. Seeing the book from an entirely new perspective as a challenging mystery, I was able to finish it. And I wasn't able to guess the ending of it.The character development is absolutely great. The books are well-written, challenging and funny for adults and children. Both the self-contained plot of this book and the overarching plot that affects the entire series of seven planned books are so complicated and filled with dread that it's virtually impossible not to become so involved in the book that you finish it in a couple days.With \\"Sorceror's Stone,\\" you get the shortest book, the simplest mystery and an introduction to the books' basic structure. But, as an introduction into the world of Harry Potter, it's top-notch.Once you realize all that \\"Harry Potter\\" has to offer its readers, it's really hard not to just adore these books. They're great."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Of all the books that I have read, not one has caught my attention as much as this book has.

At first his horrible uncle tries to stop Harry from attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft. With the help of an unwelcomed visitor, Harry is swept off his feet and taken to this magical school. He then meets up with two of his fellow classmates, who he shares most of his adventures with. From school bullies, to saving the school from extreme disaster, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone shows that children can make a difference in this world.

I encourage any person, young or old, to read this book. It would be time very well spent."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a very good book. The story line is good, the plot is interesting, and the charecters are really really life like! The addiotional bits of humor that are thrown in are totally brilliant, and they add all the more reason to buy this book. After you finish, I bet you'll buy the second one too. But believe me, it's absoloutly worth it. You are not throwing away your money. Comparing J.K Rowling with R. Dahl is entierly justified, and true too. Buy it, or you'll regret it"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter books are some of the best books I have ever read. J.K. Rowling describes the scene in the books so well, you fell like you are being sucked into Harry's magical world. These books are very imaginitive and creative, and I recommend them to ANYBODY, not just kids. They are excellent books and can be enjoyed by people of all age groups.JK Rowling captures your attention from the first words, to the ending sentence. A wonderful story.If you were thinking about buying this book BUY IT, it will be one of the best books you will ever read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was a great thrill,yet a little wierd and drawn out. I believe the most exciting part was close to the end were the Quidditch game was really getting started. I thought the way she was so descriptive was a little of a waste. She could have been a little less descriptive and still have a great book.If you start reading Harry Potter, you never want to stop. You say to yourself after this fun part I'll stop, but by the time you've gotten there there is already another good part in affect.I strongly recommand this book to students of all ages. Especially ones who enjoy long, fiction books. Also I recommend this to teacher of all grade levels. It is a good way to get your students interrested in reading ,and if you think you might be a bore to them, try the cassette instead."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book has too many names, they are too long and too hard to remember! I am not saying the book is bad, it is just that it isn't a great choice for readers under the age of 9 or 10! This book is wonderfully written, but if you want to buy this for your daughter or son, make sure they are pretty good at pronouncing long and confusing names and words. They will ask you how to pronounce many words. Overall, you should buy this for your daughter or son, if they are:1) 9 and up2) Good readers3) pronounce words well4) willing to read a long book"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter has no idea how famous he is. That's because he's being raised by his miserable aunt and uncle who are terrified Harry will learn that he's really a wizard -- just as his parents were. But everything changes when Harry is summoned to attend an infamous school for wizards and he begins to discover some clues about his illustrious birthright. From the surprising way he is greeted by a lovable giant, to the unique curriculum and colorful faculty at this unusual school, Harry finds himself drawn deep inside a mystical world he never knew existed, and closer to his own noble destiny. This audio book edition of Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone is a completely unabridged, technically flawless, highly recommended recording narrated by Jim Dale. 6 cassettes: 8 hours, 17 minutes."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved this book and I am now on the second book. This book kept me in suspence. Just when you think you have solved the mystery, something swerves to change your mind. This book is about a regular boy who lives with his aunt, uncle and his evil cousin. Once he finds out he is a warlock, he is sent to the best wizarding school. After meeting his two best friends, Ron and Hermoine, they manage toget into all sorts of trouble as they help Harry escape neardeath experiences. If you have the opperatunity to read or buy this book I would reccomend it to you with five stars!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I know those words have been used to describe this book more than a hundred times, but they're so accurate. I'm 16 and I'm an avid fan of Harry Potter. These are simply the most addictive books I've ever read. I cannot stop reading them. I'm on the second one (just started today and I'm gonna finish it tonight) and the third one will be arriving soon (tomorrow I hope). I can't say anything that hasn't alreay been said, but take my word for it: you cannot go wrong with these books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I found out right before Christmas that my wife was pregnant. As a result we received the Harry Potter series as gifts (so we could get acquainted with it). I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The book brought me back to my childhood when, after a particularly dramatic reading of Tarzan, we stole my mothers dish cloths and butter knives, and now equipped with loin cloths and weaponry proceeded to live out jungle adventures in our backyard. To put it simply it was a pleasant journey through my imagination, which needed a stretch. My wife and I would take turns reading to each other before bed. It became one of the events I looked forward to after a long day. The series is not synonymous with Tolkien, as some have alluded, but what really is? It is a book for a child, and this 23-yr. old child enjoyed it immensely.Also, were your child decide to go off and seriously seek after \\"magic and spells\\" after reading, I would question the job done by the parents teaching the difference between imagination and reality, not the book.Buy the book for your child, or yourself, and take an imagination out for a well needed workout. You will thank yourself later."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Since I am a semi-adult (actually 28) I knew ahead of time that these books were aimed at younger readers but I could not resist and thank goodness for that! These are some of the best books I have read in a long time. Certainly the most fun books I have read in ages... J.K. Rowling obviously wrote these to entertain a younger audience but I found that the writing and the plot kept me involved as well. I read the whole thing in one day and had to wait for the other two books to arrive. I then polished those off in a few days and can't wait for 4-7! I highly recommend these books - it has been a long time since my imagination has been fed such a good meal!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful fantasy written in a captivating style that draws its readers into the author's realm of vivid imagination. My nine year old daughter read this book in just 22 hours. She asked me to read it so we could discuss the book, but insisted that I wait to read it until she had the chance to read it a second time--which took another day. BRAVO J.K. Rowling for creating the 'new fad' of reading!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a story about an eleven year old boy who discovers that he is a wizard. He is invited to a school called Hogwarts which is for witches and wizards. He also discovers that his parents were killed by an evil wizard named Voldamort and he survived oneof Voldamort's spells. He is popular because of a lightning shaped scar on his forehead that symbolizes that he survived theevil spell. He meets some friends and some enemies. The story is also about Harry and his friends trying to find clues to solve the mystery of what happened to Voldamort after his powers disappeared and how to keep the Sorcerer's Stone away from Voldamort. I really enjoyed this book. It was exciting and interesting! I look forward to reading the other Harry Potter books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potters personality is very outgoing and adventurous.He is a curious boy. The plot is about how he goes to Hogwarts and finds out that Voldmort is after the Sorcerer's stone.One reason why I think someone my age should read this book is because it is a thrilling book and once you start you can't help but read the whole series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My book review is Harry Potter and the Sorcceres Stone first the resion i am reading this is becouse I heard it is was good.

Worthwhile reading for adults and kids alike."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am going to use this one review for all four books. These books are so much fun, they're like watching the movie \\"A Christmas Story\\" every year. Read them once and they will quickly become staples of yearly reading. If possible, procure an audio copy. The guy who does all the voices is absolutely amazing. Watch for this to quickly become the star wars of the present generation.

These books are all must reads."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I originally ordered the set of books for my children after hearing the rave reviews since &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; started flying off the shelves. Unfortunately the books continued to be put to the wayside due to homework and busy schedules. I am an avid reader of medical mystery and horror thrillers, so reluctantly I picked up this book convinced that it would never live up to the hype as portrayed by the media. Boy was I wrong. This was truly a remarkable story that lives up to the highest ranking reviews. I am now reading the third volume and the stories keep getting better with each page. J.K.

I really enjoy the audio, it gives me time to do crafts while getting back to Harry's stories.

I always thought they were just kids books but when a couple of my friends told me to read them I did. And they...were...awesome!

But I picked it up, read a page, and one page lead to another, and before I knew it I&#8217;d finished the first chapter, then the second, and soon enough I&#8217;d read the whole book in three hours. I haven&#8217;t had a book pull me in like this since Catch-22, which I read five years ago.Perhaps the most appealing element of Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#8217;s Stone is the character descriptions. JK Rowling positions the reader to respond in certain ways to the characters in the book. Harry Potter is constructed such that he is completely likeable to the reader. He&#8217;s a levelheaded, intelligent and grounded boy without ego or pretension. Other characters classifiable as &#8216;good&#8217; are constructed in the same manner. Harry&#8217;s friend Ron is lots of fun with a self-deprecating sense of humour; Dumbledore, the chief wizard, has a bumbling appeal; and Hagrid the Giant is totally warm and lovable. Conversely, Rowling writes the &#8216;bad&#8217; characters such that she positions the reader to dislike them totally. Characters like Dudley Dursley, the horribly spoilt stepbrother of Harry, or Snape, the terrible Potions Master, inspire hatred from the reader. (...) This is why I loved Harry Potter so much. In the book, I know exactly who I love and who I hate.The plot rollicks along at a cracking pace. (...)Ultimately, I loved this book so much I couldn&#8217;t put it down. The shops are closed right now (8:30pm Sunday night) but in the morning I&#8217;ll be straight down to the bookstore to pick up the second episode in the Harry Potter series. I can&#8217;t see how anyone couldn&#8217;t like this book! It&#8217;s brilliant!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I first became aware of the Harry Potter series upon the release of the third book. I had learned about Muggles and wizardry, but I did not read the books. They seemed like all the other children's book crazes, such as Goosebumps, The Babysitters Club, etc, that have a brilliant few years of popularity and die out from overexposure. Therefore, I didn't pay it much mind. Boy, was I an bloomin' idiot.This book is a triumph. Why? It is a book that adults enjoy on the same level as the kids. This places the movie adaptation in &quot;Star Wars&quot; territory. Meaning that it's a story that transcends all age groups, races, and sexes.Harry Potter is like a boy Cinderella. He has a miserable life until his Prince Charming comes, namely an eight foot, bearded giant, named Hagrid, with an invite for Harry to attend an infamous wizard's school.This book is like &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; and &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; rolled up into one. It has the wonder and innocence of the former, and the magic and adventure of the latter. J.K. Rowling has herself a franchise that has more than just &quot;legs.&quot; (An entertainment industry term for &quot;sustained popularity.&quot;) It has the potential to rival some of the most popular cultural pieces of modern literature in terms of social relevance.It is well written, great fun to read, and it makes you want to purchase the next book right away. Adults, buy it for your kid, and then read it yourself. It's a very entertaining book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As an adult, I was thrilled with the Harry Potter books and read all four of them in about two weeks. Needless to say, I had &quot;Harry-itis&quot; but loved every minute of it. My affinity with Harry started with Book I and only got better as it went along. Not just for children, we, as adults, needed to be reminded we are (or were) all Harry at one time or another in our lives .. messy hair, gawky and tape on our glasses. I doubt if there isn't anyone who never felt they didn't fit in, or they were different from the rest of their family. I imagine everyone has wondered at one time or another if they had a special gift, and if so, what was it. I am certain everyone has wondered at times whether it would pay off in the long run to remain &quot;good&quot; rather than to follow less savory &quot;evil&quot; ways. Everyone has had monsters .. dragons, three-headed dogs, trolls, and witches they have had to conquer in their lives. I am certain at some point everyone has felt there is more to their life than &quot;living with the Dursleys&quot; and like Harry we haven't had a clue how to go about finding more. Everyone has been Harry Potter, everyone has found their magic or at least some of it at times during their lives, everyone has found their own &quot;pack&quot; as Harry found his wizarding friends in Ron, Hermoine and his role models at Hogwarts. Harry is a friend we want to have, even as adults, we want to go to Hogwarts, visit the Leaky Cauldron, conjure up potions, play quidditch, and fly on a broomstick (although I am not sure I really want to deal with Professor Snape!) It was a book that reminded us how hard it was to grow up and reminded us of how special we are, who we have become. Magic, faith, friendship, truth .. we all need more of that in our world, in our own world. Harry is us and we love him!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book turned out to be far better than I had anticipated. I liked it very much, finding it to have some moments of real profundity as well as many absorbing narrative features. The author succeeds in appealing to a remarkably wide range of readers. Certainly she draws on a number of her illustrious predecessors but never in a slavish way, and she produces a work that stands up well against the classics of the past. Her success is well deserved. There is much here of value concerning the virtues of friendship, courage, loyalty, and love, as well as some good advice to all of us regarding what to treasure and how to go about finding it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"All I have is praise for these books! I loved them. I could hardly put them down once I had started them. Rowling is a wonderful author. She writes beautiful, well-developed characters and I love the way that the stories unfolded. You can't help but love Harry and his friends. These book are fun, exciting, and a great read. They make a perfect gift for christmas, birthdays, or whatever. Plus they are great for any age. Not too wordy for kids but will grab even adults attention.

Kids as young as 5 years old can listen to this story a chapter at a time and can't wait til the next chapter is read. Older kids are challenged by vocabulary and newly defined words. As they grow, they will re-read these books and notice the depth of the story and the eternal struggle of good against evil. Especially in these trying times, good triumphs over evil, and a child helps to that end...empowerment! Someday, as parents, they will relate to their offspring by introducing them to our &quot;Harry, Ron, Hermoine, Dumbledore, Snape, Fluffy, Hagrid and then there are the Muggles.......as classic as &quot;Nancy Drew&quot;or the &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; solving mysteries, Harry Potter is a triumph of J.K Rowling's brilliant imagination!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter Review The Wizard, Harry Potter, is a boy.

By the way I'm a retired school teacher and have seen kids go from being uninterested in reading to avid readers thanks to the Harry Potter series. I've even seen kids start with listening to the audios first to wanting to read it for themselves. These books, audios, movies didn't sell millions for nothing.

Once you started you can not stop reading it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm not a kid anymore. I'm an adult now. But somewhere in between childhood and adulthood a curse was cast upon me. I stopped reading. I used to read all sorts of books when I was young (if Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys sound familiar to you, then you'll know roughly how old I am). I read whatever I could get a hold of and it filled me with a sense of wonder and imagination. Reading filled voids during the lonely times, and gave me something to think about during the happy times.It's kind of ironic that a children's book should make me fall in love with reading again. But this book did the trick. From Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I slowly read the next book in the series, then the next and the next. Each book got progressively thicker, but that didn't matter. The stories come to life with humorous characters and this world of witchcraft and wizardry. I was beginning to imagine again!After reading the four books in the series, I said to myself \\"Hey, that wasn't so bad. I wonder why I stopped reading.\\" From that point on, I started with The Hobbit, then The Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien. Then I saw the movie trailer for The Bourne Identity which stars Matt Damon and I looked for the book it was based on. That led me to explore the world of espionage and international conspiracies according to Robert Ludlum. From here, I realized that I should probably balance my reading between fiction and non-fiction. So I read Good to Great, a business book by Jim Collins (the author of Built to Last), Jack: Straight from the Gut (about Jack Welch, the former CEO of GE), Made in America (about Sam Walton...). With a seamingly endless sea of titles to choose from and written by authors I did not know, I started one book at a time from each \\"famous\\" (atleast to the world around me) author. I've read current books by John Grisham, Jonathan Kellerman, Sandra Brown, Carol Higgins Clark, Robin Cook, Tess Gerritsen, and many many more. From this sampling, I've developed a sense of what I like and don't like. I've discovered what \\"formulas\\" these authors use. All this in a span of 5 months.I don't even realize how caught up I get when I describe to my friends the books I've read and the books I plan to read. It's truly an indescribable feeling to once again find the passion for reading. And it all started with this simple children's fantasy book.So would I recommend this book? Wholeheartedly! To kids and adults alike."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In J.K. Rowling's, Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone, Rowling creates such as story that it will make readers everywhere applaud such a wonderful adventure. Rowling uses irony in many places throughout the book. Irony is the discrepancy between appearances and reality. Also, Rowling makes the story contain so many different dilemmas, adventures, and much more. Rowling also paints a clear picture of the story without even going into much detail. This book should be read by anyone, no matter how old or how young you are. Rowling has produced a novel that will leave the reader wanting more.Throughout the book Rowling uses different forms of irony to intrigue the reader. Situational irony is used nearly every time the page is turned. Harry and his friends do the exact opposite of what the reader would expect in almost all situations. For instance, Harry and his friends get in trouble countless numbers of times for breaking many of Hogwarts' (School of Wizards and Witches) rules, but they still go on adventuring as they please after nearly being expelled. Dramatic irony is used throughout the book too. In his first year at school, Harry attempts to meet an unknown visitor on top of a tower at midnight to give this person a dragon that is not allowed at school. Obviously, the reader knows how risky the situation is and would never think about doing anything like that. Rowling uses irony constantly in her story, both dramatic and situational.Rowling creates her story pleasing the reader with adventure and suspense. It starts out with Harry living with his aunt, uncle, and cousin. Then, all of a sudden he is receiving letters telling him to go to Hogwarts and learn magic. The adventure of Harry and his life, from one moment living in the Muggle world (ordinary life), to studying self-defense spells against the Dark Arts and other types of magic. The story also contains suspense in nearly every situation. Each time the reader opens the book, (s)he starts to read and starts to learn many things about Harry's life and wonders what will he do next. For these reasons, Rowling generates a wonderful book filled with suspense and adventure.Rowling has imagined a story that charms all. Rowling does this through her various uses of irony in its many different forms. Rowling also satisfies the reader through the adventure and suspense she uses in her story. All in all, J.K. Rowling's, Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone, is one of the best stories you will ever read in your life."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Throughout Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone by J. K. Rowling the setting plays an extremely important part in the novel. The images brought to life by the many colorful adjectives used throughout the book paint an immense picture in the reader's mind of what Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is really like. The proper twentieth century time period portrays a sense of stability and monotony that is shattered by the strange letters that Harry receives acknowledging him of his acceptance to Hogwarts. Also, Harry's malicious \\"muggle\\" family and their run-down house provide for a colossal change of scenery when Harry enters the beautiful campus of Hogwarts. This symbolizes the immeasurable change that Harry is about to experience when he meets people who actually love him and are not ashamed of him. The exotic surroundings and creatures of Hogwarts exemplify the bizarre lifestyles that all of the teacher's posses. The mysterious moat that surrounds the castle of a school that inside contains moving staircases, secret passages and endless adventure is shown exuberantly by Rowling's wonderful use of a descriptive setting. Every piece of the parallel world of Hogwarts is fully explored by Rowling. The bizarre types of candy that are eaten on the train to Hogwarts by Ron Weasley and Harry reveal the strange adventure that they are about to embark upon. From dragons to Bertie Botts Every Flavor Beans this novel is exquisitely written where the setting of the story augments and parallels the changes of the characters personalities throughout the novel."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"That is what this book is. Entertaining escapism. Nothing else. Believe me, there are no thought-provoking topics discussed in here, no world-wrenching ideas or philosophies. It is an entertaining fantasy of a young boy who has a bunch of mystical, happy-go-lucky adventures with his other young friends. There is nothing especially sophisticated about the language used here, no brilliant metaphors or equally brilliant puns which you might find in roger zelazny or terry pratchett.Because this series is what this series is,it should not have such a hype as what surrounds it. It is not something which deserves to be read five-thousand times. It also does not deserve the posters, video-games, action figures, and whatever other merchandise surrounds it.In a relatively concise conclusion, if you're looking for an entertaining read, thenby all means, purchase this book. If you're looking for some deep writing, please, move on."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was great fun to read, and is one of those rarities that can appeal to young and old. I have read the entire series to date and have enjoyed each one. I hope that Ms. Rowling will continue the series and give us more Harry Potter to enjoy long after he has left Hogwart's School.I recently saw a news item on TV regarding a town in New Mexico where some of the citizens were protesting and burning Harry Potter books because they felt promoted the devil. I feel so sorry that these people aren't able to separate fantasy from reality. And if they were able to understand that concept, can't they see that Harry Potter tales embody the classic story of the triumph of good over evil?This series of books is a must for anyone that wants to experience a simple, wonderful, fantasy world with unforgetable characters and imaginative stories."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerors StoneBy J.K RowlingWould you like to stick a wand up a trolls nose?This book is about an 11-year-old wizard boy.

That certainly stopped my boredom. I read it twice that day and since then I have bought the next two book and read them all at least ten times. The first chapter or two were quite confusing, and at first I thought it wouldn't be that good. But once Harry got to Hogwarts, the story improved immensly and I couldn't put it down. The books all have excellent plots, you never know what is going to happen next. There are secret meanings everywhere which adds to the charm. The books, especiallly the third one, are so fantastic that I wonder if Rowling can go even better. This is a great book and I'll read it to my children."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K Rowling has shown a sense of childness, humor, and creativity through this book.

All three are excellent, exciting, and funny. In SORCEROR'S STONE, it starts a bit slow, but it quickly picks up a leads to a terrific ending. Don't quit! And don't hesitate to let your child read these books! Unless there's something wrong with him, he won't put down the book and start practicing witchcraft. The magic in here is not evil at all, it is in the author's talent for giving a fantastic new story that will captivate anyone's imagination. You can really relate to the different characters, and I'm sure they will develop more and more as the seven-book series continues. Great literature for the young and young at heart, don't discourage reading Harry Potter. I'm eagerly waiting the fourth book, THE DOOMSPELL TOURNAMENT, which comes out in April 2000.

I criticized the books continously and wondered why people read such junk. After deciding to just read one of the books I was hooked. Each page allowed me to explore the world of this young teen dealing with so much pain and adversity. Each chapter encouraged you to read on and find out what will happen next. I enjoyed how the book was so greatly put together. I appericate J.K. Rowling for making a book so freshly written. Some of the ideas and setting were tied into real life. So it doesn't feel like you are reading a fairy tale. The issues focused on in the book are so world wide that any age can read the book and enjoy it.

I first decided to read this book to see what the fuss was all about. I'm glad I gave this book a chance because it turned out to be an excellent book. There's a reason why there's so much hype about Harry Potter and why this book sold as many copies as it has!After reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone I couldn't help but read the rest and I'm anxiously waiting for the 6th book to come out. I personally don't think the movies do the books justice (although they are good) but I would suggest reading the books before watching the movies. This series has everything a reader is looking for: mystery, adventure, humor, romance (although cleverly hidden so it doesn't distract the reader from the main part of the story). Give this book a chance and I'm positive you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Well, here's where the phenomenom all started.It's hard to compare Rowling with any other author ( CS Lewis...? ) suffice to say these books are highly enjoyable for child and adult alike( Really Amazon- age group 9-12- c'mon, are you deaf and blind???)I read my first Harry Potter book only in 2004- (I am aged 33 ), after seeing the first two movies, I can say I ignored the phenomenom for a few years, but the first movie was just so enjoyable and well done, that in a few short weeks I had thirstily read all the first 6 books.Comparing all the books, this is one of the best, and although much shorter than the last few, perfectly introduces the reader to the world of Harry Potter and Hogwarts.Don't worry if you have already seen the movie- the two are very similar, and you'll get all the extra little bits, like characters thoughts and a few scenes that weren't included in the movie as a bonus.A truly really great book, and for all ages.Do yourself a favour!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A magical world indeede J.K.

It also takes us through Harry's first year at his new school.

He goes to live with his Aunt and Uncle who know Harry is a wizard. Harry doesn't find out he's a wizard until his 11th birthday when Hagrid comes to take him away to Hogwarts, School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. That's when all the magic begins for Harry.

I always told myself that I was to old to read those kinds of books. Man was I ever wrong. I absolutely loved this book. It took be back to the good old days of when I used to read just because I wanted to and not because I had to finish the book for and English test.This book had a very enjoyable plot. There really weren't any slow parts to the book because at every turn of a page it seemed like Harry was just about to get expelled from school. Then somehow he would get out of the jam and go on being a normal student. It just kept me wanting to read more and more of the book.J.K. Rowling had wonderful characters for this book. None of them were \\"perfect.\\" They all had some sort of flaw. Harry wasn't the brightest or the strongest person in the world but he managed to stand up to the worst Wizard in the land. This book really shows people that hero's come in all different shapes and sizes and that you can always use help in your life.Sometimes books will drag on forever and you'll always be wondering when is it going to end. Well, not with this one. This book is a very easy read. It doesn't seem like your reading a 310-page book. I literally read this book in two days. (Which for a high school student is pretty fast.) I just never wanted to put it down. I remember towards the end, I was reading the last chapter and I looked at the clock and I had to go to practice.

Not to mention the creative words (Nimbus,Golden Snitch ,Quaffle,Bludger,Hogwarts,Diagon).

She stayed up late (and went to work late too) for a few days until she finished. She then gave me the sequel as a gift (although I couldn't get it out of her hands until she was done) and we just ordered the Prince of Azbakan from Amazon UK to get it now.I highly recommend all of these books, but suggest you read them first before telling your significant others about them."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I picked up this book because of the title. Magic is the food that sustains the young at heart. After coming across the article about J. K. Rowling in a recent issue of &quot;People&quot; magazine, I doubly wanted to read the book.

It was really interesting if you are into wizards and stuff like that. I enjoyed reading it but I'm not into wizards and flying brooms. But it kept leading on to read more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"While I like the Harry potter books, I can't help feeling that the success they're enjoying is a bit disproportionate to the actual quality of the work. Yes, it's cute and interesting, but I've seen it all done before, and I've seen it done better.The basic plot of the book is simple: Harry Potter's parents are killed by an evil wizard by the name of Voldemort, so he is given into the care of some muggle (normal humans without any magical powers) relations to be raised. the Dursleys are the most hateable family since Roald Dahl's Matilda-they're fat, superficial, ugly, and they treat Harry like dirt. Of course, all that changes when Harry gets a mysterious letter from Hogwart's school of wizardry, and is whisked away from his obnoxious foster family to be a great wizard.The idea of a world of wizards that exists right next to our own, filled with wonders of all description is not new, although Rowling does manage to pull it off with a fair amount of originality. Harry as a character is sympathetic and likeable without being prudish, and the Dursleys are delightfully evil. But the incessant silliness can quickly get to be too much (do we really need to know about every kind of bizarre wizard's candy? Less is more.), and the book's lack of real originality can make it seem threadbare and tired. Susan Cooper, C.S. Lewis, Edith Nesbit and Diana Wynne-Jones (just to name a few) did children in alternate fantasy worlds better, and Roald Dahl does children's humor with considerably more wickedness and wit. The Potter books are great to read when you have a few hours to kill, but I think a few years from now, when the fad is over, they'll probably be forgotten."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My mother read me the first two books in this series when I was about 8 years old. After that we agreed that we didn't really want to read the rest of the series. I just wasn't grabbed by the story at all.Now I am nearly fifteen years old. Throughout my life, most of my friends LOVED Harry Potter, and I could never understand why. No one will believe you if you say you didn't like Harry Potter. A few days ago, I decided to give the first book another try. (This was partially due to an experimenting mood since I had just made a deal with my friend to try a soda if she would try Indian food.)Well, I finished it the next day, and it certainly wasn't BAD. It seemed sort of like a standard fantasy to me. What I don't understand is what made this book so special. There are thousands of good children's fantasy books out there... why this one? Maybe because it is set in our own world, with characters kids can identify with. I really don't know. It just wasn't that special to me. I enjoyed it, but I didn't love it. I just can't fathom what everyone sees in Harry Potter. And no offense to JK Rowling. I think it's a good first book. But it doesn't live up to the hype. I'm sorry... it just doesn't."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This was one of the best books I ever read. I was so into itthat I finished it in less than a day. I always have found thatHarry's friends are as exciting as he is ..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I just want to mention that I counted 192 pages before the story actually got to the business of solving what you-know-who was up to. In other words it was a 192 page long intro to Hogwarts followed by a short story.If you look at the other Potter books written, this book is simply the intro book, kindof like a pre-algebra course. As a stand-alone book, it kinda sucks. Don't get me wrong, it has remarkable immersion qualities. This book has the magic stuff that all writers aspire to achieve. The book is uniquely inspired at a level not seen since Walt Disney did Fantasia!But the plot is hazy, the conflict is short and the primary characters are stereotypical. This may be an enjoyable context for kids, but unenjoyable for adults looking for more personal involvement in the story. For instance, the wizest most powerful wizard at Hogwarts is an old grey wizard with a long white silvery beard. As you may guess: he's good, he's wise, he's powerful, he's rarely seen, and he's unexplicbly omnipotent. Talk about your stereotypical wizard! There's nary a Tolkien (Gandalf), Camelot (Merlin), Dragonlance (Fistandauntilis), Forgotten Realms (Elminster) or other popular fantasy setting in existance that hasn't done the old grey wizard thing to death! Stop with the old grey wizard thing already!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter. We've all heard it, all been trapped in the craze. Or have we? I must say that I was terribly dissapointed in this book. I may just sound like another person that LOVES to oppose EVERYTHING. But I truly don't think this novel deserves the hype that surrounds it. Don't get me wrong - it is a wonderful childrens' book and introduction to fantasy. Certainly NOT the best, but decent.Why the two stars then? I found that this book lacks the general complexity and 'real' feeling that I love a good fantasy to portray. I'm no forty-year old mother that reads &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; in her spare time. I'm twelve, and this book really, really, stinks. Give me a break - I fail to find the complexity and exitement in something as bland and over-used as the concept of 'magic school'. Take any random fantasy off the shelf, and there's a 6/10 chance you'll pull out a book about an orphan, mistreated boy/girl that's transported to a time and place where magic abounds, and their new 'talent' is amazingly powerful!Step two - the characters. Horribly two dimensional! Harry and Ron don't really seem to have much character or personality. There's a few Rowling twists and turns to add to the-almost-nothing originality of the story, but other than that...I can't see what's so amazing about this book! The vocabulary is stale (sure, it's made for kids, but they understand a bit more than you think!). The imagery is null.Harry Potter = A ZERO in my book. GOOD BOOKS = Ender's Game, Chronicals of Narnia, Hero and the Crown, Last Book in the Univers (original, if not perfectly written), The High King...ect, ect..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The backstory being a rather blatant ripoff of David Eddings Belgariad series, the unoriginal if mildly entertaining Harry Potter books serve their purpose: they give the kiddies something to enjoy reading. That alone is valuable, since studies report a decline in childrens recreational reading in America. The plots and characters are formulaic, but set in motion to accomplish some interesting things, and the moral dilemmas faced by the children are framed fairly well. I'm not surprised that children enjoy these books and hopefully it will inspire them to take off Rowlings' training wheels and get to something a bit more challenging.What does scare me a bit, though, are the great numbers of physiologically adult people who are taken by these books. For kids, these books are fine. For adults, they're incredibly insubstantial and simplistic and the interest that they have generated among a good number of adults is evidence of a dearth of literary comprehension and abilility among adults of tragic proportions.And there's the irony: perhaps if kids get inspired to read by the Harry Potter books, maybe they stand half a chance of not ending up as an adult who reads Harry Potter books!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I had heard about these books, but have just now read the first one.

After the first chapter, I understood. It was because the &quot;newness&quot; and genuine ideas created by J.K. Rowling. Although I was impressed, I don't think it's a &quot;must-read&quot; book, let alone being the very best seller. Perhaps I'm too old for Harry. The second and third in this series were boring for me as they dwelled on the same theme. The creations (words, scenes, and plots) were no longer catchy. I have to say Ms. Rowling has to prove herself after Harry Potter series end. Anyway, I can't say her books are not great, but my heart is still occupied by the prolific and creative Roald Dahl."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is one of the best books I have read J.K Rowling makes the characters come to life some people say because it has witches and wizards they don't let their kids read it.

Harry Potter is a story worth reading. Before I started to read this book, I was very unsure and skeptical about the Harry Potter phenomenon. It seemed like a book that only a young child could like and that it was below my reading level. Once I started reading it, however, I discovered how wrong I had been. This book is not just for a young child who has a large imagination. This book can and should be read by people of all ages because everyone would enjoy this book regardless of age. The plot of this book follows a normal hero's journey, which is not so complicated that a child couldn't understand and enjoy it. It also isn't so simple that an adult would think the book was too childish. It finds a happy median so that everyone can enjoy it. Rowling does an excellent job of characterization and by the end of the book, you feel like you really know the characters and how they will react to certain problems that arise. Hagrid (one of Harry's friends that he meets) comes across as an intimidating man that is very strong and dangerous. Rowling, through her excellent use of description and words, makes Hagrid act and sound like a very timid, passive person who wouldn't hurt anyone. This book stirs the creative mind in all of us. It allows the reader to live through the eyes of an eleven-year-old wizard who has an important destiny to fill. I feel that this book is worth reading, and I also look forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Hype is true.

I loved the fact that they had owls carrying messages and stuff! J.K. Rowling is a genius! Her books will be classics. A hundred years from now, these books just may be with Hawthorne, Thoreau, and Louisa May Alcott. And I like the fact that this woman has a broad imagination and isn't narrowminded like some of the new up-and-coming writers out there (i.e. pop singers trying to be talented). J.K. Rowling has &quot;IT&quot; and she has the juice! The spark! She is a wonderful writer and her stories are adorable. 1st billionaire off writing, which goes to show that writers deserve more credit than they're given, huh?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I recently read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for the first time. I read it for a class. I really enjoyed the book. I think the book is directed toward older kids, older than 8-13 like the book recommends. The book was written so young kids could read it and understand it but I don't think young kids will realize that the book is fantasy and the magic doesn't exist. Older kids and adults can read Harry Potter and know that it's all fake and still enjoy the book. And even though the book is written for ages 8-13, I thought it was a good book and a positive change from some of the books that I have read that are complicated and too hard to understand. The plot of Harry Potter was awesome. It was like a roller coaster ride. The author, J.K. Rowling did an excellent job with keeping the story moving and interesting. She included a lot of action and suspense and you think you are getting closer and closer to the climax but really you are stilling in rising action. Because Harry Potter is written for young kids, Rowling characterization was mostly through description. Rowling would devote an entire paragraph to introducing and explaining a single character. Harry Potter didn't have much for a theme. I couldn't find an overlaying theme of the book. But overall I loved the book. I definitely recommend it if you are looking for a book to keep you reading. It was funny, suspenseful, sad, and exciting all at the same time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was very sceptical as I listened to all the hype about this series. Not being one for 'fads,' I paid little attention to this one. However, I took my little sister to see the movie, and I was very impressed, and was inspired to give the book a try. I did, and to my amazement I couldn't put it down! I started reading the first book Tuesday night... it's Monday, and I finished the third book this afternoon! I absolutally love them. I recomend everyone, whether interested in fantasty (which I am not) books, or not, pick up a copy and give it a try, I guarantee anyone with an imagination will appreciate this series! Bravo Rowling!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read the Canadian version of this book (with the title of The Philosopher's Stone), but other than a few Americanizations, it is the same book.I am giving this book 5 stars as a children's fantasy book. I would probably be a little rougher on it if it's original intent had been an adult fantasy, but this book is a wonderful introduction to the fantasy genre. It's not so deep and involved that it will turn off the young reader who doesn't usually pick up a book, but it is involved enough that it prepares the young reader for the journey into bigger and better things. If a child has already started reading things like Lord of the Rings (I read it in 3rd grade), then he/she may be a bit bored by the Harry Potter books, but the first one at least is short enough that it probably won't happen that way.Once you've read the first book, and invested some time in the characters, you'll probably be more interested in moving on to the bigger Potter books that are coming up. I know that's the feeling I have. I'm very interested in reading the rest of the series. If young readers have the same feelings (and I know a lot of them do), then the first book has done its job.Another thing this book avoids, which is really refreshing, is talking down to the reader. I think that may be why so many adults have also fallen in love with this series. There are some things in it which don't seem very usual for children's books in the States (such as Hagrid being snookered because he had had a little too much to drink), but there's nothing that's inherently harmful in my eyes. Yet it also allows the adults to enjoy the book without feeling like they're reading a &quot;kid's book.&quot; I found this book walked a very fine line between being &quot;too much a kid's book&quot; and &quot;too grown-up to be a kid's book,&quot; and it did it exceptionally well.I'm not going to summarize it, because I'm sure it's been done much better eleswhere. What I will say is that, if you want to get your kids reading, this is a great book to start. And don't feel too shy about picking up the book and reading it yourself after your kids have gone to bed."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is filed with action and adventure I really liked it you should to it was awesome just read it"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I would recommend this book to everybody.

If you want great fantasy for children, try the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis(which are just as good and subtle for adults), the works of Edith Nesbit, or the works of Edgar Eager (beginning with Half Magic). I have to admit that, of the three I've read, this one was the best. It was very funny with regard to the descriptions of the Muggle family, the Dirsleys. But there is always a touch of rebellion and plain revenge to the story. The later books are more mysterious, but I say it's unfair in a mystery to not give enough subtle clues to make it possible for me to figure it out before I am told the answer by the author. The third book, The Prisoner of Azbakan, was especially frustrating in this regard. I found the second and third books hard to wade through. I don't care about Quiditch and I just didn't care about what happened to Harry and his friends. In the end some new info would FINALLY tell the answers to the mysteries in the book. Rowling is no great author and I consider these books a waste of time--except for the Dirsley parts of the first one.

You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A story doesn't have to be 100% original to be entertaining, but it's not necessary to steal and rob as much as J.K. Rowling does. I really have trouble connecting to the characters as well. Harry's foster parents, the Dursleys, are way over the top and I think the story would have worked better if they had at least been somewhat likable. Harry himself is an irritating specimen, hating people with a hatey hate from the get-go. That's not a good example to set.But what peeves me most is that Rowling hurls the old rule of \\"Show, Don't Tell\\" out the window. She constantly tells what people are feeling and throws in stacks of adjectives, instead of trying to let the reader deduce the characters' feeling from their actions. It makes for a boring read. The only thing she does well is using in-story cliffhangers, which might be the main reason why children like this.All in all, this work is quite average and if it hadn't been adapted into some comparatively good movies, it would have been long forgotten."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a fantastic story for literally any age! Be sure to read this before the rest of the series, as the author truly uses detail to enhance the magic of the tale. Magic, valiant heroes and evil villains, staunch friendships, and wonderful mischief scamper through the halls of Hogwarts - Harry's wizarding school - as a Rowling shows you life through the eyes of a courageous young boy. At the age of 11, Harry Potter must now step up to his place of honor and danger in a world he never knew existed. While he learns to be a wizard, he also learns many other lessons that are much more important than simply how to cast a spell. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys a thought out story as well as a good time. Yes, it is a book targeted for children, but as an adult I can even say that I sat, after reading it, just thinking. My mind couldn't seem to pull itself out of the captivating world of Rowling's, and I had that warm feeling that you get when the good guys win over the bad ones, and you know the world is safe until the next adventure. I can't help it. I like Star Wars and other wide epics that tell a good myth. Although I didn't start reading fantasy until after I went to college, I have become a huge fan over the years. Rowling creates a tight, quick paced story that keeps you reading 'till the end, much like Tolkien and Lewis (2 great authors)! She has really added a worthwhile series to a sometimes forgotten genera. I find myself caught up in the characters and story. My only dislike for the Harry Potter series is that it is slated to last only 7 books!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think that this is one of the best books I have ever read! I couldn't believe that parents would say that these books are not educational books and don't want their child to read them! Wouldn't parents want their kids to use their imagination? But from all that, I think that this is a really good book. A great job you're doing, Ms. Rowling, and keep up the good work!Harry Potter has never played a sport while flying on a broomstick. He's never worn a cloak of invisibility, befriended a giant, or helped hatch a dragon. All Harry knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley. Harry's room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn't had a birthday party in eleven years.But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to a wonderful place he never dreamed existed. There he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic around every corner, but a great destiny that's been waiting for him... if Harry could survive the encounter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"All right. Here I am, a Tolkien fan, a Lewis fan, a Mennonite, and I like Harry Potter. I will not say it was the best I've ever read, but I flew through that book like the wind, and now I'm rereading it. I haven't read a new children's fantasy--or any fantasy--this good in ages. The characterization was great, there were good lines, the action was engaging, and the plot twists effectively caught me off guard. Reminds me strongly of Roald Dahl. Read it!To those who accuse Rowling of encouraging witchcraft, I say LIGHTEN UP! Good grief, if we're gonna throw out &quot;Harry Potter,&quot; why not &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; or &quot;The Hobbit?&quot; Even being a conservative Mennonite and attending a well-respected Bible college, I found little wrong with this book's &quot;wizardry.&quot; Mixing powders and saying a few nonsense words don't quite equal any kind of dark satanic rituals I know of. Its not like they killed any chickens! :-)Go ahead and read it. If you don't like it, that's your problem. But I liked &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,&quot; and am looking forward to buying the rest of the books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter books are full of mystery and humer. In are class we have literature circles(a bunch of kids reading books togeather) we just got to start Harry Potter! All the kids love it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved this book, but when I read of the Sorcerer's Stone I had a nagging feeling about it at the back of my mind, until it struck me that all the descriptions of it matched what I had always known as a Philosopher's Stone. I first learned of the Philosopher's Stone when I was 10 years old and read a book called &quot;Gone-Away Lake&quot; by Elizabeth Enright, and then of course read more of it when studying European history.As the Encyclopedia Brittanica puts it: &quot;in alchemy, substance thought to be capable of changing base metals into gold. The same term, more fully elixir vitae, &quot;elixir of life,&quot; was given to the substance that would indefinitely prolong life--a liquid that was believed to be allied with the philosopher's stone.&quot;I was quite confused, but then I discovered that it England the book *was* originally called &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&quot;. This title makes so much more sense. What the heck is a sorcerer's stone? Nothing. Why the change? Does Scholastic Books just think American's are dumb, ignorant fools? I can't think of any other reason for the change.I do know that from now on I will buy my copies of the books from the British publisher, rather than the &quot;dumbed down&quot; American versions put out by Scholastic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This was a re-read for me. Caught up in the excitement of all the rave reviews, I read this one when it first came out. I devoured it then, and I was anxious to read more of the series. However, I decided that this was exactly the type of series that I wanted to experience with my children (I didn't even have any at the time!) and turned a blind eye to all the future releases in the series as well as the movies. I did not want to spoil the joy of sharing something so wonderful with my kids.I read this aloud to my children, and they loved it as much as I did! Rowling writes in such a way that the book can be enjoyed by young and old alike. It transcends generations.For anyone who has been living on another planet and not yet heard about this phenomenal book, it is about a 10 year-old boy named Harry Potter. He was orphaned as a babe and left to be raised by his maternal Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, who do not care for him one bit. While they lavish attention on their dear Dudley, they treat Harry as though he isn't worthy of any love. He is treated like a servant, made to do the cooking and cleaning, and given crumbs to eat. His \\"room\\" is the cupboard under the stairs, even though spoiled Dudley has two bedrooms for himself: One for his bed and the other for his toys.A mysterious envelope arrives addressed to Harry. Before he has a chance to open it, Uncle Vernon snatches it away when he sees the seal on the envelope is from a place named Hogwarts. More envelopes arrive, and Uncle Vernon boards up the mail slot and burns the mail. Finally, he takes the family away to a secluded island away from anyone for miles around. It occurs on the day of Harry's 11th birthday, which of course is not celebrated by the Dursley family. A giant of a man breaks down the door and introduces himself as Rubeus Hagrid, who presents Harry with one of the elusive envelopes. It turns out that Harry has been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, which is located in a parallel magical world. Hagrid further informs Harry that his parents were also witches who were killed by a bad warlock named Voldemort. This is all a shock to Harry, as he had been told that his parents died in a car crash. For some reason, Voldemort was unable to bring harm to Harry save for the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. After Voldemort's inability to destroy Harry, he disappeared. Some say he died, and others say that he is still around just biding his time. Harry became famous among the witches because he is the only one who was able to survive a tangle with the evil Voldemort.Harry goes with Hargrid to Hogwarts, where he enters his first year of training to become a wizard. He makes friends with two other first-year students: Ronald Weasley, a red-haired boy who comes from a lower-class family of witches and is frowned upon by some of the richer class because of his hand-me-down robes and books, and Hermione Granger, a bushy brown-haired girl who also has trouble fitting in because she comes from a non-magical \\"Muggle\\" family (Muggles are known as non-magical folks.) At first, Hermione comes across as a know-it-all because she is extremely smart and studious. Later, after she takes the blame for an incident which saves Ron and Harry from getting into trouble, the three become inseparable.Hogwarts itself is fantastically magical with its talking portraits, staircases that change at will, secret passageways, and a forbidden forest. The place is filled with mystery, and Harry and his friends are just beginning their journey of discovery.This is the type of book that I would have loved as a child. It is a classic tale of good versus evil. I love that Rowling incorporates some life lessons about social classes. When Ron is taunted by the richer wizard families (Draco Malfoy and his two sidekicks, Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe) for his family's meagre wealth, Harry stands up for him. Harry is envious of what Ron has, which is a loving family. That means more to him than all the wealth in the world, and he would give anything for it.My kids and I are so excited to continue with the next book in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I liked that it was about wizards and that there was a school that taught wizards how to be wizards. I like the book so much that I couldn't stop reading it because I had never read a book so good in my life. I liked the characters, they were pretty fun and you could get to know them easily. I especially liked Professor McGonagall and Snape because I like that Snape's sort evil, which makes him funny. I like Professor McGonagall because she's very good at teaching. I also like Fluffy because he's Cerberus, but he has a cuter name. I also like Harry, Ron and Hermione because one, Ron is really, really, really funny; 2, because Hermione is very smart, but not a goody-goody entirely. I like Harry because he can be funny sometimes, but sometimes he's really irritating."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A great, fun read even multiple time around. I haven't read these in years since reading them to my daughter. I'm looking forward to reading them all again."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"At first I wasn't so sure about reading this book. Mostly beause I prejudged this as a young adult book only. This was around 2001. The books at this time were given to my youngest sister (I was 22 at the time making her 16). She read them and then handed them to me hoping I'd read them - little sis knowing I love to read. I forgot about them until the first movie came out. I don't recall if I read the book first or saw the movie. But either way, I learned I was wrong to prejudge this series. Since then I've been hooked to everything Potter.When the book 'Order of the Phoenix' was released in 2003, I was in the Navy. I was lucky enough to get 'Order of the Phoenix' and later 'Half-Blood Prince' in the Bloomsbury publishing editions. So as of now I currently own all 7 Scholastic hardcovers, 7 Scholastic paperbacks and 2 Bloomsbury hardcovers. As well as 'The Tales of Beedle the Bard' hardcover. And 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' 10th Anniversary Edition [Deluxe Edition] [Hardcover]. I also own all 8 of the movies (all special editions of course).I am currently 36 years old and I'm still a fan. A fan of all Harry Potter. And a fan of J.K.Rowling - purchased ebook of 'Casual Vacancy' the day it was released.Harry Potter is a very charming orphaned boy who finds out he can do magic.

Harry thinks he is stuck in this terrible home forever until strange things start happening around his 11th birthday. A magical secret that's been kept from him his entire life changes his future, and what little he knows about his past. But I guess you'll have to read more to figure it out.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first book in an amazing series. J.K. Rowling really captures the readers' attention with the many adventures of Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione. She uses amazing imagery in this book, and that's what originally got me really involved; I couldn't put the book down until I finished. Overall I give this book a five-star rating because it's one of the best books I've ever read. This book has suspense, drama, action, a little bit of love, and magic! What more could you want? Plus after you read this book there's the rest of the series to read, and all of those books are equally as well written and interesting. Bottom line is: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the book for anyone of any age who likes to read fantastic books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If your like me, you are a book hound,but most of the books just don't fit your taste. You have read other books about fanticy, but just not good enough. Now Potter comes out, and your just not sure. Should you buy it, or leave it till later, when you have more time? After all it is the same subject as those other books. And then you finally get the time, you ceck it out (just in case), oppen it up, AND YOU LLOOVVEE IT!Harry Potter opened my life up, giving me hope and oppertunity I never had. I lived a lot like Harry, no friends, no hope. I know some giant isn't going to burst through my door and tell me I'm a wizzard and wisk me away to a new world, but his hope, ambition, and making of friends helped me out, and it wii do the same to you. You might be some stockbroker on the floor,(500 shares of Amazon ,now!) a man on the farm, neading time to spend, just no reason to, or some kid, like me, needing hope and insperation.

The books are very thrilling and I think you'll love them. I have all 3 books at my house, and I have read (and reread) them all. Some other great fantasy books I recommend for you are: The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S.

Never did I realize that I would love them so much. They are just so adorable. I am 16 years old and I cannot wait till the forth one comes out. There is always a great mystery in these books, one that you would never come up with the answer to before you get there. Everyone from the smallest child to oldest stubbornest parents or grandparents can read these books and enjoy them so much. If you want to read something fun either for yourself or for your children chose Harry Potter!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is the most excititing, compelling, overall wonderful book series I've ever read! The first book of the series, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone tells about Harry's first year at Hogwarts and his search to find the legendary Sorcerer's Stone. Along the way he discovers how precious friendship really is, becomes the youngest player of the Quidditch (a sport played on broomsticks) team for over a century, and runs into one unexpected suprise after another. This book is a great start to an excellent series! I STRONGLY recommend it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am 40 years of age, lives in Hong Kong and have two children age 8 and 7. I am an avid reader myself indulging in fantasy, science fiction, action, detective and any sort of novels I can get my hands on. I read Rowling's books to my children as an ongoing thing from Enid Blyton. And I have been very pleased with the reception I received. My son could not wait the next night for me to read the next chaper. So he decided to read the book himself...and finished it and the next 2 books. It is absolutely fabulous escapism and I must recommend Ms Rowling on her turn of phrases that appeal to such a wide audience that I enjoy the books myself and finished the books before my bedtime reading to the children. We are now eagerly awaiting her next installment. And with bated breath hope that Harry will show the brilliance that Dumbledore expects of him in his fourth year at Hogwarts."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is ideal for kids from ages 6 and up. I personally enjoyed the book immensely and reccomend any adult to read it, no matter your age. It draws in the reader and provides an exce,ent alternative to TV."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I had heard about the Harry Potter books (who hasn't, by now?) on the news, in bookstores...but I really didn't pay much attention at first. Another fantasy series. @whee. You know how it is. Besides, I was a Jordan fanatic, and the latest book was occupying my time. Then just yesterday, I came upon a paperback copy of _Sorcerer's Stone_. Much cheaper than the hardback, so why not? Do you know that once I opened this book when i got home, I didn't put it down until the last page? I'm twenty-six, but I have never outgrown my love for a good fantasy novel. However, I've become disappointed with a fair amount of what's come out in the past few years, and I've found myself going back to the old standbys--The Lord of the Rings series, Chronicles of Narnia--they have a power to enchant that many writers of fantasy have lost. Fantasy writing is nothing if you can't enchant the reader. But with Harry Potter, I've found that enchantment that I've been missing. It's just such a remarkable little book. I absolutely love it. The writing is spectacular, the plot is nice and tight, and the characterization is beautiful. I've not read a children's story this good in quite a while. Rand al'Thor's fight with Lews Therin and the Dark One can wait. There's a whole slew of adventures in House Gryffindor waiting for me. :)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I first learned that the recommended reading age for Rowlings' wonderful Harry Potter was 9-12 years, I wished more 20, 30, and 45 year-olds would experience this joy. In the footsteps of The Pagemaster and other great works of children's literature, this book excels as a mystical adventure to be shared among kids of all ages. This book will reawaken the longing for everyday magic in any Muggle body."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In this fast reading, 300-pg. novel, you follow the life of a young boy, Harry, with all the best qualities. He lives in a closet, and is ignored. His horrible life changes when letters literally &quot;flood&quot; into his life. He was excepted into Hogwart's school of wizardry. It is then that the magical world, which lies behind ours, is explained. Harry also learns that an evil wizard, Voldemort, killed his parents. He did make a best friend, though. Soon he would make another. These three would stick together in good and bad. However, while sneaking about, they find out about a hidden source of supreme power: Nicholas Flammel's sorcerer's stone. Eventually, Harry finds out Voldemort is trying to regain life with it. Through wits, bravery, and smarts, the three friends save the stone and keep Voldemort from turning the world evil. The author developed the school and characters to perfection. Suspense fills each and every chapter. Finally, you don't have to wait until pg. 100 to find the hook, it is tright there at pg. 1. I must say, for a kid who hates ALL books, I think I found a success! I would recommend this book without a pause. This is probably the best book I have ever read. Don't read it because it is recommended, read it because you want to read the best book you have ever read! Usually, I have to put a pleasure reading book down by Ch. 2, but this book kept me hooked all the way along. I have never seen a plot developed so perfectly, and characters I could relate so much too. If you don't read this because you want a good book, at least read it so you can know what you would have missed!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Okay, there's a lot of hype about these books. And the reason is that JK Rowling is an incredible story-teller! It's just too bad she didn't decide to write adult fiction instead of children's. Yes, it's wonderful that something could inspire kids to want to read, but don't we have a responsibility as parents to make sure our kids aren't exposed to so much violence? I loved all three books. Couldn't get enough. But they even scared me a bit, and I'm well past childhood! In the first book, the worst scene is of a slit unicorn's throat, from which a monster drinks it's blood. The violence gets progressively worse in each book, where in the last one, a monster repeats &quot;Kill, Kill, Blood, blood...&quot; over &amp; over. We also get to visualize Harry's mother's pain &amp; suffering as she pleads for her son's life before she's murdered. I understand that kids today are mature &amp; &quot;can handle&quot; such fantasy violence. But why do we want them to? These books would have been incredible books without the scary violence. For children in their teens, and even adults, I would highly recommend all 3 books. But I think it's irresponsible to encourage reading such violence for younger children."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I do not recommend any child under the age of fifteen (15) reading this book without parental guidance, and then, only if that child is deeply spiritually rooted. J.K. Rowling makes magic and witchcraft quite attractive,romantic, fun and acceptable. There is a discriminatory attitude between those of the community of magicians, and those who are magically-challenged (to be politically correct!). Those who are not able to twirl a wand with wondrous results, are looked down upon. Any child with guidance, can be made to understand that Harry Potter et al, is no more true, nor harmful, than the fantasy enjoyed by those of my generation, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;! And, that the fantasy series that is &quot;Harry Potter, and the...&quot; is nearly &quot;oz&quot; caliber!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm probably the last person on earth to read the Harry Potter books or watch the movies (or maybe it just seems liked it).

To tell the truth, I'm three books in to the set and struggling.What a disappointment from what I was expecting do to all the raves. I'm thinking I probably shouldn't have waited so long to start these, and also wondering how such poorly written work can be proclaimed as great literature? Give me Roald Dahl or C. S.

Along the way, he makes his first real friends, sardonic slacker from a poor family Ron Weasley and studious bookworm Hermione Granger from the Muggle world, and makes enemies with potions teacher Severus Snape and Slytherin creep Draco Malfoy. Oh and it's up to Harry and his friends to save the Philosopher's Stone from the ghostly remnants of Voldemort.Rowling's first tale of Harry Potter and his merry band of miscreants is loaded with humor, action, and suspense. A great introduction followed by the crappy COS which was followed by the superior POA and so on and so forth."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Imagine discovering that someone loved you so much they gave up their own life to save you. Now imagine that in so doing, they also broke the power of the most evil entity ever known and left that being a shattered remnant of his former self. This is of course, the basis for this, the first Harry Potter novel, but it is also a very direct reference to the Christian faith and its foundational beliefs in Jesus Christ.The parallels continue with stunning force that it's amazing public schools actually encourage children to read this and other books by J.K. Rowling, especially given the absence of other blatantly religious literature by men like John Bunyan and Daniel DaFoe. As Harry becomes aware of his mother's sacrifice and what it meant, he also becomes aware of a much deeper reality that he has existed in all his life even though he has never known of it until now.Following this \\"conversion\\" experience, Harry is whisked off to Hogwart's, where he learns more about the deeper reality he now is aware of, particularly the power of love to drive out evil and to redeem. This is religious allegory on a level not seen since the days of C.S. Lewis and his \\"Chronicles of Narnia.\\"Still, if you can put aside the overt religious themes of the book, you're in for a very pleasant experience. Although \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" is by no means the strongest of the four Harry Potter books published so far -- it spends a long time on setup, and develops neither plot nor characters as well as Rowling's later novels -- it's no slouch either.While at Hogwart's Harry encounters pretty much every variety of menace and friend known to early adolescence: there's the teacher who doesn't like you, the know-it-all girl, the bully, the best friend, the class clown, and of course the stern and loving teachers like Minerva McGonagall and Albus Dumbledore.Although the menace Harry ultimately must face is worse than any bogeyman I can recall from my middle school days, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is a magical fantasyland romp through the world of a teenager, told through the eyes of a teenager. Read it with your teen or preteen, and you'll have plenty of chances to talk with them about their own problems and the people they have to contend with at school each day.And if you want to talk with them about matters of eternal nature, this book presents the chance to do that as well."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I had mixed fellings while reading &quot;Harry Potter&quot;.On one hand I felt that this is decent fantasy book with exciting action and shallow meaning.

First off, the Reader says that the book uses the word &quot;Kill&quot; in a very real sense.

Dahl has a way to grip you emotionally (I'll never forget the first time I read the passage when Charlie unwraps the golden ticket), but Rowling keeps you on edge through the entire books. Can't wait till the others come out. Why stop at seven? Harry will no doubt be headmaster of Hogwarts some day. Keep them coming."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read the first Harry Potter recently. I thought it was one of the best books I have ever read.

I felt as though I were there with the characters in the scene. All my friends have read it, my teachers have read it, my 7 year old brother and his friends have read it-even my parents are reading it, and we all love it! If you are looking for an exciting read this book is for you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Having heard people rave about Harry Potter, I bought 2 copies to give as gifts. One I sent to my 10 year old grandson who was thrilled at getting all three for his birthday. Before sending off the second, I decided to read it. To my surprise, I had trouble putting it down! Harry Potter is a wonderful little boy who, in spite of his relatives is a bright warm boy who has a spirit of adventure and a good heart. I believe the author, a delightful young woman has been able to reach all ages with her books. I finished the first book and had to read the second. The characters jump off the pages and her descriptions of the school and the activities are pure joy to read. A book that is entertaining to all members of the family will only encourage family reading hour. Thank you Ms. Rowling for giving us Harry Potter!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have been reading fantasy since I was a child and this book(and the series so far)is one of the best I have ever read. The story and Harry captured me in the beginning and I could not put the book down. Harry is the underdog and he truimphs over adversity in each book. How he does it is what makes this book so good. I felt like I was part of the story, that I was there watching everything happen. This book and possibly the series are destined to become classics. It is a book for all ages. Read it, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Thinking it would be a children's book, I thought it would be fun to give a light reading, little did I know it would awaken the magic inside of me. I felt more alive after I read this. I found new found passion that I lacked to feel in today's world. IT got my imagination going and I could not wait to read the next book. This is a great series as well as a great book.I would recommend everyone reading this, especially those that are sort of bored in their daily grind. (I am over 25 years of age and still loved it) THis book is NOT JUST for kids."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I actually first read this book months before anyone even knew what it was. I had seen my sister reading it at the kitchen table, when I asked, \\"What's that about?\\" She said simply it's about a kid becoming a wizard. Then, a couple weeks later, she picked up the newly released second edition, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. That's when I picked up the first one and started reading, and I didn't stop. It was like reading candy. It was the most magnificent thing I had ever read.I loved these books. I read them the summer preceding my seventh grade year, and I'm now a freshman in high school, and I still love to pick up and read one of the Quidditch matches for a bit of nighttime reading. J.K. Rowling's imagination is even bigger than mine. You can obviously tell she loves writing these things, because she makes them so fun. These books are great, for little kids, for teenagers, and for adults too. Oh yes, and I'm not some loser kid with no life who likes little kiddy books because I have no friends. I am just as normal and have just as many friends as any average teenager. And I'm telling you, this is fine fiction."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"...Ok, on to the book. The story starts out as a boy who is orphaned and has a horrible aunt and uncle. Their son Dudley is even worse. He even sleeps in a closet under the stairs. Then one day he gets a misterious letter in the mail. The dursleys wont let him have it. Finally a giant named hagrid turns up to personally deliver the message, and he learns his misterious past, and he is going to a school of witchcraft and wizardry. It is not horrible witchcraft, it is spells that can help. They can make objects hover, they can summon objects. There are so many kinds of spells used that aren't horrible. Only the Evil person Voldemort uses them. And whats good saying he is evil if he cant even be evil?I think this author has some very creative ideas, and I think the story is enjoyable and absolutley fantastic. I suggest you read this great book, you dont want to miss out!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter lives with his Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon and thier son,Dudly.Harry is treated very badly, a lot from Dudly, like getting beat up and getting wacked with Dudly's stick.

Thats when Harry meets Hagrid and finds out he's a wizard and he's been accepted into Hogwarts School of Wichcraft and Wizardry! In my opinian, this book is exelent."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"All will love the mystery and majesty of harry potter!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm a 25-year old who just a month ago would have scoffed at the idea of so much as opening a Potter book. Too frequently, what is incredibly hyped and popular turns out to be rubbish churned out for the unthinking masses. As a rule, I try to read complex fiction and often get saddled with heavy academic material (which despite being rewarding can be tedious as well). So in what you could call a pretty pompous manner, I dismissed HP out of hand. A couple of friends my age had recommended these books to me, and were met with my cynicism. Yes, I had a firmly set prejudice that the HP books were just extremely well-marketed children's slop. Nothing more than a fad. I wasn't really interested in seeing the movie either. Was I ever wrong...what a tremendous mistake!!One night, being very tired and having nothing to read, I stole my cousin's copy of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, with the excuse of \\"finding what all the damned fuss is about\\", fully prepared to drop it the instant this dumbed down children's book bored me. But as I should have known, my scorn turned into delight in no time! I plowed through it like a madman, and rushed to the store to buy the second one immediately afterwards, and the rest is history, of course.The verdict: I love Harry Potter. Love, love, love. I'm incredibly glad to have discovered these amazing books. They may not be terribly complex of course, but they have an undeniable charm to them, and are incredibly thrilling to read. As much of a clich&eacute; as \\"you will not be able to put this book down\\" is, it is very true of the Harry Potter books. They just have an intangible quality to them make the stories irrresistible. They have that combination of being very light to read, while at the same time tugging at your imagination in a wonderful way.When I knew nothing of Harry Potter, I had the idea that it would be an interminable series of some kind (As in \\"Harry Potter #24\\", &aacute;la Hardy Boys and what have you - urgh!)...of course, it turned out to be a seven book series. What fascinates me is the story arc that runs through the whole series: the plots are intertwined and the stories are threaded very cleverly from one book to the next. Certain parts of the books are reminiscent of Roald Dahl, who was my favorite author as a child (and whose adult material I've gone on to enjoy as well). In reality, they are written for any age group, and Rowling has cleverly decided to not dumb the material down patronizingly just because so many children are fans of her work. On the contrary, as the tales advance, there is a clear descent into darker territory. Without spoiling anything for you, Part 4 ends with an indescribably thrilling vibe. The sense of anticipation it gives you is tingling, almost unbearable! You can't wait for the next installment, but you dread it all the same.A word of warning to readers who have yet to make up their minds about Harry Potter: beware of the reviews on Amazon. Just take my word for it and pick up the entire series! Too many inconsiderate people reveal key plot twists & spoilers, some going so far as to spill information on all four books in the review of a single one. Just reading three or four reviews could be one review too many. Don't assume people will be smart enough to not disclose vital information about the entire series in a single review. Part of what enhanced my enjoyment was my complete and utter ignorance of the Potter world, and discovering it on my own. What a series...Books 1 and 2 are great, but parts 3 and 4 show that, rather than becoming stale, the story arc gets more complicated and fascinating. The last 2 parts are definitely the best. And the movie certainly doesn't hold a candle to the reading experience.As a wise man once said: buy or die! No matter what your age, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Began reading this to my 3 year old son who was more interested in other things. Decided to finish the book myself because of all the great reviews it had received and really enjoyed it. Simple story with great characters. I'm going to read the whole series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read the book before seeing the movie for the first time. I found the book to be highly amusing. There are parts that are sad, or happy, or make you think. This book runs you through almost every emotion. The book is much better than the movie. The movie left out some great parts (especially in the end) that I think would have added a special part to the movie that most movies neglect (like the use of logic!)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is a very good book to read. You can sit down and read the first couple of paragraphs and you're hooked. It's a great book for all ages. If you like books about magic and wizardry, then this book is for you. You learn the way life is like for a wizard to grow up with normal people and how they treated this young boy. Harry was a very deprived child who no one cared about, or so he thought.Harry was a very gifted boy who one day he discovered his true talent. One day when he least expected he found out all about his past. Harry finds out how to be a true hero. He learns about true friends and those who love to hate you. Harry learns a game that he is the best at. He discovers how odd some people show their way of caring. Harry Potter is the greatest book I have ever read, and it taught me a lot of lessons."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is an amazing character with a confusing life. The story tells of a boy who knows nothing of his parents except that they were mysteriously killed in a car accident. Therefore he has to live with his aunt, uncle, and annoyingly mean cousin. They treat Harry horribly, as if he doesn't even exist. On his eleventh birthday, a giant man named Hagrid came and told Harry something that would change his life forever. He was told that his parents were wizards and that he would attend Hogwart's, a school of wizardry. He leaves for the school and when he gets there he learns many amazing things about his parents world. While attending the school he unexpectedly reveals a secret that is forbidden by students to know. To find out the secret, you'll just have to read the most adventurous book about the courage of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It will definitely keep you in suspense."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"There is nothing like the Harry Potter series. These books shaped my imagination and ignited my passion for reading. I could identify with Harry as an outsider and Hermione as a bookworm. I could read these books a million times."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful first novel in what is an outstanding series. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is largely a struggle for self identity story and Rowling does such a brillant job developing Harry's world. Harry grows up thinking he's an ordinary boy,but on his 11th birthday,Harry recieves an invatation to a specail school that starts the embarkment on a journey for Harry to discover who he really is and what his destiny is. One reason Harry Potter has been so popular is that Rowling suceeds in making the readers care about her characters. The characters feel so real. You can almost feel their joys,fears,and sorrows through the pages. That's the thing that makes Harry Potter such a wonderful series,all the characters and their feelings and reactions seem so real. This is easily the most charming and innocent of the Harry Potter novels,but one reason the later books resonate so much is that,by making us fall in love with Harry,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore,and Hagrid in this the lighter adventures of Sorcerer's Stone,we are thus really able to fear and empathize with them when they face the darker and more tragic and intense events of the later books because we've grown to care for them. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a rousing first novel in a series that only gets better afterwards. I strongly recommend this book for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is an awesome.I wish I could have the book but my mom says I don't need a magic book.That is what I wanted to say."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Wow! What an enjoyable / fun read. Ill admit, I was one of 'those people' who watched the movies first. But now that I just started to read the book for research (seeing how books translate to film), this book is nearly word for word from book to movie unlike Lord of the Rings which I started reading also.Way to go JK Rowling! What a vivid imagination you have!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I love how much stuff there is to do in Hogwarts. Something new and exciting is always going on, whether it's finding a mirror that shows what you most desire, playing a game of Quidditch above hundreds of cheering students, or solving magical riddles to stop a dark wizard.And Rowling's storytelling skills are amazing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Yeah, this book was good. I don't suppose I need to say much more. I liked it as did many others and am working my way through the whole series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"With all the hype about Harry Potter, I thought I'd give it a whirl. The more I read, the more I admired Rowling's fantastic imagination. I was upset to hear the book was geared towards the 12-13 yr. old group. I'm a grandparent and am thoroughly enjoying reading about Harry."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"How do you review a book that came out years ago, a book that has become part of the global culture? That's my challenge, now that I've read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Odds are that nine out of ten readers (if not more) have already read the book. So rather than a typical review, where I'd suggest my opinion of the book's strengths and weaknesses, I'll instead walk you through my first reading of the book.So this is Harry Potter. After hearing about the boy wizard for thirteen years, this feels like reading a biography. I know the name and some of the exploits, but I don't know the details.Potter, like so many great protagonists, exhibits unusual potential for his age, combined with a gentle humility and loyalty to his friends. What Potter hasn't shown, so far, is weakness, or acknowledgement of weakness. (Harry's comparative lack of book smarts, when put alongside Hermione, hardly counts as a character weakness.) Harry is compelling for his potential, but he's distant in his lack of humanity. There aren't any weaknesses or flaws to be seen, and he seems to excel out of a fixed destiny rather than any real effort on his part. So far, Harry is intriguing but not inspiring.Rowling herself is a bit heavy-handed with her character development. Clearly Harry is meant to be the chosen one, and his new godparents despise his wizarding heritage; and there is neither complexity nor depth to either stereotype. I struggle to remind myself that Rowling is writing to a child audience at this point. I've been told her writing matured as her audience did, so I'm working to read this book as if it's young adult lit. Despite my initial qualms with her writing, Rowling knows how to captivate. She's a good storyteller, if not a great writer.Certain elements and plot devices have shown great potential, although Rowling does not develop them deeply. For instance, the Mirror of Erised fascinated me -- anyone who looks into the mirror sees \\"nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts.\\" However, the mirror serves primarily to reinforce the stereotypes into which Rowling has written her characters, and I close the book disappointed that the mirror didn't play a larger role. (The mirror does, however, make a reappearance near the end, to serve the plot, but it's potential was left mostly untapped.)Death, too, received an intriguing treatment. Through Dumbledore, Rowling described the end of life \\"as going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.\\" Even after reflection I can't parse that last sentence -- how does the mind's organization affect one's view of death?Now at the end, I've flown through these 300 pages, much like I did with The Hunger Games. In both, the writing style encourages a quick read, and the plot was compelling enough to keep me from putting the book down. As stand-alone books (ignoring the rest of each series), I prefer The Hunger Games by a large margin. That story resonated more deeply, the characters mirrored reality more closely, and the ideas piqued my curiosity more strongly. This first Potter book was fun, and I look forward to continuing the series, but I hope to see Rowling grow as a writer."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Who would have known a story about a little boy living under a cupboard named Harry Potter would become an international best-seller? HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCER'S STONE is the first novel in a 7 book series that introduces the reader to an amazing world of magic.The novel begins with Harry living with his aunt and uncle, the Dursleys. Ever since Harry was dropped off at the Dursley's front doorstep 10 years ago, the Dursleys along with their hefty son, Dudley, have made his life almost unbearable. It is not until a letter arrives, written with emerald-green ink, addressed for Harry Potter--The Cupboard under the Stairs--does Harry's life begin to radically change.That's when a giant named Hagrid visits Harry and reveals to him, against the wishes of the Dursley's, that he is a wizard. After Harry purchases all his school material from Diagon Alley, he leaves platform nine and three-quarters straight to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry also learns he is famous, world renown, in the magical universe because of his faceoff with You-Know-Who, Voldemort! Woops, I didn't say that!The reader, for the first time, is teased in this novel with such unforgettable characters and stunning ideas that become much more prominent as the series plays out: Hogwarts, Dumbledore, Voldemort, Quidditch, Professor Snape, Professor McGonagall, Draco Malfoy, the Invisibility Cloak, Gryffindor, etc.J.K. Rowling's writing ability, imagination, and intuitive grasp of human nature gives her characters a depth that resonates in the core of the reader. Harry, along with his best friends, Hermione and Ron, are so in tune, emotionally intact with one another that it makes the story so much more alive. Before Harry knows it, his first year at Hogwarts involves not only learning magic but figuring out how to keep the Sorcerer's Stone from getting in the wrong hands.This novel is a classic that will initiate the reader into a world of mystery. The characters are so emotionally developed they become real in your heart. It is a story so good and well thought out that it urges you to read on to the end."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read this with my 8 year old son in the evenings.

So much fun!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I looked at the cover of my sister's book and figured it couldn't be the best book in the world, and to my surprise, I couldn't stop reading. It's excellently written, suspense and mystery are woven into the spectacular tale of Harry Potter the modern day wizard. J.K. Rowling has written the best fantasy series since the Hobbit. And I know that the next sever are going to be just as good, if not better. It's a must, not only for the kids, but for the adults who are reading it too."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter has to be one of the best books of all time. If you are a person like me who barely if ever reads for fun and felt that all books are just boring and when you read a book you just dont feel like finishing this is the way to start.This book and the entire series have helped me realize how much fun reading really is. I have actually improved my reading habits from barely a minute a day to about 4 hours. I cant stop reading these books. If you like any kind of reading or no kind of reading you will enjoy the book. It has tons of Intensity, Mystery, Action, Comedy, And Great Cliff Hangers. I would recommend this book to anyone big or small."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an enchanting book. Rowling (author) brings you to a world of magic and excitment. Where the people fly on brooms and use magic wands to do some of lifes more difficult things.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is one of my favorite books and if you read it I bet it would be one of yours too."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When my little brother first became obsessed with getting this book, I thought that he was crazy. It seemed to me like &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; was just some sort of fad that would work itself out. I was initially only going to read it to find out why everybody loved it so much, but by the time I finished it I realized that the hype about it was well deserved.J.K. Rowling's characters were very real and believable. The way that they interacted with each other was incredibly realistic. Her touches of humor, especially in the Weasley twins, were quite enjoyable.Once I got started reading &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,&quot; I didn't want to stop. The last few chapters were especially suspenseful, and the ending totally surprised me. I would recommend this book to people of all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I love this book, it is funny and smart, and totaly ingenius. I had no thought but to give it 5 stars. My favourite characters were the Weasley twins! READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A friend of mine has been trying for months to get me to read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but I refused to read it, insisting it wasn't the type of book I would would enjoy. Afterall, witches and wizards were just some of those things that can't happen and I never really liked books about the &quot;impossible.&quot; However we made a deal where she would take me to our favorite restaurant if I'd read Harry Potter. So, I unhappily began reading the first chapter, half expecting to find that the book was a good book after all. But, it seemed a rather slow start that was boring. Same thing with the second chapter. Somehow I managed to get to the fourth chapter and I was surprised to find that somewhere along the line I'd gotten interested in the story. I read on, growing more and more interested as I read. The characters that seemed so dull and boring at first were now blooming into real characters! I found myself changing some opinions I started with. Hermione had seemed like such a know-it-all type of person at the beginning and by the end I was starting to like her. Her vast knowledge really helped Harry and Ron. Hagrid turmed out to be a friend to Harry and his friends. The story had a marvelous ending that only a brillant author like Joanna Rowling could have created to be fitting to this exceptional story. Some people have written reviews saying that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone doesn't live up to all the hype surrounding it. That's simply not true. Harry Potter may very well someday be a classic, like Charlette's Web and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Besides knowing that this book really was great, I know one more thing. I got the better end of the deal with my friend: Now I will get to go to the restaurant AND have had the opportunity to read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. :o)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I saw J.K.

You have to read it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is fun, fast, and fiesty. It's got everything a good kids' book needs; humor, action, and just a little bit of comedy. I've never read a book that kept me laughing so much! And, people, this is from an actual kid!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was introduced to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by my mom, who read it before I did and loved it! I started reading it because it sounded interesting and I needed a fantasy book for summer reading, but I found that I was reading one of the greatest books ever. I think that it's my most favorite book since Madeleine L'Engle's &quot;A Ring of Endless Light&quot; and Sharon Creech's &quot;Walk Two Moons&quot;!!! If you haven't read it yet, you don't know what you are missing! I can't wait to read the rest of the books!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When my friend suggested to read this book I laughed in herface. When I put it down I went out and bought a sorry note to giveher, for Harry Potter and The Sourcer's Stone is unforgettable. It's so imaginative it makes Jane Eyre seem tripe and utterly boring. To alll those people who insist that it is a children's book, read it because it's not often a reader can be enchanted and whisked off to such a remote and magical world where the writing is truely inspirational!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an awesome book! Irecived it as a gift in March and starteed reading it thatafternoon. I stayed up extra late so I could finish it. I even did my book report on it because I liked it so much! It is a great book that any kid who likes action, adventure, and magic should read. I recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I can't belive it! This piece of writing is imaginativly created! The world of Hogwarts....The wonderful world of magic.........The funny act of the students.........The weird teaching methods of teachers........ This books RULEZ!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am 10 years old and love to read. This book was very exciting and I read it in about 5 days. I enjoyed the magic, the flying brooms, and the quidditch games. I am excited to begin reading the 2nd book. This would be a great Christmas gift for your child."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the sorcerers stone was a very good book. Iam not usually in to books that are not true, but this book is a good one. It is very easy to read and I recomend it to anyone at any age."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I love Harry Potter and so does my whole 6th grade class. Your children will love this book and want to read it over and over again. This is a good price to having all these people love Harry Potter and the Dursleys. The author J.K. Rowling is amazing in this book about Harry Potter and his spell on the world!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I will be among the millions of kids that want to walk around with lightning bolts on their forheads....and I'm almost 17! These books are absolutely amazing! I started the first one on a saturday and was complelty captivated by Harry and his wizardry. I finished that one in three days, the second one in one day! and I just began the third one and cannot put it down! These are must reads for everyone!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone is about the life of an 11-year-old boy who finds out he's really a wizard.He decides to go to Hogwarts, a witch and wizard school,where he meets new friends and goes on amazing adventures. This is a wonderful book with great dialouge that J.K. Rowling wrote very well."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought this is one of the best books i read..and will ever read! When i first glanced at the book cover and title i thought eww punny third grader picture book! After reading the back i became slightly more intrested but not much. I finally became convinced of reading it after my whole school seemed to have it in their hands i just HAD to read it said they. So i did and i was soo ASTONISHED! it was so creative and imaginative! I am a good writer myself and i could never come up w/ what this writer did. The plot is AMAZING and i'm not hesitating in reading the sequels! I did judge by the cover but i was proven wrong!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is a glorious book with al the elements of fantasy,adventure,and mystery. the book is really not for ages 9-12;I know that because my mother reads it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"10 years old and nothing to look forward to including holidays and even your birthday. That's how 10-year-old Harry Potter feels all of the time. He lives in a cuboard under the stairs of his aunt and uncle's house where he is treated very poorly. He soon finds out that he is from a magical world full of charms, potions, spells, sports on broomsticks, and candy that comes in every flavor you could think of. His aunt and uncle have been hiding this from him for 10 years. He goes to Hogwarts and has a great adventure. Strongly recommended. I read it in three days and I'm only ten, too."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter And the Scorcer's Stone was magical. (No pun intended) As soon as I finished it, I read it 21 more times. Some of my friends think I'm a little wierd because I read a children's book. Most of them, however, are just as obsessed as I am. Harry Potter is not just a children's book. I am 14, and I can't wait for the fourth book of the series to come out. Yes, I've read all three in exisitance multiple times. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a really good book for either themselves or their children. Guaranteed to please!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is an excellant book, it is inspirting and has high climate, I could put it down i recommend it to any body, looking for a mystery, funny, and excitting book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I first borrow the book from my library, I was expecting a children story. But it turns out to be an unexpected treat. The characters and plot are all so believeable that they have a real feel to them. The story is.. simply amazing, it is light fantasy at its best. I can hardly wait for the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved this book and can't wait for the next, I'm 12 and don'tsee why people think kids learn violence from these kinds of book, Norevil or anything else either, I'm Homeschooled and love reading and books don't influence me if they are bad, I suggest you read this to your children or read it yourself, It's wonderful for all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a 72 year old retired nursing professor. I bought the book for my grandchildren. Before I sent it to them I decided to read it. I sat up late two nights savoring it. The fantasy content is not as important as the feelings. The book describes the emotions of children entering a new school, making friends, dealing with school bullies and unfair teachers--in short, dealing with life. The fantasy will keep the kids reading, but the lessons they will learn have far more importance in their every day lives."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Yes, it's true. I really pity the parents who are uh, (I have to say silly or the won't print my review, you get the idea), to not allow them to read the best books written recently.GO GRYFFINDOR!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"While I was reading this book, the thought that it might be evil never entered my mind. It's a wonderful children's story about a young man named Harry Potter who, after being treated horribly by his muggle family, finds happiness and adventure at a school for wizardry. It was an amazing read and I recommend it to anyone. This book will be placed among the classics such as the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and the Secret Garden. Evil? Pshaw! This book is as evil as the Wizard of Oz or Glenda the Good Witch."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think this is a great book! I am 8 years old and my mom bought this book for me to read. I have been reading chapter books since I was 6 years old. This is far the best I have ever read! I can't wait until she buys me the rest of the Harry Potter series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter was really one of those rare books that can just pull you away to another place and time. While reading this my brother stepped on my toe and I didn't even feel it; while flipping a page I hit my elbow on the side of my chair and it started to bleed but I didn't even notice it. I read this book virtually non stop for four days and finished it. One of my favorite parts was Harry's first Quidditch match. Quidditch is a very unusual, VERY creative sport played on broomsticks in the air with six balls that can think for themselves, and the game actually makes sense (As much as something can at Hogwarts), with nice and organized rules. I'm really a person that goes for only the great plots in books, and Harry Potter has provided me with enough plot to last me a long time. As a baby, Lord Voldemort, the ultimate evil wizard, kills Harry's parents. Voldemort cannot kill Harry himself. He is then placed on the doorstep of his former perfectly normal aunt and uncle. They know he has strange magical powers, but never tell him this as they raise him in a cupboard in the basement. He's raised learning all lies about his life and treated terribly there, until finally the gamekeeper of the wizardry school &quot;Hogwarts&quot; comes to a cabin of theirs to tell Harry about his life and powers. From then on his life changes as he stars in Quidditch, makes new friends at his new school, and has strange encounters with evil in his great adventures. I love fantasy: books, movies, etc. and I must say, I definitely recommend this to all fellow fantasy-lovers, and really to all kinds of people. I say if you don't have it, GET IT."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I must give Rowling credit: she has done wonderfull for herself with her first book. I must say I'm jealous. But I can't understand all the hype. I enjoyed the book (finished it in one day), but it wasn't the best book I've ever read. I can't agree with those who say it's horrible (especially those who say it makes children want to join the occult- it's a children's book for crying out loud!) but I also can't agree with those that say it's as good as the Chronicles of Narnia by C. S. Lewis (Nothing is as good as they are.)The story isn't exactly new. You can find a witch/wizard school in books like Jill Murphy's _Worst Witch_ series. The ending was dissapointing, not suprising. The worst thing was the logic puzzle. Showing the readers the poem was a waste of time if they can't see the bottles. The book is filled with cliches and the author doesn't attempt to make something new about them.So, while I did enjoy most of the book, I can't possibly give it 5 stars like almost everyone else has."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter's story is an engaging. I loved the famous sorcerer card deck. But all the (professional) reviewers who seem to think that _Harry Potter_ is some profound new genre have been missing Diana Wynne Jones' books all these years. When you finish _Harry_ and wish for more - read her!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book deserves 8000 stars not five. Harry Potter is off the chart. Some people think Harry Potter is devilish, some advice just read it! YOU wont be disappointed."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Informed that I HAD to read this book before venturing to see it's onscreen translation, I'm one of the many hordes that must have just reading about Harry for the first time in late 2001.Unfortunately, I've also read more thoughtful fantasy, and more intense British &quot;public&quot; school stories. For all of it's bang, this first book in the series seems a little thin, though allowances maybe should be made for all the time spent establishing the characters and the setting. Still, Harry is charming, and the characters surrounding him are extremely appealing, so their is obviously huge potential existing in the remaining books.Harry, himself, is a clever creation. He's not that original an idea, not even in his appearance, but he provides a perfect view into Hogwarts School. Like us, he never knew such a wondrous place could possibly exist. Everything needs to be explained to him, and, lucky us, we get to listen in. The other appeal in Harry is that he turns our world on its head. Slight and bespectacled, he's a veritable superstar - a natural - at the wizard world's athletic pastime, Quidditch, a game that captures the best and worst of modern sporting (fast-paced flying broom and ball game with elements of soccer, and scoring even weirder than cricket).Prior to his new academic life, Harry lived a nightmarish existence amidst bourgeois plenty. Harry's got too much pluck to let us know how miserable he is, but when the world of wizardry aggressively invites him in, it almost seems like the remainder of the book is mere wish fulfillment. The Muggles here most clearly resemble Roald Dahl grotesques, which makes it almost disappointing when Harry gets whisked off to the Chocolate Facto-- er, the Wizard's school.Hogwarts threatens to be a sticky-sweet paradise, but Harry's friends and rivals, along with the school's faculty and staff, flesh everything out nicely. While author J. K. Rowling borrows relentlessly from all sorts of fantastic traditions to populate and decorate Hogwarts' halls and surroundings, she does it all with a deft spin to keep Harry Potter's world from being one giant, cheesy pastiche. And even though Rowling seems to rely a bit on the Dumbledore ex machina to resolve the House Competition at the end, the conclusion to the mystery occupying the final third of the book is very satisfying. It is easy to see why her readers repeatedly return for more doses of Harry's world.Viva Ravenclaw!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have read all three Harry Potter books and each one is an unique adventure that I strongly recommend. I do not agree with all the critism it has been given. Yes, it is not for little kids. No, it does not encourage Dark Arts/Magic. It is a book made for the fantasy genre, which has been around FOREVER.....many classics are fantasy stories. And if you know your child, and have brought them up to respect literature (which is the only way acheive knowledge) they will love it too for what it is, a story. I would let my child read this book way before I let them watch prime time television. When I was eleven, the most popular books in school were the R.L. Stien books. And somehow, no one opposed it like they did to Harry.I encourage old and young to read it. The picture appears in your mind in great detail, and the story comes alive. Its pure pleasure."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have the complete series of the Harry Potter audio books, and have simply been blown away by Jim Dale's vocal ability. Though a bit pricey, it is well worth the cost. I have listened to the entire book at least six times! A must buy for any Harry Potter fan."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I don't know if I hate to read or just don't.... I'm 31 years old and have read less that a hand full of books and then only kicking and screaming... After the first 3-5 chapters of harry potter I didn't want to put it down.... I'm a slow reader and actually would read the book outloud to my wife. I READ IT TWICE and when the fourth book came out I was excited that is had over 700 pages!!!Thanks you J.K."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter series had me up all day and night. I couldn't put it down. I, personally felt attached to the characters. The author is superb in keeping you guessing and wanting for more when the book is over.I highly recommend these books not only to childrens but to adults as well!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K.

At Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry found out that the Sorcerer's Stone (a stone which holds a potion that gives eternal life) is hidden. Harry and his two best friends need to save the Stone from Voldemort.I thought this book was wonderful for all ages. It was filled with action and adventure.
