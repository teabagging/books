It's a resource to get, read, then schedule time to periodically re-read and keep learning about this important area."},{"Title":"WriterSpeaker.com: Internet Research and Marketing for Writers and Speakers","review":"Carmen Leal is not just a very smart lady; she's very nice, too. Both traits come across loud and clear in this book. Reading her easy, straightforward, advice-rich prose is like having a conversation with the wise, affectionate aunt you never had. And, without a doubt, her collection of helpful sites for writers and speakers is unparalleled. She had pretty much every link in my own Internet bookmark folder, plus about 25-30% more than I had -- and mine were considerable, being the result of more than six years as a writer. Without a doubt, this book will stay next to my computer and become dogeared from all the love and attention it gets from me.That said, I do have a slight issue with the marketing of this book as pure Internet reference, because that's not exactly what it is. Ms. Leal's target audience is actually NOT the seasoned writer or speaker who just needs to rev up his or her personal research engine. She's writing for, and to, beginning writers and aspiring professional speakers. Much of her book (some entire chapters and several partial chapters) is devoted to introducing neophytes to the craft and the business of writing or speaking. Thus, considering my six years of experience as a writer, I found myself skimming great swaths of text, with my eyes pausing only when I glimpsed the italic print with which all those juicy internet links are helpfully set apart.Bottom line: This book is most definitely worth the $10 Amazon will charge you for it, and more. However, its scope is, in my opinion, a bit broad. It would be more useful to professional writers and speakers if it came in a separate, streamlined edition -- one without all the newbie advice we've already heard and benefited from long ago."},{"Title":"WriterSpeaker.com: Internet Research and Marketing for Writers and Speakers","review":"Carmen Leal has done a massive amount of research to write this book.

And, oh what I would have missed had I not read it! \\"Technical reading\\" is not usually my choice. In fact, the last time I read a technical book it was assigned reading in college.

Excepting perhaps Detective Alleyn, the book is full of characters that one does not care about, engaged in an uninteresting sequence of events. This is exacerbated by the fact that it is unclear as to which character has what significance. Also there is not much of a sense of atmosphere. Disappointing."},{"Title":"Death of a Fool (Roderick Alleyn mystery)","review":"Although not in the same league with BLACK AS HE'S PAINTED or DEAD WATER, Ngaio Marsh's DEATH IN A WHITE TIE is a highly satisfying novel that meets the expectations readers have of this particular author: it is literate, witty, peopled with fully rounded characters, and set against an interesting backdrop--in this case the London debutant season.In this particular novel, Inspector Allen is called upon to investigate rumors of a blackmailer at work in London's high society, and he accordingly recruits Lord \\"Bunchy,\\" a well known and decidedly fatherly figure. Bunchy is quick to identify the blackmailer--but just as the blackmail plot seems about to unravel murder steps in, and Allen must not only uncover the blackmailer but a killer as well.As is often the case in a Marsh novel, some readers will spot the killer long before the book's finish--but as typical of Marsh, getting there is most of the fun. A number of favorites return in this novel, including painter Agatha Troy, previously introduced in ARTISTS IN CRIME, and Allen's charming mother; the novel also includes a number of romantic subplots that Marsh handles with considerable effectiveness. Neither newcomers nor old fans will be disappointed; recommended."},{"Title":"Death of a Fool (Roderick Alleyn mystery)","review":"This is perhaps Ngaio Marsh's best example of an upper-crust English murder mystery. The characters are so finely drawn that it makes you wish they would show up in her other novels.

The backdrop of the debutante parties gives an interesting behind the scenes glimpse of 1930s London society, and if you like your mysteries peopled with lots of peers, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Death of a Fool (Roderick Alleyn mystery)","review":"To celebrate the Winter Solstice, the swordsmen of South Mardian intricately weave their blades in an ancient ritual dance.

The mystery is rather intricate. Some of it is discernible IMHO, but some is not. The characters are interesting but some seem like charicatures. William Andersen's dialect was impossible to understand; many other characters (as usual in Marsh books) use many British idioms not readily understood in the US. But, these are annoyances only. \\"The Play's the Thing.\\" The 5 Sword Dance, a continuation of an ancient pagan ritual, is described in great detail. Interestingly, I was reading the entry on Dancing in the encyclopediaMan, Myth & Magic, An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Supernatural 24 Volume Complete Set(orMan, Myth and Magic: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Supernatural (24-Vol. Set)) at the time! Synchronicity--per C. Jung (seeThe Tao of Psychology: Synchronicity and Self). There's a lot of psychology in Alleyn's solution to the case. What amazes me the most though is how people (assuming Marsh's characterizations are realistic) can be so foolish in dealing with a murder investigation. But, \\"it takes all kinds...\\" It's a pretty good mystery, I liked the ritual aspects, but not her best IMHO.

There are also others in the village who manage to antagonize each other. Still, the last thing anyone expects is for one of the dancers to die in a gruesome manner, mid-dance.

Unfortunately Lord Robert, known as Bunchy to his friends, is murdered after he discovers who is responsible for the blackmail. Alleyn now feels the case is personal and vows to track down the murderer if it is the last thing he does.This is a complex mystery involving some long hidden secrets and some very nasty characters who prey on people's weaknesses. Agatha Troy appears in this novel and Alleyn renews his attempts to persuade her to take him seriously as a possible husband. I enjoyed this book and found it difficult to work out who committed the murder as there are plenty of clues but plenty of red herrings too.If you like your crime novels in the classic mould then try this Ngaio Marsh. The novels can be read in any order though if you read them in the order in which they were published the relationships between the series characters are easier to follow."},{"Title":"Death of a Fool (Roderick Alleyn mystery)","review":"When a blackmailer strikes high society during the Season, Detective Chief Inspector Roderick Alleyn of Scotland Yard enlists the help of Lord Robert \\"Bunchy\\" Gospell, a charming elderly gentleman who's a friend to all, to unmask him. Unfortunately, Bunchy gets too close to the truth and pays for it with his life, leaving Alleyn both distraught at the loss of a good friend and responsible for catching the killer.I've read nine Ngaio Marsh mysteries now, and overall I'm still struggling to understand why she's considered so good an author. Death in a White Tie is certainly more accomplished than some of her previous efforts. The clues are there for the alert reader, the plot mechanics fit together, and the writing is less clunky than Marsh's previous efforts. The 1930s setting has an exotic appeal for readers today and the book feels more open and real than, say, A Man Lay Dead.On the other hand, this is still a puzzle rather than a novel, where the solution depends on who was in what room when and whether the police can engineer a confession through a series of unlikely interviews. Having the police themselves point out how unlikely they are to succeed doesn't actually excuse it. None of the characters are particularly interesting or appealing, including Alleyn himself, and there's no real depth here. The book also feels unnecessarily long, padded out with a few too many characters and conversations. I can only guess that the rules of evidence in 1930s England weren't what they are now, because this isn't the way I'd want to see police behave.Alleyn is his usual self here: nobly lacerating his finer feelings to discharge his duty as a policeman and unprofessionally involving friends and family in his investigations. He is the only character permitted to solve even the slightest part of the mystery; no-one else is allowed to shine. It's made clear Alleyn has solved the mystery long before the reader is enlightened, as per usual, but when we aren't shown how his mind works this adds nothing to the book's interest. Alleyn also resumes his puzzling \\"romance\\" with Agatha Troy in this book, which leads to a fairly repellent exchange with his mother about what women want.As far as Golden Age mysteries set amongst the English upper classes go, this is pretty standard fare. It's pleasant enough for whiling away a couple of hours, but no more than that."},{"Title":"Death of a Fool (Roderick Alleyn mystery)","review":"This is one of my favorite Marsh mysteries and I was delighted to find a CD audiobook version.

The first chapter of the book, per se establishes the premise that the intellectual life is a calling from God, one that is sacred and to be held as a trust.In the second chapter there is a section on the spirit of prayer, among other topics.Chapter three develops the paradox of solitude and involvement with other people. An intellectual, as is the case with other creative individuals, does both.Work is the topic for chapter four and the contexts include: continuity of work, work at night, mornings and evening, and moments of plenitude.A creative scholar must be open to insights around him.&quot;Ideas emerge from facts; they also emerge from conversations, chance occurrences, theatres, visits, strolls, the most ordinary books&quot; (p. 73).The remainder of the book fleshes out this discussion of intellectual work.A reader would leave this book a more thoughtful person from having been exposed to these ideas.

In addition to pragmatic material on life as an Academic, the author unfolds the truth that knowledge is \\"nothing more than a slow and gradual cure of our blindness.\\" This insightful book is a must read for anyone who is feels a call to excellence in scholarship."},{"Title":"The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods","review":"1998 reprint of 1987 edition, Catholic University of America Press, 296 pages (of which 260 pages form the main body of the book)Translated from the French (1934 2nd edition) by Mary RyanI came across this unusual book when discussing with my most well read friend the problem of deciding how much to read. He told me this topic was covered in Sertillanges' book and suggested I read it.The title makes it sound as if the book might be pretentious, but it is not. In the same way that Peter Drucker's superb The Effective Executive is a book for any knowledge worker rather than just for managers, Sertillanges' book should be helpful for anyone who wishes to work using their intellect, rather than just for rarefied intellectuals.The 1998 reissue (the 1992 date listed on Amazon.co.uk is incorrect) of the 1987 edition has a new forward by James Schall. I think he captures the essence of Sertillanges' book very well:\\"At first sight...this is a quaint book. At second sight it is an utterly demanding book.\\"The subtitle of The Intellectual Life describes its contents well: \\"Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods\\". For Sertillanges, intellectual work is not something done in isolation of the rest of a person's life. He believes strongly that in order to do intellectual work to one's capacity, one must order the whole of one's life with this goal in mind. And further, that this requires habits of simplicity, detachment, note taking, memory, writing and more. His book is thus a step-by-step manual that sets out these requirements from the general (virtues, character) to the specific (note-taking, writing).For most people who are not already members of religious orders (Sertillanges was a Dominican friar) it would be terrifically demanding to follow all of Sertillanges' prescriptions - and involve major changes to one's life. Sertillanges does believe, however, that if one takes care with the rest of one's life then intellectual work can be done satisfactorily using only a couple of hours a day. His book is thus a mixture of the extremely demanding and eminently practical - particularly as much of his advice involves cutting out and eliminating habits that waste time and disturb thought (e.g. pointless correspondence and interactions with people, reading of novels and newspapers).After reading Ben Franklin's autobiography and Charlie Munger's Poor Charlie's Almanack at the beginning of the year, I have become increasingly aware of the crucial role of habits in determining the outcome of peoples' lives. I was stupid enough to have spent a good proportion of my life testing out the truth of Franklin's maxim: \\"Experience keeps a dear school, yet Fools will learn in no other.\\" I no longer have any doubt that forming good habits - and most especially avoiding forming bad ones - is terribly important. After all, reliability - which Munger considers the single most important determining characteristic for a person's life - is really just another habit.Sertillanges understood this very well and the importance of habits that facilitate intellectual work is a topic that he brings up repeatedly - and in my view very wisely - in his book:\\"One acquires facility in thinking just as one acquires facility in playing the piano, in riding, or painting.... The mind gets into the way of doing what is often demanded of it.\\"This is not the only resemblance between the advice in Sertillanges' book and that given by Charlie Munger (the best source for his ideas and the most useful book I have ever read is Poor Charlie's Almanack). The importance of a broad base of knowledge, the danger of over-specialisation and the critical importance of only a few ideas in each subject are all covered in this book.Another striking similarity is Sertillanges' view of the importance of 'contact with genius' and how one goes about acquiring wisdom:\\"...the principal profit from reading, at least from reading great works, is not the acquisition of scattered truths, it is the increase of our wisdom.\\"I was left with somewhat mixed feelings as I progressed through The Intellectual Life. At times Sertillanges' overt religiosity became a little much for me (I am not a religious person) and I found his prescriptions rather daunting.As I neared the end of the book, however, my view changed and I found myself extremely grateful that Sertillanges' had written this book for us. It was partly because his section on writing answered with great clarity some problems that I had been wrestling with, and partly because I realised that one could simply take what one needed from his book - rather than the whole package.My difficulty in deciding how much to read remains somewhat unresolved: there is a tension between Sertillanges' advice on reading and that of people like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger on investment (my own profession/hobby). Sertillanges advises cutting down on excess (particularly undirected) reading, including, for example, newspapers:\\"As to newspapers, defend yourself against them with the energy that the continuity and the indiscretion of their assault make indispensable. You must know what the papers contain, but they contain so little...\\"Buffett, on the other hand, claims to read five newspapers a day and urges us to read everything in sight!I suspect the different advice is due to the type of work. Firstly, I am not sure that investing is an inherently intellectual pursuit (Buffett has often said that after an average level of intelligence the right temperament is more important). Secondly, intelligent investment is just applied opportunism - and in order to take advantage of opportunities we must first be aware of their existence.I did not find this an easy review to write. I have had to leave out various topics that I would like to have discussed more fully (such as Sertillanges' excellent advice on writing) and still feel this review may be overlong. However, I believe a review that does not attempt to set its subject firmly in context is of limited use. I'll leave the final word to Sertillanges:\\"There are books everywhere and only a few are necessary.\\"I commend this unusual book to you as one of the necessary ones."},{"Title":"The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods","review":"Indispensable for anyone desiring to become a genuine and disciplined scholar; it provides an outstanding roadmap for anyone aspiring to the intellectual life and its mastery. A few of Sertillanges' suggestions are antiquated due to the date of the book's publication. This, however, poses no difficulties for the reader as these patches of \\"elderly wisdom\\" are easily updated - substituting the era of the typewriter with the age of digital scholarship. The principles taught in this text remain unchanged over time. After all, it is the task of \\"one who would know\\" to refashion the specific, temporal elements of \\"BEING & DOING\\" in accordance with the essence and ideals which form the timeless core, indeed the heart, of a life lived in pursuit of the highest things. It is the journey that captivates and grips both spirit and mind with a particular awe; overwhelmingly humbling and dazzling the soul of those who bide the perils of such a life and are rewarded, if they do not succumb to their own pride, with the unexpected, dumbfounding flash of perceiving (or more accurately SEEING) an image, a fleeting shadow of \\"that which IS\\" - the act of knowing something for the first time which was not taught to you by another, nor derived as the end product of a line of reasoning."},{"Title":"The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods","review":"The French A.G. Sertillanges originally wrote The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods in 1920. This edition was published by The Catholic University Press in 1987. The translation from the French is both warm, and serious. It reads as if you are sitting by a warm fire in the evening, in a quiet room full of books from all ages. An experienced friend is telling you the best way to go about spending your future time in this favorite room.What first drew me to this book was its title. I wondered if it would give me some insight into the private thoughts of great thinkers. Besides, if the book has been around 90 years, and is still in print, certainly there would be something to be gleaned from its pages. The title may seem a little daunting at first, but the truth is that this book is a very heartfelt journey into the life and mind of the everyman thinker, whom Sertillanges calls \\"great men\\", but can be any man with the drive, desire, and discipline to think and produce something original.While this book is male-centric, and considers women to be the \\"wife of the thinker\\", this was in no way a hindrance to my enjoyment of the book as a woman. This was simply a product of the time, and also very fair and right in its portrayal of the role of the wife. A wife, Sertillanges says, can be supportive of her thinking husband, and also help him by just being with him while he works, she also working on something she equally loves. This is right, proper, timeless, and in no way means that a woman can't just happen to love being a thinker also, as opposed to say for example, the family seamstress or gardener: both good hobbies and work in their own right. The point in it all is discipline more so than gender.The major themes throughout this book are Faith, Discipline, and Balance. Sertillanges asserts that a blend of Roman Catholic tradition, a purposeful discipline, and a balanced life are the key to succesfull and fulfilling thought thereby generating great works for the benefit of all. I can't say that this formula is wrong as it is based on Biblical values, however, I do believe that Sertillanges places too much emphasis on Roman Catholic Tradition instead of pure Biblical Truth. As a Catholic author this shouldn't surprise his readers; Catholics hold both scripture and church tradition as equal as decreed by the Council of Trent, the documents of which Sertillanges suggests a learned man read. This is one main difference between Catholics and Protestants who hold a doctrine of Sola Scripture - \\"Scripture Alone\\". I fall in the latter camp, but since this book is not a book on theological doctrine, I simply took in this part of the book as informational. I can say that I was very appreciative of the fact that Sertillanges makes a strong case for the validity and importance of men of faith living the intellectual life in service to God. This is a point he makes well.Sertillanges spends a large portion of the book explaining why the intellectual life is a calling, a vocation, and why a disciplined mindset is pivotal in fulfilling this calling effectively. His primary recommendations revolve around simplification of one's daily schedule, having a good understanding and practice of solitude, and preserving an interior mental silence. In later chapters, he described how to organize one's reading, research, note-taking, and writing. Some of the methods described are outdated but can be easily adapted to the computer age. Overall, the ideas and mindset transferred to the reader are of the type that stay with a person, reminding them of a better way when doing the work of the thinker.A few key quotes:\\"Slacken the tempo of your life. Receptions, visits that give rise to fresh obligations, formal intercourse with one's neighbors, all the complicated ritual of an artificial life that so many men of the world secretly detest - these things are for a worker. Society life is fatal to study.\\"\\"Vocation means concentration. The work and the conditions that further it are the whole thing. Money and attention squandered on trifles will be much better spent on collecting a library, providing for instructive travel or restful holidays, going to hear music which rekindles inspiration, and so on.\\"\\"Frequent only a few whose society is profitable; avoid, even with these, the excessive familiarity which drags one down and away from one's purpose; do not run after news that occupies the mind to no purpose; do not busy yourself with the saying and doings of the world , that is with such as have no moral or intellectual bearing [tabloids and gossip sites, anyone?]; avoid unless comings and goings which waste hours and fill the mind with wandering thoughts. These are the conditions of that sacred thing, quiet recollection. Only in this way, does one gain access to the royal secrets...\\"My personal favorites:\\"And you, thinker, why have you come to this life outside the ordinary life, to this life of consecration, concentration, and therefore solitude? Was it not because of a choice? Did you not prefer truth the the daily lie of a scattered life, or even to the noble but secondary preoccupations of action?\\"\\"Thus the wise man, at all times and on every road, carries a mind ripe for acquisitions that ordinary folk neglect.\\" [This is not about intellectual snobbery, this is about a choice that any person can make.]Quoting Keyseling: \\"The truly wise man doed not dispute, he does not defend himself. He speaks, or he listens; he states or he tries to discover the meaning of things. [How is that for a lesson in internet etiquette, not to mention life?]On variety of study: \\"You must cross your crops in order not to ruin the soil. And do not imagine that to carry this comparative study to a certain point is to overload yourself and to lose time about embarking on a special study. You will not overload yourself, for the lights thrown by one subject on another will, on the contrary, make everything easier; as you acquire breadth, you mind will grow more receptive, and less easily burdened. By approaching the center of all ideas, everything is simplified, and what better means is there of approaching then center than to try different paths, which all, like the radii of a circle, make us feel that we are converging on a common meeting place.\\"At this point, I am tempted a create a graph of this spoked circle of varied study, with God at its center, because to know anything truly, God must be at the core. Another picture of this is that to know anything truly, God must be at its foundation; the subject must be approached from a Biblical, Truthful worldview as its basis.This leads well into a final quote, which will also serve as a fit conclusion:\\"The man without some such equipment, is in the intellectual universe, like the traveler who easily falls into skepticism through getting to know many dissimilar civilizations, and contradictory doctrines. This lack of a coherent system of ideas is one of the great misfortunes of our age. To escape it, thanks to the intellectual balance afforded by a sure body of doctrine, is an incomparable benefit.\\""},{"Title":"The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods","review":"This book would make an excellent gift for the student beginning university work and the tired student, professor, or independent researcher who needs a refresher. Sertillanges has advice for everything from being moral to staying healthy to taking good notes, all of it both persuasive and practicable.It's a good guide for scholars of every discipline, so long as they are Christian or warm to Christian ideas. Sertillanges' arguments, especially in the first chapters, rely upon premises like the unity of God's creation and the incarnation of Christ. For instance, in a section entitled \\"The Intellectual Does Not Stand Alone\\", the author says \\"Jesus Christ needs our minds for his work, as on earth He needed His own human mind; we have that measureless honor. We are His members, therefore have a share in His spirit, are therefore His cooperators\\" (pp.13-14). If you aren't Christian and/or you refuse to listen to any arguments which assume the tenets of the Christian faith are true, then this may not be the book for you.The little sample above gives an idea of Sertillanges' charming prose, and this entire book is full of captivating writing just like it. For some this book will be an edifying one-time read, but for others it can become the cornerstone for a truly fulfilling intellectual life."},{"Title":"The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods","review":"Still a very good book about:Why (a lot) and how (a little bit) to become agood thinker. Very inspiring.The original French version is available for free online(among others at www.inquisition.ca).Cheers!Stefan"},{"Title":"The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods","review":"A. G. Sertillanges (1863-1948) was a French Dominican brother who studied the moral philosophy of Thomas Aquinas, the great Catholic theologian. Sertillanges published this particular work, \\"The Intellectual Life,\\" primarily for lay Catholic readers who intend to pursue an intellectual activity as at least a part of their life's main work. His model is a short letter attributed to Aquinas that goes by the name of \\"Sixteen Precepts for Acquiring the Treasure of Knowledge,\\" and his goal is to update Aquinas's vision of intellectual work as expressed principally in this letter for a modern reader. Following Aquinas's lead, Sertillanges gives practical and theoretical guidance in the topics of the proper mode of living for an intellectual and the moral and intellectual framework that should underly a life devoted to study.Among the most interesting of Sertillanges' arguments is the idea that an intellectual life must be a vocation in the sense that an individual must have an inborn desire for intellectual work, and further that a personal lacking such a call will not have the will to accomplish anything in the intellectual sphere, despite perhaps possessing great intelligence or other virtues. So the first insight is that will to do and an interest in intellectual work is the first, most important qualification, and that success or failure in an intellectual occupation is mainly an issue of disposition rather than intelligence.Another principal argument is the idea that an intellectual has a moral obligation to the rest of mankind, and that this obligation demands that all intellectual work must have an eventual practical use for society. The same moral obligation also dictates that an intellectual should prefer a project that is within their ability to complete rather than another greater and perhaps more interesting project that is too large for their gifts, because a completed project does service to the world while an uncompleted work does not serve anyone.Sertillanges also argues that while we should initially develop a broad intellectual base of knowledge to build upon, a deep speciality knowledge is essential to actually understanding the world. He believes that real knowledge is always a knowledge of root causes. One cannot hope to develop this knowledge by a broad survey of many subjects, but instead by endeavoring to understand at least one subject down to the fundamentals. To know one thing is necessarily to neglect others, and a certain amount of ignorance is necessary and unavoidable for a true intellectual.Other reviewers on this site have criticized Sertillanges as being uncomfortably effusive over religious themes, and this is without a doubt a fair criticism. Additionally, many of his arguments rely on appeals to Catholic theology and morality, and it follows that readers who do not share Sertillanges' beliefs may have trouble accepting certain of his conclusions. The Catholic idea of service and good works does however adapt pretty well to a humanist paradigm, and readers who approach the work from this angle will likely be able to resolve the issue to their satisfaction.A related criticism is that most of Sertillanges' arguments are unscientific in nature, and rely more on metaphorical examples and biographical episodes than on cause and effect or logic. This criticism is harder to answer, except to say that many of Sertillanges' conclusion really have the ring of truth when contemplated in the context of one's own education experience, and seem to be effective when put into action.Aside from those qualifications, this book is the most insightful I've read on the topic of education and learning, and among the first rank of anything I've ever read. On an initial approach, many of Sertillanges' conclusions are ideas that you may feel that you have a decent understanding of already. There is, however, a significant functional difference between half-knowledge and actual knowledge, that is to say that you will get more out of an idea that you have developed to enough of a degree to trust in action as compared to another idea with which you are merely familiar. Additionally, many of Sertillanges conclusions share a counterintuitive element with the arguments I summarized above. For those reasons, I give this work my very highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods","review":"... and inspiring. iug igo k8oug ugiug iugh h jiuh i h i i i iu iu k g g"},{"Title":"The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods","review":"The practical of the book is good.The motivational, spiritual/theological relevant, the conceptual is GREAT!Sertillanges does well in speaking to the issues and reality of doing study work, reading/researching & writing/producing. He even has a section for spouses (p.43-5). The actual practical aspects of the book are worthy of a read.The special pieces of this work are what he says about \\"work\\" from the perspective of what it means as a disciple of Jesus. These comments lend themselves to any discussion of sanctification doctrine, or one's relationship with God as a believer in Jesus.It is not heavy in philosophical or theological language or quotations/citations of others, so it makes for an easier read that expected. He makes many illustrative comments as well, like little word pictures that are more inspirational in tone than simply helps (e.g. pursuing truth is like following a tributary to a river eventually finding the ocean).One comment he makes is regarding the ultimate mystery of knowledge that all people will have: no one is able to know everything, not even everything on a single subject. The absence of things said is more telling than what is said for Sertillanges, as it reveals the greatness of ultimate Truth, found only in the eternal God. So a pursuit of any truth is essentially a pursuit of God. The comment that is so wonderful is that at the end of life, the works of our life will be either as \\"straw\\" or proved \\"reward\\" in God's purifying judging holiness. This will be like \\"the silence preceding the great cry with which the whole soul will vibrate in the flood of light revealed\\" (p.142). In other words, like a great anticipation of something waited for all life, a holding of the breath, a peeringn into the blinding light of God, waiting... waiting... wondering... wanting to know, to see... and then...... I love this picture of what it will be like to come before holy, loving God finally seeing the hope of our faith, knowing truth first-hand, personally, awed and humbled and overcome with the greatness of Him!Highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods","review":"And there are plenty of maxims in this book. I missed not being able to highlight them on my Kindle, but, then again, it's just as well, since I would have highlighted half the book. My favorite may be an unattributed quote \\"He who stumbles without falling takes a bigger step forward.\\"Sertillanges outlines the nature of and the virtues needed for the intellectual life. He discusses the balance of the physical, mental, and social aspects of the intellectual life. Much of it centers on balancing the depth and breadth of focus: studying and recreation; sitting and walking, reading and looking around; learning and creating, etc.Open to any random page and you are likely to read an inspiring thought in a well-turned phrase. As I read I kept imagining one sentence after another being posted to someone's Facebook status.This is an ennobling manifesto of living a life devoted to thought."},{"Title":"The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods","review":"There are some books that have the ability to change the way you look at things, and this is one of them. Written originally back in 1921, 'The Intellectual Life' by A.G. Sertillanges O.P. is a manual for those interested in the intellectual life of study. But is is much more than that, it is a manual on how to live. The book is based upon a Thomistic framework, explaining first what the intellectual life is and why one would engage in such work. The author makes it clear that there can be no real intellectual work without virtue, being regularly engaged in prayer, and of course being in the state of grace. Discipline of the body is also expressed. One who cannot control their appetite for example makes a poor intellectual. It is extremely important to have a regular schedule in life, having the same time each day to pray, to exercise, to study, and of course fulfill your regular obligations of work and family, etc. The author even touches upon getting proper sleep, not too much, yet not too little, and even gives advice on how to make your sleep productive.The second half of the book explains how to actually engage in study. He talks about always using the methods of Saint Thomas to form one's intellectual foundation, starting first learning the basic principles of philosophy and logic. The book teaches you how to read and how to properly research the subjects you want to study. He teaches you how to take notes and how to write well. How you spend your time with others and how you engage with them is also talked about. In short, the author teaches you not really how to study or how to write as a separate work, but he teaches you what it actually means to be an intellectual in the true sense of the word. It is not something that you do, but something that you become. He teaches you how to integrate your daily work, your family life, your spiritual life and your study so that you can always be active in living \\"the intellectual life.\\" If there is one book you should read before you read any others, this is it. It has changed the way I think about life, and it is rare that a book has this effect. It has made me think about what is important in life. I am now on a mission to remove any obstacles that will keep me from achieving a well ordered life towards God, and towards my studies.The author also has another great book available titled, 'Thomas Aquinas, Scholar, Poet, Mystic, Saint'. It is an introductory book on Saint Thomas which gives a basic sketch of his life, his thought, his spirituality and his work. It is only 140 pages, but it is a great book to read along with 'The Intellectual Life.' I find it always rewarding to go back and read introductory works on Saint Thomas. There is always something to be learned from them. If you implement what these two books teach, then I believe that you will be made a better person in doing so."},{"Title":"Missionary travels and researches in South Africa: Including a sketch of sixteen years' residence in the interior of Africa, and a journey from the ... down the river Zambesi, to the eastern ocean","review":"In his book on Nile exploration, Moorehead speaks of Livingstone as possessing &quot;baraka&quot;--the quality of making everything seem better just by his presence. Livingstone's humanity and generosity of spirit illuminate this book. The details of his journey through Southern Africa are interesting and vivid, though not crammed with incident. Modern readers will be interested in Livingstone's observations on race relations in the different colonial settlements of the region.

There is a simple reason: There isn't one.Other books will defraud the reader by giving them techniques that in reality don't work. Dr Eckman pounds in one central point - that there is no one single way to detect dishonesty. He calls any belief to the contrary \\"the Brokaw Hazard,\\" named after Tom Brokaw, who believes that circumlocution is the omnipresent sentinel of a lie. He also develops the concept of the \\"Othello Error,\\" that cautions the reader against actually causing lie signals by accident (named after the literary Othello, who assumed that his wife's sobbing was for her lover, but in reality she was sobbing because of her husband's rage over the incorrectly presumed affair.). He gives many tips, including a checklist in an appendix that might help the reader to detect lies, but most of the material is embedded deep within the text. He helps the reader to develop a dynamic approach to detecting lies; approaches that are developed as detection begins. He exhorts the reader to use NUMEROUS well-defined clues to develop the case for the conclusion that someone is lying.The biggest flaw in the book is on its cover. The cover suggests that this is a practical book. It is more of a research paper. This is what makes it reliable - the fact that such a complete study is contained within. But the average reader will look for a standard protocol for detecting lies - but the Brokaw Hazard tells us there is none."},{"Title":"Telling lies: Clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage","review":"As I've said in my other reviews, I am not Susan Gill, I'm her son.Dr. Ekman's work on lie detection has been getting a lot of attention lately, due to the fact his science is regularly practiced on Fox's new show Lie to me. The producers even asked him to be their scientific consultant and have put on a quite impressive display of how effective Ekman's study really is.Alright, first off, the problems. Dr. Ekman has a notorious habit in the entire book for stating that his science is, \\"inconclusive\\" and \\"still has a lot of faults\\" and that he\`s not sure about this, or that. In other words, he tries to come off like there is no real way of knowing if his science works or not, and if it\`s a real practical way of catching deciet. This is mostly because he focuses on \\"deception clues\\" instead of \\"deception leakage\\" which are two entirely different things to look for in a person when looking for deceit (don't worry he describes both in detail, although deception clues in more detail). But the truth is, it does work, and it works very effectively when used correctly. The reason he keeps saying it's inconclusive is because he wrote well over half of this book in \`85, way back when he didn't have funds for research on his study. However, if you get the updated version to \`01 or even better \`08, then he begins to write that his work is much more conclusive than before, and that using facial reading with body language, you are well over 90 % accurate in your lie detection (and concealed emotions reading) ability.One more complaint that I have is that it seems he shouldn't have written the book himself. It can be a very tough read at points, sometimes having so many technical terms it's hard to keep up, so if you're looking for really easy reading, this book isn't for you. Also, he seems to neglect certain findings that he makes and doesn't give them as much detail as he should sometimes (i.e. mouth shrugs and one sided shoulder shrugs). Another thing he doesn't give enough attention to is (oddly enough) his main point of research, the face. He gives great detail on the body, voice, and words for lying, but when it came to the face, he didn't give hardly any detail on the seven universal emotions. Instead, he gives greater detail to different smiles a person can make, and what each of them could mean (valuable, of course, but that won't tell you if they're lying). For the most part, though, he gives great detail on most of the important things.Now, for the positive aspects.If the hard reading doesn't bother you, and you're as committed as I was when it comes to lie detection, then this book is completely worth your time. Dr. Ekman may have a hard time writing out what he means, but you always seem to understand the important things when he does write about them. He includes many things that are not in the show Lie to Me like the difference between \\"manipulators\\" and \\"illustrators\\". He also gives the three reasons why people can fail in their lies, and even has an entire (long) chapter on the use of the polygraph and his science. This chapter can be useful, because it gives you ideas on where to start with your questions for the liars. Using the \\"Guilty Knowledge Test\\" is an example of something you can use to your advantage when questioning a liar. These questions may be meant for use with the polygraph, but as Ekman's science proposes, a person using his techniques (I believe) are much more accurate at lie detection than the polygraph.One thing I should mention is the fact that Ekman states in his book that people look in the wrong places for lie detection, and that those places are the face and words. Although words are obviously the wrong place to look for deception leakage, the face however, is not. A person's face may be able to lie about certain things (and I realize that certain people get the wrong clues from the face), but he tells you the signs to look for in the face that reveals a false expression, and later goes on to state that looking for micro-expressions alone for lie detection is 70 % accurate on it's own, so the face is actually the first place you should look (hence why he reprinted this book so many times).Ekman also gives the right impression by saying \\"there is no actual sign of lying itself\\". The truth is, there isn't. You may wonder how his science works then, but really all you're looking for is signs of emotion that are out of place, or contradictions between the face and body that don't match the words. Most of the time, you need to investigate certain emotions a person gives, because, if you don't, you could commit the \\"Othello Error\\" or even the \\"Brokaw Hazard\\" (which are in detail in his book).All in all, this book is very good at describing his lie detection science. As long as you pick out what is conclusive from his books, then you should have no problem figuring out his lie detection techniques. Watching Lie to Me is a great way at spotting his more conclusive stuff, and figuring out what's what in his book. Not only that, but it's a great excuse for watching the show. My only advice is to get two other books if you're interested in lie detection. Ekman's other book Emotions Revealed is totally focused on the face, and even has an extra chapter on lying that can be quite useful. The third book is actually a book totally devoted to body language called The Definitive Book on Body Language by Allan and Barbara Pease. It gives you some bases for negative body language and also has a chapter on body language and lying, but it's mostly a bunch of different manipulators. However, the book is good, nevertheless, because the information on those manipulators is valuable to most lie detecting, and that's something Ekman never really focused on. Of course, it gives much more information than that, and all of it is useful.So if you're interested in being thorough for lie detection, buy this book, and the two other books I listed. You can't go wrong between these three amazing books. Just make sure you get the most updated version of this book (And to be sure and watch Lie to Me for better distinguishing Ekman's conclusive work! you can watch episodes on [...]***EDITED NOTES***Just so you all know, I have a new reccomended Body language book for you all.

The references to marriage, politics and the marketplace are just anecdotical and non substantial to the book.I am not saying that the book is not interesting.

Made popular by the Fox TV show \\"Lie to Me,\\" this book documents the line of research used, not only by the show, but by Secret Service, police, jealous spouses and a host of others who want to be better at detecting lies. New material includes how to identify the facial expressions indicating that someone is likely to become violent.Ekman points out that we often look for the wrong things when trying to detect deception. Even much of the information he has reviewed in training materials for job interviewers, jury selection, and other deception detection professionals is just plain wrong. The hard part about lying effectively is not concealing information, it is concealing the emotions the liar feels while lying. Guilt, fear and even the \\"duping delight\\" a clever liar feels when getting away with a falsehood can provide clues obvious to a trained observer. While Ekman acknowledges the value of verbal slips and body language cues, his research reveals the greater value of focusing on facial expressions, particularly \\"microexpressions\\" that are displayed and quickly concealed. He teaches readers to identify and interpret them.Some of the interesting points the book makes as it teaches us to catch liars in the act:- We should avoid the \\"Brokaw Hazard\\" of assuming someone is lying because their speech seems evasive or convoluted. Some people just speak this way, lying or not.- We should also avoid the \\"Othello Error\\" of branding someone a liar because of fidgety behavior, such as repeatedly touching themselves or adjusting their clothing. They may be uncomfortable, but are not necessarily lying.- Emotions such as anger, fear, sadness, disgust, distress, happiness, contentment, excitement, surprise and contempt are conveyed by distinct facial expressions, common across all cultures.- Deception detection is most effective by someone who is familiar with a possible liar's usual behavior and can notice deviations from it.Paul Ekman's book is recommended for anyone interested in detecting lying. It is a rough read in some places for a popular book, but is far more readable that the journal articles we would need to read without it. Forgive the author his writing style and learn some valuable lessons about his area of expertise."},{"Title":"Telling lies: Clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage","review":"The book is fascinating, to say the least. I think people need to take a &quot;realistic approach&quot; to applying the knowledge acquired by reading the book. My one big fault with the book is that whoever actually &quot;wrote&quot; the book is terrible with regard to constructing sentences and expressing ideas! I had to read some things twice in order to make sure I was receiving the information as intended. Dr. Ekman needs to invest in a professional writer who can more clearly express his thoughts, intents and ideas. Hard reading and unneccesarily so!"},{"Title":"Telling lies: Clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage","review":"This book has lots of important information, not the least of which is to correct many misconceptions about signs of deceitfulness and the distinction between signs of anxiety and signs of deceit.Ekman does a good job of defining important categories of non-verbal behavior and correlating increases or decreases in each of the categories with different emotional states. However, the specific facial changes associated with genuine versus feigned emotional expression identified in this book offers nothing new.I particularly liked the author's narrative style. It was reminiscent of accounts written by 19th Century scientists who were trying to discover fundamental principles by observing natural phenomena and describing them in careful, objective language. The bonus to the reader is the raw data provided with specific conditions carefully and objectively described. The studies employ ingenious designs to elicit desired emotion and, because of the detailed description, allow the reader to formulate hypotheses and draw conclusions -- some of which may differ from those of the author.Much of the information about deceitfulness presented here is just common sense, but Ekman does a good job of categorizing this information and presents well-described objective data from which his conclusions are drawn."},{"Title":"Telling lies: Clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage","review":"Being a big fan of the Fox TV show \\"Lie to Me\\" I had high hopes for this book. While the book does tell some interesting stories and information about deception, it fails to provide key information, such as good photos of the seven universal expressions. The book has a very few, small, poor quality photos with no baseline (expression-free) photos. This is especially disappointing given how the book reveals that some subtle expressions can only be detected by measuring slight changes in certain facial muscles.I was also troubled by the way earlier chapters did not appear to have been edited at all - all subsequent versions offered were additional chapters. For example, there was a reference \\"as I write these words, the [Reagan] White House has revised its proposal about the use of polygraph and Congress will begin hearings on it next week.\\" No further information was provided of what came of it, or subsequent polygraph usage guidelines or laws.In summary, the book offers some interesting background on the science, but not much to help one detect lies."},{"Title":"Telling lies: Clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage","review":"Dr. Ekman's books, including this definitive text, have no doubt become more popular recently due to the success of the TV show \\"Lie To Me.\\" Having been a fan of his work for years, I was very pleased when I heard a show would be made about this field. I now try to watch the show every week as a way of continuing my education on non-verbal communication (accompanied, of course, by Dr. Ekman's blog on the Fox website, where he describes the real science behind each episode).It's interesting to read the many reviews here that describe the writing in \\"Telling Lies\\" as boring or repetitive. I wouldn't be surprised if many of those people bought this book thinking they were going to read a popular science text, something with the fictional character Cal Lightman's wit, or that would at least reference the TV series.In fact, this book was written before \\"Lie To Me\\" was conceived, and wasn't originally written to be a popular science book, so it's a bit unfair to expect that from it. From what I understand, this book was originally written in the 1980s and was intended for government departments and employees (Secret Service, CIA, FBI, etc.).And when you're writing to branches of big brother, certain stereotypes apply. The now-cliched mantra, \\"tell them what you're going to say, say it, then tell them what you said,\\" is diligently adhered to on small and large scales in this book. Each chapter in the book follows the rule, and each paragraph within each chapter also follows the rule. The same examples are repeatedly referred to throughout the book to provide continuity, and easily referenced talking points are created via the use of simple phrases like \\"Brokaw hazard\\" and \\"Othello error.\\" Jargon is a part of science, and that most popular science books only use it rarely merely speaks to the fact that they're trying to make the science more accessible to a public with a short attention span. In this case, Ekman wrote a book for a not-so-public group of non-scientists who stereotypically need to have something repeated many times in many different ways in order to be convinced of its veracity.It's good to be aware of this before buying the book -- if Ekman had written these chapters as academic papers, he could have said the same thing in a quarter of the page count, though each page would have taken longer to read -- but it's not a reason not to buy the book. Dr. Ekman is still one of the leading scientists, if not the leading scientist, in the field of detection deception, and this book is essentially a reference manual. It even has helpful charts and tables in the appendices, and the chapters have been appended as new versions have come out. (Like a true scientist, Ekman typically adds to his text, leaving the old text and then describing changes in the field, instead of making it look like it was originally written with all the answers.)One thing that is maddening from a layperson's perspective, but refreshing from a scientist's perspective, is the way that Dr. Ekman equivocates when describing the strength of his scientific findings. It may be more comforting to hear that someone has a definitive answer, even when they don't, but you shouldn't expect that from this book. As a scientist who studies the truth for a living, it would be hypocritical for Dr. Ekman to exaggerate his conclusions. After you finish this book, you will know exactly the extent to which you can trust a polygraph, as well as the ways you can't. You'll know how likely you are to make an error in your attempts as a \\"human lie detector\\" (a phrase Ekman would not approve of), and you'll know each of the possible errors you can make, along with their consequences.Sure, you may not have a lot of laugh-out-loud moments along the way, and this book may never become a talking point for the general public the way that Stephen Hawking's books have, but by reading this book you will learn a large amount of extremely valuable and verified information. That, simply, is why I gave this book five stars.Incidentally, I agree with the other reviewer who recommended Navarro's book \\"What Every Body Is Saying,\\" and I think that book is complementary to \\"Telling Lies.\\" Navarro's book is much more pop-science-like, whereas this book is more truly scientific, and they also discuss different things. My advice? Buy both, and since this book *came* first, read it first."},{"Title":"Telling lies: Clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage","review":"We live in a world of emotions, and as much as we'd love to understand them all, Telling Lies: Clues to Deceit in the Marketplace, Politics, and Marriage by Paul Ekman tells us that it's never fully possible to know, but gives us just what the title promises. The only way this book will be the magic answer to telling lies from truth is properly applying thorough science to the facts presented within it.I honestly looked into this book due to my appreciation of the television show based on Paul Ekman's findings, but the methods for reading body language and looking for micro-expressions are just as sound in text as they are in hour-long episodes. Anyone can learn the clues to deception leakage, the difference between falsifying and concealment, and what a flash of a scowl means before a smile. What the book preaches more than the basics of the science is how to apply it carefully, and that is the most important lesson it teaches. In a way, Dr. Lightman from the television series is an extreme example of the applied methods, going big with himself to get a real reaction instead of letting natural situations over a long period of time bring about the same results.There are very few to no situations where, from a single glance, a person can assess the situation as a whole from one shoulder shrug or micro-expression. Everything is a clue, and only piecing together the clues with logical analysis and further investigation reveal the truth behind the situation. Most of the time, one will never apply this science to daily interactions with the people in one's life, and that thought's encouraged within the book. Becoming a human lie detector and attacking all signs of deceit is not part of good investigation. The most important aspect I took from the book is knowing the science in case there's a need for it in your life, such as a major business deal or buying a used car. Don't scrutinize every aspect of life, because there's a reason lies exist."},{"Title":"Telling lies: Clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage","review":"This book takes a great many words to say very little.

The first, the study of a woman who tried to lie to get out of a mental hospital in order to kill herself and the second of some nursing students who lied about watching some gory videos. The third was about a women who was subconsciously giving an interviewer the finger.

Weaver II, Ph.D.Telling lies is a book that everyone can read: expert and layman alike. There is no sophisticated vocabulary, scientific terminology, or eloquent theoretical discourses. If you are looking for a specific formula, exact template, or reliable protocol that can be used to investigate or detect liars, this book will serve little purpose because there is no such system. However, if you are looking for a catalog of the wide variety of cues that liars manifest (e.g., words, voice, facial cues, or body), and the results of numerous scientific studies on lying, and examples from politics, sales/business, government, and everyday life that reveal the various cues, this is a delightful, well-written book.The narrative form that Ekman uses is interesting and engaging. What led me to this book in the first place was some recent research on lying. As reported by Benedict Carey, \\"Judging Honesty By Words, Not Fidgets,\\" in The New York Times (May 12, 2009, p. D1), he writes, \\"In part, the work grows out of a frustration with other methods. Liars do not avert their eyes in an interview on average any more than people telling the truth do, researchers report; they do not fidget, sweat or slump in a chair any more often. They may produce distinct, fleeting changes in expression, experts say, but it is not clear yet how useful it is to analyze those.\\" The study, according to Carey, draws \\"on work by Dr. Vrij and Dr. Marcia K. Johnson of Yale, among others,\\" and was conducted by \\"Dr. Colwell and Dr. Cheryl Hiscock-Arisman of National University in La Jolla, California. [They] have developed an interview technique that appears to help distinguish a tall tale from a true one.\\" The actual interview technique is not as important as the conclusion: \\"People telling the truth tend to add 20 to 30 percent more external detail than do those who are lying.\\" When liars concoct their prepared deceitful script, it is tight and lacking in detail, whereas those without a deceitful, previously prepared script, recall more extraneous detail and may even make mistakes. \\"They are sloppier,\\" say the researchers. The researchers point out that their interview, content-based approach does not apply to individual facts, may be poorly suited for those who have been traumatized and not interested in talking, and it is not likely to flag someone who changes one small but crucial detail in a story.The point is that in the interview, content-based approach, those who seek to detect lies are not looking for specific nonverbal or verbal clues; they are looking more holistically at content. This \\"new\\" science is evolving fast says Carey."},{"Title":"Telling lies: Clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage","review":"This work by Paul Ekman is absolutely fascinating. It is amazing that more than 65% of human communication occurs without speaking a word!!! Although Mr. Ekman writes in a detail oriented manner, the information he provides is astounding.

Anyone writing about deceit and emotions must address Ekman's observations, just as a writer on gravity must mention Galileo.The book recounts facts. Ekman ventures on theory no more than absolutely necessary. In this sense, \\"Telling Lies\\" endures. New information and new theories could debunk Ekman only by finding his experiments irreproducible or by finding contradictions in their implications.The downside is that some parts of the book are truly dull reading. The chapters begin with interest, but several of them steer into a sea of detail I wearied of navigating. In three chapters, I skipped over large portions to the last few paragraphs and then on to the next chapter. I found the historical examples in international diplomacy quite interesting.

The term micro-expressions describes communications that we share with others that are outside of our control. Because they are involuntary, they are one of the purest communications and the reading of these body language messages reveals our truthfulness or deceitfulness. It is absolutely one of the most fascinating excursions I have ever taken. Thank you Dr. Ekman."},{"Title":"Telling lies: Clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage","review":"I write this for two reasons. Firstly, to critique some of the lower graded reviews, not for the purpose of debasing them but to inform them. And second, to speak to the layperson about interpersonal communications.As any individual who has worked within or studied psychology would tell, causality treads along a thin line. Ekman notes, astutely, that there exists no one invariable indication of deceit. Instead, deciphering the likelihood of deception's occurrence need be done cumulatively. In other words, by tallying the indicators we seek to be more founded and closer to certainty, prior to making an accusation. This is so because research into confirmatory bias has shown that once we've become convicted in our beliefs, no matter what those beliefs may be, distancing from them to at least consider an alternative, becomes extremely difficult if not nearly impossible. This results in the proverbial, false-positive. There must always be room for doubt; room for the .01% possibility that we might be misguided. Certainty becomes foolishness, otherwise. Indeed, it seems to be human nature to seek affirmation. But the individual, who expects to read this book and take from it a surefire method of detecting deception, would be reading it for the wrong reason. To do so requires the utmost of critical thinking. And Ekman promotes this cautionary tell eloquently.When talking to someone who, for example, we are unsure of the plausibility of their accounts, to test it we must work deductively. Via an exclusionary line of reasoning, one seeks to locate the more possible explanation by weeding out the lesser. This book, in my opinion, was written to make the reader think and to challenge any preexisting notions one might have about what denotes lying. It was meant to reform our mentality in approach to being more observant and cognizant of just how multifaceted lies often are. Uprooting a lie is difficult. And if we go about it haphazardly, we run the risk of throwing our observations askew; making them mean something they do not. Outside of being clairvoyant--hopefully you do not think that you are--we can never know why, because the reasons why are wholly subjective. Short of eliciting a confession of sorts, I mean to say, we cannot know precisely why someone might be lying, or if they truly are. And to hastily jump to the conclusion lying has taken place, then all else that person we suspect of lying may say, would, to us, be tainted, whether they are being truthful or not.I highly recommend this book, highly. It was well composed and cited some prominent historical examples, detailing how some of the most incisive people in human existence have been fooled and lied on the grandest of stages. As a guidebook for exploring the realm of deception, there can be none better than this book. I can only look forward to Ekman publishing some more of this type of splendid material."},{"Title":"Telling lies: Clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage","review":"If you're looking for a surefire, foolproof signature of deception, then do not read this book. Read the dozens of others mouthwatering books on the market that make such promises. You will remain the naive, overconfident person who believes he can detect a lie better than most. You will not grow, improve, or learn anything except misinformation (if you read other books on the subject).One of the fascinating points he makes is that people who watch only the body of the liar, without hearing the words, do the best at detecting a lie...about 65% success.. The most accurate judges of deceit (who could identify 85% of the liars) were highly experienced psychotherapists with reputations for being expert clinicians.The machines sold that are supposed to detect lies by analyzing the voice do no better than chance, but that hasn't affected sales.Most people pay the most attention to what is the least trustworthy source of deception-words. More reliable sources are facial expressions and voice (taken in comparison and contrast with the words spoken).This reminds me of how most people are more persuaded by a moving anecdote than a research study of thousands of people, even though the latter is far more reliable a source for drawing conclusions and controlling for confounding factors."},{"Title":"Telling lies: Clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage","review":"I find it hard to fathom all the 5 star reviews of this book, regrettably I'm forced to give it 2 stars. Firstly I will acknowledge that the book does contain a lot of useful information, but having said that the book does have a number of serious flaws- The writing style is quite dull and academic and takes forever to make a point- Most of the book was written in the early 80s, only a couple of more recent chapters have been tacked on to the end. There would have obviously been a substantial amount of research done since the 80s either confirming or refuting some of his conclusions. If I read an academic text whose references were mostly from the 80s or earlier I wouldn't give it any credence. There is no reason this book should be judged any differently.- The author uses the same tedious examples over and over, namely Hitler deceiving Neville Chamberlain, the suicidal patient Mary deceiving her Doctors (don't worry she doesn't die), Ruth's telephone conversation with her lover from the Novel 'Marry Me' etc. After reading a few chapters I got so sick of them. I started to pray that he would introduce some better anecdotes. The most annoying thing is that many of his examples about deception are actually from works of fiction !?- The author makes up terms for things like 'Brokaw Hazard' that I just found irritatingYou probably don't need to read the book, it's main ideas can be summarized something like 'Some people are bad liars, but many people are good liars. Some people are good at detecting lies, but the vast majority aren't. While there may be some clues when people are telling lies, these clues are not reliable indications of deception, in practice most people are very poor at detecting lies. Even learning all the material in this book, you probably won't get much of an edge in lie detection. The idea that you can become a skilled detector of deception is false'I haven't read any other books in this area, but I would be very wary of any book that promised to turn you into some kind of 'human lie detector'."},{"Title":"Telling lies: Clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage","review":"Paul Ekman dives deep within the recesses of the human psyche to uncover the truth and meaning behind lying.

And the long chapter on polygraphs (which I thought I'd end up merely flipping through) wound up being the most interesting section of the book, with much of it still relevant for today. The real-life historical examples (Hitler/Chamberlain, Watergate figures, murderers, and philanderers)used throughout work much better than the lies and liars he provides from literature (Updike, Shakespeare, and others). A later edition with actual photos of micro-expressions instead of the sparse pencil drawings contained in this edition will prove much more useful. A MUST-HAVE on the shelf of any sideline-psychologist."},{"Title":"Telling lies: Clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage","review":"I purchased this for my son that has gotten into psychiatric philosophies and human behavior.

You too can learn to be a human lie detector and tell when your spouse,children,Boss or anybody else is try to decieve you or lie to you by watching their facial expressions and body language.These are great skills to have and I think it gives you a better advantage in all situations to be able to see what people are really telling you with their faces and posture.

This book is the science behind Lie to Me. From breaking the law to breaking a promise, how do people lie and how can they be caught. It digs deep into the research behind the theories and introduces the reader to work Ekman done with the Secret Service, FBI, CIA etc... If you want to know with more accuracy who is \\"full of it\\" and who is telling the truth then this is the book to read.I did a review of this book with some interesting extracts of information on my blog located here:[...]"},{"Title":"Telling lies: Clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage","review":"For anyone interested in detecting lies in the marketplace, politics, and marriage: this is the last book you should buy. Slight exaggeration aside, there are probably 3 semi-valuable pages in this book.Ekman spends about 275 pages trying to convince you that even if you believe someone is lying, you might be wrong...or, actually, you may be right...The entire book is a dizzying succession of tautologies. He is so scared that you will read his hypotheses (which are of no practical value - who can spot a \\"micro-expression\\" without buying his $50 software and training on it for a month?) and accuse an innocent person of lying (or vice versa) that he has rendered this book useless. If you are a masochist and are interested in reading a book where an insecure researcher talks to himself for hundreds of pages, by all means buy this book.There IS a reliable protocol for detecting lies, and there are at least a couple of books that I know of that go over it in detail, in less than 200 pages."},{"Title":"Telling lies: Clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage","review":"Not the best read, but a very interesting topic and another way of analyzing human behavior."},{"Title":"Telling lies: Clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage","review":"I enjoy reading this book.

He could easily include too much medical training/lingo, but he avoids it well. His methods are easy to follow and reveal the steps he used to come up with his conclusions. He even includes the information that seemed to contradict his conclusions, but explains his thoughts on it all. He also invites others to review his work and critique it.This book won't help you become a human lie detector. Honestly, it's just a tv show. But, it does provide additional skills that some may need when dealing with people at work, ect....I will be looking for more of his work. Fun and engaging. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Telling lies: Clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage","review":"This is the second book of his that I have read. I really enjoy his work. There is plenty of actual science to back up his claims. The writing isn't too dense nor does he go on and on about which muscle does what. The book gives you the information you need to actually begin working in this area. Plus, it gives you all the links for all of the background information if you want to explore more on your own. All in all, well done. I enjoyed it and I will be reading more of his writings in the future.P.S.It is much better than the tv show."},{"Title":"Telling lies: Clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage","review":"The whole idea of microexpressions has captured my imagination and given me insight into why a smirk looks deceitful.

I didn't get that because, as the author admits, it is not an exact science. However I did get a lot out of it knowing that there are microexpressions that, if someone is on the lookout for, they can find.I wish the case studies had been a bit more real life, or at least people we would run into every day rather than, say, the woman in the mental institution. All in all, though, I think it deserves the four stars because it opens the reader's eyes to the idea that people do lie and there are thngs to look for."},{"Title":"Telling lies: Clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage","review":"I have most of Ekman's books, everytime I have them all he writes another, but this is probably his best for the layperson.His older books are instructional, but his writing is more academic and they are sometimes a dry read. In this book Ekman shines and goes beyond simple instruction and research. Ekman provides an a fun to read analysis of the motivations and techniques of dectecting lies.The most important message of all in this book is that there is no 100% surefire way to detect lying in everyone all the time. There are methods that are 100% if the person exhibits them, but not everyone does. He is highly critical of those who are trying to sell the world on a boilerplate 100% accurate detection method. His discussion of polygraphs is riveting.I loaned this book to my daughter and she never gave it back, so that is a 10 star endorsement.This book has something for everyone and is well written."},{"Title":"Telling lies: Clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage","review":"It is by far the most informative guide to human interaction.

I was able to heal myself of numerous problems, in particular, one very bad sprain in one day instead of the usual two to three weeks of Ace bandages and ice-packs! Being an avid sportsman I understood the issues regarding pain and the usual healing process. But in this case, the healing process occurred by my following the simple instructions in the book. I now practice it regularly with similar wonderful results. I heartily recommend the book to anyone who wants to heal themselves and also to learn about how energy works and flows in and around each of us.-- Healed and Happy Reader"},{"Title":"Pranic Healing","review":"Pranic healing is truly a rare book, it's exercises work and the theory is superb. I bought it after having had years of experience doing a somewhat similar practice that I had discovered myself, it was based only on my experiences and was necessarily fragmentary, if effective. Pranic healing filled in the holes and has given me a solid manual describing some of the unseen workings of the world, a rarity. Also good is it's recognition of certain western traditions like Theosopy and AMORC as containing good information about the spirit world, even if, in my opinion, the central doctrines are very shaky. A great book, buy it, use it."},{"Title":"Pranic Healing","review":"Whether you study reiki, polarity, therapeutic touch or another modality, this is the perfect introduction book for you. Pranic healing is the term used to encompass many energy healing techniques known around the world. However, it is not initiation-based like reiki. That means you can learn to use pranic healing without the blessings from a Master.\\"Pranic Healing\\" completely covers the essentials of healing: cleansing oneself, prayer, cleaning the patient's energy body, sending energy and closing the healing session. Also are included basics of chakras, the power of words and illnesses.It includes this specific technique's way to raise energy and cleanse the practitioner: the Meditation on the Two Hearts, a short 5-minute meditation to do before healing that opens up the heart center and blesses the healer for healing work. However, I should add that these techniques are very powerful and, like any spiritual work, they could cause issues in the heart center and even in the body itself. The help of a psychic or shaman may then be needed if difficulties arise. Overall, an excellent guide if precautions are taken to use it well."},{"Title":"Pranic Healing","review":"This book gives an excellent introduction to Pranic healing. Author gives good background information on the concepts of Prana and chakras. Next couple of chapters talk about the various Pranic healing techniques and how to heal some diseases. The chapter on &quot;Meditation of twin hearts&quot; gives very good information on the technique. I prefer to use a companion audio tape to practice the meditation. This books is an excellent introductory and reference book on Pranic healing techniques. For more advanced information, read &quot;Advanced Pranic healing&quot; and &quot;Pranic Psychotherapy&quot; by the same author. They give more detailed infomation on healing illnesses. I highly recommend the Meditation of twin hearts to achieve relaxation and good health."},{"Title":"Pranic Healing","review":"This is a fantastic book.

Migael Scherer's tales of the bears, the dangers of the wild, the water and weather obstacles, the pleasures of living aboard, and her efforts to wrestle with her own ghosts from a brutal rape and the loss of a close friend to cancer - create a carefully woven story that draws to the heroine's conclusion as the race comes to a close.The analogies she draws between the bears, from Indian lore and her observations are wonderful - as is her experience of living in Alaska. We can't all get up there, but from the wonderful telling of her adventure, we can get close to the real southern Alaska environment. Both my wife and I enjoyed Migaels' insights into the sail regatta.It's a very gentle adventure that's either an easy weekend read, or can be enjoyed over many a drizzly evening in Seattle.

Well, not really, the caractures are fictional but the plot is not. It's the story of a young man living in Denmark during world war II and the German occupation. He, like almost all of the youth in the country, becomes part of the &quot;resistance&quot;. The resistance is responcible for doing almost everything possible to irratate, or in some cases kill, the Germans. They were responcible for everything from illegal newspapers to factory bombings. The hero must face death of friends and the terrible feeling that he is responcible for his fathers fate. Nathaniel Benchley has obvioulsy spent a great deal of time on reserch, as this book is almost a resource for information on World War II.

Each episode is followed by a two page summary of the particular skill needed to meet the challenge. Each book has a useful bibliography to guide the reader to more detail where desired and a suite of Appendices covering further details on key aspects of skill.There is naturally some overlap between the books, but each is valuable in its own right and the set combine to provide a thoughtful, practical and readily referenced guide to the key elements in the human side of management and leadership.The Tao of Coaching deals with such skills as eliciting and giving feedback, diagnosing the styles of individuals, taking account of the skill and will of the coachee and techniques of motivating (subsequently expanded into a book of its own)."},{"Title":"The Tao of Coaching: Boost Your Effectiveness at Work by Inspiring and Developing Those Around You","review":"Max Landsberg succeeds in translating the essentials of coaching into a simple story and a few tables and graphics.

Having spotted this book at an airport bookshop I read it on the plane. I put its suggestions into place, starting from the front of the book, and worked my way through the chapters as they were appropriate. I had it on my desk for the entire 4-month study. It bought immediate results for the team, and me by achieving greater cohesion of energy yet releasing greater diversity of thought especially during the inductive phase of the study. During the deductive stages it helped us focus on a team-based outcome without leaving people out of the decision-making process that had to be managed to a schedule. I firmly believe that without this book we would not have achieved the results we did - the pressure was intense and teams have a tendency to blow themselves apart after the final report is in. The team would not have continued to work as a coherent whole on subsequent phases of my study. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs to lead a high performance team.

The kind of communication Dr. Rosen suggests that parents use takes care, thought, and time, but does not require a graduate degree. Rather, it simply requires a lovingparent. It takes a good deal of the &quot;mystique&quot; out of formal counseling when the issues are garden variety issues of growing up."},{"Title":"TLC: Talking Listening Connecting","review":"I thought I knew everything there is to know about working with kids, because I work with them everyday as a School Adjustment Counselor and I am the parent of three children spanning all ages. This book STILL gave me great ideas on how to communicate (and even have great, close relationships!) with kids in SIMPLE, DIRECT language. Using ideas that all therapists know, this book really helps you navigate the very tough waters of raising a child in this day and age, STEP BY STEP. Common sense solutions to all kinds of issues such as teasing, bullying, peer pressure, discipline... it's all here for parents and even teachers. I also used some of the ideas with my classroom groups, because it is very &quot;value-based&quot;, meaning that Dr. Rosen was not afraid to touch on character development as well - so important in this time when we are all trying hard to raise the next generation of responsible, healthy and well-adjusted kids.

From the war to the depression to simply the life at Jalna running the orchard each character never steps outside of themselves even for a minute. No matter what type of person you are, or who you are there is going to be at least one character you sympathize with.Also the writing is flawless. Roche had this incredible way of describing settings and characters. She never over described anything but gave the house and those inside a whimsical feeling that makes the reader feel as though they are there and share in the experience.I know the series is out of print now, but look for them at your library or buy used copies, but if you are a fan of family sagas you won't want to miss this one."},{"Title":"The master of Jalna","review":"This is not a stand alone read. You really need to be into the whole Jalna epic to enjoy this book. Who is Renny? How did he grow into the man he is?

I'm a total Jalna fan of more than 30 years, so have to give the 5 star rating."},{"Title":"The master of Jalna","review":"This book is one in a series of 16 books. It is about the Whiteoak family and their Canadian home called Jalna. The family is unique, and the series takes you through several generations.

I read the series when I was in my twenties and am reading it again in my 70's. It grows on you. Just be sure you read the books in order as it is so much fun to see the members of the family grow up, have successes and failures, marry and divorce, travel, and have adventures on the Jalna property... you rejoice at their successes, and you mourn with the family when members die.

The concepts are definitely not supported by science.The front part of the brain has nothing to do with extraversion. That area has to do with conceptual thinking. Extraversion can be guided by both conceptual and perceptual thinking. Extraversion has mostly to do with the activation areas of the brain stem, not any of the various functionalities of the cortex.The right side of the brain is not the primary area for perceiving. The perceptual lobes are located on both sides of the brain in the posterior areas.I could go on, but it's just more of the same. It's as if the author had a preconceived notion that somehow a mapping of brain function would support MBTI theory (a totally different model, based on Jungian psychology and which predates 99.9% of what has been discovered about the brain) and tried to force-fit a superficial understanding of the brain to fit his theory.

He seems to be their savior but Mary cannot bring herself to trust him and modern civilization is a very long way off.This book raises important questions about the supposed superiority of Western civilization over 'native' cultures, and the supposed inferiority of 'colored' people. It also illustrates the terrible misunderstandings that can result when people of different cultures meet.This book was published in 1959 and it is important to realize that Australia has changed a great deal since then. Non-English speaking Aboriginals who have never had contact with white people are definitely a thing of the past, and were very rare even in 1959. Beyond the fact of a plane crash the author has not given any indication of the time in which the story is set."},{"Title":"Working Class Hero: Memoirs of a Providence Fireman","review":"Lt.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Managing Your Documentation Projects","review":"Joanne Hackos is widely acknowledged as a leading authority on technical publications management, largely because (a) she has some good things to say and (b) her _Managing Your Documentation Projects_ is one of the few books on the topic. This book offers some valuable insights about basic project management, but tries to shoehorn publications project management into a particular software development methodology -- Carnegie-Mellon's Capabilities &amp; Maturity Model. Hackos acknowledges her debt to CMM and warns that trying to implement the model described in this book is tough sledding if the development organization is not using CMM.After 20 years as a technical writer and publications manager, I've come to believe that all publications lifecycle systems are doomed unless they map directly to the development methodology engineering management supports and uses.(I've also come to believe that most development methodologies are more often than not honored in the breach.)If, as a publications manager, you're not aware of the development methodology your engineering managers have adopted, you need to get over and talk to them now. Even if they haven't adopted a formal, academic model, they do have some idea about how they produce technical products. Tailor your publications lifecycle to their lifecycle -- don't seek to impose an alien &quot;order&quot; on their process.(If your engineering managers can't articulate a methodology or say things like &quot;We just code until we're done&quot;, you have bigger worries than your publications lifecycle, such as the near-term viability of your company.)Too often I've seen tech pubs managers adopt the &quot;Hackos model&quot; and fail because it doesn't fit the organization's development style. A organization that adopts the Rapid Application Development (RAD) or &quot;Extreme Programming&quot; model, for example, isn't going to be too thrilled about endless sign-offs on planning documents that take nearly as long to write as the manual itself.Instead, tailor your approach toward the high degree of interactivity inherent in such methods -- quick review cycles of small portions of text, for example, instead of waiting for a full draft of the book to be ready.Too many erstwhile pubs managers skim this book, then adopt the project documents provided as models in the book as &quot;fill-in-the-blank&quot; busywork for their writers.Tech pubs managers might be better served by learning the basics of project management (especially the interplay between resources, time, and scope) and reviewing the development model of the engineering organization than adopting the CMM-inspired approach Hackos describes in this book.There is no one-size-fits-all method for producing documentation. And Joanne Hackos would be the first to tell you that."},{"Title":"Managing Your Documentation Projects","review":"Any technical writer seeking to move into the upper levels of the profession will find that \\"Managing Your Documentation Projects\\" is one of the most useful books to read. I agree with other reviewers' comments about the dreadful illustrations and the problems one would have putting the entire bulky method into place in many technical environments. Many of the sample conversations Hackos includes as examples of what can happen when the process is applied are almost unintentionally ironic.However, my experience is that the process and information that Hackos offers in this book will give you some of the tools you need to land a senior-level position. As Hackos herself writes, the ideas and material she offers are there for you to use, to try out, to modify so that they fit the requirements of your particular environment.Some readers may be a bit put off by Hackos' focus on planning and delivering print publications. I have found that the ideas are flexible enough to transfer to different media. The important thing is to use project management for technical communications projects.There is considerable ongoing debate within the technical writing profession as to the value of process and planning for the work. One argument is that process and planning takes us away from our real work and provides a convenient excuse when projects do not progress as required. Proponents of this idea often say something like, \\"Shut up and write.\\" Another side holds that careful analysis and planning are integral parts of our work and we cannot succeed without a defined process. I find that a lot of high-tech companies are looking for process. They know that they need structure to produce quality products in a predictable, reliable way.One caution worth noting, as Hackos herself advises, is that the model would have to be modified extensively to work in a Rapid Application Development (RAD) environment. Another caution is always to remember that the method is not the goal. At times, it is more important to produce documentation than it is to revise the project management materials to keep up with the latest twist or turn in a project.I recommend \\"Managing Your Documentation Projects\\" for technical writers looking to move ahead in their careers. It is a bit pricey, but I think that many people would find it money well spent."},{"Title":"Managing Your Documentation Projects","review":"I have very mixed feelings about this book. Clearly Hackos has a tremendous amount of experience and has seen many successful projects from start to finish. Nonetheless, I'm troubled by the length of the book and the heavy reliance on project management methodologies from other disciplines. Hackos has correctly recognized that a documentation project has to be broken into stages, and the stages she suggests are (pretty) good. But the sheer number of deliverables produced in each phase is overwhelming. By bombarding developers with doc deliverables (information plans, content specifications, etc.) during the development cycle, you risk becoming the ninny on your software project--or more precisely, the schoolmarm. And that, I think, is what bothers me about this book in general: the schoolmarmish tone that resurfaces throughout. There is just too much detail.Hackos is correct to suggest that writers must establish better rapport with developers. I think the way to do that, however, is to get closer to real development methodologies (rather than writing methodologies) that are gaining steam today. (Best example: Rational Software's Unified Process.) If the profession is ever to get the respect it deserves, technical writers will have to become more like programmers, and less like English teachers."},{"Title":"Managing Your Documentation Projects","review":"Hackos book is often extolled as the universal Bible of technical documentation. However, in reality many of her methods are impossible to implement and unrealistic. Hackos has a very traditional view of the tech pubs department. A view that is rapidly disappearing. The real world of tech writing is considerably muddier and dynamic. Last-minute changes and chaos are more often the norm than people want to accept.Hackos book is a good place to get ideas to help define your own methods and practices. However, most of the ideas here are absurd and time consuming. Attempting to implement all her methods would quickly turn a tech pubs department into a mire of bureaucracy and unnecessary work.As somebody who thinks developing documentation processes and extensive planning are often used as an excuse to avoid the real work of tech writing (namely *writing*), my bias is pretty obvious. Personally, I think many tech writers use Hackos' book as justification for wasting time building meaningless documentation processes when they should be out there talking to engineers, writing text, and designing graphics.However, there are some good ideas in here. If need some basic guidelines for completing documentation projects, this isn't a bad place to pick them up."},{"Title":"Managing Your Documentation Projects","review":"This is an excellent source for documentation managers. I was thrust into a managing role after 1.5 years as a technical writer. This book really helped me make a mole hill out of a mountain. My only complaint is the extranious graphics/illustrations (which offer no profound insight or information). These graphics may add white space, making the book less intimidating to the green reader, but this is a specialized topic for a specialized audience, which doesn't need such pedestrian graphics. If you can learn to ignore the illustrations and stick to the content (which is excellent, by the way), this book will help you get a grip on managing documentation."},{"Title":"Managing Your Documentation Projects","review":"For novice or experienced writers, this book offers more insight into good documentation processes than any other book I have read. The approach advocated by the author is applicable in any documenation development effort, be it hardware or software, commercial or mil spec. There really is something for everyone.This book focuses on the need for a solid planning effort as the basis for all major decisions. Information planning, content planning, scheduling, and resource allocation are all covered in a comprehensive and thorough manner.Throughout the book, the author chooses as an organizing principle the concept of a documentation life cycle. Thus, readers have a conceptual framework that they can use to relate what the author has written to their own experience.As well, the author classifies the stages of development of a publications group from chaos to a team capable of a managed, repeatable, and worthwhile effort that enhances the product. I have had both the misfortune and good fortune to have worked with each type of organization that the author describes. The descriptions are breathtaking in their accuracy.This book is written in a very readable style. There are numerous case studies and examples. Clearly, the author has extensive experience and has drawn upon this to provide a very useful book.This book should be on every technical writer's shelf."},{"Title":"Managing Your Documentation Projects","review":"In the perfect world, this would be THE book to have. Unfortunately, this is anything but a perfect world and this book falls short in dealing with the realities of the profession. There is too little information and guidance for those that don't have a document-centred employer.Also, the book is purely for those creating user documentation - if you write any technical material (such as requirements, design, UAT, or implmentation documents) this book will be of minimal help. Don't expect any realistic help in dealing with developers either.Fine book, but only for a narrow field."},{"Title":"Managing Your Documentation Projects","review":"I have used this textbook twice instructing advanced technical writing courses at Portland State University. I have found it easy to use, well-written, and organized the way I expect it.The main point Hackos makes is that every publications department sits somewhere on the planning continuum. She introduces the concept of the Publications Development Life Cycle (PDLC). Your department may range from Level 0, oblivious, to Level 5, continuously incrementally improving. She identifies the main tasks needed to move from one level to another.The three main tools used to plan for projects are the information plan, a high-level strategic document; the project plan, a set of timelines and estimates for page counts and money; and a content specification, a detailed outline of every deliverable.Hackos has done a masterful job of setting forth the theory behind the reasoning. Her examples demonstrate not only how important planning is, but the commitment that has to be made to make it succeed. If every technical writer had this book on their shelf, our profession would take a huge step forward."},{"Title":"Managing Your Documentation Projects","review":"This book contains many years of compiled wisdom, not only from the people JoAnn bases her Publications Maturity Model on, but the many doc managers she interviewed and her own consulting experiences. The PMM is an ideal model and not one that can be applied across all industries. The book and process is heavily slanted toward software development and that's where it finds its biggest application, but the process breaks down for many industries outside of that arena. Most tech writers are paid to produce documents, not create and refine processes to such detail as suggested by the PMM parameters--but that's not the book's fault--it's the fault of engineering/technically driven organizations that would rather force tech pubs groups to reinvent the wheel with each new project than spend the time creating and fine-tuning a repeatable process.Perhaps the biggest stumbling block to widespread acceptance/adoption of the PMM is the underlying need of &quot;enlightened&quot; organizations that appreciate (with time, money and resources) and understand the value-add such a process can provide, and those organizations are few and far between. You can have JoAnn's company perform a PMM audit for PMM certification (not sure how much that counts for in the business world--yet), or you can try to be compliant by following the suggestions outlined in the book. But if you're not a software shop, you'll have to make your own adjustments to the PMM requirements and scale appropriately.All in all, I think the book provides some great direction for a documentation project management process that has to be scaled to meet your business/industry needs. This book has and will continue to serve as a springboard for more discussions and new initiatives in the technical communications field."},{"Title":"Managing Your Documentation Projects","review":"If you are or are going to managing documentation projects, read this book. Even if you don't completely agree with Hackos' methodologies, they act as a baseline.Like another reviewer, I'm not thrilled with the examples. Most of the text was valuable and well-written, but I found the examples (and accompanying graphics) to be stilted and somewhat condescending.On the whole, however, a volume to keep close at hand."},{"Title":"Managing Your Documentation Projects","review":"A thick book which endeavors to fit the whole business of technical documentation between its covers. Surprisingly enough, it is fairly successful. However I found the style surprisingly is abit &quot;talky&quot;, and the approach could have been a bit less general and a bit more focused on tips and prticalities. But all in all it provides an interesting read. Especially the project model."},{"Title":"Managing Your Documentation Projects","review":"Joann T. Hackos's book offers some interesting concepts, such as information plan, project plan, and content specifications, to name a few. Her concepts are well hidden under mountains of text that the unfortunate reader has a difficult time finding or understanding her intentions. Her book is information technology-centered, and technical communication has so much to offer other industries, such as oil and gas, healthcare, and financial, regarding project and documentation management. This book is not a good choice for college-level courses."},{"Title":"Managing Your Documentation Projects","review":"Another long-winded academic thesis. It lacks the ONE thing that documentation managers and writers need: the tool. There is not a single example of a project plan or documentation design doc. There is no CD with templates.

I've implemented bits and pieces of Hackos' techniques everywhere I've worked since the book came out in '94. They always work, as long as (a) you aren't the kind of idiot who prefers to swat every gnat with a jackhammer, and (b) you aren't working with three or more of the following: (1) cowboy coders, (2) clueless engineering managers, (3) marketing people who've stopped taking their meds, and (4) the usual species of techpubs dino who prefers extinction to following *any* process s/he didn't actually invent. Even if you disagree violently with some of her approaches (as I do), you'd have to be mighty ignorant to disagree with all of it. If you're a techpubs newbie, buy it right now.

I highly recommend this book. The cost is nothing for what is received in return from reading it."},{"Title":"Managing Your Documentation Projects","review":"It's shocking to me that this book is still the best of its kind on the market. In 1994 this was a breakthrough book. People who wanted a rigorous methodology for planning and executing documentation projects needed this book. Its shortfalls were clear from the beginning--the bloated sections on the process maturity model, delaying project planning until 80 pages into the book, and the unnecessarily vague how-to advice made the book hard to use. And even in its most useful sections, the project management processes were convoluted.Some of the book's weaknesses are understandable. Hackos was developing a profession-specific project management methodology before the PMI had ever published the PMBOK. Online help had yet to gain universal implementation. Content management and single sourcing were hardly the themes we have today. Netscape wasn't even released until late 1994!My primary objection, though, is that by developing a methodology that does not correspond to a product development team's methodology, doc teams doom themselves to irrelevance, frustration, and lack of success.Despite all these weaknesses, however, this book has become a classic in the field and is still the best to buy on this subject. It is still superior to Hackos's updated version from 2007. Buy this one, if you can. But even more importantly, after you read this book, learn more about project management in general.

It focuses heavily on the intellectual end of the subject matter, with a major emphasis on how the religion has evolved in response to the American environment.The main focus of the book is on the emergence of Reform and Conservative Judaism, with somewhat less attention paid to Orthodox and the Hasidim. A writer for Commentary magazine, Glazer at times seems to overly favor Conservative Judaism, though not to the extent that it becomes a screed. Furthermore, in the final chapter, he overemphasizes the importance of support for the state of Israel to a 'truly' Jewish identity. This is a faily minor point in an overall good book.If I had to make one criticism, it would be that Glazer's vision of Judaism focuses exclusively on rabbis and thinkers such as Mordecai Kaplan. It does not give enough attention to lay members of the Jewish community, let alone specific sub-groups such as women.

Still, I have to think there were three better choices to make as icons for the decade of the 1980s, especially given that the young readers for whom the books in the 20th Century USA series are intended are not going to remember this particular decade as well as the rest of us. After all, the 1980s was the decade of the \\"Challenger\\" Disaster, \\"E.T.,\\" the fall of the Berlin Wall, a Royal Wedding, and a whole lot of Stephen King novels.Rennay Craats begins with a brief but tantalizing introduction that shows headlines from the decade (e.g., \\"Carl Lewis Races for Gold,\\" \\"Chernobyl Disaster,\\" \\"Live Aid\\") and then provides a Time Line that starts with Miami become the new home for thousands of Cuban immigrants in 1980 to the fall from grace of baseball star Pete Rose in 1989, all of which are covered in brief articles in the body of the book. Actually, on the second page of the Time Line they have what for me are the two most enduring images of the 1980s: the \\"Challenger\\" explosion and the one man standing in front of the tanks on the Avenue of Eternal Peace in Beijing's Tiananmen Square (nobody ever knew his name, but I guarantee you that everybody who saw him remembers this guy with admiration and wonder).Once again Craats divides the articles into the standard categories of Disasters (the Exxon \\"Valdez\\" oil spill and the eruption of Mt. Saint Helens), Entertainment (MTV and CNN, the Brat Back and \\"The Cosby Show\\"), Trends (CDs and Rubik's Cube), World Events (Anwar al-Sadat's assassination and famine in Africa), Political Issues (Hostages being released and Reagan being shot), Literature (Judy Blume, Alice Walker and \\"Neuromancer\\"), Science & Technology (Sally Ride and Barney Clark), Sports (Baseball strike and Greg LeMond), Society (Vietnam Memorial, ERA, and Sandra Day O'Connor), Economy (Breakup of AT&T;), Fashion (workout clothes and denim), Immigration (Mariel boats), Music (Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen), and Foreign Affairs (Free Trade and invasions of Panama and Grenada).As you look over this list if there are people and events that you have forgotten, then you can see the value of these books for reminding you what you were reading about and talking about at the time. That is why the chief value of these books is in getting beyond the main currents of history covered in the standard textbook to the things that were making headlines and which would have been appealing to young students at the time (i.e., \\"The Terminator\\" more than the war between Iran and Iraq).

A great sitcom. The characters are simple but loveable (or hateable), and the comic timing is incredibly tight. At almost 800 pages, the book demands more attention than the average sitcom fan will allow, but those who persevere will be well rewarded. They will experience Svejk, a character for the ages who deserves his place along Falstaff or Don Quixote, as the author Hasek deserves his place along satirists like Swift and Rabelais.This original drawings that accompany the text in every edition I have seen are wonderful. The book is such a success that it becomes the case that you cannot even look at a picture of the good soldier Svejk and his unfortunate compatriots without laughing. If you are curious about history, or a fan of Catch-22 or MASH, you will completely enjoy this classic of a book."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"Once in a while, people claim that this or that was the greatest book of all times. In this case, however, this saying is true. And you know what? Persistently and now well over 90 years, it's been true! Unrivaled and unmatched, Jaroslav Hasek still stands a few cuts above the greatest of authors.Jaroslav Hasek is the greatest author of all time. (And that's a hell of a statement!) He invented sarcasm and irony. He took no prisoners and clawed with his penetrating wit at all layers of society. He pandered to no one. He saw the filthy rot in every layer of every organisation. He belonged to no one, not even his readers. This particular book is probably his greatest. It does not age. Though set in WWI, it's as spanking new today and applicable to -- for instance, the moral American debacle of Bush's war and demonisation of millions of Middle Eastern children, their mums and dads -- as it ever was.The book ends prematurely, far too prematurely for the immensity of J Hasek. A half way through its fourth part, with the sudden death of the author, it ends abruptly leaving the reader gasp and shed tears everytime. Thank God for the 4 parts. Many have tried finishing this literary torso but all have failed. I'm now attempting the impossible, but I'll be straight with you in telling you that I don't believe my version of Hasek's part V will do much but dent the literary world. I'm certain, mine will be the best of all the many endings but I must, in advance, apologize to the great literary genius Jaroslav Hasek for the stunt. But the Hasek nurtured cynicism I've cherished and cultivated so leaves me no choice.This book is the greatest book in the world. Yet, I do not recommend it since the English translation is simply atrocious. It's an impossible task, really. One cannot hope to translate the most grammatically expansive and the most expressive language coupled with the largest vocabulary in the world into the primitive non-inflected English that actually boasts that an average adult commands her pithy 300 of its root words. Except in English there are only root words. But in this case, the butchery went even further the obvious translation guillotining. It seems the silly translator did not grasp even the most basic fundamentals of Czech slicing rapier-like wit and instead filled page after page with boredom and pathetic account of what Hasek might have meant. It's as though a first grader reviewed some unwanted book he was forced to skip through. It's no wonder the English version is a sad 20% of the original thickness. Nothing of value makes it into the translation, which, by the way, is a purposeful and deliberate attempt to keep Jaroslav Hasek from rightfully dominating the world literary stage.All Western pushed authors like Hemmingway, Poe, and Shakespeare pale in comparison and lay about the American bookstore shelves boring generation after generation with their lackluster witless emptiness.I urge all to learn Czech and thus gain a front row view into the amazing Hasek social rhetoric, prophecies, and foresight offered in the funniest possible way that exists in the entire literary world today.Don't no one forget that the word 'Robot' is Czech! Czech literary artistry is the best in the world, hands down. Just as Czech authors have no equals in the world, Jaroslav Hasek stands alone far above the rest even among his mother-tongue peers."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"This is a brilliant book, taking on unnecessary wars started by vile and senile rulers. The book is full of insights of highest relevance to us. In fact, it has been studied and cited abundantly by the policymakers. Is is never credited though, but then, perhaps the speechwriters had difficulties finding out whether the Doppelmonarchie (where the book was written) was a member of the coalition of the willng.Here is the latest excerpt, from Gov. of CA's GOP convention speech:\\" Let me tell you about the sacrifice and the commitment that I have seen firsthand. In one of the military hospitals I visited, I met a young guy who was in bad shape. He'd lost a leg, he had a hole through his stomach, and his shoulder had been shot through. And the list goes on and on and on.I could tell that there was no way he could ever return to combat. But when I asked him, \\"When do you think you'll get out of the hospital?\\" He said, \\"Sir, in three weeks.\\"And do you know what he said to me then? He said he was going to get a new leg, and then he was going to get some therapy, and then he was going to go back to Iraq and fight alongside his buddies.He said, \\"Arnold, I'll be back.\\"This is directly lifted from a propagandist leflet described in the book. I am not sure Arnold's aids fully realized the depths of Hasek's sarcasm, though.The book has an eery feel, as if foretelling what next cliche will be deployed to work up the fears of the tired population. It seems, one can read it as the scripts of today's war propaganda machine.In short - immensely funny, biting and sharp book; book for today and, alas, perhaps for more years to come, fellow Americans..."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"The Good Solider Svejk is a comical tale of a faithful, \\"idiot\\" of a solider heading his way to proudly serve his country. The book chronicles his journey with his Regiment and is full of comical mishaps and such. Though, the book is pretty well written and on a very easy level, I found it to be a bit redundant. From reading the intro, this book started as a series of short stories and I think they would be better if read this way. Constantly hearing about how Svjek has once again, messed up something for the Lieutenant started to get annoying and predictable. This book was meant to be in six parts, however the author was only able to write four before passing away. Though that may be, you do not feel as if the ending left you hanging which can be good or bad depending on who you are. The fact that I was not left hanging made me feel that perhaps I could have left to book at page 400 and still felt the same about it. I normally enjoy long books, this however was very difficult for me to get through and I would not recommend it to those with short attention spans.All in all, I found the writing to be easy and comical as there were several instances in which I wanted to laugh out loud. I do think, this book would have faired better if I had read it in the short story sections it had meant to be in. I am completely in the middle in regards to this book because I feel there are some people who would enjoy it much more than me and others who will put it down after the first 200 pages.

My favorite is the following scene of the hero being called from his cell for interrogation, not a normal subject of amusement these days. The attitude of our prisoners, seized in the war on terror, does not differ greatly from Svejk's --They came to take him away for questioning. And so, mounting the staircase to the 3rd Department for questioning, Svejk carried his cross up on to the hill of Golgotha, sublimely unconscious of his martyrdom. As he came into the office, he said,\\"Good evening to you all, gentlemen.\\" Instead of a reply, ... someone stood him in front of a table, behind which sat a gentleman with a cold official face and features of bestial cruelty, features of the criminal type. The interrogator gave Svejk a bloodthirsty look and said: \\"Take that idiotic expression off your face.\\" \\"I can't help it,\\" replied Svejk. \\"I was discharged from the army for idiocy ... I'm an official idiot.\\"Back in his cell, Svejk told all the detainees that this kind of interrogation was fun. \\"They shout at you a bit and finally they kick you out. In the old days, it used to be worse. If a chap was only thrown into a dungeon he felt as if he were reborn. Nowadays it's fun being locked up. It's true it's a bit far to the interrogation room. You've got to go along three corridors and up one staircase, but on the other hand it's a clean and lively corridor. No one need be afraid that in the office they'll tell him, \\"Well, we've considered your case and tomorrow you'll be quartered or burnt, your choice. Yes, nowadays things have improved for our good.\\"For those who see war in a religious vein --\\"Preparations for the slaughter of mankind have always been made in the name of God or some supposed higher being which men have devised and created in their own imagination.Before the Holy Inquisition burnt its victims, it performed the most solemn religious service -- a High Mass with singing.When criminals are executed, priests always officiate, molesting the delinquents with their presence.The great shambles of the world war did not take place without the blessing of priests. Chaplains of all armies prayed and celebrated drumhead masses for victory for the side whose bread they ate.Throughout all Europe people went to slaughter like cattle, driven there not only by butcher emperors, kings or other potentates and generals, but also by priests of all confession, who blessed them and made them perjure themselves that they would destroy the enemy on land, in the air, and on the sea etc.\\""},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"The Good Soldier Svejk is one of the classics of literature that sprang from the flesh-fertilized grounds of World War 1. But Svejk is a war book with a twist. It is profoundly funny -- hiliarious in fact, an antiwar novel that wanders throughout the realm of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire without getting anywhere near the Russian front for a long time. Unlike Remarque's brooding &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, or Lawrence's memoir &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;, Hasek's novel views the war as a great absurdist event, a colossal stupidity witnessed by a small stupid person, Svjek (who prior to the war, made his living by selling dogs with forged pedigrees). But Svejk isn't stupid. He PLAYS dumb all right, because he knows that's how one survives. Hasek lays bare the ridiculousness of the old Habsburg monarchy: the ethnic rivalries, the endless bureaucracies, religions of convenience, the military heirarchy, as seen through the eyes of the not-as-simple-as-he-seems Czech reservist, Svjek. Through a series of mishaps, blunders, deliberate scams and other reasons, Sjvek always seems to somehow just avoid going to the front, until the very end of the book, which has kind of a surprise ending all its own. It is a wordy book (largely because Hasek wrote the book as a serial published in an Czech newspaper -- he was paid by the word), but an immensely fun one nevertheless. Considering all the serious literature that came out of the First World War, Sjvek is a hilarious treat with a serious subtext that hasn't lost its power to entertain and provoke thought. It's not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"Just as Don Quixote is the seminal piece of Spanish literature, and War and Peace defines Russian lit, so does Hasek's classic capture the essence of the Bohemian soul, and the ridiculousness and pointlessness of World War I.In doing the bare minimum to be considered competent, we see the nature of Czech resistance to Austro-Hungarian (and later, Soviet) authority - as Havel put it some fifty years later, it is the &quot;power of the powerless&quot; - subverting authority from within while seemingly going along with the grandious designs of the ruling elite.Svejk is a common footsoldier - an &quot;everyman&quot; - who frankly would rather have a beer than fight, and has no real interest in the war or its outcome. The humor is subtle, the satire biting, the social criticism of Austro-Hungarian class structure dead on. Some of the jokes and jabs may be a bit above the heads of those not familiar with the history or culture of the region. It his, however, an enjoyable - and I dare say classic - read."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"The Good Soldier Svejk is like no other book I have ever read. It is truly a classic war satire and is on par with books like Catch 22. I see it as the spawn of many satires written about WWII however quite rightly no author has ever tried to replicate the style that it was written in. Jaroslav Hasek had one of the most interesting lives of any author, switching from Austro-Hungarian to Russian Monarchist to Bolshevik to Czech nationalist during WWI and his life story is reflected somewhat in his story while he illustrates it with brilliant humour.The character of Svejk is developed in such an intricate way that makes it difficult to discover his real purposes but the book is not damaged in the slightest by the fact that it was cut short because of Hasek's untimely death. In fact it has only helped to cultivate the Svejk legend.I encourage ANYONE to read this book.

I DO speak Czech, and have read Svejk in both languages.My Czech professors in California urged me to buy it in 1991, saying that the translator had done a very good job of capturing some of the nuances of the Prague accent. Now that I have lived all over Bohemia, I agree. Of course, no translation can possibly be as good as the original, but this one is about as close as they come.They also said that if I wanted to truly understand the way Czechs think, I had to read this book. Much has changed since it was written, including the typical Czech mindset. However, many of the older Czechs with whom I spoke insisted that Svejk describes the true mentality of many typical Czechs of the period, and were excited that an American would actually be interested in truly learning the cultural and literary history of such a small nation.History buffs occasionally scratch their heads and wonder why the Czechs have always made some of the best weapons in the world, but rarely used them. With an irreverent, bumbling style, Hasek and Svejk show us why many Czechs throughout history have preferred to &quot;switch their coats&quot; and go with the flow of the everchanging dominant powers, rather than be trampled underfoot.Both the book and the translation deserve five stars."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"I think the five-stars rating system does great unjustice to this book.

It is a great way to learn the history of that period, while laughing as you have never laughed before.

The Cecil Parrot edition is, needless to say, much preferable (it contains a wonderful introduction including a discussion of Czech profanity as compared to English) and I've read it again and again since it came out in 1974. Shelby Foote said somewhere that every year he reads Proust as a sort of literary vacation. About ever 2 or 3 years I reread Svejk to clean my literary palate and it's always as fresh and as enjoyable as it was the first time. The dialogue, the characters and the situations in Svejk are, stated simply, the funniest I've ever read. Many other books have many merits in this regard, but none has approached Hasek in the sustained hilarity over 500 pages or more. The secret policeman, Bretschneider, Chaplain Katz, Sergeant Major Vanek, Cadet Biegler, Balloun and Lt. Dub are each memorable characters but when they interact they surpass anything I have ever read for comedy. The term \\"laugh out loud\\" is much used and abused recently, but The Good Soldier Svejk will have you disturbing family and friends repeatedly with guffawing any time you read it in their presence. I can't give a text any higher recommendation."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"This novel is one of the best books ever written about war, but its main character isn't a brave soldier ( as the title ironically shows), but an anti-hero, considering that the most realistic view of war doesn't deal with heroism but with resistance and survival, more so because are precisely the bravest the ones to fall sooner, while the non valiant just think about the ways to flee from death. The novel is a satire of the Great War begun in 1914, specially of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a war which begun almost happily and irresponsibly by the means of every European country, and which initiated the bloody history of the twentieth century. Three monarchies were mainly responsible for the war, Prussia, Austria and Russia, and the three lost their crowns for ever. The novel deals with popular humour in the best Czech tradition, and it somehow reminds me of the picaresque Spanish Literature, and it chooses an sceptical view of the military and the worn concept of patriotism, so often manipulated. From my point of view, there are two ways of seeing war: the one represented by the splendid &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; by Eric Maria Remarque, a tragic vision, or the one represented by &quot;The Good Soldier Svejk&quot;, also splendid, but satirical although dramatical at the bottom.

In the immense stupidity of political powers, war, and military service, Schweik, who is released from service for being an idiot, is the only one who sees and thinks clearly.

I understand that it motivated Joseph Heller to write Catch 22. Great satire."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"This firsthand account of service in WWI by a gifted Bohemian intellectual, is recounted as ironic blind-drunk adventure. The intensity of passion behind this satire is barely sane. Hasek's actual experiences as a philandering drunken swindler, seditious conscript and gadfly are recounted mercilessly.Like all great art, this book powerfully imposes a flavor of thought, a viewpoint so natural and compelling that before you know it, you can never go back. Without this book you will never understand the meaning of the word \\"Bohemian\\". Franz Kafka wrote and lived at the same time and place as Hasek, but Kafka was sincere and guilty; precisely, explicitly, imtimately doomed. Hasek was equally doomed, but rather than expressing tortured humanity, he dove into his sorry fate, becoming an ironic, shifty fool, living for the next beer or chicken leg, devouring and slathering the madness like a starved pig. The parallax between Kafka and Hasek creates a complete landscape of the time.The adventures of good Svejk only touch on the first few years of Hasek's real \\"anabasis\\". Hasek's own life became even more ludicrous and incredible than his book. It is perhaps good Hasek died before he could revel absurdly in the likely gruesome deaths of his ridiculous, pathetic, real comrades. Hasek himself slogged and drank and conned his way through the purges and famines following the war, switching sides several times narrowly avoiding assassination and execution for treason from all sides. But, the story ends just about as it should, as our drunken raconteur passes out in mid-sentence.The mass psychological effect of this book are greater than its explicit literary influences, but even they are considerable. \\"Catch-22\\" is an open homage to \\"The Good Soldier Svejk\\". Toole's classic \\"Confederacy of Dunces\\" could hardly exist without Svejk. In turn, Hasek's use of ironic gung-ho naivete, his immersion in a culture of relentless, systematic, bizarre cruelty, his appropriately obscene humor, his recreation of the salty dialects and usages of real personalities, owes a debt to Mark Twain.W.R. Isaacs"},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"I read the first two sections of this four section book and am undecided as to whether I will complete the third and fourth sections.Schwejk strikes a unique nerve in anti-war literature. The protagonist feigns simpleminded ignorance and an infectious, madcap humanity to cope with the absurdity of life as a soldier in the Hapsburg Empire during World War I. But Hasek (through his character Schwejk) doesn't restrict his hard-hitting satire to the military, he also tackles the ethnic tensions that dominated Austria-Hungary, the hopeless hypocrisy of the Church, the crushing and mindless government bureaucracy and profiteering that were rife during that profoundly sad era. Besotted Chaplain Katz, the hapless First Lieutenant Lukasch, and thick-headed Colonel Kraus serve as perfect foils for Schwejk as he weaves his way through hospitals, military prisons, cushy assignments and insane asylums, all while avoiding the Front (at least through the first two sections of the Book). My only complaint would be the long-winded anecdotes that Schwejk enages in - these are repetitive and hard to follow (as a masochist, I read the first two sections in a very dated and idiomatic Bohemian/German - a lot of the words had no translations). The \\"Anabasis\\" was perhaps the best part of the first two sections - the hike through the Bohemian countryside as Schwejk tries to reconnect with his regiment is particularly poignant inasmuch as it contrasts Schwejk's innocence and openness against the deeply paranoid home front Army that captures (and almost executes) him as a spy."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"My initial reaction to this book after reading the first few chapters was that it reminded me of Catch-22. Sure enough, after some research, I found out that Heller credits Hasek's work as one of his key influences. If you appreciate the biting satire, base humor, and no-holds-barred castigation of bureaucratic organizations in Catch-22, you love it in Svejk as well. Sveyk, the (seemingly) good-natured and dopey Dudley-Do-Right of the Czech contingent in the Austria-Hungarian army during WWI is a well known \\"hero\\" in his home country. He represents the \\"little people\\" on a world scale, the powerless little countries that have been at the mercy of their militant neighbors throughout the 20th century. Sveyk, unable to assert any form of control on the political chaos around him, engages in a more passive-aggressive tactic. Pretending to be a patriotic supporter of the war, he ensures, through \\"innocent\\" bumbling mistakes, that more energy be required to get him to the front than necessary. Although officially labeled an \\"imbecile\\" by the military, Sveyk's canniness shines though in his ability to shame and/or outwit the forces that try to impose him (and what greater enemy of the common soldier exists than his own chain of command?) Secondary and tertiary players provide a colorful cast of caricatures: the sozzled chaplain who falls over drunk at mass, the idiot general who speaks in platitudes, the ambitious cadet whose cognac hangover is misdiagnosed as cholera, and finally the Sveyk's own well-meaning and hopelessly frustrated superior officer Lt. Lukas. If anything, it all goes on a little too long until our grins start to freeze to our faces.

Hasek sets his sights on the decadence of the collapsing Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, takes aim and skewers the empire, its army, the secret police and the ethnic distrust and downright hatred between the many populations that had been cobbled together by military conquest centuries earlier. Sitting atop this decaying \\"empire\\" is Emperor of Austria/King of Hungary Franz Joseph, who once remarked to a visiting diplomat that he was the last of \\"The Old School\\" rulers, and indeed was so unpopular with the citizenry that he utilized legions of secret police to spy on virtually all who came in contact with them. Hasek's pen spares no one: debauched priests, drunken, abusive and incompetent army officers, brutal shopkeepers, all are lashed by Hasek's wicked satire.The protagonist is Svejk, a seller of dogs with forged pedigrees, a seemingly retarded borderline idiot who is in reality a patient and clever man who outwits government officials and army officers with his charade of incompetency, and it is precisely through these absurd (and often cruel) encounters that Hasek exposes the decaying underbelly of Austria-Hungary and it's extraordinarily brutal and ineffective military machine. While Svejk appears the fool, it is in reality those with whom he interacts that are exposed for who they really are.The book is lengthy, having originally appeared in print as an ongoing serial in a newspaper, and regrettably Hasek died before finishing this definitive absurdist work. Nevertheless, \\"Svejk\\" is an eminently readable and at times outrageously funny book.

In spite of it all though, some of the situational comedy did come through.I couldn't quite ascertain if vejk was truly an idiot or only pretended to be one in order to more perfectly combat the hegemony-- at times I was sure he was pretending and then at others I lent towards imbecility.In all, not quite the excellent read for which it was recommended. I'm glad to have read it, however, as perhaps it will garner more insight when reading Catch-22."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"This is one of those books that you can never get enough of and it always amazes you with its simplicity and originality. The book is like an endless gallery of human characters lost and exposed by the turmoil of the war. It is a comedy of words and situations, yet it is also in a way the revenge of the small people against the big mindless &quot;system.&quot; It is the ultimate guide to not taking the world seriously. It is unbeleivably enjoyable. It helps of course if you are eastern european makes it easier to recognize and identify. But still the greatest book ever if I had to choose one."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"Twenty years ago this was required reading for my East European history course, and I have to say it is not only a classic but a great read. My Professor (an exile Latvian) wanted us students to know the reason why Eastern Europeans acted the way they acted. After being dominated by major great powers, East Europeans became docile in the face of power. Good soldier Svejk not only exhibits this with both the Austro-Hungarians, but also the Russians. Svejk accomodates himself to the realities of his life by acceptance outwardly, but resists internally the controls placed on him.This is a great read for those trying to understand East Europe.It is also a humorous read. Even now I chuckle over the actions of Good Soldier Svejk."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"Perhaps one of the most comical books and best acerbic political satires ever conceived, this book is utterly permeated with sarcasm and the farcical adventures of the &quot;good&quot; soldier Svejk. Putting the defects of the Austria-Hungarian empire into the limelight Jaroslav Hasek hillariously dethrones them. It is a weeping shame however that the novel has not been completed as it quietly dies shrouding the rest of Svejk's adventures in mystery. Also, one might say that the &quot;toilet humour&quot; and sarcasm together with the convenient misadventures become somewhat monotonous and cliche after the first 300-400 pages. And yet, despite its weaknesses and length, &quot;The Good Soldier Svejk and His Fortunes in WWI&quot; undisputably deserve your attention."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"The obvious objection is: what about Catch-22? Yes, but that protagonist's motives are quite clear. Svejk, though, is hard to figure out - and here's the beauty of it - because he is so shallow. It's Hasek's way of exposing the hypocrisies of authoritarianism. That sounds too bookish. He pokes fun at everything. So why only four stars? The translation is difficult to warm up to, especially in the dialogue. Nevertheless, I encourage you to read this book, and perhaps even model yourself after Svejk. Anti-hero? Think again. Or don't (think again, that is), and see if the outcome is any different. That, I believe, is Hasek's point."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"Humbly Report Sir....If there is such a thing as a humorous war story, this is it. The blundering idiot (or genius?) Svejk takes us on a thrilling, unpredictable and round-about journey through Bohemia during WW1. The unassuming and inadvertently witty Svejk will certainly make you laugh throughout this book. It's a shame that the author didn't live long enough to continue Svejk's journey into the Second World War!"},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"This is a wonderful, hilarious book, but it's butchered by a very poor translation. And not only is the translation often inaccurate, but the translator considerably softens Hasek's (vulgar) use of language. Until a better translation becomes available, learn Czech. It will be worth it."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"This book is a funny anti-war adventure story, but also so much more. It gives the reader an excellent sense of what it might have been like to live in the Austrian Empire in 1914-15. I know it sounds strange, but after reading this, Kafka begins to make sense. Read this book once for sheer entertainment, but then read it again and give it some thought. It's worth it!"},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"Oh man, this is, without a doubt, my fave book of all time. I've read it a few times through to catch all the subtle nuances that Jaroslav Hasek was able to blend so masterfully. I don't laugh out loud when I'm alone (who does? ya psychos...) except when reading this book. Maybe you have to be central European to fully revel in the humor, but Hasek's editorializing on language (after book I in the text) is enough reason to read this book if not outright buy it. But buy it anyway. Lada's illustrations make great t-shirt clip art, by the way."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"The &quot;Catch 22&quot; of World War I."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"This is undoubtedly one of the masterpieces of satyrical literature, on par with such giants as Don Quixote and Gargantua. While some particular jokes and comical situations may be difficult to understand for readers who didn't live in the Austro-Hungarian empire in the early 20th century, the humor is timeless, the way all masterpieces are. An incredibly funny novel that draws its comical effect from the absurdity of war, one of the most brutal and tragic events that humans can experience, where comic situations are unlikely to arise. The fact that they do here, and that the book causes the reader to laugh aloud many times while still showing him the cruelty and horrors of war, is the sign of a true satyrical genius. Svejk himself, the seemingly idiotic but in truth extremely wise and cunning &quot;everyman&quot; character, who was partially based on Hasek himself, is one of the most likeable and memorable characters in world literature.I first read this book 5 years ago, and since then I reread it at least once a year and always find some new aspects of Hasek's work that I've missed before. I heartily recommend this all-time classic to anyone who is interested in WWI history, or just wants a good laugh."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Before his death in the early 1890's, Francis Parkman would be hailed by many as North America's greatest historian. One of his first major works, The Oregon Trail, illustrates why. Written in 1847, the book chronicles an extensive journey by the youthful Parkman and his loyal friend Quincy Shaw the previous spring and summer. Parkman's express purpose was to see the &quot;real&quot; American West and live among &quot;real&quot; American Indians before their way of life passed forever. A vigorous young man, possessed of a keen intellect and observant eye, and already blessed with a rare and masterful prose style, Parkman chronicles his journey from St. Louis into the heart of the largely &quot;unknown&quot; American Plains. Peopled then by only a few white traders, trappers and ruffians, slowly pushing their way into the domain of the Pawnee, Comanche, Arapaho, Dakota, &quot;Shienne&quot;, Snakes and Crows, the West was a truly wild and dangerous place - and Parkman revels in it, providing meticulous descriptions of the landscape, people, and struggle for life and lifeways that would soon be no more.Along the way Parkman introduces you to the men of Fort Laramie (established and maintained by traders, long before soldiers came to the territory), lives amongst a Dakota band, hunts buffalo, weathers awe-inspiring Plains' thunderstorms and periods of drought, explores the Black Hills, the Rocky Mountains, and New Mexico. His journey takes him up the Missouri River, the Platte, the Arkansas and more. And far more than describe fascinating places and events, Parkman charms with full renderings of the characters he meets along the way: redoubtable hunter and guide Henry Chatillion, muleteer and cook Delorier, the dolorous Raymond and Reynal, jester Tete Rouge, hundreds of loathesome &quot;pioneers&quot;, Indians Mene-Seela, Smoke, Whirlwind, Hail Storm, Big Crow and more. All characters worthy of Mark Twain. Plus, we are made witness to Parkman and Shaw's slow transformation from adventurous young Bostonian scholars to worthy &quot;plainsmen&quot;.Even before finishing his college studies, Parkman declared that his ambition was to chronicle the &quot;struggle for the continent&quot;. He achieved his goal in glorious measure. Parkman's works on the founding of &quot;New France&quot;, LaSalle's explorations, the French/Indian Wars, Pontiac's conspiracy, Montcalm and Wolfe, etc., remain standards today, rich source material for authors from DeVoto to Eckert.His brilliance lies in the fact that Parkman was no &quot;arm chair&quot; historian. His research was not limited to books and papers found in libraries from Boston to London and Paris. He personally visited nearly every town, battlefield, and waterway he wrote about. Parkman was also deeply committed to understanding the effects of the English/French/American struggles for the continent on the hundreds of North American tribes that were caught in the middle. To wit, the &quot;Oregon Trail&quot; trip to the Plains of the 1840s was designed to assist the historian's mind in understanding what was lost by eastern tribes decimated during the wars and land-lust of the preceding century. Even then Parkman foresaw a similar misfortune for western tribes: loss of free roaming on their ancestral lands; extinction of the buffalo; the ravaging effects of disease, whiskey and other evils of white contact. But Parkman was no romantic. He refers to the various tribes and some individuals (both white and red) as &quot;savages&quot;, revealing a touch of his mid-1800s Bostonian elitism, yet by no means can Parkman be considered a closed-minded misanthrope. His life's work, starting with The Oregon Trail, reveals far too much sensitivity and fairness of thought for that label to stick. Read this, then dive into Parkman's later work on the history of Canada and early America. It is astonishingly good stuff!"},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Francis Parkman lived the Oregon Trail, slept it, ate it, marveled at it, and wrote an excellent memoir that leaves one with the feel of sand in your boots and the smell of buffalo roasting on the fire.As a young man, Parkman went out west in 1846 to discover the American Indian. Setting out from Independence, Mo., Parkman proceeded to Ft. Larime (Wyoming), spent many weeks with a band of Indians as they hunted buffalo and secured life's necessities for the coming season, and returned to &quot;the settlements&quot; via Bent's Fort (Colorado) and the upper Santa Fe Trail. (Making this wonderful book misnamed since he was only on about the first 1/3 of the Oregon Trail and never crossed the Rockies).What Parkman has left us is a wonderfully descriptive first person account of overland travel in the rugged west and the life of the Indian (as viewed by an outsider).The strength of this book is in the details. Parkman has a keen eye whether it is turned towards imposing landscapes, Indian village life and travel, or buffalo hunting. This book has a gritty feel that paints the grandeur of western vistas as well as the hard reality of subsistence life (both Indian and white traveler) lived outdoors in a frequently unforgiving land.Parkman's voice does have a 19th century feel. Modern readers will find he over-introduces new subjects (ie, &quot;since, reader, we are telling of a buffalo hunt, now is a good time to acquaint you with the manner in which buffalo are brought to ground.&quot;) and the book does not have the flow associated with more contemporary writing. His attitudes towards Indians reflect the majority view of that time period and he was certainly at times a gratuitous hunter.But the book's descriptive power, as well as the fascinating telling of life among the Indians and on the plains makes this well worth the time. This is a first person account that speaks of authenticity and gave me a feel for \\"what it must have been like.\\" A good read."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The Oregon Trail still stands as a classic of American literature and of a rapidly vanishing past. Written as an account of a summer he spent traveling the Oregon Trail, Parkman captures the details of communal Native American life with no sentimentality, just hard reality. Even though written in 1846, Parkman is amazingly precise in his estimation of the vanishing frontier and Native American way of life. At times, he is rather callous toward the Native Americans, but this also reflects his times and environment. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Living at the main jumping-off point of the Oregon, Santa Fe and California Trails, and having traveled frequently throughout the great plains and Rocky Mountains, I thought this book would be a good read. I wasn't disappointed.The book chronicles the author's trip along the Oregon Trail in the Spring and Summer of 1846. He begins by joining a group of fellow adventurers at Westport, Missouri, in present day Kansas City. Together they embark for Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. From there they head out to the plains, visiting Fort Laramie in Wyoming and the Black Hills of South Dakota. While in this general vicinity, the author joins a band of Indians and lives with them for a prolonged period, richly detailing the living conditions and customs of a Plains tribe at this time. He accompanies the tribe on a hunting trip to the Black Hills where he details this pristine area before the onrush of white encroachers after Custer's 1873 expedition.The title of the book is somewhat misleading in that the author doesn't travel the entire Oregon Trail. In fact he only traverses about 1/3 of the trail, for he returns to Fort Laramie after his stay with the Indians where he regroups with his party before heading to Bent's Fort in Colorado. The country in between these two forts is vividly illustrated by his pen as is the fort itself upon his arrival.At the fort his party is joined by a jester of sorts, a mentally ill volunteer soldier who had been left behind by his unit on their way to fight in the Mexican War which had begun just prior to the author's trip. He gives a colorful description of this man and his odd attributes during their return trip to civilization.The party follows the Arkansas River through Kansas on their way back to Westport. Along the way they meet Indians and groups of soldiers marhing along the Santa Fe Trail toward action in Mexico and California. They also partake in hunting buffalo and of this experience the author does an exceptional job of putting the reader at the scene of the hunt. While this makes for exciting reading, it is also sad when one reflects that actions such as those of this party would later lead to the near extinction of the bufalo as well as the irradication of the plains' Indians lifestyle.Having been on the plains, I felt that the author did a good job of describing the varying weather there, from the oppresive heat to the violent storms. I found it interesting that whenever one of these storms should arrive, the author and his companions would seek shelter below trees, contrary to what we are taught today. But then again, being caught out on the open plains with no adequate shelter when one of these tempests arose, I suppose one can see the reasoning in their actions.This book was a quick read and I found it very educational. It was fun to see the plains through the eyes of someone who had been there when they were still little touched by civilization. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the period, as well as to those who are studying the history of the nation's development or thinking of traveling in this part of the country."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Francis Parkman lived the Oregon Trail, slept it, ate it, marveled at it, and wrote an excellent memoir that leaves one with the feel of sand in your boots and the smell of buffalo roasting on the fire.As a young man, Parkman went out west in 1846 to discover the American Indian.

The following year he published this travelogue which remains one of the great books ever produced by an American and embarked him on a career as one of America&iacute;s first great historians.On their trip, they were accompanied by Henry Chatillon, a hunter &amp; guide, and Deslauriers, a muleteer. Parkman, in a passage which nicely illustrates his mastery of descriptive technique, sketches them as follows:Deslauriers was a Canadian, with all the characteristics of the true Jean Baptiste. Neither fatigue,exposure, nor hard labor could ever impair his cheerfulness and gayety, or his politeness to hisbourgeois; and when night came, he would sit down by the fire, smoke his pipe, and tell storieswith the utmost contentment. The prairie was his element. Henry Chatillon was of a differentstamp. When we were at St. Louis, several gentleman of the Fur Company had kindly offered toprocure for us a hunter and guide suited for our purposes, and on coming one afternoon to theoffice, we found there a tall and exceedingly well-dressed man, with a face so open and frank that itattracted our notice at once. We were surprised at being told that that it was he who wished toguide us to the mountains. He was born in a little French town near St. Louis, and from the age offifteen years had been constantly in the neighborhood of the Rocky Mountains, employed for themost part by the company, to supply their forts with buffalo meat. As a hunter, he had but onerival in the whole region, a man named Simoneau, with whom, to the honor of both of them, hewas on the terms of closest friendship. He had arrived at St. Louis the day before, from themountains, where he had been for four years; and he now asked only to go and spend a day withhis mother, before setting out on another expedition. His age was about thirty; and he was six feethigh, and very powerfully and gracefully moulded. The prairies had been his school; he couldneither read nor write, but he had a natural refinement and delicacy of mind, such as is rare even inwomen. His manly face was a mirror of uprightness, simplicity, and kindness of heart; he had,moreover, a keen perception of character, and a tact that would preserve him from flagrant error inany society. Henry had not the restless energy of an Anglo-American. He was content to takethings as he found them; and his chief fault arose from an excess of easy generosity, not conduciveto thriving in the world. Yet it was commonly remarked of him, that whatever he might choose todo with what belonged to himself, the property of others was always safe in his hands. His braverywas as much celebrated in the mountains as his skill in hunting; but it is characteristic of him that ina country where the rifle is the chief arbiter between man and man, he was very seldom involved inquarrels. Once or twice, indeed, his quiet good nature had been mistaken and presumed upon, butthe consequences of the error were such, that no one was ever known to repeat it. No betterevidence of the intrepidity of his temper could be asked, than the common report that he had killedmore than thirty grizzly bears. He was a proof of what unaided nature will sometimes do. I havenever, in the city or in the wilderness, met a better man than my true-hearted friend, HenryChatillon.&quot;Any man would consider his life well spent if he could inspire that portrait. But lest you think he's too pedantic, he also writes with great humor, to wit:Whiskey, by the way, circulates more freely in Westport than is altogether safe in a place whereevery man carries a loaded pistol in his pocket.or try this remark on setting out from Fort Leavenworth:Thus we bade a long adieu to bed and board, and the principles of Blackstone&iacute;s commentaries.Parkman's later work, The French and English in North America, was one of the first works published by the Library of America and it was the first great work of history produced by an American. It is also epic in length, numbering some 2000 pages or so. For a little easier introduction to his work, try The Oregon Trail.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"this real-life journal of a wealthy Bostonian adventurer traveling the Oregon trail in the late 1840s is outstanding in its description and as a historical reference.

Parkman's &quot;Oregon Trail&quot; is considered a timeless, historical masterpiece and rightfully so. Only twenty three years old, he and his friend Quincy Adams Shaw went west &quot;on a tour of curiosity and amusement to the Rocky Mountains&quot;. Stopping off at Fort Laramie, we acquire a taste of what life was like there in those early days of overland emigrants, trappers, traders, Indians and &quot;ruffians&quot;. He then spends time with the Sioux, observing and describing their behavior, culture and customs while in the Laramie Mountains and Valley, and the foothills of the Medicine Bow Mountains. From here, Parkman and Shaw travel down the front range of Colorado to Pueblo, Bent's Fort and back to St. Louis via the Arkansas River. Being a very descriptive writer, we gain an insightful and vivid look as to geographical landforms and the characters who lived in those days. Excellent."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"In a day when \\"historians\\" make comment on the long dead or events from the confines of their apartments, Francis Parkman is the person who actually experienced the history he wrote about. There is no political correctness in Parkman and he describes savages, French, frontiersmen and Mormons exactly as they were without apology.This work is a masterpiece everyone should read and be a guidebook to modern historians who spend more time working a political end and getting in the way of history rather than letting history tell it's truthful tale.Parkman is not just the historian or recorder of events. He is the bard of Sioux myth, the geologist, biologist and countless other things describing flora, fauna and weather. He is complete in having that air of Boston social elite in beginning his journey and returning from the plains an American having tasted, smelled and breathed the savage world and revealed the eastern thoughts on how that world would evolve for the next 60 years.Parkman is remarkable and the best compliment for this book is to recommend that readers search for other Parkman histories to read as they are real.I am currently in his wonderful Montecalm and Wolfe series on the history of Canada which actually created America. If you have children, share Parkman's history with them as he will make it come alive for them.As you can see by all of the lengthy reviews, Francis Parkman invokes a great deal of thought and emotion in his histories which transfers to the reader."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Parkman was little more than a youth when he set out with a group of fellow greenhorns to tackle the Wild West. The West really was wild in the 1840's and this book gives us a rare glance at what it was really like.

Long considered a classic of western exploration it is also a saga of youth and freedom."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Parkman is one of my favorite authors, and the only thing I can add to what others have said in reviews before mine is that this is NOT a history told from the point of view of an emigrant - in fact, he views them (and nearly everyone else) with the disdain that only a Bostonian can render. So, although incredibly entertaining and informative, he does not travel the Oregon trail in the traditional sense but wanders far and wide from it, and does not cross the Rockies; so anyone looking for a narrative history of what it was like to travel the full length of the Trail might be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Francis Parkman lived from 1823 to 1893. The Oregon Trail, an account of his travels in 1846, was his first published book. Parkman's journey would have been much easier to follow if the book had a map tracing his route.My reading edition of The Oregon Trail is that in The Library of America volume [53] containing both The Oregon Trail and Parkman's The Conspiracy of Pontiac; but since I haven't yet read the book on Pontiac, I'm placing my review under the present volume. The Library of America edition of The Oregon Trail (TLA.OT) is of Parkman's 1849 first edition published by George P. Putnam, with a correction of the title, restoring it to Parkman's intention. The book was revised and reprinted several times, the last edition, illustrated by Frederick Remington, in 1892.The year 1846 is also the year of the Donner Party's attempt to reach California. In chapter 10 of the Oregon Trail, Parkman mentions them, although not by name. He has stopped at a place he calls Richard's trading-house (TLA.OT: 118) near Fort Laramie. A group of emigrants on their way to California are there, and Parkman is introduced to a Colonel R----- who is the emigrants' erstwhile leader.\\"Fearful was the fate that months after overtook some of the members of that party. General Kearny, on his late return from California, brought in the account how they were interrupted by the deep snows among the mountains, and maddened by cold and hunger, fed upon each other's flesh!\\" (TLA.OT:121)If Parkman actually talked with or recalled the face of anyone from the Donner Party, he doesn't mention it, and the above quotation is all he says of them. The Colonel R------ is William Henry Russell (1802-1873). The Donner Party was, in fact, part of the Russell Party before going off on its own via the Hastings Cut-Off after crossing the Continental Divide through the South Pass. At the time Parkman is speaking with him, Russell has been deposed as leader, but the Donner Party has not yet split off. \\"His men, he [Russell] said, had mutinied and deposed him; but still he exercised over them the influence of a superior mind; in all but the name he was yet their chief.\\" (TLA.OT:121) Lilburn Boggs eventually took over leadership of the Russell Party (see, for example, Ethan Rarick's Deparate Passage: The Donner Party's Perilous Journey West, page 51), but Parkman does not mention Boggs. This narrative of Parkman's experiences on the Oregon Trail can then be read as concurrent (up to a time) with the tragic experiences of the Donner Party.California emigrants took the Oregon Trail until after crossing the Continental Divide through the South Pass, and so spent part of their journey with emigrants to Oregon; but Parkman was not on the Oregon Trail as an emigrant at all. In fact, he doesn't appear to have even reached the Continental Divide. The book has no map of his travels, and he's not always clear, but he seems to have gotten only as far on the Oregon Trail as Fort Laramie. While there he learns of an upcoming gathering of \\"Dahcotah\\" Indians, waging war against the Snake Indians. An \\"Ogillallah\\" chief, called the Whirlwind, has lost a son in battle, and he is determined to \\"chastise the Snakes\\". Parkman learns that the gathering will take place \\"at 'La Bonte's Camp,' on the Platte. Here their warlike rites were to be celebrated with more than ordinary solemnity, and a thousand warriors, as it was said, were to set out for the enemy's country.\\" (TLA.OT: 110-11) Parkman is overjoyed.\\"I was greatly rejoiced to hear of it. I had come into the country almost exclusively with a view of observing the Indian character. Having from childhood felt a curiosity on this subject, and having failed completely to gratify it by reading, I resolved to have recourse to observation. I wished to satisfy myself with regard to the position of the Indians among the races of men; the vices and the virtues that have sprung from their innate character and from their modes of life, their government, their superstitions, and their domestic situation. To accomplish my purpose it was necessary to live in the midst of them, and become, as it were, one of them. I proposed to join a village, and make myself an inmate of one of their lodges; and henceforward this narrative, so far as I am concerned, will be chiefly a record of the progress of this design, apparently so easy of accomplishment, and the unexpected impediments that opposed it.\\" (TLA.OT:111)So Parkman resolves to be at 'La Bonte's Camp' for the upcoming Dahcotah rendezvous. Several chapters cover his journey there and his adventures with the Dahcotah, including a buffalo hunt and time spent in the Black Hills. He and his companions eventually return to Fort Laramie and from there head south, down to Bent's Fort on the Santa Fe Trail. They hunt buffalo along the Arkansas river, and journey east towards Fort Leavenworth and civilization, essentially completing their circuit.\\"We had met with signal good fortune. Although for five months we had been traveling with an insufficient force through a country where were were at any moment liable to depredation, not a single animal had been stolen from us. And our only loss had been one old mule bitten to death by a rattlesnake. Three weeks after we reached the frontier [by which he means the western edge of the United States as it stood in the midst of the Mexican War of 1846], the Pawnees and the Camanches [sic] began a regular series of hostilities on the Arkansas trail, killing men and driving off horses. They attacked, without exception, every party, large or small, that passed during the next six months.\\" (TLA.OT: 337)"},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The Oregon Trail by Francis Parkman is an account which further enforces the history of the Oregon Trail we had learned about in [U.S. History] class. The book portrays what it must have been like to travel on the Trail, never knowing what the next day would bring. The buffalo hunting which took place throughout the book became monotonous and boring after the first exciting few, but other than that repetitiveness, the journey was well depicted. I especially enjoyed Parkman's in-depth descriptions given to the reader of the people he meets on his journey and his observations on their actions as well. His vivid imagery of scenes from nature such as animals, prairie landscapes, and the weather, place the reader right next to Parkman in his adventuresome expedition. There are some dull, repetitive points in the observations made by the author, but aside from that his autobiographical telling of his journey is unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Before his death in the early 1890's, Francis Parkman would be hailed by many as North America's greatest historian. One of his first major works, The Oregon Trail, illustrates why. Written in 1847, the book chronicles an extensive journey undertaken by the youthful Parkman and his loyal friend Quincy Shaw the previous spring and summer. Parkman's express purpose was to see the \\"real\\" American West and live among \\"real\\" American Indians before their way of life passed forever. A vigorous young man, possessed of a keen intellect and observant eye, and already blessed with a rare and masterful prose style, Parkman chronicles his journey from St. Louis into the heart of the largely \\"unknown\\" American Plains. Peopled then by only a few white traders, trappers and ruffians slowly pushing their way into the domain of the Pawnee, Comanche, Arapaho, Dakota, \\"Shienne\\", Snakes and Crows, the West was a truly wild and dangerous place - and Parkman revels in it, providing meticulous descriptions of the landscape, people, and struggle for life and lifeways that would soon be no more.Along the way Parkman introduces you to the men of Fort Laramie (established and maintained by traders long before soldiers came to the territory), lives amongst a Dakota band, hunts buffalo, weathers awe-inspiring Plains' thunderstorms and periods of drought, explores the Black Hills, the Rocky Mountains, and New Mexico. His journey takes him up the Missouri River, the Platte, the Arkansas and more. And far more than describe fascinating places and events, Parkman charms with full renderings of the characters he meets along the way: redoubtable hunter and guide Henry Chatillion, muleteer and cook Delorier, the dolorous Raymond and Reynal, jester Tete Rouge, hundreds of loathesome \\"pioneers\\", Indians Mene-Seela, Smoke, Whirlwind, Hail Storm, Big Crow and more. All characters worthy of Mark Twain. We are also made witness to Parkman and Shaw's slow transformation from adventurous young Bostonian scholars to worthy \\"plainsmen\\".Even before finishing his college studies, Parkman declared that his ambition was to chronicle the \\"struggle for the continent\\". He achieved his goal in glorious measure. Parkman's works on the founding of \\"New France\\", LaSalle's explorations, the French/Indian Wars, Pontiac's conspiracy, Montcalm and Wolfe, etc., remain standards today, rich source material for authors from DeVoto to Eckert.His brilliance lies in the fact that Parkman was no \\"arm chair\\" historian. His research was not limited to books and papers found in libraries from Boston to London and Paris. He personally visited nearly every town, battlefield, and waterway he wrote about. Parkman was also deeply committed to understanding the effects of the English/French/American struggles for the continent on the hundreds of North American tribes that were caught in the middle. To wit, the \\"Oregon Trail\\" trip to the Plains of the 1840s was designed to assist the historian's mind in understanding what was lost by eastern tribes decimated during the wars and land-lust of the preceding century. Even then Parkman foresaw a similar misfortune for western tribes: loss of free roaming on their ancestral lands; extinction of the buffalo; the ravaging effects of disease, whiskey and other evils of white contact. But Parkman was no romantic. He refers to the various tribes and some individuals (both white and red) as \\"savages\\", revealing a touch of his mid-1800s Bostonian elitism, yet by no means can Parkman be considered a closed-minded misanthrope. His life's work, starting with The Oregon Trail, reveals far too much sensitivity and fairness of thought for that label to stick. Read this, then dive into Parkman's later work on the history of Canada and early America. It is astonishingly good stuff!"},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I have read and enjoyed all of Parkman's historical works concerning the French and Indian Wars. I did not find \\"The Oregon Trail\\" to be nearly so engaging as his other books. Obviously, the book is a valuable first-person account of the great plains during the mid-1840s. Most especially Parkman's observations of the Indians among whom he spent a good deal of time. That being said, I found the account to be somewhat tedious and redundant and would only recommend it to someone with a particular interest in the plains Indians or the westward expansion of that period. I listened to the unabridged Audible Audio version of the book."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This book was named before it was finished and then the title changed to make it more fitting.

It was \\"breaking away\\", \\"a testing of self\\", \\"seeing the world\\", \\"the search for the other\\" or maybe just drugs and a hippie vibe. In 1846, a Harvard graduate certainly didn't have such an option, but still he could choose not to travel across to Europe for the usual Grand Tour. The 20th century European travelers in Asia viewed the various peoples they met with a mix of incomprehension, awe, prejudice, and myth. Parkman's account of a journey to the high plains of America reminded me of the latter day tales immensely, though in his day, \\"cultural relativity\\" had not been thought of. At 23, just out of Harvard, he and another Boston friend headed for the West, then just being opened up (or invaded) by overland pioneers, Mormons, trappers, buffalo hunters, and soldiers. Parkman and Co. travelled through Kansas, Nebraska, and into parts of South Dakota, Wyoming and Colorado. He met many Indians, spending a couple months with an Oglala Dakota band. Totally ignorant of their language and assuming innate understanding on his own part, he drew a rather biased portrait. Yet such is the skill of his writing and his feel for drama, that any reader will still, over 160 years later, find this book hard to put down. His descriptions of the land, the storms, the vast herds of bison, the rugged but raggedy trappers and mountain men, and the look and behavior of the Indians is as vivid as a book of photographs. Parkman has left us an invaluable document whatever its shortcomings. He provides us with a rare look at an America now completely disappeared. After all, \\"Overland to India\\" occurred in the Age of Photography, but Parkman had no camera. To have written this book despite being in bad health for most of the trip is indeed an achievement. It's an American classic well-deserving of the name, despite its jaundiced treatment of the so-called savages, who hosted him, helped him, and never hurt him. That bias too is part of the same history."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I ordered this book based on the film, \\" The Oregan Trail,\\" which I enjoyed watching. The book is a good follow-up to the movie, making much of the content even more real for me."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Parkman's travelogue on the Great Plains is a major work of life among the Native Americans. His descriptions are honest and capture a society that was fading even while he was writing. The book had a major impact on the way that non-westerners saw the Great Plains. This was both good and bad. Parkman wrote through the lens of a Boston aristocrat and was full of prejudices against those who did not meet his standards. This was dangerous in that many who read about the \\"backwardness\\" of the Native Americans used this as justification for \\"civilizing\\" them. Although this was probably not Parkman's intention, it was a consequence of his writing. In addition, he promoted the hunting of buffalo for sport, which led to the decimation of the buffalo heards on the Plains.Another major issue with this book is that, in spite of its title, it is not about the Oregon Trail. Parkman went no further than the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains and he did all in his power to dissociate himself from the pioneers moving along the Oregon Trail. If you are looking for a history of the trail, this book will not satisfy your needs.However, in spite of the misleading title and the prejudices that surface throughout the book, it is still a fine piece of writing that opens up a world that has been lost to today's readers. Read it and enjoy your travels into another time and place."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The Oregon Trail is an undeniable classic -- although overrated compared to other books written about the same time about the same subject. Parkman is a priggish, Boston snob who complains his way across the West. He despises the pioneers crossing the plains and has no interest in them -- a startling lack of consciousness for a historian. The Indians and the mountain men fare little better. A better, more generous book by a young man in the west is Wah-to-Yah and the Taos Trail by Lewis H. Garrard.Smallchief"},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This book is very well written. His description of the plains, Black Hills and wildlife make you feel like you were there. It is amazing how little the landscape has changed between the 1840s and today, especially Western Nebraska.Francis was a lucky man to survive the journey; however, he gave no indication that he was fortunate. The follies and close calls were just a day in the life of an Oregon Trail traveler.His time spent with the Dakota Indians was most intriguing. At times Francis would show respect for the Indians while his opinion of their lifestyle and culture was one of disrespect and crudeness.The book does get bogged down in the latter half with the wasteful killing of buffalo and almost anything that moved (antelope, elk, birds, rattle snake, etc.). It seemed as though a herd of buffalo would appear at every crest or vista, which would prompt Parkman and his travel mates go on a killing spree. The tails and tongues of the bulls were cut off and placed on the shooters saddle. Bull meat was almost never eaten and the carcasses were left for the wolves and buzzards."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This book was a disappointment to me and I should have researched it more before purchasing it. It was my hope to read about the settlers moving West on the old Oregon Trail but this book had nothing to do with that. Instead, it was an account of Parkman's experiences as he traveled in some of the Western areas of the U.S. (Wyoming area, Black Hills, etc.) Much of his time was spent with the various Indian tribes as he befriended them and learned much of their culture. He also spent a great deal of time hunting. My real problem with his story is that it was so repetitive. Many of the accounts were similar and it seemed like we were going over and over the same thing. I read almost every thing I can find on Western adventure and exploration but this one is sure not on the top of my list."},{"Title":"Unholy War","review":"This well researched and footnoted book is not an attack on the church but an overdue examination of historical facts. In history there were popes who protected the Jewish people. For example,The Borgia Pope Alexander VIwelcomed those who sought refuge in Rome after the expulsion from Spain in 1492 and also allowed the immigration of those expelled from Portugal in 1497 and Provence in 1498. Others were Gregory IX, Innocent IV, Clement IV and Clement IX. In this work, the author never criticizes Christian theology and takes care to discuss the extenuating circumstances that contributed to the attitudes and behavior of the church in the period following the French Revolution.Part One examines the treatment of Jewish residents of the Papal States from 1814 when Pius VII returned after Napoleon's defeat. He revoked their rights and re-imposed all the previous discriminatory laws as regards place of residence, travel, occupation and clothing. Only in 1870 were they released from the ghetto when Italy finally incorporated Rome as its capital. There were also ugly instances of the kidnapping of children and other forms of cruelty. Kertzer places this oppressive climate in the historical context of the church's abhorrence of everything associated with the French revolution and ideas of the Enlightenment.Part Two covers the latter part of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, focusing on church attitudes as expressed through publications like L'osservatore Romano, La Croix and the Jesuit organ Civilta Cattolica. The work of authors like Edouard Drumont and Ernest Jouin (who championed the infamous Protocols of the Elders of Zion) is also investigated here. It is clear that the Vatican encouraged Antisemitic writings and supported anti-Jewish political movements in Austria, Poland and France. The familiar old smears of a conspiracy, of evil intentions towards Christians, of control over the banks and the press, lack of patriotism and blood libel were indulged in. Kertzer even provides evidence of racism in this literature.The years between the wars are explored in Part Three, with the emphasis on Achille Ratti who became Pope Pius XI, as well as church relations with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. The conclusion is depressing but inescapable: the church did contribute to creating a climate of Antisemitism in the decades that led up to the Holocaust. Of course it was not the only institution, as Dennis Prager illustrates so well in his bookWhy the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism. Antisemitism has been present throughout history - in the ancient world, from early Christianity onwards, in Lutheranism, in Islam, the Enlightenment andaround the political spectrumof Europe in the 20th century.Itslatest manifestationcomes in the disguise of anti-Zionism, mainly on the Left but also on the Traditionalist Right, in academia, in the mass media and in the Arab World. Examples of the aforementioned are documented by Bernard Harrison inThe Resurgence of Anti-Semitism: Jews, Israel, and Liberal Opinion, Abraham Foxman inThe Deadliest Lies: The Israel Lobby and the Myth of Jewish Controlwhere he investigates the antics of Jimmy Carter and Walt & Mearsheimer, Nick Cohen in his bookWhat's Left?where he examines the phenomenon in the UK, andPeace: The Arabian Caricature of Anti-Semitic Imageryby Arieh Stav.In his compelling book, Kertzer provides an interesting history of Italy in the 1800s, illumines a previously obscure aspect of the history of Antisemitism and also disputes the 1998 Vatican report which conceded that the church had a history of anti-Judaism but claimed it was not responsible for the hatred that culminated in the Holocaust. He does not deal with the important role of Martin Luther in the development of German Antisemitism but he does prove that for about 150 years the Catholic Church condoned or encouraged the full spectrum of prejudices characteristic of this old hatred, including the irrational notion that Jews were simultaneously responsible for capitalism and communism.This book ought to serve as an urgent warning about what is transpiring today. The Christian Left is scapegoating Israel ever more harshly, especially organizations like the World Council of Churches and certain mainstream Protestant denominations with their attempts at divestment. As regards the Catholic Church after the second world war, in his book Contrary to Popular Opinion Alan Dershowitz chronicles manifestations of the continent's enduring plague during and after the fall of communism in the chapter titled European Antisemitism, with the emphasis on the church in Poland. And there is Michel Sabbah, Catholic Patriarch of Jerusalem, an implacable foe of the Jewish State.The best book on the subject of Christian anti(Zion-)Semitism isChristian Attitudes Towards the State of Israelby Paul Charles Merkley. Finally, there is a thought-provoking book drawing on the wisdom of the Bible that explains how to deal with this ancient hatred,The Dawn: Political Teachings of the Book of Estherby Yoram Hazony. Unholy War includes an appendix of Popes and their Secretaries of State, voluminous notes arranged by chapter, a section of references cited and an index."},{"Title":"Clinical pharmacology","review":"An excellent book.I have been teaching clinical pharmacology from this book to paramedics,undrgraduate and postgraduate students without the need to consult bigger textbooks or reference books.

This happens very rarely, but when it does, the world simply stops as I lose myself within the pages of the text. I am happy to report that RICHARD MATHESON'S KOLCHAK SCRIPTS is one such book. As I read the adventures (and mis-adventures) of journalist Carl Kolchak, as he stumbled across vampires, serial killers, and government conspiracies, the outside world paused, and I was literally enthralled until I had read the book cover-to-cover.As the title implies, this 400-page volume contains all of the scripts that Richard Matheson (author of I AM LEGEND, HELL HOUSE, and numerous others) wrote in the early 1970's using the character Carl Kolchak. The first two scripts, THE NIGHT STALKER and THE NIGHT STRANGLER were produced by Dan Curtis (of DARK SHADOWS fame) and televised as TV-movies, which eventually led to Kolchak's short-lived ABC TV-series. As an exceptional bonus, the book also contains Matheson's third script, co-written by William F. Nolan (co-author of LOGAN'S RUN), which was never produced.In addition to the three scripts, editor Mark Dawidziak has supplied a plethora of supplemental information, placing the scripts in their proper historical place, enlightening the reader to all the background struggles of producing and writing the show, and also examining Kolchak's continued popularity. The lengthy appendix offers rare photographs, a glimpse at Richard Matheson's lengthy writing career, and an episode guide to THE NIGHT STALKER TV-series. These supplemental materials help to illuminate the scripts, and are also quite entertaining and informative in their own right.The scripts themselves, which are reproduced from the original script pages, are fascinating. Matheson is completely in his element here - his dialogue is crisp, his pacing is sharp, and, using only the written word, he is able to create scenes that play in the readers mind just as they would on a television screen. In some respects, the scripts read even better than they were eventually filmed. The original scripts for the produced TV-movies offer an unadulterated view of the storyline as it was originally intended, and offer not only additional dialogue, but occasionally whole new scenes!The unproduced script, titled THE NIGHT KILLERS, is worth discussing in its own right. Sometimes, when reading unproduced scripts, it becomes quickly apparent why they were left on the shelf. THE NIGHT KILLERS, however, is superior to THE NIGHT STRANGLERS, in my opinion. It breaks from the formula of the first two TV-movies, and veers into X-FILES territory, over 20 years before The X-FILES was even on the air! A brilliant mix of conspiracy and intrigue, it showcases both Matheson and Nolan's imaginations, as well as their ear for clever dialogue.In the end, Carl Kolchak will probably never be a household name. He deserves recognition, though, because he was the forefather of all the supernatural and conspiracy themed TV-shows, movies, and novels that would follow. TV-series such as the X-FILES and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER owe Kolchak a great debt, as THE KOLCHAK SCRIPTS proves, time and again. Ultimately, this is a fascinating look at a fascinating character, and well worth your attention. Any fan of Kolchak, Matheson, or Nolan owes it to themselves to check out this book.RICHARD MATHESON'S KOLCHAK SCRIPTS is limited to 552 copies, which helps to explain its $150 price tag. (A brief sidenote: at 400 pages, that comes out to almost 38 cents per page. After reading the book, I had to ask myself if I believed I got 38 cents of enjoyment out of each page, and, in the end, I decided that I did. Yes, it's a big investment, but when one considers the limited nature of the book, in addition to its content, I think its worth the price of admission. Besides, a quick look at ebay reveals that you can't even find the DVD of THE NIGHT STALKER for less than $125!)"},{"Title":"Richard Matheson's Kolchak Scripts","review":"What a book! Mark Dawidziak, author of all things Kolchak (a series companion, an original novel, AND a comic book adventure), collects together, for the first time anywhere, the three teleplays written by Richard Matheson that introduced the world to the rumpled reporter hero that is Carl Kolchak. The first is an adaptation of The Night Stalker, the story that started it all. A serial killer is stalking Las Vegas. One who only attacks at night and drains the blood from his victims. When Kolchak finally sees the killer effortlessly escape from the police, he figures out that it isn't someone who thinks he is a vampire. The killer IS one! Matheson's final script differs a bit from what actually made it to the television screen (this includes an entirely different take on the ending) because Jeff Rice, the author of the first Kolchak novel, was called in to do some rewrites. The Night Strangler was the 'rushed' sequel to the ratings blockbuster. The comfortably similar yet all new mystery with the returning favorites (Kolchak and his always suffering, yet oddly supportive, editor, Tony Vincenzo) and a cast of lively newcomers shows all the hard work that Matheson put into a story that was almost impossible for him to write. Considering how hard the second script was, it comes as no surprise that screenwriting chores were shared with William F. Nolan for The Night Killers, the third and unproduced Kolchak movie. It is this funny and suspense filled mystery (featuring aliens and robots) that makes the anthology worth it - for it finally gives Night Stalker fans the chance to see the Kolchak adventure that never was. To me it is the best script of the bunch, with Matheson so completely comfortable with the characters that you can hear/see McGavin and Oakland going through the paces while Nolan crafts a first rate mystery that takes them in new directions. The third time was the charm and, considering the high standards set with the previous installments, that is saying a lot. No Kolchak fans should be without this. Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Richard Matheson's Kolchak Scripts","review":"It has taken some time to contemplate what it is I want to say about this book. Not because there is nothing to say, but rather because I don't know where to begin. The &quot;Kolchak Scripts&quot; is a superb compendium of information with scripts from &quot;The Night Stalker&quot; (1972 ABC) , &quot;The Night Strangler&quot; (1973 ABC), and the &quot;Night Killers&quot; (1974 ABC). It also includes introductions from Mark Dawidziak for each script that delivers a timeline of information that flows throughout this book.The scripts themselves would have been enough, but great care and thought was used putting this project together. Not only does it leave you knowing the legend of Kolchak, but the legend of Matheson himself. You become privy to the whole process of going from paper to screen, network issues, and more. Dawidziak does a wonderful job of giving you the information you need and want without wasting a crumb.

But the one by Emms has more recent games, and Emms comes up with more suggestions for Black in what I feel are some key lines.After 1 e4 d5, White can play 2 e5, 2 Nc3, 2 Nf3, 2 d4, or, of course, 2 dxe5.

I think a repertoire book on the Scandinavian ought to say something about 2 Nf3 and 2 d4, but neither Plaskett nor Emms give these moves any real space.When White plays 2 exd5, White can play 2...Qxd5 or 2...Nf6. I play the latter move. But both Emms and Plaskett spend plenty of space on 2...Qxd5. Their emphases are different, though! After 3 Nc3 (both books mention 3 d4 as well), Plaskett has 8 pages on 3...Qd8, 11 pages on 3...Qe5+, only 21 pages on 3...Qa5, and 51 pages on 3...Qd6. Emms has 2 pages on 3...Qd8, 3 pages on 3...Qe5+, 74 pages on 3...Qa5, and only 9 pages on 3...Qd6. By the way, if you want to play 3...Qd6 you may want to get the book on it by Michael Melts as well.Of course, you may play what I think is the objectively stronger move, 2...Nf6. Both Plaskett and Emms have some good material on 3 Bb5+. But the two moves you'll generally face are 3 d4 and 3 c4.3 d4 may be the strongest White move. Black can play 3...Nxd5, the main line, and come under some strong White pressure. Or Black can try the possibly unsound Portuguese Variation, 3...Bg4. Plaskett has 38 pages on the Portuguese, and if you play it, I think you may want to get Selby Anderson's book on it as well. However, I don't play the Portuguese, and I think Emms has better advice on how to survive in the 3...Nxd5 lines.3 c4 is the other main White try. It tends to transpose into the Panov-Botvinnik attack against the Caro-Kann. But Plaskett lets us down by not covering the Panov at all, while Emms at least has an interesting recommendation for Black after 3 c4 c6 4 d4 cxd5 5 Nc3 e6 6 Nf3 Bb4.I prefer not to defend against the Panov-Botvinnik attack, and I generally prefer the move ...e6 to ...c6, so I play the Icelandic Gambit (1 e4 d5 2 exd5 Nf6 3 c4 e6). Plaskett spends 15 pages on this, while Emms has only 8 pages, but I prefer Emms' treatment. Both Plaskett and Emms agree that 4 dxe6 Bxe6 5 Nf3 is the most dangerous try for White. But while Plaskett simply recommends avoiding the gambit with Black, Emms at least tries to offer a playable line with Black, namely 5...Qe7 6 Qe2 Nc6 7 d4 Bg4. That's what I think is best. Surprisingly, neither Plaskett nor Emms look at the line Andrew Martin recommends in \\"Secret Weapons,\\" namely 5...c5 6 d4 cxd4 7 Nxd4 Bc5 8 Be3 Qb6.Still, I like this book and I enjoyed the writing style of the author."},{"Title":"Scandinavian Defence","review":"This book is basically a collection of games played in the Scandinavian Defence, VERY poorly annotated by the author. Don't expect to learn anything from the author's comments to these games. No insights about what's going on, no discussion of ideas or plans for either side.

The beginning date was advanced to include the Reconstruction period; the terminal date of 1933 was chosen because the philosophical and psychological ties between the South and the farm policy-makers had been clearly delineated by this time, and because after the First World War the region had a less diversified farmer movement than the Middle West.--- from book's back cover"},{"Title":"Pass the Polenta: And Other Writings from the Kitchen","review":"Lust has intoxicated me with her writing where words strung together become magnificent aromas, memories of familial kitchen ethnic cooking, raising chickens, Pop's garden, and life growing up in the kitchen where everything was prepared fresh, from scratch, and with favorite family recipes.

But this book is based on a true account of a couple's perilous chase by snowmobile across the subarctic Canadian barrens in pursuit of thugs who have just made an attempt on their lives. The man, a half Montagnais half Naskapi, has turned to smuggling as a way to make a living in the midst of North American society that has skewed values and despoiled his land; now at great risk, he must protect his interests. Rick Hornung tells his deeply distressing story with exhilarating skill."},{"Title":"At the Edge of All Things: In Search of Labrador","review":"In sparse and elegant prose, Hornung takes his reader through the harsh and jagged twists of an unforgiving land. By telling the story of a man who casts himself out of his homeland and into an underworld of smugglers, this book provides a unique perspective on life in the remote areas of North America. When following Martin Rouleau's journey, the reader will travel into the cracks that are etched into the rocks of Canada -- the rifts between whites and aboriginals, the fissures amongst different aboriginal communities, the tensions between French and English speaking Canadians. This is a fascinating book; and, it's a must read for anyone interested in the survival of aboriginals living in the northern climate."},{"Title":"At the Edge of All Things: In Search of Labrador","review":"The cognitive title, AT THE EDGE OF ALL THINGS, plunges the reader onto an undeniable trail. The book itself is beautious to hold with no detail overlooked -- including typesetting, cover design and binding. But the true beauty is found in Rick Hornung's fascinating narrative as he navigates through unfamiliar territory on a quest for understanding the black-market life of Martin Rouleau. Hornung artfully makes his journey and Martin's journey our own journey, taking his readers far beyond the backyard, and into the weathered rock and heart of Labrador."},{"Title":"At the Edge of All Things: In Search of Labrador","review":"At the Edge of All Things: In Search of Labrador by Rick Hornung tells the story of First Nations smugglers in northern Labrador. The format of the story resembles a novel, and the abundant dialogue only emphasizes this perception. The storyline is introduced in the prologue, when the central character, Martin Rouleau, tells it to the author after the latter hires Rouleau to take him on a caribou hunt in northern Labrador. In between the tale of travelling to the Labrador peninsula, shooting, drawing and quartering caribou in the prologue and epilogue, Hornung writes about Rouleau's adventures snowmobiling and smuggling to and from remote Labrador native communities.Rouleau has a team who pilots the goods in, stores and distributes the contraband, which is mainly cigarettes and alcohol. He has colleagues who score drug deals for him in Montreal and who bring in more money so that he can buy more contraband. The focus of At the Edge of All Things is Rouleau's search for the gang who torched his remote cabin--while he and his girlfriend, also a smuggler, were still asleep in it. While continuing to bring in booze and drugs to the native communities, Rouleau devises a plan to seek revenge on those who destroyed his cabin and all of its stored contraband.Rouleau shares his own personal history of growing up half Montagnais and half Naskapi in Labrador, at a time when the peninsula was being carved up by mining companies, native groups and the new province of Newfoundland. Multiple new place names are dropped on every page and the map that is featured on the inside cover is regrettably too small and too general to chart most of them. Unfortunately I could not follow Rouleau's smuggling journey across the province, however his final journey, in search of the arsonists, is mapped out.Hornung describes wintry Labrador with the eyes of a true explorer, and every colour of every rock, each snag in the trail and every snowmobile switchback is painted with precision. The exposed granite and ore are streaked with rainbow hues that change colour as the sun rises and sets, and one can feel one's own fingertips freeze when Rouleau must set up his outdoor tent and tie the stakes together.The detail does get tiring however when the reader stumbles across, yet again, another reference to an \\"L-shaped depression\\" or an \\"L-shaped jag\\". Labrador must have been created by God wielding an enormous cookie-cutter shaped like an L. Hornung also uses the verb \\"zigzag\\" and \\"zigzagging\\" far too often; it is not hard at all to open the book to any page at random and find these words popping out at you."},{"Title":"A Cry in the Night (Silhouette Intimate Moments No. 1186)","review":"Rocky Mountain Search and Rescue is back! This time it's Buzz Malone, searching for a four-year-old boy lost on a mountain with an out-of-control forest fire headed his way. Worse, the victim isn't just any little boy--it's his son, a child he never knew he had until he was in danger of losing him. His ex-wife, Kelly, had kept little Eddie a secret because Buzz had made it clear he did not want children. Now Buzz and Kelly must join forces, putting their differences aside to track Eddie down before something terrible happens.In this gripping, emotional story, Linda Castillo deftly blends the turbulent feelings of a couple who love almost too deeply, pitted against the indifferent ravages of nature. The richly drawn setting adds intensity to the story, and the action scenes, depicted in a fresh and bold manner, kept the pages turning. A great read from a consistently entertaining author. (And the eye-catching cover doesn't hurt matters!)"},{"Title":"A Cry in the Night (Silhouette Intimate Moments No. 1186)","review":"A deadly firewall moves through the Rocky Mountains, threatening a lost four-year-old boy. A simple accident had separated him from his mother Kelly Malone. Now she must ask the help of the best search and rescue worker she knows, Buzz, her ex-husband. But she never told him that they share a child. Seeing Buzz again makes Kelly realize that she had never gotten him out of her system.Buzz made it clear that he never wanted children, even when it destroyed his marriage. Kelly's revelations leaves him stunned, and he knows that he must keep his dark and volatile emotions under check if he is to find his son. Worse, he knows that if he gives in to the impulse to offer Kelly comfort, he opens a door he had worked very hard to close, no matter what lies on the other side.Author Linda Castillo creates an emotionally complex romantic suspense in A CRY IN THE NIGHT. As Kelly and Buzz listen for a cry in the night, the voice of their lost child, they confront the pain of the past and tentative hope for the future in every glance and every touch. Their child's periodic point of view adds an entrancing innocence that sharply juxtaposes the dangers of him wandering lost and alone in the wilderness. A compelling novel that readers will find impossible to put down, A CRY IN THE NIGHT comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Cry in the Night (Silhouette Intimate Moments No. 1186)","review":"I am a fairly new reader of Linda Castillo's books, but she has become one of my favo rites.

Surprisingly, and disappointingly, it seems to have been all but forgotten. This is a shame because it's quite a fine book and well worth the attention of anyone interested in these difficult topics.I remember it as being almost in the form of an extended, musing essay, full of interesting surprises and insights -- the kind of book which makes you think about things differently than you did before without really being able to put words to it.

I have read and used Mitchell's hiking books in the past and have been pleased with them, but when it came down to choosing a good canoeing guide, Gertler's book covers several more streams and rivers and gives much more thorough and in-depth descriptions.Gertler includes many great maps that label access points, hazards, and road names and numbers. I wish he had included camping areas on his maps, but alas, he did not. His descriptions are thorough and at times humorous, and he includes extra information like nice pieces of scenery to look for and information on water gauges.What could be considered either a weakness or strength is that Gertler excluded lakes and reservoirs from his book. I do not consider this to be a downside, because lakes are generally calm and flat, and do not pose many hazards like rivers and streams do. Therefore, devoting a lot of text to them is unnecessary. Plus, information about publically accessible lakes is readily available on the web, unlike many of the smaller streams Gertler has in his book."},{"Title":"Anxiety at 35,000 Feet: An Introduction to Clinical Aerospace Psychology (Forensic Psychotherapy Monograph Series)","review":"This is a fine book that is as the subtitle states an 'introduction to clinical aerospace psychology.'

One of the things I love about a good science fiction anthology is the way your brain has to shift gears with each tale, groping around for clues to discover if you are on another planet, in an alternative history, far into a strange future, or still in the here and now. This anthology provides a fantastic range of settings. You've got straight up space opera (in the most literal sense of the words) with \\"Callus Redux\\" by Rebecca Carmi, a hard-boiled mystery caper in Eugie Fosters \\"All in My Mind,\\" a really cool cowboy tale in \\"The Bear Eater\\" by Paul Pence, and the tale of a comet hunt told in a Native American folk style by David Levine in \\"Ukaliq and the Great Hunt.\\" The tone swings from the truly horrific in Kyle David Jelle's \\"Hidden Scars\\" to more playful tales like Carl Frederick's Yeti hunt, \\"The Beast of All Possible Worlds.\\"Let me single out a couple of favorites. \\"Hidden Scars\\" is a deeply disturbing story. Jelle plunges us into an underworld of people who have dark secrets and go to extreme lengths to keep them. You know the story is going to haunt you right from the opening line: \\"I love women with scars on their wrists.\\" Jelle's cool, unflinching narrator leads us into a tale of the worst possible human behavior. This is outstanding work, and I can't wait to read more from this promising writer.\\"The Bear Eater\\" was the anthology's biggest surprise. Paul Pence tells the the simplest story in the anthology, and the most suspenseful. A trapper in the old West finds himself stalking a beast big enough to eat bears. The story reminded me of the best of Jack London's adventure stories, a gritty life or death struggle of man versus beast, an intense page turner that keeps you guessing what's next. Highly recommended.Finally, the cover story, \\"Hitting the Skids in Pixeltown,\\" by Matthew Rotundo, is a nice artistic argument against the coming age when humans will vanish from film-making, replaced by virtual computer generated doubles. This story takes a gamble by attempting to anticipate the near future of film making, when films such at this summer's \\"Hulk\\" already seem to be landing with their toes already over the line of that future. I'm not 100% convinced I buy the premise that actual humans on film trump virtual creations--\\"Finding Nemo\\" would have been rather silly with actors in scuba gear and fish masks--but the story still works because Rotundo has crafted a bit of virtual magic of his own. His fictional characters instantly seem real, and you want their attempt at making an \\"honest\\" film free of digital magic to succeed. This is good, solid, story-telling.In fact, the whole book is filled with solid stories. Buy a copy. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hitting the Skids in Pixeltown: The Phobos Science Fiction Anthology (Volume 2)","review":"Collaboratively compiled and edited by Orson Scott Card, Keith Olexa, and Christian O'Toole, Hitting The Skids In Pixeltown: The Phobos Science Fiction Anthology - Volume 2 collects twelve winning stories from the 2nd annual Phobos fiction contest, as judged by seven distinguished individuals including celebrated authors Orson Scott Card and Larry Niven, and NASA astronaut Marsha Ivins.

Young, enthusiastic, exceedingly bright, and seemingly undaunted at the prospect of swimming against the current, Jason shares with us his passion for sustainable design. Having spent the formative years of his career working with the veritable giants of the sustainable design field, Jason shares his unique perspectives and experiences that today's up and coming green warriors can only dream of.A must for any aspiring architect, Jason takes the reader through the entire series of timeless principles that form the very foundation of sustainable design with loads of practical examples and current references to help empower the reader to internalize and apply those principles in their own practice. At the end of our journey, we are convinced that it is the rest of the world that is, in fact, swimming against the current, and we are emboldened and encouraged to follow our instincts, and are reminded that good design not only can, but in fact must be sustainable. He also dedicates an entire chapter to predicting the future of architecture, complete with a timeline for the next 100 years!Jason specifically reaches out to encourage the next generation of green warriors with a chapter dedicated to understanding the drivers of, and barriers to, sustainable design in today's corporate structures and design firms, giving the reader a helpful \\"big picture\\" overview to help recognize the progress of an organization's corporate culture on the path to sustainability, and to better understand how to make a difference.To complete the package as an essential resource, the appendices include Jason's own \\"Green Warrior Reading List\\", & a \\"Who's Who in Green Design\\".A must-read for anyone serious about facilities design in the 21st. century."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Sustainable Design","review":"I came late to bioneering, after I was inspired by Herman Daly'sEcological Economics: Principles And Applications, Brian Czech'sShoveling Fuel for a Runaway Train: Errant Economists, Shameful Spenders, and a Plan to Stop them All; and everything by Paul Hawkin, but especiallyThe Ecology of Commerce.I have had an interest in the intersection of global science, sustainable political and social and economic orders, and the vulnerability of the nation-state in the face of growing complexity for some time, and many of my other reviews focus on these literatures, as well as the literatures of collective intelligence, global assemlages, wealth of networks, localized resilience, and so on.I make mention of that broader literature to add emphasis to my view that this book is one of the most extraordinary I have ever encountered. I made a mistake when I first got it months ago and put it sight unseen into my \\"hard and dense, save for intercontinental trip.\\" This book is not hard, not dense, and it is both easy to read and intellectually elegant. I can easily see this book as the single mandatory first year or summer pre-reading at any level--undergraduate or graduate--along with contextual books such as:High Noon 20 Global Problems, 20 Years to Solve ThemPlan B 3.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization, Third EditionThe Future of LifeThe leadership of civilization building: Administrative and civilization theory, symbolic dialogue, and citizen skills for the 21st centuryandCollective Intelligence: Creating a Prosperous World at PeaceThe sixteen chapters and five appendices are elegant--concise, clear key points, short, just the right mix of photos (including color in a center spread) figures, and text.The publisher has been criminally remiss in failing to load the varied items that Amazon allows, such as the table of contents. I am increasingly disenchanted with publishers and of the view that Amazon should get into the book publishing business, sending digital copies to FedExKinko's, helping authors self publish (full disclosure: BOTH Fred Smith at FedEx and Jeff Bezos at Amazon blew me off--these guys are simply not serious about innovation).Preface: Philosophical BeginningsChapter 1: The Philosophy of Sustainable DesignChapter 2: The Evolution of Sustainable DesignChapter 3: The Principles of Sustainable Design (Biomimicry)Chapter 4: The Principles of Sustainable Design (Human Vitality)Chapter 5: The Principles of Sustainable Design (Ecosystem/Bioregional)Chapter 6: The Principles of Sustainable Design (Seven Generations)Chapter 7: The Principles of Sustainable Design (Energy/True Cost)Chapter 8: The Principles of Sustainable Design (Holistic Thinking)Chapter 9: The Technologies and Components of Sustainable DesignChapter 10: Shades of Green--Levels of SustainabilityChapter 11: Productivity and Well-BeingChapter 12: Greening Your OrganizationChapter 13: Green EconomicsChapter 14: The Sustainable Design Process--Holistic ThinkingChapter 15: The Aesthetics of Sustainable DesignChapter 16: The Future of ArchitectureAppendix A: The Green Warrior Reading ListAppendix B: Who's Who in Green DesignAppendix C: The Phases of Green DesignAppendix D: The Elements of Green Design MethodologyAppendix F: The Principles of Sustainable Design--SummaryI put this book down with several thoughts:1) Enormously impressed with the University of Oregon in Eugene, to the point of trying to get my oldest to take his computer and creative skills there.2) Profoundly delighted with the deep philosophical underpinning that one finds throughout the book, without pretense or pomposity.3) The one appendix I would have liked to see that is not there is the one entitles: Green to Gold--Bottom-Line Dollar Savings Over Time, and then a whole range of the elements of sustainable design by climate zone.This is an extremely satisfying book to read. My last throught: it's time to write the Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth. Read more about this at Earth Intelligence Network. This book by Jason McLennan is a perfect model for what the larger systems book should strive to be.See also the literatures under panarchy, resilience, sustainability."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Sustainable Design","review":"This book is the new heavyweight contender of green building titles. If you liked Natural Capitalism by Hawkins and Lovins, you'll enjoy this book. It's more comprehensive and uses facts and figures more judiciously. I'm impressed with the author's courage to make predictions in a chapter on the future of sustainability. This book should be required reading for all architecture students."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Sustainable Design","review":"A very easy to read book that will help anyone, with or without an architecture or design background, to understand the basics of Sustainable Design. Well written, with very precise, intelligent, and oftentimes humorous commentary. Mr. McLennan knows his stuff, and the only thing in my mind that he could be faulted for is not going deep enough on some of the topics. That is the nature of the book, however. It is mean to be a high level overview of all aspects of Sustainable Design. Mr. McLennan has been very thorough, though, in including tons of references for those of us looking for a deeper understanding of any of the topics mentioned in the book. A must have for any aspiring architect or designer and a fabulous addition to any arcophile's library!"},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Sustainable Design","review":"This book should definitely be on the must-read list for anyone interesting in sustainability.

Victor goes into a depth that is very important for our degraded societal faults, but Mclennan's book takes this to a whole new level. I really wish there were more books like this out there. When I am finished, I will fulfill this review further, but until then I figure it can't hurt to tell people that this is book eliminates any reason to continue on the path we are on. Design may be a largely growing part of our lives right now, but there is no excuse for continuing in the direction we are moving. We are smarter than we have proven ourselves thus far, we just simply need to read books like this and change (however subtle or dramatic). Change isn't always good, but this time it is."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Sustainable Design","review":"Even though the book barely has any pictures, the information presented in it is incredibly valuable.

However, this time I am making an exception; and I hope you take a moment to read this, if you are seriously considering buying this book.I have been performing projects for several years at work; but recently, I began to receive expanded project responsibilities. I have never had formal project management training; and I decided it was time to look for resources to help me improve my planning and management practices. My boss and several colleagues highly recommended this book; and, after reading it, I can see why.This book is a wonderful resource for anyone who plans and performs projects. The author takes what could certainly be a very complex and dry topic and makes it seem logical and easy to apply in many different situations. His examples are to the point and easy to relate to. His discussions on several topics (for example, assigning team member roles, defining outcomes, identifying work to be performed) helped me see why several projects with which I had been involved in the past had failed. His insights on how to ensure the tools and techniques are used most effectively are invaluable.I was able immediately to start using many of the techniques at my job; and I saw their positive effects almost at once. I felt I had greater control over what happened in all aspects of my projects. I was even able to influence team members' behavior on some of the larger projects on which I was working.What really motivated me to write this review, however, was a review by Joseph Dewey that I saw on this site before I bought this book. After I read the book, I realized that, sadly, his \\"review\\" consisted mainly of a combination of unsubstantiated criticisms (\\"this is a bad book\\", \\"(the author) is a bad author\\", \\"(the author) is arrogant\\", etc.) and grossly exaggerated or just plain false statements (\\"I'm not kidding, every one of the 100 examples in this book follows the same model\\", \\"all the techniques sound the same\\", etc.).I understood that this review reflected the feelings and opinions of one person. However, it occurred to me that someone who had not read the book might read this review and actually believe some of what it says. And I truly feel it would be a shame, if this review caused even one person to miss out on this uniquely valuable resource. If you are seriously looking for insights and approaches to help you dramatically improve your project performance, I strongly suggest you buy this book."},{"Title":"Project Management For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"Individuals with any experience in running a project, whether it is a small focused job or a large-scale product development effort, will find subject treatises too fundamental. The chapters lack the in-depth coverage and focus as the apparent goal is to present a broad-based overview of basic concepts in the field of project management.Here is a guideline to use in deciding whether or not to purchase this book:How comfortable are you with using the Microsoft Project software?If you are very comfortable with MS Project, I recommend that you try &quot;A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge&quot; instead.If you have never used MS Project and/or have no idea what it does, then you should probably buy this book."},{"Title":"Project Management For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"Stan is an excellent trainer (I have attended 2 of his courses), and it turns out he is a good writer, too!

(Submitted by Charles Carpenter, PM Consultant and author of Real World Project Management and a charlesspeaks.com keynote speaker.)"},{"Title":"Project Management For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"There have been a bunch of books published recently on project management. Most of them have been oriented to helping the student cram to take the project management certification test. This book is different in that it is less concerned with the reader taking a test than it is with the reader actually learning how to manage a project.It begins with the 'simple' task of understanding your project. What is the project, can it be done, and developing the start of a plan. From there it goes on to the basic project management problem of putting a team together, managing the team, and of course the paperwork.Intended to be a beginners book, this book talks about keeping the paperwork to a minimum and doing it manually. Even in Chapter 17 where he talks about using computer technology he talks mostly about standard packages like word processing and spreadsheets rather than integrated project management software such as Microsoft Project.He mentions Microsoft Project, but he also says that there are more than 50 such packages of all shapes and sizes on the market. Hint, Mr. Portny - For your next edition of this book, provide a list of at least some of these packages with comments, and especially with price, as I suspect some of them are free.Like most 'For Dummies' books, this is an excellent introduction to the topic."},{"Title":"Project Management For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"This book gives the professional insights of a master of his job. Stanley Portny knows what he is talking about. He allows the average person to read this book and feel knowledgeable in the field of project management. He should be proud of his ability of making such a complicated subject seem so easy. &quot;Dummies&quot; are lucky to have found him."},{"Title":"Project Management For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"This is a good book for beginners. If you are a seasoned Project Manager, you probably won't find this book of much interest.Stanely Porter's book succeeds in explaining to the reader the phases of a project in a logical sequence -- all of this is done using a simple and clear language style.The book is also peppered with a lot of useful tips how how to deal with project-related matters such as micro-management, project turnaround, how to hold people accountable, how to become a better project manager, and on.In my opinion, the only weakness in this book are certain examples, which are far too long (especially in Chapters 3 & 4). Also, I personally like books which have a summary at the end of each chapter (which is not the case for this book). This is the reason why I give this book 4 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Project Management For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"I can't believe how bad this book is. I read this book from cover to cover. Toward the end, I plugged on just so that I could write a negative review on amazon. But, I think that this book changed my mind about reading bad books all the way through just so that I can review them.This is the third of five project management books that I'm reading. But, after this book, I need to take a break from project management books for a while. My head hurts--bad.And, this is the worst \\"For Dummies\\" book that I've read, and I've read about 20 of them. John Wiley and Sons really needs to recall this substandard book.What makes this book so bad? A few things:1) Stanley Portny is a bad author. This book has no life. This book has no soul. I've read algebra books that breathe more life into the subject material. I've read statistics and economics books that breathe more life into the subject material.2) This book is extremely repetitive. Project management has a lot of different subjects to it. Project management is an exciting subject. However, he makes everything from Gantt charts to risk management to a work breakdown structure seem like the exact same thing.3) Stanley Portny is extremely arrogant. This is the first \\"For Dummies\\" book where the word \\"I\\" is the most commonly used word in the book. The authors of the \\"For Dummies\\" books usually quietly take a back seat to the subject material. Not in this book--the author is very prominent.4) All of the examples are the same. This really bugged me. All of the examples in the book go something like this:At a recent training session, someone came up to me and said, \\"I don't think I need a certain aspect of project management.\\" Well, I, Stanley Portny, disagreed with this person, and I made every effort to show this person that they were wrong, and that they did need the certain aspect of project managment.You probably think I'm kidding--I'm not. Every one of the 100 different examples in the book follow this same model. It seems that Mr. Portny hasn't ever heard the maxim, \\"There's no such thing as a stupid question.\\" It seems that Mr. Portny's adage that he lives by is, \\"Every question is a stupid question--and an opportunity to show how brilliant I am.\\"Please don't buy this book...unless you're buying the one that I just read that I'm immediately selling used on amazon."},{"Title":"Project Management For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"This book covers the basics of project management but does not include the &quot;how to&quot; tools to be &quot;the reference guide&quot; for project managers.

I was looking for a tool to help me prepare for the PMP certification exam. Admittedly, I had come across and used a majority of the topics in the book before but the book served as a really good refresher. I thought the topics I hadn't used before were presented in a clear and straightforward way. I had read portions of my colleagues' copies of the 1st and 2nd editions of this book in the past and all three editions of the book touch upon a wide range of PM best practices. The author consistently presents the material in a user friendly, easy to read style. The examples are very helpful. The 3rd edition seems to be tailored to be more of a preparation tool for the PMP certification exam - I thought the first two editions presented useful material for the exam but just not as strong a tool as the 3rd edition. The author got it right this time - study the 3rd edition before you take the exam! I think the main improvement in the 3rd edition was the author's use of the same terminology as the Project Management Body of Knowledge (version 4) - the first two editions seemed to conform with the versions of the PMBOK in effect when they were written, but Project Management for Dummies 3 is current and relevant."},{"Title":"Project Management For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"This is a great book like most Dummies books.

It was reprinted and updated in 1990.]Alright, we all know that it was the national guardsmen, but who gave the fatal order to fire?! This is one of the best books on the subject, and believe me, I've been looking at them all recently. Michener's book was comprehensive, but may have come out too soon. Davies' book was too conspiracy minded, but did move the case onto the front burner. Aided by the longer view of history and time to inquire, reflect, and learn, this book gives adequate coverage of all time periods... pre-riot, attitudes, facts, photos, aftermath, trials, settlements, and probable motives and suspects. I found Gordon's writing very accessable, a mixture of human emotion and factual account, challenging testimony and statement in the light of subsequent testimony and further research. By far, the most comprehensive look at what happened and why... and pulls no punches when it lays out who was at fault and why. I tend to agree with his conclusions, though author Gordon admits that we will never truely know until one or more of the National Guardsmen steps forward and tells his/their story. And that will narrow the field of suspects even more. Perhaps that is why they agreed among themselves not to speak. They don't have to.... only time, (and these books) will tell!One or two concerns with this book: The map on the inside cover has a differing location of the various victims than other books. In fact, photographs SHOW different figures laying or falling in different spots. (In fact, many of the books differ between themselves on where the four fell. I don't understand how and why this happened yet....)I also enjoyed Davis' book alot, as it has SO MANY photos.. I find I flip back and forth to Davis' book to cross check things.As with other books that were published earlier, the Kent State story continues to unfold... see other reviewers for further developments that have happened since publication. Perhaps another edition with updates and corrections is in order:**This book is criticized by some \\"who were there,\\" as it does not promote their agenda. (But then everyone has attempted to spin May Fourth to their advantage.) If there are factual errors, I did not spot them on the first reading. I enjoyed this book, despite the criticism. But, perhaps the best view is gained by reading MANY authors and MANY points of view. That's why I continue to seek them out...and to question their points of view with people who were on campus then. Inquire, reflect, learn.I know I did. And I'm still searching out others...."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is an unforgettable book because of its brilliant plot and characters. Steinbeck sets the story in Salinas Valley, his hometown, and focuses on two families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons. The story passes fairly quickly from one generation to the next in the three sections of the novel.Its plot is filled with Biblical allusions, specifically the stories of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel. Steinbeck explores brother rivalry in two generations as the father favors a son, causing the other to experience overwhelming jealously and anger. The novel is profound as it explores this and other deep emotions, such as guilt. In the end, timshel emphasizes that forgiveness is necessary to allow one to move on in life.The characters are entertaining with their contrasting personalities. Cathy especially interested me as I questioned if she was completely evil or not.Also, Steinbeck's style is enjoyable because it is easy to understand.Even though the novel is long, the reader will love every page as they watch the amazing story unfold in front of their eyes. This book is a must read as it teaches many things and entertains at the same time."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden, with over 600 pages of text, may seem daunting at first, but throughout the entire length of the book, Steinbeck keeps the reader focused and on track with his masterful story telling. Set against the backdrop of the biblical tale of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel, this modern account is a must read for many.Beginning his tale with the parents of Cain and Abel, Steinbeck follows this family for three generations, describing their lives and thoughts as they sadly reenact the lives of their Biblical counterparts. The only downside to this book is the introduction. Though it is fair from boring the first few chapters are slow. They are not as powerful as the rest of the book but it does create the proper context for the rest of the story. These few chapters bring us deep within the plot of the novel before flaring up and continuing full force for the rest of the book.While East of Eden can be read for its plot and storyline, Steinbeck's writing allows it to be much more. One of the most intriguing aspects of this book is the characters. Each character behaves in a dynamic way, they change and grow and most importantly, live. Steinbeck so flawlessly portrays his characters that they seem real and alive. Their actions and thoughts mimic our thoughts as we read. The development and maturing of these characters are a joy to read. We are eager see as Cal struggles to live up to his brother's ability and talents while we watch as he weeps in his shadow. Cathy is another powerful character. Her chilling ability to destroy and ruin those that love her is uncanny. I have found it hard to comprehend the actions of her twisted mind as she slowly devastates those around her. Yet, this added another level to the story by introducing a wild and unpredictable character. It is exciting to read about her exploits and the evil she can unleash.Though a story book by nature, East of Eden is able to incorporate deeper meaning with its complex characters. Cal's and the other character's experiences become our own as we read and learn from their mistakes as they struggle through their version of Adam and Even and eventually, Cain and Abel."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"In Steinbeck's masterful retelling of the biblical story of Cain and Abel, he explores the meaning behind the idea behind the meaning of his interpretation of timshel and the passing of the original sin through the experiences of the Trask and Hamilton family.Writing as the descendant of the third generation descendant of the Hamiltons, Steinbeck weaves the two families together that are drawn towards the rich and fertile farmlands in California. Steinbeck's book is divided into a series of four parts, each focusing on the different characters in the book. The first part tells of Adam and Charles Trask growing up under the care of their father Cyrus, a swindler and a liar who at his death wills a large sum of money to be divided into half to each of his sons. The money, gained from shady dealings, would represent the passing of sin from father to son, much like that of the biblical Adam to his offspring, Cain and Abel. Furthermore, much like how God favors Abel over Cain in the biblical story, Steinbeck applies the same parallels and character traits to Adam and Charles.Steinbeck's most prevailing focus would be on Adam's children, Aron, who is basically a happy-go-lucky kind of person and Cal, who is dark, brooding, and manipulative, much like his mother... and this you will need to read out for yourself! As the story progresses, it is Cal, who the story centers on the most and it is revealed that he has a sensitive and intimate side and wishes to be more like his brother. It is through him, that Steinbeck is able to convey his interpretation of his prevalent theme, timshel that thou mayest, that people have the will to choose their life. Although at the story's conclusion, the same chain of events occur as in the biblical story, Steinbeck offers deeper insight with his story as it is in fact the characters of the story that changed, which made this one wholesome ending.Don't get intimidated by the book's hefty size, although it starts off rather slow and may at times be quite boring due to Steinbeck's sometimes rather simplistic details in his prose, but if one has the will to toil on, he or she can find himself in a position where it his two hours past midnight and still want to read more because of the interesting character development and come to admire Steinbeck's simple, yet powerful use of language.Though initially I thought that this book would be long and tedious and only read the book because of it was an assignment, I finished the book with a sense of contentment and satisfaction that had long been extinct from previous experiences with some of the \\"required\\" literature."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read this book twice and intend to read it again. The first time was when I was 10. It, along with Tobacco Road (Erskine Caldwell) was forbidden me as unfit literature for children (my mother was an avid reader, but she protected my childhood as long as she dared) so naturally, it became my goal to find where she had hidden them, and read both, which I did, having wasted nearly all of one summer looking for them. Finding them buried deep beneath some old clothes in her large Cedar chest, I curled up on the old sofa beneath the sunny kitchen window where the yellow June blooming roses were alive and vocal with the buzzing of bees, eagerly opened the pages and began to read........This book, obviously, parallels the story of Caine and Abel in many mortal ways. It's an incredible tale of betrayal, that I understand had roots in truth, woven around the totally depraved character of one woman, who, though amply endowed with charm, intelligence and ambition, it's but an outward veneer, and she is without the things that make such a person whole - conscience, loyalty, mother love, or any other human emotion that separates us from the primitive - and gets what she wants by using others. Killing someone is not something she worries much about.This woman, taken in by the Trask brothers after being found nearly beaten to death on their doorstep, marries one, beds the other and bears two boys who are by the brother not married to - twins - just before she leaves the good man who thinks he is their father - from her childbed, without a backward look. The story gets better and more incredulous with each passing page. You are given insight into any number of human conditions, characters, motivations, and finally, betrayal of yet another trust between brothers.It's one of Steinbeck's best works. He is a master of the written word - one who can pull you into the story even if you come from a different world than the one you are in as his fascinated reader - and ask you to feel it move you all the way there and back. There are these others by Steinbeck that number among my favorite reads and grace my personal library:\\"Grapes of Wrath\\"\\"Cannery Row\\"\\"The Red Pony\\" which is an unusual story about a young boy and his horse - of a love lost, but with responsibility and maturity painfully gained - book from my youth, but which is much more than a child's story."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is a 600 page masterpiece. This book grabbed my attention from start to finish. I read it in 1 week. It did get a little slow during the middle of the book. But I feel Steinbeck wrote that in as a plateau for such a mountain of a book. He is a true artist with every word & sentence. He draw's the scene out with a paint brush with fine brush strokes. Then when the scene is finished. He let's the great character's speak. They speak with true life meanings and lessons. I stopped reading for many years and this book is going to inspire me to keep reading for the rest of my life. But I don't think any book will live up to the masterpiece of this book. I will probally compare the rest of my readings to this book and find nothing will compare to it. I will surely read everything he has wrote and find joy in each one."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"nearly everything steinbeck wrote is worth reading.this story is worth devouring.it's far from a \\"happy\\" story, but the writing is too good to be true, and after completing it, it's nearly impossible to find another author to chase it down with.it'll make you jump into more steinbeck if you haven't yet."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck can go either way. \\"The Pearl\\" was a disgusting waste of time and paper, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" a fabulous, emotional read, and \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" a fascinating book that totally engaged the reader. Where does \\"East of Eden\\" fit on the Steinbeck-o-meter? At the top.Many readers don't like \\"East of Eden\\" because of its length, its higher level of rambling, and just the overall overload. Then again, this is part of the book. \\"East of Eden\\" IS long. Steinbeck DOES ramble quite often here. But then there's the story, the emotion (and occasionally lack of), and the way hundreds of pages flew by that just bring this book up so high.\\"East of Eden\\" starts out with very difference characters than it ends with, and over time we notice the subtle shift. Granted, most of the book revolves around the same few characters, but they're so interesting and have so much personality that it fits well.There are many biblical themes here (Eden, for starters), but it's not exactly the whole story. Mostly, this is almost like a retelling of classic, ancient stories. There's the tale of brother versus brother, a devil (also known as the deceiving woman), and the miracle. But overall, Eden is an incredible read, a wonderful book, and written in an excellent way. Steinbeck has come a long way since \\"The Pearl\\".This is the ultimate Steinbeck. It's the heaviest, the most intense, and probably (in my opinion) the best. There is so much to it, and it's such a rewarding feeling to read it.An excellent book for any reader! I definitely urge you to read it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I had the realization earlier in the year that I missed out on reading a lot of great books while at school. I can't remember the exact reason why I picked up this book but had read that it was John Steinbeck's greatest personal accomplishment. I also saw that it was part of the Oprah's Book Club. [...] all of her books but was curious on why she picked it. I had tried to read Grapes of Wrath several years before but never got through it. I just finished the book this morning and can see why it has such an impact on American Literature.The story begins with the description of the surrounding areas of the Salinas Valley in California and then moves east to start the saga of a young family in Connecticut. It follows the story of a father motivated by the military and the rearing of his two sons. The Sons grow to learn that there father was not what they expected and they have different ideas on how to live their lives. Mixed with the stories of the brothers are the tales of the Wright family. We watch the brothers grow up, move apart and one becomes a father to two more boys and the problems that faced the preceding family are recycled and repeated.As you can tell from the title biblical themes run through the story. Steinbeck takes the story of Cain and Abel and applies it to an American family plagued by sacrifices and the struggles between good and evil. The thought that history and human nature does not predestine us as good or bad seems to be the prevailing thought in this book. There is choice inside of us that we can use to make decisions."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a marvelous opus into which you can really sink your teeth! Of course, I had seen the famous James Dean film version, but had no previous idea of what an expansive, sweeping epic it had been based on--- the book far surpasses the wonderful film. The incredible gift Steinbeck has for storytelling, the classic yet complex characters and the dramatic, original storylines will sweep you up page after page after page.It's especially satisfying to find a juicy read that lasts so long (this edition @ 600 pages) to bring you a fulfilling reading experience you can savor. The author's many pearls of wisdom and insightful spin on the Cain & Abel story will stay with you long after you finish. It's also a fascinating look at the foibles and fortunes of early 20th Century Americans. It's a book to enjoy and to share.I can't believe it took me so long to discover this literary treasure, which quickly leapt to the Top 10 List of my all-time favorites."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck either writes short, tight novels or long, intense sagas. At over 600 pages, \\"East of Eden\\" is the latter.\\"East of Eden\\" is my new favorite Steinbeck novel. It is the story of two brothers, Adam and Caleb (the Cain and Abel allegory is strong here), their parents and Cathy Ames-one of the most manipulative, unfeeling, unscrupolous, complicated villains I have ever encountered in literature.The novel is long and dense and much of it is \\"the set up\\" for how the rest of the novel plays out. It is such a pleasure to read. There is no author (except perhaps Buck in The Good Earth) who weaves character growth, morality, allegory and geophraphy together so beautifully.Read this book!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"When I picked up this book I was not sure what to expect, but I soon got hooked. It was a refuge for me and I found it incredible to live the lives of those in Salinas, California. This book talks about good and evil in ways that I hadn't even thought of before. All the characters were so interesting they could have been their own story. This book opens your eyes to the world of 1900 and today. I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book was an assignment for my English class, I put it off till the weekend before the research paper was due to read it. When I finally made a commitment to read it... I could not put it down! This book made my laugh, cry and angry. I loved every page of it, and I was always anxious to find out what happened next. I have definitely learned a lot about mankind and the human spirit by reading this book. Now my goal is to read all of Steinbeck's novels. It is such a powerful story, if a person in their whole lifetime were to read one book and one book only, I would highly recommend them to read this book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck leaves no character here unscathed, if not by a current malfeasance, then at least by a tormented past. One thing he does well by elaborating the good and evil theme from the Cain and Abel story, is to show how typically people think they need something to be happy, but then are less content than someone with far less. But it's not that easy, because someone who looks relatively content, is actually just better at making peace with their own demons. Sam Hamilton and the Chinese guy, for instance, seem to be coping much better than any of the newcomers from Connecticut with the way-better land, but still they suffer.Pounding on the theme of a love deficit as an explanation for evil is also well done, in that Steinbeck shows that some forms of evil are outside this explanation, as well--for instance the unfathomable genesis of Kate's badness. Dr. Dobson would say that some kids are just plain bad.Timshel is a very touching way to end this, but not surprisingly, the Hebrew scholar I checked this with (who is on the board of directors of her temple), tells me there is more than one interpretation, and that it is not necessarily &quot;thou mayest.&quot; But I have no reason not to like the interpretation discerned by the Chinaman, in consultation with the rest of his Chinese friends-cum-Hebrew scholars.Roy the Model T mechanic (&quot;Jus call Me Joe&quot;) is also an appropriate character type who would fit right in to our network administrator culture of computer geniuses.This book is disturbing, and so is Cain and Abel. I doubt Cain was pleased with the result of his successful attack on Abel, which he must have thought he wanted, as well."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I was required to read this book as summer reading for my 11th grade Honors English class.Like my fellow classmates, I thought &quot;Great, a book that's over 600 pages long written so I'll never be able to understand it.&quot;Fortunately, I was wrong. East of Eden is intriguing and written so that even teenagers can understand it. If you can get past all the family/character introductions which occupy the first few chapters, you've got it made. The rest of the book is well written with its use of symbolism, themes of good and evil, colorful character and other elements that make it a classic."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck captures so many complexities of human character as well as human relationships. The story and the characters are overwhelming. It's a book that reminds you how good a book can be."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read East of Eden last summer, not knowing what to expect. I already knew that I liked John Steinbeck, but this book really drew me into its meaning. I am fifteen years old now, and so far, East of Eden is one of the only books which have completely captivated me even after I finished reading. Steinbeck's clear yet descriptive writing definately deserves more attention than it is given."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read East of Eden while living in Santa Cruz Ca. I had just seen the movie and thought the book might be good. After meeting Cathy I couldn't put it down. I loved it so much I made my wife and a friend read it. A few months later the book was made into a NINE hour play in Salinas. We all went on a Saturday and watched the entire play (3 hours, lunch, 3 hours, dinner, 3 hours). I feel so fortunate to have read it when I did."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Well, it is the dead of winter here in Minnesota, and good books are good friends. East of Eden has been a long-time favorite of mine--the best book I have ever read. But rather than try to explain why I feel this way, I would instead point readers to Part I, Chapter 3, where Adam Trask and his father Cyrus are out walking, discussing Adam's future in the military.You know, there are parts of books where authors develop the story, develop the characters, and so on. Then there are the more important parts where the author bares his soul and really tries to get his message or deepest beliefs out to the reader. Steinbeck is Cyrus in this part of the book, and a more profound understanding of the human situation (and of the differences among us) I have yet to encounter. It is a passage like this that will keep me reading Steinbeck again and again. Timshel!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I'd just like to put in my words of agreement with the previous Vermont reviewer, who was basically telling two juniors in our high school to stop bashing Steinbeck to annoy their English teacher. Their sole purpose in writing the review was to irritate an English teacher; they made up the drek about the novel. East of Eden is a fine novel with a strong message about personal choice and the nature of good and evil. Steinbeck's writing is not laborious, and his theme is not inaccessible. Sometimes his writing is more complex than some wish to delve into, but for the most part, careful reading tells you what you need to know. Read it. And don't pay attention to the reviewers who love to tease their English teacher (as we all do); they don't mean it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I greatly question the unfounded review of East of Eden that was posted on this site by a Vermont address. East of Eden is generally held to be a literary classic, wonderfully crafted as it is. That is not to say that a reader should resign him/herself to public opinion, unquestioningly. But reviewers loudly stating their opinions without providing evidence has no more credence than the former. There was no reasoning behind the thoughtless bashing of this novel. If any basis for such accusations exist, I would like to hear what they are so the argument can be considered rationally. At the moment, no foundation is present for a meaningful exchange of information. The author incorporates a vivid palette, using multiple brushstrokes. Though some of the smaller strokes seem disconnected, the larger strokes bring the painting together into a cohesive whole. That is not to say that Steinbeck is inaccessible. Rather, it is the analyzation of the minute without a look at the bigger picture which can cause confusion. It is understandable that some readers may see the novel solely as beautiful, individual images. Yet this is not the fault of the author, rather the inclination of the reader to examine parts of the whole without ever observing the final masterpiece. A reader could be easily seduced into zooming in on the aesthetics of the descriptions. Nevertheless, the novel discourses upon this very temptation in the characterization of Kate by her son, Aron. Aron falls into this limiting trap, through which he can only see desirable aspects of his mother. This inability to view the entirety of the situation is, in the end, the cause of his demise. We are lucky, indeed, insofar as authors such as Steinbeck exist, holding up a mirror in which we can see the truths within our own souls."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It has been twenty or, sadly, maybe thirty years ago since I've read a Steinbeck. A couple of books that I passed on at that time were 'East of Eden' and 'The Grapes of Wrath'. In 'East of Eden' Steinbeck still amazes me with the depth of his characters, and the intricasies of their relationships with each other. If an award was given for 'best supporting character', I would vote for Samuel Hamilton! His simple joy of life and home-spun wisdom are an interesting contrast with the chronically, evil Kate. This book will stay with anyone who reads it for a long time. 'The Grapes of Wrath' will be next for me - I know that I will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a wonderful story. I could not put this book down. It is so hard to rate books for me because so many I have been reading are so great. But I recommend this one. Buy the one with the Introduction by David Wyatt it gives a lot of insight into the feelings of Steinbeck when he wrote this. Well I am off to read Grapes of Wrath!!! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read the &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; years ago. Loved it and watch the movie every chance I get, but for some reason I never read any more Steinbeck. &quot;Cannery Row&quot; is a favorite movie of mine also and when a friend suggested that I read &quot;East of Eden&quot;..I thought, &quot;why not?&quot; Of course, I had seen the movie and always felt that it was a downer (I don't partucularly like James Dean). Well, I read East of Eden..and loved it and will be reading the other works by Steinbeck. Upon reflection, I now feel that James Dean was the perfect actor for the part. I was sad to finish the book, because it will be a while before I have such a friend to pick up and escape into again."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Not being a Steinbeck fan, I expected to be bored with the novel, but the language which Steinbeck utilizes along with the stunning portrayl of the characters enthralled me. There are so many stunning elements to the novel; the classic struggle between good and evil, the realization that no one's fate is predetermined and that every one has to decide what path to take in life. I thought it particularly interesting to see the use of allusion with the Cain and Abel story and the Alice in Wonderland story. This is a must read for everyone. I can't imagine anyone not loving this novel as much as I do."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is one of the best books ever!! It tackles questions and problems that are immortal-- love of family, fate and free will, and the general path of growing older. &quot;...the word timshel--'Thou mayest'--that gives a choice. It might be the most important word in the world. That says the way is open. That throws it right back on a man. For if 'Thou mayest'--it is also true that 'Thou mayest not.' Don't you see?&quot; -quote from EOE"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is one of my favorite books. Shaped by Steinbeck's own life, the story is intricate and absorbing. The characters are indellible and the imagery has stayed with me for many years. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who has the time to read it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read &quot;Of Mice &amp; Men&quot; while in school. It was one of the first books I was 'forced' to read in school that I blew through! I have been a Steinbeck fan ever since. While I enjoyed his most famous work, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, I feel it pales in comparison to &quot;East of Eden&quot;. I recently found out that it is a very autobiographical story, which perhaps is why is comes across so powerfully. Simply one damned amazing book!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is the only book that I can finish reading and immediately start again at the beginning without being bored. The story of Cain and Abel is completely engaging told first as a rivalry between Adam and Charles and then between Cal and Aron; and the Hamilton family is a fascinating fictionalization of Steinbeck's own family history."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is an exquisite book which masterfully tackles the difficult topics of love and loyalty in the family, while also embodying the spirit of American adventure and independence. Steinbeck brilliantly utilizes the biblical Cain and Able story to metephorically elaborate on the complex relationship between the brothers depicted in the novel. It is definately worth the time put into completing it!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Stienbeck creates an American masterpiece unparelled before or since. This cinematically written book uses several Biblical references, while presenting an exciting and in depth saga of an pioneering American family. Members of the family are based on Old Testament characters and their lives read like parables for contemporary America. Many of these characters have become the archetypes for a new generation of storytellers. Don't see the movie (except for James Dean) or the TV mini-series -- both of which are painfully abridged -- until you read this contemporary American classic."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's East of Eden is an exemplary story of the battle of humans struggling to make choices. What I liked most about the book was Steinbeck's ability to characterize without favoritism or bias. I enjoyed each character not because s/he was \\"good\\" but because Steinbeck (with the exception of Cathy), made every character a real human, with emotions, good and bad. The balance Steinbeck created amazed me and made the plot exciting and unpredictable. Steinbeck's honesty and frankness helped recreate a story that was real and enjoyable. The lines of humor spread through the book made me smile: I could not put the book down. Furthermore, there were many parts where I noticed Steinbeck's skill as a storyteller, and as I flipped back to previous places in the book, I saw how all the parts were intertwined and weaved together. This is an amazing book; even if you've never liked Steinbeck before, the spiritual and intellectual value will capture and win you."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck truly captures the human innermost desire to choose the path of righteousness and darkness. In this novel, Steinbeck gently parallels the old Biblical story of Cain and Abel while inplicating and imposing his own underlying theme. This theme of humaninty, the choice of good and evil, will cause one to re-evaluate one's own opportunities to choose between the two. This book definately has real-life applications as well as present day relavence. It causes one to reflect on one's own life and perhaps elevate one to a new level of understanding of the world around oneself. Although events in this book may seem unorganized and somewhat random, Steinbeck tactfully organizes and arranges events so that the overall message of the book is still accomplished. The characters in this book are well developed which further adds to the greater effect of the novel. This book is one of the more substantial books that you will ever read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This unique novel places the Old Testament in Salinas Valley in the early 20th century. The book's apeal lies in the combination of alluring characters and pictorial descriptions of the California setting. Powerful displays of human emotions--ranging from unconditional love to hatred--are hallmarks of the characters and key to the insightful value of the book. This wisdom is as compelling as the characters that reveal it--or fail to see it. The characters are a great highlight of the book--Steinbeck leads the reader to feel the same emotions as his characters. This Nobel Prize winning novel promises and entertaining and enlightening read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Yet another powerful classic, East of Eden by John Steinbeck traces the history of the Trask and Hamilton families to their origins in California. Three generations of their stories are told through wonderful prose and imagery from the beginning until the very end.Essentially, East of Eden retells the story of Cain and Abel - a biblical story. But, reader beware, you don't have to be religious to enjoy such an exquisite book. Morals lurk in every corner as Charles faces the arduous task of gaining his father's love, which his brother Adam already has. Relative to our very own lives, you'll find yourself flinching at the destruction caused by Cyrus's unwillingness to accept Charles as his son. His eager acceptance of his other son empowers the book with themes of jealousy and the struggle between good and evil. Steinbeck then manages to push his cyclical themes through into another generation of people - Adam, Aron, and Cal - who seem to share the same problem. However, the plot and evil thicken. A brothel manager named Kate seems to get caught up in the mess as well - her evil; a vice of destruction. Supplemental to the main theme of good vs. evil are hints of other themes such as timshel, and knowledge which will become self evident as the book is read. Steinbecks fascinating ability to animate characters will mesmorize you until the very end. And, surprisingly, there is even room to spare for brilliant quotes and memorable lines.East of Eden is a magnificent story that'll leave you turning the pages until the end, keeping you east of eden, ---- and wishing there was more."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden provides a interesting reading experience and never fails to suprise. The characters are all very complex and change throughout the story. It is about two families, the Trask's and the Hamilton's whose path meet in the Salinas Valley of California. East of Eden also parallels the biblical story of Cain and Abel. The rivalry between Adam and Charles and Aron and Caleb directly parallels this story, the only difference being that Aron and Caleb (Adam's children) manage to resolve thier rivalry with each other. Cathy represents the evil character while Adam is the Ultimate good. Adam starts off very naive and gets taken advantage of by Cathy; and not until later does he finally become more aware and sees what Cathy really is. A theme in this novel is the need to be loved. Charles and Caleb, both feel that thier father's do not love them and this creates an extreme jealousy of Adam and Aron respectively."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's East of Eden is a complex work of art. Through only 600 pages of writing, Steinbeck is able to fully develop each of his few dozen characters. Each person, whether he plays a major or a minor role, fits in the novel perfectly. The most interesting character is undoubtedly, Lee, a Chinese cook. Through Lee and the other characters in this novel, Steinbeck explores the important themes of love, family, trust, identity, and jealousy.Although it is a little lengthy, East of Eden is far from boring. In every chapter, something significant happens and encourages you to read on to learn more. The only drawback is that this novel is entirely based on the Bible and it may be difficult for non-Christians to fully appreciate Steinbeck's allusions to the Book of Genesis."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden, set in the rural areas of America during the early twentieth century, is a captivating novel exploring a person's struggle between what is good and evil. Steinbeck uses biblical references to enhance his ideas about basic human nature. With a foundation based on the story Cain and Abel, Steinbeck goes above and beyond and produces a variety of fully developed characters through his analysis of their outer and inner turmoil. Steinbeck establishes a moral spectrum of good and evil through his characters, and he effectively portrays how a balance good and evil is necessary to maintain order in a society.I found it mesmerizing as the plot would thicken, which it continuously did, and was impressed by Steinbeck's thorough exploration of the mind and heart of an individual. I highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is a masterpiece that richly interweaves mesmerizing characters, enduring themes, and human impulses. Steinbeck's style and tone as a writer was what made the book magnificent from the beginning. He is a true storyteller, in his exposition of characters' natures, lacks, and desires. He portrays characters with exploratory truth. Samuel Hamilton is the wise, philosophical idealist who only wants to get a rich drink of life. Cathy, on the other hand, is a being that is not human, and has consequential evil tendencies. Brothers, such as Adam and Charles, and Aron and Cal, go through the endless tales of jealousy, love, and hurt.Steinbeck eloquently explores many themes-perhaps they are the eternal themes of life. He explores the struggle between good and evil, the fight for parental love, and the question of identity. Rather than keeping the scope of the novel narrow, he connects it to the history of the world.I highly recommend this book for anyone who likes being moved by literature. It will stir emotions and stimulate the mind."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Although the novel is full of imagery and situations mimicking the Bible, the book itself does not revolve around these themes. Instead, the story delves deep into the realm of love, death, and relationships between human beings. The distinct characteristics that Steinbeck provides in each person set the stage for an excellent novel. Not only do the characters (such as the moral but foolish Adam Trask, and the evil, sly Cathy Ames) invoke emotion in readers, they also stir the audience to action. After reading the novel, I wanted to personally do something about the unfortunate situations presented.The story starts off describing two families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons, across the nation, who later come together via unlikely events. The great friendships between families last forever, until the manipulative Cathy Ames steps into the mix. The friendly looking lady seems cheery on the outside, but what is she really like on the inside? These inner features are what make her a dangerous character, and you need to read the novel to find out what I mean. In addition, sibling rivalry is represented like the scenes from Cain and Abel, and can be seen through Charles and Adam, and Cal and Aron. Although both Charles and Cal are inherently evil, Cal is able to use advice from the family servant, Lee, to fend off his immoral ways.I recommend this book not for a quick skim, but for a lengthy, indulgent read. Paying attention to the subtle details that Steinbeck includes calls for increased enjoyment. East of Eden is a highly entertaining book, while discussing topics that provide stimulation for the mind."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is a philosophical investigation into the human mental condition, emphasizing greatly the struggle between good and evil. It explores the complexities of such varied themes as depression, lonesomeness, hate (from Cain and Abel), and of course, love. But one should read this novel with a proverbial &iexcl;grain of salt&iexcl;. Steinbeck will sometimes replace character development with his own analysis, much as a historian would look upon past events. For example, he begins a paragraph with &iexcl;When I said Cathy was a monster&iexcl;.&iexcl; To the reader, this may be an emotional anticlimax to the plot; it gives the tales a feeling of redundancy. Why not let the stories speak for themselves? It may be that Steinbeck is teaching us something with this novel, something important, something life changing C Timshel."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is, in my eyes, Steinbeck's great American saga."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden by John Steinbeck is a classic. Though its plot might be predictable after understanding reading the bible, its style and character development truly merit its great recognition. Every character and its foil are unique in their own way. Most of these characters are exaggerated, therefore they are unrealistic. It is because of this overstatement and overemphasis of the character's specific detail and idiosyncrasy that truly makes this book special. Overall, this book is a great read if you have time on your hands to slowly analyze it.As I read East of Eden, I easily spotted many allusions to the book of Genesis for I had already became familiar with the stories of Cain and Abel when I had read the Bible, thereby enhancing my overall understanding of Steinbeck's allusions. At first, I thought reading the book of Genesis was going to be a hassle, just another book to read; however, it added to my reading comprehension. The book incorporated many references to the story of Cain and Abel, and reading the book of Genesis basically supplied me with enough contexts to understand the essential theme of the book. So, anyone who is planning to read this book should skim over the book of Genesis just for a background and reference.The plot might be rudimentary, but the ideas are thought provoking. After Samuel reads about the story of Cain and Abel, Lee brings light into the situation, establishing the importance of timshel, which is the ability to change one's fate, and in Cal's situation, to either continue wrongdoing or change for the better. The characters literally incorporate the story of Cain and Abel in their discussion to utilize the story as a reference, because of its recurring nature in humanity. As Lee unveils many aspects of the story of Cain and Abel, he concludes many similarities between the bible and the familial relationships. Therefore, Steinbeck incorporates allusions to the story of Cain and Abel to depict its recurring nature and its importance as a reference.As reference to the East of Eden, the story of Cain and Abel becomes essential to the understanding of the recurring theme; however, both characters are not similar, and of the two, Abel undertakes the persona of the wanderer. Like Abel, Adam and Aron both resemble the less volatile of their brothers. However, it is they, who are often sent off to places literally, and involved in intricate conflicts. As Adam marries Cathy, who alludes to the devil, and travels, while trying to deal with his sons, who are hostile to each other. Like Adam, Aron is literally sent off to the military and discovers much, but only to die as a result of Cal's lies.John Steinbeck effectively uses characters to further bring objectivity. In this case, he employs Lee's objective nature to bring in outside information. Lee serves as an objective person, who sheds light to the convoluted and intricate tensions that exist between the characters. His being a Chinese servant further parts him from all the complex tensions. Lee literally talks about the story of Cain and Abel, drawing conclusions to the similar conflicts between the characters, alluding to those of Cain and Abel. He becomes concerned with the ability to change fate, according to timshell, where Cal can actually choose to be good.So go read it, because these books are rare nowadays!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"...in the Salinas River Valley in California. Steinbeck is a master at developing characters so well that you think you actually know them personally half-way through the story. This is the tale of multiple families, from all over the country, who end up in the Salinas Valley. Their reasons for settling there vary from honorable to despicable. Steinbeck's storyline mimics the one of Cain and Abel throught he lives of brothers in the book on the Trask side. There are other families and characters that add a richness to the environment as well, such as the Hamiltons, Abra, and Lee the faithful servant. As you follow the lives of the Hamiltons and Trasks, you can't help but wonder if any of this kind of thing really took place back then. I learned alot about farming and days when automobiles weren't around. It was a great read, and an unexpected surprise."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a classic, but one younger generations of readers might easily overlook.

It plays on the juxtaposition of naivety and wisdom, truth and faith, struggle and redemption, and most importantly, good and evil. Within the given boundaries of 600 pages, Steinbeck explores the psychological and mental desires of everybody, while also enlightening the readers with a theory on the purpose of life and its attributes.The main storyline follows the vicious cycle of two generations of siblings in the Trask family, while also playing on the biblical reference to the stories of Cain and Abel, and Caleb and Aron. The two set of brothers, who set the stage for the novel, are always in conflict with one another in their desire to gain the love of their fathers. In its exploration of their interaction with the people around them and with their fathers, Steinbeck uses the brothers in order to explain life as the Bible does. He directly calls upon the stories in the vastly popular book in order to expound on God's meaning of life as it pertains to society and how people should view their lives in respect to others. He creates a whole commonalty of characters that help extenuate and expose the interactions of people and their effects. Cathy, another important figure in the book, is Steinbeck's way of placing evil in a light that takes a tangible form. Cathy is one character alone that while she amazes and builds suspense for the reader, she also disgusts and shocks the reader with her cunning ability to manipulate people at the lift of a finger. Her evil genius is solely a product of her desires: to get out of work in dismissing responsibility, to subjugate blame, and gain an enormous control over people. Steinbeck also delves into the meaning of life and how it is defined completely on the ability of choice. He acquaints the readers with the word \\"timshel.\\" Etymologically speaking, the Hebrew word directly translates to \\"thou mayest,\\" which Steinbeck uses to express his viewpoint on choice. He tells the reader that only he has the ability to choose the path of his life, and it is he who can conquer sin and break from past trends.Ultimately, the book brings out the true battle of good and evil as the Bible interprets it, and reveals the true definition of life. As Steinbeck explores the issues that surround life in terms of faith, trust, and love, he creates an unbelievable book, despite its licentiousness, that leaps out of the boundaries delineated by society. The characters, the themes, the story itself, all of it comes together, creating a momentous book by all standards."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden has so much potential to be a book which has more of a satisfactory impact. This book, was at times poorly written, contradictory, confusing, and unfortunately boring. I say the book was poorly written at times because John Steinbeck spent so much time writing this book (several years I believe) and he could not manage to create many characters which interested me. Also, he included too many characters which were not important to the novel and even makes it unclear who the narrator is in the novel. I think the book is somewhat hypocritical because the novel's emphasis on freewill as one of its themes is not expressed through all the characters. Cathy Ames for instance, is condemmned as a devil during the entire course of the novel. How can you claim that freewill exists, and then permanently condemn one of your characters to a satanic status? I think that makes the book boring because it causes the plot to be too predictable, and at some points dry and corny. I am not saying that this book was completely awful though. The three stars I gave were for, the decent character development of Charles, and the insightful amorphisms provided by Lee, the Chinese servant of Adam. Also, Steinbeck's development of Cathy also had its strong points, but overall, I was disappointed at the way many character's dealt with their dilemmas. At times I was left feeling jipped at the outcome, or craving for more than what was provided. Overall, the book has strong themes, and a sufficient plot, but is hindered by its poor organization and mild character development."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This story is excellent despite what other people may say. This novel allowed him to write freely. He didn't have to teach a lesson in this book. This book was mainly for him to let go of his torn past and set a new look on life. He is an amazing story teller. Better than any I have read in my lifetime. Steinbeck uses a lot imagery. He wants the reader to see his home as he saw it. He wanted the common person to be able to understand. This book is EXCELLENT. You have to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have been a Steinbeck fan since last year when I first read, &quot;Of Mice and Men.&quot; I have yet to be let down by a Steinbeck novel or short story and I doubt I ever will.

All of the characters are either male, or perjoratively female with the exception of Abra Bacon, the final female character who's role in the novel is minimal. Although Steinbeck's intent is to reveal the true meaning of life in his modern world by analyzing the biblical tale of Cain and Able, he effectively ends up giving an Episcopal sermon endorsing the male dominant themes of the Bible itself. Too bad he had no knowledge of or respect for women."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It's sad to celebrate the 100th year of Steinbeck, and realize he wasnt that great of a writer. He is a story teller, but not a beautiful writer. East of Eden seems hurredly written, and I kept looking for a beautiful paragraph, a sentence that might make me read it several times. East of Eden was a real disappointment to me."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"One way to separate a great book from a book that falls far short is to think about whether the characters are realistic and fleshed out. Read War and Peace. Read Brothers Karamazov. Read Remembrance of Things Past. East of Eden has cardboard characters meant to display good and evil for you. I'll give you an example, so you can see where I'm coming from. It doesn't convey my whole feeling that the characters are cardboard but it points you in the right direction.&quot;Abra came in with shining eyes and a red nose from the frosty wind, and she brought such pleasure that Lee giggled softly when he saw her.&quot;Do you mind being manipulated by an author's cliches? I do. The shining eyes of a good child, the red nose of a good child on a frosty morning, you can take your shining eyes and red nose and frosty wind and stick them, along with Lee's delighted giggle.I don't mean to condemn Steinbeck for that one paragraph, which an eighth grader could have written. I mean to bring out that paragraph as an illustration of an overall weakness in the writing. The characters represent good or evil, and they are annoying. All the characters who begin with A (Abra, Adam, Aron) represent Abel, and all the characters who begin with C (Cal, Cathy, Charles) represent Cain. Gee, duh, thank you, that's heavy.It's not that I enjoy trashing well thought of books. It's something else. I resent that the great books are diminished when something like this is complimented. True quality deserves to be separated above stuff like this.Try this one on. One of the characters makes a lot of money in an investment, and ends up burning all the money he has made. Tell me something - how the hell is he going to raise enough money to pay taxes on that realized gain? IRS won't care that he burned the money. They will be coming for their taxes. The author wanted his character to make that annoying, stupid sacrifice, burning lots of money. Well, if the character doesn't care, neither do I. I hope IRS nails him good.I'll tell you where Steinbeck really started to lose me. He played one of those stupid &quot;I know something you don't know&quot; teases on us readers. He had one of the Trask brothers enlist in the army. We expected Cal to do it, but he threw us a clue that it was probably Aron. Then he left us there and changed the subject. Nyaa nyaa nyaa nyaa nyaa. Steinbeck knows which brother enlisted and we don't, and he's going to make us wait to find out. Isn't that great, brilliant writing. Dust off that old annoying trick. And the reason we don't know is because he didn't tell us what happened in chronological order. He lets us know later that something happened earlier. So our ignorance is his fault, and he's teasing us with it.Thank you, Clifton Fadiman, for not including this book in your Lifetime Reading Plan of the great books.

I found the characters to be unmotivated and I was indifferent to the three families that are the focus of the book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This was an excellent novel, mainly because John Steinbeck made a clever, astute, and contemporary version of a modern Adam and Even/Cain and Abel story. The most exemplary attribute of East of Eden is how one can coherently see how the story of Cain and Abel is no different from the story of everyday people. Somehow I had a better understanding of Cain and Abel and the idea of \\"original sin\\" from reading this novel, which is something that's definitely worth acknowledging on Steinbeck's credit. However, there's also a major flaw to East of Eden. At times it felt a bit bombastic and pretentious. The characters were very interesting, however they felt more like biblical symbols than real characters. Obviously that was Steinbeck's purpose, but it made them appear VERY one dimensional (for instance: Why is Cathy all bad? Why is Cal the least loved? Why is Aron the most loved? Why is Cal the least liked because he has brown hair, and Aron the most loved because he has blonde hair and blue eyes?). So therefore, it made me a bit detached from the characters, and it felt a bit unrealistic and predictable. However, despite that, there are still many scenes in the novel that felt inspiring, so much that I nearly clapped for the character (Adam) when he finally confronted his fears. It doesn't really touch on new ground about the concept of good and evil, but East of Eden is a novel worth reading at least once."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I was required to read this for an English course, and was not looking forward to it because I had not enjoyed other Steinbeck books... after the first 10 or so pages I couldn't put it down.

Although lengthy, the story never ceases to draw one in. For instance, during the last part of the book, I stayed up all night to finish it. The story is loaded with detail, rich, and very entertaining. The only problem, for me, lies in the ending. I felt I would have liked to know more about a certain relationship that takes place at the end. Also, if you read the book slowly, the ending may confuse you due to the fact that you may forget the meaning of a conversation that took place in the beginning. Even with that said, I still recomend this book to anyone who enjoys Steinbeck. Try reading Travels with Charley in Search of America by Steinbeck, as well. That I give 5 stars."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is a beautiful work that is multi-thematic, complex, and yet very personal. In the saga of the Trask and Hamilton families, Steinbeck weaves a story that explores, above all, people. Siblings, parents, births, deaths, sorrows, joys, truths, lies, and the perceptions in between, this novel has it all. Headed by Sam Hamilton, the Hamilton family is trying their best to live with dignity on the poorest land in their area. They are the kind of people who are so decent and joyful in each other that it's hard to remember that they are struggling to get by. Adam Trask, emerging from what we would now call a dysfunctional family, buys up the best land in the area with money that he inherited, somewhat mysteriously, from his father. While he wants desperately to make his new bride happy and be the father/patriarch he never had, Adam has the misfortune to have picked a wife that is not interested in settling down and becoming a mother. Immediately after the birth of her twins, Adam's wife disappears, turning up later as the madame of a whorehouse reputed for \\"providing the sort of services that shouldn't be available\\".The story is large, somewhat complex, but never tedious. Unlike most novels of this length (600 pages), there is never one place where the story becomes bogged down. Steinbeck does such a good job with his beautiful prose, true characters, and honest emotion, that the reader floats through the 600 pages effortlessly. I loved this novel and have every intention of reading every other piece of Steinbeck I can get my hands on."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"i love this book. it a advanturous book.one of best piece of litterature. in the begaining you might not be interested but if you go along you will love the book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in quite some time.

You 'feel' the characters. You 'see' the unfolding and changing landscape. You are emotionally pulled into the unfolding drama. You laugh at outrageous hilarity. You cry over intense sadness. You literally feel the rain on your face when he alerts you to a storm blowing in.For the most part, the characters spanning several generations are biographical depictions of his real relatives; mostly on his mothers side. The only weakness in the novel that I feel worth mentioning is that the character Kate appears too mean, inhuman, and damaged to seem real.John, in a paragraph or two using real nonfictional characters, actually puts himself into the story by name at two different times. The first is when he and his sister Mary at around age 10 or 11 discuss a very funny situation with their Uncle Tom at a Thanksgiving dinner. The second time he appears in the story is again with his sister Mary where they are depicted as peeking out of a second story window down upon a visitor walking up to their house in Salinas.The existential theme of &quot;individual choice&quot; being more fundamental than &quot;Heavenly Mandates&quot; is a topic he repeats often causing one to believe that John himself must have believed this to be an important idea. But he also demonstrates that choice itself is often not powerful or useful enough to provide solutions to complex tragic situations.This novel is a must read. But then again, I believe that any of his novels will not disappoint."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck is one of the greatest North American writers ever. With his work he was to create a huge portrait of the life in the first half of the 20th Century in United States of America. &#65533;East of Eden&#65533; is among his masterpieces, in which he is capable of bringing to life real and vivid characters, influenced by their habitat.The novel follows the life of a family, concentrating on its two offspring since before their birth. Steinbeck also inserted his own family and himself in the book as minor characters and this device sort of gives him authority to talk about the events and people.Not many writers were able to draw such a convincing portrait of such people. By choosing the right words and building the right sentences, the author gave depth and beauty to his novel, so filled with descriptions.&#65533;East of Eden&#65533; has survived for decades and praised as one of the most perfect North American novels ever. All this due to Steinbeck geniality. Despite his labored prose this book is not difficult to read and understand. Its reading flows easily and from the beginning the story captures one&#65533;s attention.Nevertheless &#65533;East of Eden&#65533; is not for everyone. Many readers may not connect with the prose and the story. People who usually read contemporary fiction with dubious quality should stay away from any Steinbeck&#65533;s novel, and not to &#65533;read&#65533; it only to appear to be highbrow."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A classic in ever sense of the word. A bit biography and a bit cathartic release, this novel is fantastic."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's East of Eden goes back in time to describe what life was like in the early 20th century for people in the U.S., more specifically California's Salinas Valley. Steinbecks' novel however goes a lot farther than just describing life for a specific group of people; his novel is an absorbing yet often times disturbing telling of life itself. The novel is loaded with numerous significant themes including love, good vs. evil, and jealousy. In his book, Steinbeck makes several allusions to the biblical story of Cain and Abel (hence where the title comes from) and even models their tale in his own character's actions. In two different situations in the novel, two brothers find themselves fighting each other for the approval of their father. Ironically however, both times, their father end up loving the son whom does not really desire nor covet their father's approval. In both instances, jealousy plays a major role in their actions that followed. The classic battle between good vs. evil finds itself time and time again in Steinbeck's characters. Steinbeck however, chooses to emphasize his belief that good and evil are both inherent parts of society, and that the main battle is the character's CHOICE of good or evil. Steinbeck's last and probably most enduring theme are the effects of love and the consequences of its absence. Every significant conflict in the story finds itself in the middle of a struggle between characters for the love or appreciation of another. Whenever love is absent from a specific situation, the results become disastrous. In East of Eden, Steinbeck emphasizes the importance of the presence of love in the lives of all people and its powerful role in every outcome. Perhaps my main problem with this book is its organization. Steinbeck seems to jump from one story to another, losing the reader through confusion. Many stories seem to be brought up out of nowhere and end up having no real weight in the novel's \\"big picture.\\" In the end however, the book is an excellent read as well as an intriguing look into life."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck's heart-fulfilling allegory to the biblical story of Cain and Abel demonstrates the qualities and emotions of what it is to be human. The tension, jealousy, and agony are portrayed through characters who make up the entire spectrum of human characteristics. It is a tale of the emotional drama that persists within a family will leave readers engaged. East of Eden will take the reader on an emotional journey because it provokes thought and opinion, making it a piece hard to put down. The language of the novel is like an art which gives literal subjects an unique meaning and interpretation. Each character shows a part of human nature."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden provides a interesting reading experience and never fails to suprise. The characters are all very complex and change throughout the story. It is about two families, the Trask's and the Hamilton's whose path meet in the Salinas Valley of California. East of Eden also parallels the biblical story of Cain and Abel. The rivalry between Adam and Charles and Aron and Caleb directly parallels this story, the only difference being that Aron and Caleb (Adam's children) manage to resolve thier rivalry with each other. Cathy represents the evil character while Adam is the Ultimate good. Adam starts off very naive and gets taken advantage of by Cathy; and not until later does he finally become more aware and sees what Cathy really is. A theme in this novel is the need to be loved. Charles and Caleb, both feel that thier father's do not love them and this creates an extreme jealousy of Adam and Aron respectively."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's East of Eden is a captivating novel that uses many interesting devices that make it one of the classics of literature. The text is sophisticated and descriptive without being overburdened by wordiness. The author's tone, message, and intent are clearly conveyed through the simple, easy-to-understand words so there is less room for misinterpretation. The plot continues to evolve throughout the book as interesting characters are intertwined in this story of love vs. hate, good vs. evil, and reality vs. dreams. Even though he uses such common cliches as his main themes, Steinbeck effectively depicts each point through two generations of two different families--the Trasks and the Hamiltons. The characters are so diverse that every reader can feel a common relation or similarity. Set in California at the time period between the Civil War and WWII, Steinbeck depicted the American's typical values or beliefs pertaining to home and to war at the time. This book is also known for its biblical parallel of Cain and Abel to the Trask brothers in the age-old story of sibling rivalry. Neither an unrealistic fantasy where all goes well nor a depressing account on the bleakness of life, the East of Eden offers a balance which tries to the depict the many sides of life without giving it a false generalization."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden, written by John Steinbeck, takes the reader back to the early 1900's, when horses were being replaced by automobiles and California still had open, fertile land for beans. The competitive relationship between twin brothers follows the story of \\"Cain and Abel\\", but is easily followed by a reader who is not Christian.I recomend this book for the teenage readers. Although filled with numerous chapters, the book reads easily. With an intricate plot and characters whose secrets are slowly unraveled, Steinbeck creates a novel full of characters with complex emotions, motives and relationships. Although rarely a dull moment exists for the Trask family and their companions, the book encompasses so many characters that it takes some getting used to Steinbeck's ever-changing focus in the chapters. The book often introduces an under-developed character who dies, unfortunately, directly after the reader has formed an attachment to him.I would not say that this book should become a part of your permanent library, but it deserves consideration. John Steinbeck is a creative writer and easily displays this in East of Eden."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"While I did find this novel enticing, enjoyable, and a fulfilling read, I did at times find East of Eden by John Steinbeck somewhat unorganized and hard to understand. For a majority of this novel, I couldn't put it down. Themes of good vs. evil as well as love become apparent to the reader. Characters are well developed and liked by the audience. Unfortunately, it was difficult to keep track of what or who you were reading about. Steinbeck would go for a chapter on one character in one setting and then completely jump to another family or character in another city. It was in the hope of the reader that these two families, the Hamiltons and the Trasks, would one day cross paths. In many ways I found this novel much like a soap opera you would find on television. There is Cathy, a whore of a mother to the sons of Adams children, Caleb and Aron. However, it is unknown to the audience if they children are even Adams, possibly being his brother Charles who Cathy slept with at one point in the novel. I found myself getting so in depth into one part of the novel and just when it got good or revealed a fact about a character, Steinbeck would go and change everything all around. If you are looking for a quick read, this isn't your novel. If you are ready to maybe read sections over a few times to understand what is going on then this is your novel. Steinbeck is an amazing author however maybe this isn't his best work."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I had always thought John Steinbeck was the author of boring books and more boring books. After reading The Pearl, which I found quite annoying, I chose to stay away from all of Steinbeck's books. So I was a bit hesitant in reading East of Eden at first, but after having read it I have no regrets. John Steinbeck captures human nature like no other in his characters. He portrays the struggles of good and evil and ignorance versus truth. His writing contains topics the reader will ponder over for days after reading it. My math teacher told me that Cathy Ames, the antagonist of his novel, has been said to be one of the most evil villains in all of literature history. But don't just read this book for its colorful character developments, read it if you like to think about life. Steinbeck has some worthwhile observations about human nature in this book. Don't be bored this summer! Read a book! Read East of Eden!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is probably the best Steinbeck novel I have read so far. I personally love the way he describes the setting. He makes you feel like you are there with the characters. This is an excellent story and provides deeper understanding of the story of Cain and Abel. It has somewhat of an elusive climax but that's alright because it is good throughout the entire novel. It is the longest book I have read but I certainly don't regret reading it and will probably read it again."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Powerful, Compelling, TimelessJohn Steinbeck's East of Eden is a powerful novel that takes an in-depth look at the inward struggle of good vs. evil that goes on within all people. Set in the 1930s, East of Eden is a vivid and realistic portrayal of life in the southwest during that time. This novel deserves as much praise as its predecessor Grapes of Wrath.The characters that Steinbeck created in his novel are strong and intriguing. While the plotline lagged at times, the characters compelled me to continue reading. Three of the best drawn and most important characters in the story are Adam, Cal, and Cathy. Adam is an army veteran. He has a good heart, and an innocent outlook which leads him to marry a woman who not only doesn't love him, but eventually shoots him and leaves him for dead. His son Cal also has a good heart, but he often struggles with it and finds himself praying to be more like his brother Aron, who never experiences any kinds of inner turmoil. Cathy is Adam's wife, and from her first appearance in the book is described as a cold hearted monster. On pg.95 Steinbeck writes while introducing her character, \\"I believe there are monsters born in the world to human parents. Some you can see misshapen and horrible, with huge heads or tiny bodies... And just as there are physical monsters, can there not be mental or psychic monsters born? The face and body may be perfect but if a twisted gene or a malformed egg can produce physical monsters, may not the same process produce a malformed soul?\\" While Cathy is well developed, her character is never totally understood. For example, what drives her and where her unremorseful cruelty comes from is never revealed, it is only suggested that these were characteristics that she was born with, not characteristics that developed over time. Steinbeck writes of her on pg.96 \\"It is my belief that Cathy Ames was born with the tendencies, or lack of them, which drove and forced her all her life.\\"One of the most interesting things about East of Eden, is its new spin on two of the words most ancient biblical stories; Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel. Adam and Eve is about the first two humans and their banishment from the garden of Eden after disobeying God. In East of Eden, Adam and Cathy's relationship parallels that of Adam and Eve. In the book Adam moves a pregnant Cathy to Salinas Valley, California, where he buys a huge plot of land and begins to create a gigantic garden on it. But when Cathy decides that she can no longer stand her life with Adam, she leaves him, which subsequently results in the deterioration of the garden that Adam was trying to make. Adam loses his Eve, (Cathy) and because of it, his garden and life turn from heavenly to hellish.Cain and Abel is about two brothers who both make an offering to God, but only one of the offerings, Abel's, is accepted, while Cain is told to do better. Feeling that he's been rejected by God, Cain becomes angry and kills Abel. In East of Eden, the relationships of both Adam and Charles, and Cal and Aron, parallel that of Cain and Abel. Charles becomes jealous and attempts, (though does not succeed,) to kill his brother Adam with a hatchet because their father loves him more. Cal becomes jealous of Aron for the same reason, only in this case Cal's actions towards his brother are indirectly responsible for his death. In both situations the breaking point occurred when the fathers either preferred one of their son's gifts over the other's, or rejected one of their son's gifts while accepting the other son's. Taking these two stories, (Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel) which some people can't connect with, and weaving them into a plot with characters which the reader can't help but connect with, was very captivating.A main theme in this novel is relationships, mainly those between fathers and sons, and brothers. Steinbeck did a wonderful job writing an honest account of the jealousy that can arise between siblings as a result of having a parent who favors one of them over the other. The various emotions and driving factors that were touched on while exploring these relationships were true to form and something that anyone who has brothers or sisters can personally understand.East of Eden was moving and left a solid imprint in my mind. Steinbeck succeeded in writing an unforgettable novel. It is truly worthy of a second read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The initial response to East of Eden reminds me of the reviews of Tchaikovski's violin concerto which was excoriated at its debut as &quot;an assault on the violin.&quot; It's clear that those who initially evaluated the novel clearly failed to appreciate the scope of Steinbeck's ambition and the extent to which he succeeded. I've read this novel 5 times now, each time more slowly. I always come away astonished at the depth of his understanding of the human condition, particularly his understanding that the feeling of being unloved has caused most of the misery in history."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is definitely not short on Biblical themes and references, but as someone who is - at best - agnostic, I wasn't put off at all by this. East of Eden is an obvious Steinbeck work, in that it does have a lot of the darker side of human-kind along with the turn-of-the-century California setting. The grandiose tale spans two families and three generations, with apt ties between all. It is a story of morality and brings up some questions about the soul and inner workings of us all. To me, it ultimately boils down to a story of hope, highlighted by the repeated mention of a single word, timshel, which equates to \\"thou mayest.\\" It is this theme of choosing and controlling your own destiny that most captivated me, as well as the thoughts on acceptance and forgiveness."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have no earthly notion why Oprah selected a Steinbeck work of this magnitude and scope to resurrect her book club. However, maybe without Oprah's generous promotional efforts, this particular work by John Steinbeck (1902-68) might have remained the obscure and enigmatic masterpiece that it is. Keen movie buffs will recall the attempt some thirty-odd years ago (or more?) to convert this novel into a movie [executed appropriately in funereal black and white, instead of in dazzling color ... despite the sunny brilliance of California's Salinas Valley]. The brooding actor James Dean had the role of brother Caleb, who vies for the affection and approval of his father, played imperially by Anthony Quinn. The movie version was not at all a box-office success mainly because, in my view, the story was so amazingly intricate and overwhelming with its ponderously convoluted psychological elements. The same is true with the novel: multi-layered in approach, tone, and structure, resulting in constant nervous tension and anguish. But then who would dare argue with a giant of such innovative literary artistry as Nobel Prize (1962) winning writer John Steinbeck? At some point shortly after the initial publication of this novel (1952) Steinbeck himself alluded to the \\"difficulty\\" (e.i.,complexity) of this powerfully dramatic work. He was extremely pleased. And difficult it most certainly is. I know I'm dating myself, but so what? Does anyone remember those essential Cliff Notes that regularly accompanied literary Master Works? Well, there was one for EAST OF EDEN. Believe me, this handy little yellow booklet proved indispensable to many readers 'back in the day.' A Masterful Read!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's novel East of Eden is like Christmas. It shows humanity in both it's extremes; the cruel underside like christmas shoppers, but more frequently the good will to all men (and women) which makes the world a wonderful place. Most importantly Steinbeck stresses the fact that we are the ones who decide whether we are good or evil, however he is not moralistic and the bad people do not always come to a sticky end. Ultimatly East of Eden shows the rewards of 'being good' in terms of personal satisfaction rather than material gain. While not as overtly socialist as 'The Grapes of Wrath' Steinbeck still includes some left-wing views such as his approach to explaning racism by means of subhumanising the victim. East of Eden is more than an 'important' piece of 20th century American fiction which should be read for dinner party conversation, it is an stunning piece of work that once again reinforces Steinbecks position of a great novelist with a excellent and hopefully justifiable knowlegde of human nature."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"For about the first 200 pages, I was in the firm belief that this book would trump Grapes of Wrath. It is hard to review this book, because I would not want to turn someone away from reading it. Reading is more about the journey itself than what you get at the end most times. However, I really felt like he was going after too much with this book. It started off very bold and very focused, but after the half way mark and until the end there was so much unnecessary stuff that any other author not named John Steinbeck would never have gotten published. It's like he wanted to add a lot of autobiographical stuff in there, but he wanted to have his story about Adam and his family. When I put it down, I was left feeling that this could have been an amazing book at 300 pages. The theme was difficult to grasp, and this was not the case with Grapes and some of his other books. I am not sorry I read it. It has given me some things to think about. The language, as always, was beautifully written. But I just didn't connect with this and felt too much artistic license was given because he had done so well with Grapes. I'm a hater! Worth three stars though because the parts of this book that are good are better than any novel written in the past 50 years."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is by far John Steinbeck's most ambitious novel, and though his reach may have exceeded his grasp, it still extended farther than he ever had before. Through a modern retelling of the story of Cain and Abel, Steinbeck examines the nature of good and evil. Though his idea of what constitutes the good and the evil isn't too clear---what determines one's moral worth for Steinbeck seems to lie not even just in his relationship to others, but merely in how others *feel* about him---but this doesn't detract too much from the novel, because he is focused mainly on one aspect of the issue, namely the question of whether we are born guilty or are some how guilty by nature.And Steinbeck largely rejects this notion. East of Eden is, at its core, a repudiation of the doctrine of original sin.But what makes it such a good novel is that these themes are explored through a cast of engaging characters and an engrossing story. Kate is one of the greatest villains in literature, and by far Steinbeck's best...the chapters about her are absolutely blood-chilling. Adam Trask and their sons Cal and Aron are fascinating, complex characters. And the supporting cast is great, particularly Steinbeck's grandfather Samuel Hamilton and the Trask's philosophical Chinese cook, Lee.The story of Adam's blind love of Kate and her heartless manipulation of him and everyone around her for her own ends and the consequences of both, and of their sons' rivalry for the love of their father and its resolution, is a powerfully moving one. Steinbeck considered this his greatest achievement, saying, \\"It has everything in it I have been able to learn about my craft or profession in all these years,\\" and, \\"I think everything else I have written has been, in a sense, practice for this.\\" He was right.Four and a half stars."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It's always difficult for me to write a review about a book I absolutely loved. I can't believe I waited this long to read this epic masterpiece. The writing is beautiful, the story and characters memorable; it's one of those stories you will never forget, but you will want to reread even though you know what will happen.--just one of my favorite passages---\\"In uncertainty I am certain that underneath their topmost layers of frailty men want to be good and want to be loved. Indeed, most of their vices are attempted short cuts to love. When a man comes to die, no matter what his talents and influence and genius, if he dies unloved his life must be a failure to him and his dying a cold horror. It seems to me that if you or I must choose between two courses of thought or action, we should remember our dying and try so to live that our death brings no pleasure to the world\\".We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the never ending contests in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.\\"The book is 600 pages and the audio book was read by Richard Poe, a favorite reader. I loved the audio, but needed to reread sections, just because the writing was so wonderful. The story is somewhat autobiographical and it also reminds the reader of the biblical story of Cain and Abel from the Book of Genesis. It is a story which spans a period covering the Civil War and World War 1, but yet, it is not a story about our country at war.It's a story of three generations and two families. The family of Samuel and Liza Hamilton, Irish immigrants. Samuel was a wise and loving man, and a wonderful husband and father to nine children. The other family is Cyrus and Alice Trask, and their two sons Charles and Adam. Cyrus is a tough on his boys as well as his wife.Adam and Charles Trask are brothers with personalities as different as day and night, from an early age they vie for their father's love and approval. Adam is gentle, Charles is mean. After their mother passes away and later their powerful father, Cyrus, the brothers are left a large sum of money. Adam marries a woman named Cathy, who he knows very little about. Not only is she conniving, she has a sordid past and is pure evil. She's a woman who will do whatever it takes to get what she wants. Shortly after they move away to Salinas Valley, California, Cathy gives birth to twin sons, who she wants nothing to do with. Not only doesn't she want to be a mother, she has no interest in being a wife either. She does what she must to escape her situation.Lee, is a Chinese cook and servant for the Trasks who basically raises the young boys, after Cathy leaves. Adam is devastated after his wife has left and unable to deal with the young twins. It is only after she is gone that the twins are even given names after Lee insists on it. They are named Caleb (Cal) and Aron, after Cain and Abel.Lee was an amazing character, a gentle and smart man who shares his bits of wisdom though out the story. The boys, like their father and his brother Charles, are opposites, and each compete for their father's love and affection as well. As the boys grow up Cal learn bits and pieces about the mother they knew. Eventually they meet her, and one son fears he shares some of his mother's evil traits.While the first half of the book tells mostly the story of the Hamilton's, Cyrus and Alice Trask and their son's Charles and Adam. The second half's focus is on the sons of Adam and Cathy, Caleb (Cal) and Abel.The entire story held my interest, and the 600 pages and numerous audio discs came to an end all too quickly. I want to read it again already. So happy I read this book. This is sure to be a new top 5 books of all time."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is the BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. For me, John Steinbeck is the VERY BEST WRITER EVER! His common sense and philosophical combination in print is better than any college course. A must read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"BAD, TERRIBLE TYPOS AWAIT YOU! I'm currently reading this \\"Centennial Edition\\", and while I love Steinbeck, the publishers and editors should be ashamed of this edition. I expect a typo or two in a book, but this edition is rife with them to the point of distraction. Some are so glaring that it's almost unbelievable that someone missed them. This is a great novel. Look for a more fitting edition."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's EAST OF EDEN was not well received by critics when it debuted in the 1950s, and although passing years have seen several re-evaluations it is still reguarded as secondary to the likes of GRAPES OF WRATH and OF MICE AND MEN. It is true that the novel is flawed: it is a great big rambling thing crammed with obvious allegory, metaphor, and allusion, loosely structured to say the least. And yet, in a odd sort of way, the very rambling, the looseness, the obviousness of the work gives it a tremendous grandeur that Steinbeck's more tightly structured work lacks. The novel is as broad and vulgar and lively and provocative as the America it describes--and it is my favorite of Steinbeck's fiction.Any one who comes to the novel from the famous film adaptation starring James Dean will be surprized, for the roots of the novel run much deeper than the film, which is based only on perhaps a third of the novel. This is not so much the story of brothers Aaron and Caleb Trask as it is the story of their parents, Adam Trask and Catherine Ames. And in \\"Cathy\\" Ames, Steinbeck creates one of the darkest characters in all of 20th Century American Literature, a creature devoid of virtually anything recognizable as human emotion. Fleeing from a past that includes murder, perversion, blackmail, and prostitution, Cathy assumes an angelic demeanor and lures the emotionally needy Adam Trask into love and marriage. And when she no longer requires his protection... she destroys him.It is the stuff of classic melodrama, but in Steinbeck's hands it becomes more than melodrama; it becomes a novel that alternately reads at leisurely pace and then suddenly reads with the speed of a whirlwind, a tale that forces us to consider the nature of good and evil and the legacies we may leave for later generations. For Adam and Cathy have two sons, and in the wake of their tragedy they will be left to fight out issues of moral choices, right and wrong, and love and hate in the sun-drenched Salinas Valley of California, the \\"golden west\\" of the \\"new world\\" as it rushes headlong into the modern age. It is a novel epic in history, geography, and morality.Some will find the novel's constant reference to the story of Cain and Able more than a little obvious; others will find it too meandering, filled with too many side-issues and minor subplots. Still others may be put off by the very slow way in which the novel gathers itself during its first hundred or so pages. But once the pieces are in place, Steinbeck suddenly pulls the threads together to create one of the most remarkable tapestries in American letters--a tapestry that has no clearcut boundaries and that, for all its simplistic tone, offers little in the way of simplistic answers to the issues it raises. Flawed, yes, but a great novel by a master of the form, so great that its flaws become intrinsic to its virtues. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It's always difficult reading a book that has been praised to the skies without expecting too much, and that's why it usually fails to deliver. Those who read it after this book became an Oprah Book Club selection seem to have come to it with just such expectations.Try, however, to always approach a book or movie, however much it has been praised, as any other. Simply pick it up and read it without any expectations. This is how I read it, and gosh, was I pleasantly surprised.The characters are people I wish I could know personally--especially Samuel, I wished I could be one of his many children just to have him as a father; Lee, so taciturn yet wise and always there, such a comfort to have and know such a person; and Caleb, whom we tend to identify with in so many ways.True, the story might have extremes, and be predictable if you were able to keep yourself so uninvolved in the story. Those who commented on the 'plot', perhaps such a book is not what you ought to read. Pick up a Grisham or some other fast-paced 'plotty' book.East of Eden is for those who think, who care about who they are and who they want to be or ought to have been. People have talked of its being depressing. It's not. I hate depressing books myself. At least it's not a meaningless depression in which you can't identify with the story at all, but it simply sucks you down. This book made me cry at many points--from empathy or sympathy for the characters, from the beauty of the language, and from appreciating the wisdom in it.I admire passages, descriptions, dialogues so much in this book that I re-read them, and re-read the entire novel already, and may do so again. I'm not the kind who likes to re-read books either. There's simply so much wisdom and simplicity and reassurance in here that it's a treasure--for me, at least. I think I'm lucky to have a book that means so much to me."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck is at his best in this classic tale of sibling rivalry as he examines what we become vs. what we *may* become. The Biblical tale of Cain and Abel sets the tone as we are introduced to two sets of brothers. Each tries to win the love of his father in different ways. The story of why one brother succeeds while another feels unloved is beautifully told.Adam Trask, from the first set of brothers, repeats his own story with his sons, the twins Aron and Caleb. The enduring themes of light vs. dark, good vs. evil, hatred vs. love, and always the free will, the ability to choose one's own destiny are paramount to this rich and multi-layered tale.Above all, it is the characters you will long remember from this riveting saga. Cathy, the whore with a heart of stone, has to be one of the most evil characters in all literature. She kills her parents, beds her husband's brother on her wedding night, shoots her husband and desserts her infant sons. And, all this before she turns really bad! Truly a character to be analyzed for decades to come. On the other hand there are the wonderful characters of Samuel and Lee, men you will long remember for their wisdom, caring, and sheer goodness. And there is Adam, a zombie of a man until his great re-birth and spectacular failure finds him caught in a web of good and evil that he will long struggle with.John Steinbeck puts himself into the novel, as Samuel Hamilton is based on his own maternal grandfather. The entire Hamilton clan is one that represents the true \\"salt of the earth\\" and elevates this to \\"great American novel\\" stature.The story is complex and involving, the characters unforgettable. Kudos to Oprah for reviving interest in this wonderful story."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This one's dark folks. I have to say I didn't expect Steinbeck's \\"East of Eden,\\" to catch me the way it did. The themes Steinbeck struggles with are epic--the relationship of men within the family, good and evil, human nature. Critics derided the novel when it came out and it may have left Steinbeck struggling to write in his waning years, but the Nobel prize he received shortly after \\"East of Eden's\\" release was truly deserving. Truly deserving because of the work of \\"East of Eden,\\" and not despite it.I read the wonderful and incomparable biography \\"John Steinbeck, Writer,\\" by Jackson J. Benson before tackling \\"East of Eden,\\" and it tainted my expectations. Some criticisms of the novel I found initially true. Steinbeck seems to be more straightforward and writes more of what's on his mind instead of letting the story and characters breathe these things naturally. At some point in the novel that approach strikes me as breaking the novelist dictum of, \\"show don't tell.\\" Steinbeck does a lot of telling. Surprisingly enough, in the end, this slight misstep strengthens the overall story. It puts you in the mind of Steinbeck and allows the reader to gain a deeper understanding of the dark dark nature of some of \\"East of Eden's\\" characters.Steinbeck always tended to have a dark side, but \\"East of Eden,\\" is a stark look at the underbelly of humanity. However, while we are looking at the underbelly of a seemingly upright community of Salinas, we also see that humanity is redeeming. Some of the very incomprehensible evil within a person is matching by a boundless capacity for good. How can that be? This is why Steinbeck's \\"East of Eden,\\" surpasses the better known and wider read, \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\" Steinbeck seems to accept human nature and not sugar coat. He tells it like it is.Steinbeck struggled and struggled to write and finish \\"East of Eden.\\" The scope of what he was trying to attempt was extremely daunting...almost debilitatingly so. Steinbeck tried to retell the story of \\"Genesis,\\" set in his hometown of Salinas...drawing from his own life, the town's life, the times between the Civil War and World War I. He pulls it off with quite some characters...Adam Trask and his twin sons Caleb and Aron, their mother--the completely evil Cathy/Cat/Kate, Adam's evenly evil and good brother Charles, the sage Chinese Lee, and the beautiful of mind, body, and spirit love interest of no less than Caleb, Aron, and Lee...Abra. I think to call, \\"East of Eden,\\" lacking in story and characters is severely missing the mark. Another criticism of the book is that the Chinese character of Lee is a racial stereotype. I didn't find this to be the case. Lee seems to be a multi-dimensional character that if anything deepens the understanding that his ethnicity takes a back seat to his humanity. Another criticism is that the character Kate is too evil...to the point of dehumanization. Steinbeck's portrayal of Kate may have roots in his failed relationships but it does not come across as misogynistic. He balances this out with other female characters, such as Abra, that have capacity for the gamut of human characteristics. Kate's portrayal of evil makes the character more real...more frightening...and indicative of human evil that, regardless of philosophy, tends to surface from time to time.In my mind, Steinbeck's \\"Cannery Row,\\" still stands out as his best (at least among his works I've read so far), but \\"East of Eden,\\" solidifies his place among a very short list of greatest American authors. It is a work deserving of a Nobel Prize for literature...damn the critics to say what they will.--MMW"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's East of Eden, which was a late, great masterpiece in the author's career, is also one of the greatest American novels of all-time. The book is unique in many ways, with many idiosyncrasies, some of them quite out of Steinbeck's usual style. To start with, many of Steinbeck's works are overtly political; among these are some of his best and best-known works. East of Eden is not among them. As the title suggests, and almost every mention of the book points out, the book is a modern retelling of the Biblical Cain and Abel story. Contrary to what such proclamations -- not to mention Oprah -- might lead one to think, however, this is not a theological, a religious, or a Christian book: the Cain and Abel allegory is the bare bones that Steinbeck uses to prop up his own visionary, allegorical masterpiece. Aside from its non-political nature, Eden is also distinctive in the Steinbeck canon for other reasons. For one, it features almost no dialect, unlike most of his other famous works; Steinbeck's deceptively simple prose is at its best here, clear and yet philosophical. It also has a much different structure than, say, The Grapes of Wrath: though it tells the parallel and intersecting stories of two families, it does not feature alternating chapters; it also tends to be quite discursive. It also proves to be quite distinctive for other reasons: as an allegory, this is not a psychological novel. The actions of the characters in the novel are presented, more or less, per se, without their actions being unduly analyzed and without their inner thoughts being much probed. Their actions are not explained: they simply ARE. In the case of the perpetually evil Cathy, this can be somewhat frustrating; much of the novel's criticism has focused upon her believability as a character. On that note, it is worthwhile to remember that, in keeping with the book's Biblical bent, she symbolizes Satan. Cathy sees only the bad in people and exploits it for her own purposes. Her downfall comes because she fails to ever see the other side of the coin.And the fact that there are two sides of the coin is the point of the book. The novel is Steinbeck's wake-up call to everyone drifting toward a determinist future. Yes, we have evil coursing through our veins -- but we also have good. Which one we choose to make use of is our own choice -- and no one's but our own. No matter whom our parents are, no matter what our circumstances may be, no matter what others may think of us -- the choice, in the end, resides with us, and us alone. Steinbeck also explores some of his other favorite themes in this monumental work. One of these is the inexplicability of love, symbolized both for Adam's apparently-unfounded yet mysterious love for Cathy and by Cyrus and Adam's preference for one son over another. Another is the consequences of not being loved -- of rejection. Charles and Cal believe that their respective fathers do not love them; they use this thought to justify much of their sometimes questionable behavior. This would seem to be the message of the book for many: that parents must love their children equally, that rejection and favoritism have, sometimes quite literally, murderous consequences and can lead to cruelty and hatred. With such an interpretation, the doctrine of original sin has its origins not in the Fall of Adam and Eve, but in God's rejection of Cain's gift. Such is the reading on the novel's glossy surface. However, it is well to remember that Cathy IS loved; and yet, not only does she does not love back, she carries out her evil deeds all the more -- not IN SPITE of her being loved, but perhaps even BECAUSE of it. This relates back to Steinbeck's true message: it the end the choice between good and evil, right and wrong, love and hate -- regardless of rejection, regardless of whether or not we are loved -- is ours, and ours alone.Timshel!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck proposed four potential titles before he settled upon East of Eden. I looked up the phrase in the Bible and found that it appears twice in Genesis (3:24 and 4:16); both accounts denoting an instance where man experienced a separation from the blessings that God had intended for him. I think this is very significant as we consider what Steinbeck was writing about in his allegorical novel. He says in Chapter 34, &quot;We have only one story. All novels, all poetry are built on the never-ending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal.&quot;The contest is in ourselves! Surely this is what East Of Eden teaches us while we enjoy the sweeping story, so well told. It is deadly realistic, as beautiful and revolting as is the actual human potentiality for good and evil. With brilliance, Steinbeck contrasts a sea of temperaments in these characters, and shows us all the while that life is much more than the choices we make, but it is never any less. Adam Trask is the representative of good intentions, of a conscience which responds to the good as the eye responds to the light. Samuel Hamilton also represents a similar (perhaps even more well-honed) goodness. But Adam is the one who has been deceived, by a force every bit as essentially evil as Eden's serpent in the tree. This is Cathy, a character so reprobate that evil isn't something she does, it's something she IS that INFECTS everything she does! After abandoning her twin boys Caleb and Aron to the care of their father (Adam) she returns to her life of debauchery. The boys grow up unaware that their mother is a serial murderer and owner of a whorehouse. Because Adam never fully recovers from his shame, his loss and disillusionment, he is not able to convey the appropriate unconditional (equally distributed) love to his sons. This leads to jealousy and rivalry in his boys, and is a generational replica of his own childhood.How can one summarize such a vast epic story? But for me, one of the most powerful scenes and a turning point (perhaps the denouement?) is when Caleb finally sees his mother in all her non-glory, and says to her... &quot;I don't have to be you.&quot; The reader can notice that really no-one is the same from this point on, there is a real unravelling here. For Cathy (now &quot;Kate&quot;), this marks the beginning of her own self-destruction, the awakening of her own conscience. She's been defied!One of the tendencies of the modern age is to deny radically the absolute nature of conscience, reducing it to a matter of temperament, or to a product of history or social environment. But East of Eden plows right through a tangle of sociological, psychological, and historical half-truths to the elementray fact: CONSCIENCE EXISTS."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"How wonderful that, through Oprah's discovery of it, so many readers will immerse themselves in this rich novel! I've loved it since my freshman year of college (I spent a weekend devouring it after seeing the James Dean film.) I live in Northern California now, and Steinbeck's description of the Salinas Valley in spring rings true to me each year. EAST OF EDEN is the Cain and Abel story (note how the names of Cathy, Abra and the Trasks start with C or A), but it's also the realization that through that story, we have been granted freedom of choice, for good or ill. And it is Steinbeck's own story; the Hamiltons were his mother's family, and how I loved getting acquainted with them. I very much appreciate Lee, who subtly represents the multifaceted history of the Chinese people in this area. There is US history, from the Civil War to WWI, and the settling of California. And there is, ultimately, the triumph of love over the evil of shame and doubt. The defining moment falls in the exact center of the book: Steinbeck was a master storyteller, and I am ever grateful he shared this one with us."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book has it all--sweeping themes which are common to all people, fascinating and flawed characters, and an interesting interweaving of people's choices and the impact this has on those around them. The novel is based on the Biblical account of Cain and Abel in the book of Genesis. Steinbeck dwells on the sibling rivalry which pits one brother against another for their father's love. This occurs in two generations with Charlie and Adam in the first generation and Adam's twin sons Cal and Aron in the second. There are fascinating characters, such as the wicked Cathy who finds men's weaknesses and preys on them for her own gain, the wise and philosophical Chinese servant Lee, and the wonderful dreamer named Samuel Hamilton. The Hamilton family is patterned after Steinbeck's maternal family and he sometimes takes side-trips to the plot in order to tell some family tale which has been passed on to him by oral tradition. Another interesting theme has to do with dreamers, like Adam and Aron, who only see what they want to see, and realists, such as Samuel's wife, whose view is likewise narrowed by her practical nature. Abra starts out as a dreamer, but grows into a woman who sees the greys in life and learns to accept them without letting them detroy her. A favorite theme seems to deal with paternal expectations and how these can overpower and sometimes detroy a son. Steinbeck delves into the question of inherited predisposition towards sin and resoundingly concludes that we all have choices and we are not driven totally by our genetic disposition. This is a fascinating study of human nature and of good vs. evil and is a wonderful read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is not as famous or as widely recognised as The Grapes of Wrath or Of Mice and Men, but it is interesting that the author considered all previous books as 'practice' for the great novel of his life, which is East of Eden. (Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters)This novel, together with Burning Bright, is my favourite of Steinbeck books.It runs in two parallel story lines - one of the Trasks where the Cain and Abel fable is replicated in two generations; and that of the Hamiltons, Steinbeck's own maternal family - the telling is fun and full of affection and great tenderness, especially the portrayal of Samuel, Steinbeck's grandfather. The effect of the parallel stories, which cross only very tenuously gives the effect of a very great scope of the novel, a full sweep of history, and place and time immortal.I could give a very bland description of what happens - but I won't because it is a poor copy of what Steinbeck does a thousand times better. What I can write about is that reading this story (and I have read it many times) always gives me a full, satisfied feeling. I think it is because it covers the great extremes of many themes, and all in between. Great good, and monstrous evil; love and hate ... all mixed up in a complex soup, which is perhaps as simple as any experience of life.Ironically, my favourite characters are the very very good Samuel, and the very very bad Cathy."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"If you want to read an author who can almost effortlessly draw you into the tapestry of his characters, in 600 pages and yet without frittering away a single word, then you have to love Steinbeck! What makes this 1952 novel the timeless opus that I believe it is (now fortunately in new paperback version thanks to Oprah,) is that ANY reader can relate to it on so many levels.You may find the story winding and complicated at the outset, peopled by characters that are often virtuous in some ways and flawed in others. But soon you'll realize how real these people are, and you'll be reading on if only to figure out what happens to each of them. The plot and the author's beautiful descriptive passages pull you along at a refreshing pace once you are into it.Although the main character's name is Adam, it's the Biblical story of Cain and Abel that is played out over and over with characters whose names begin with \\"C\\" and \\"A\\". Adam's father, Cyrus, is quite the wild man. Adam's brother, Charles, tries to kill him. Adam's wife, Cathy, abandons him and their newborn twins to pursue the lifestyle of evil she cannot escape. Their children Aron and Caleb continue as opponents trying to vie for their father's attention until the bitter end.And when you finish trudging through the entire thing, you'll feel like having actually lived and breathed the philosophies and lessons of a lifetime. Steinbeck's acute awareness of the interplay of his themes despite his lingusitic economy is an absolute joy to behold. His characters are specific and alive, mirroring real people and their foibles.I highly recommend this classic piece of literature but be prepared to read. It's not your average pulp."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden by John Steinbeck is just about as good as it gets. This story features the classic battle of good vs. evil.Adam Trask represents the good while the woman he falls in love with is the epitome of evil. Now this should not ruin the story for you, nor provide any hidden insight, as Mr. Steinbeck tells a truly remarkable story; leaving little to the imagination. From the birth of one character, and her intitial label as a monster, to the evocative descriptions of a barren landscape; Mr. Steinbeck is at the peak of writing prowess.This book is well-worth the time investment necessary to read it. Once done, however, the end result is well worth it. The characters in this book will stay with you."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck, despite past controversy, is one of America's finest novelists, fully deserving the resurgence in interest caused by The Oprah Phenomenon. It reflects the current cultural mania for 'names' that it takes such publicity to attract readers to someone who should be read anyway. Steinbeck is so much better than so many highly touted writers of today that the 'name' mania seems bizarre, inexplicable.East of Eden is beautifully written in every sense--story, plot and characters. It draws the reader in from the start and demands to be read, to savor the magnificent prose and wonder at the skills of observation and exposition Steinbeck demonstrates. Some critics have suggested, over the decades since the book was first published, that the author pushed his biblical allegories too far, that Kathy was outrageous and improbable in her behavior, that the depictions of time and place were harsh and unrealistic. Those critics had clearly led simple lives and had never been exposed to actual people who behaved far worse--yes, they truly exist--or actual places where the cultural landscape was equally complex and often agony to experience.It is perhaps difficult for a modern reader to adopt the attitude that would permit the comfortable assimilation of East of Eden. It is not a modern book, but this novel proves that great writing transcends time and fad, that Steinbeck was a hugely talented, powerful and fearless writer who could tackle difficult material and convey it with searing intensity.I have re-read this book many times and remain in awe at how powerful and memorable it is. Having read, perhaps, 25,000 or more books in my life, I rate this among the top 10 and find it magnificent in every way."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I cannot believe I haven't read this book sooner. I was taken in immediately by the sheer language of the author. The prose was so wonderfully descriptive that I could visualize every place, every item, every character- it was as if a movie was playing in my head as I read each word. It was a classic \\"good vs. evil\\" theme that was realistic in that the good don't always prosper and the evil don't always get what (we feel) they deserve. The character development was great. Some characters were more complex while some characters were really one-dimensional, however, I believe that was the intent of the author because it made the story work. The author made me have an opinion about each character, and whether I liked the character or not, I understood his/her actions and cared about what happened to them. I am now looking forward to reading and re-reading more Steinbeck novels and other classics.You're probably wondering why I only gave this book a 3 star rating after all of this raving. I deducted a star because of one word - EDITING! I ran across mispellings, grammatical errors and punctuation errors. That is unacceptable for a published piece of writing. Especially for a classic work such as this. I am shocked that the editor and publisher did not pay closer attention to this. Otherwise, this book is an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I'm amazed that it took, of all people, Oprah to encourage me to re-read this Steinbeck novel. But, after 35 years, I bought and read the new Oprah-recommended book, and I was amazed at how much I enjoyed it, particularly because of the vivid descriptions of early 20th Century-era Salinas, California, which is close to where I live. Steinbeck is a very talented writer. Because he was born in the early 1900s, he had a good feel for that era, and even gives an interesting insight into 19th century America with his descriptions of the childhoods Adam and Charles Trask, and their father. If you are ever in Salinas, be sure to check out the Steinbeck Museum on Main Street. Also, after reading this book, you might want to also read Steinbeck's depression-era masterpiece, \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" and check out the 1939 John Ford movie starring Henry Fonda. Steinbeck did a lot of screenwriting in Hollywood, and had a hand in the \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" script, as well."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read this book for the first time many years ago because I am a John Steinbeck fan. I thought that Grapes of Wrath was wonderful, but this book is even more mesmorizing. You can picture the characters and actually feel the good and evil and confusion in each of them. I read both Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden at least five times. Both are lengthy, but both tell a story that will keep you up all night reading. If anyone has seen the old movie, it no way compares to the book. What did compare to the book was a television mini-series way back in the 80's which starred Jane Seymour as Kathy. It was wonderful and so portrayed this book and I am desperately trying to find it on DVD. You will be so disturbed by this book and you won't be able to put it down. I was thrilled that Oprah finally read it!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Where do you begin with EAST OF EDEN, for it offers the reader a bounty of pleasures and ideas to contemplate? The beautiful tone of the prose flows along like a gentle breeze, while increasing the intensity of dramatic moments. Steinbeck's characters, as they always do, capture you, but even more so in this magnum opus, in particular Samuel Hamilton, the polymath progenitor from whom Olive and then John Steinbeck descended (the novel contains autobiographical elements), a man you wish you could spend an hour or two with; Lee, the highly educated, very wise, completely unassuming Trask housekeeper and companion, who gives rise to the central, hopeful theme of the novel, summed up in the Hebrew word timshel (thou mayest, Steinbeck's translation in support of the theme of choosing between good and evil); and Cal Trask, self-aware of the potential for evil and good within him, probably the most dimensional character in the vast cast. Steinbeck renders the epic, sequential story arcs of good versus evil, with permutations, on the most personal level of family, in a way we can feel and identify with. Yes, EAST OF EDEN is his greatest novelistic achievement, among the greatest family sagas of any century, and one of the best American novels by any American writer, and the best because, put plainly, it is a pleasure and inspiration to read. If you haven't read it, please do yourself a favor and do so now.You'll also find the novel timeless. After all, don't we all still struggle with good and evil; don't we all yet make choices that lead us down paths we wish we did not find ourselves treading; don't we all yearn to turn our lives around at some point but wonder how to do so? If only we had a Samuel or Lee to nudge and guide us; if only we could grasp our plight and wrestle our nature into obedience as Cal will. Well, at least you'll know you are not alone; you'll know you're just human.As you read the novel, and perhaps critiques of it as well, you'll find the central theme to be that a person has it in his or her power to choose between good and evil. Adam and his son Aron are the symbols, the suffering symbols, of good. Charles, Adam's brother, and Cathy, Adam's wife, are evil, and choose to be such. Cal, who possesses evil tendencies, recognizes his predilection to evil. He strives mightily to choose to be good. But I 'd add that Steinbeck might be also telling us that with each generation we trend more to the good, making the individual struggle more hopeful. You'll see this vividly illustrated in Cal, who appears to have descended from Cathy and Charles.Finally, should you explore information on the novel, you'll discover that readers have pulled many quotes from EAST OF EDEN. It's that kind of novel, a place to find any number of thoughts meaningful to you and your life. This passage, which I haven't seen quoted, struck me the moment I read it. It demonstrates Steinbeck's keen understanding of the American character, a summation well worth keeping in mind today. Lee addresses Cal after a devastating turn in the story (page 568, Penguin Centennial Edition):\\"We all have that heritage, no matter what old land our fathers left. All colors and blends of Americans have somewhat the same tendencies. It's a breed--selected out by accident. And so we're overbrave and overfearful--we're kind and cruel as children. We're overfriendly and at the same time frightened of strangers. We boast and are impressed. We're oversentimental and realistic. We are mundane and materialistic--and do you know of any other nation that acts for ideals? We eat too much. We have no taste, no sense of proportion. We throw our energy about like waste. In the old lands they say of us that we go from barbarism to decadence without an intervening culture. Can it be that our critics have not the key or the language of our culture?\\"Highly recommended as a vital, brilliant masterwork that will never lose it relevancy, as well as for its superb style."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read this book twice and intend to read it again. The first time was when I was 10. It, along with Tobacco Road (Erskine Caldwell) was forbidden me as unfit literature for children (my mother was an avid reader, but she protected my childhood as long as she dared) so naturally, it became my goal to find where she had hidden them, and read both, which I did, having wasted nearly all of one summer looking for them. Finding them buried deep beneath some old clothes in her large Cedar chest, I curled up on the old sofa beneath the sunny kitchen window where the yellow June blooming roses were alive and vocal with the buzzing of bees, eagerly opened the pages and began to read........This book, obviously, parallels the story of Caine and Abel in many mortal ways. It's an incredible tale of betrayal, that I understand had roots in truth, woven around the totally depraved character of one woman, who, though amply endowed with charm, intelligence and ambition, it's but an outward veneer, and she is without the things that make such a person whole - conscience, loyalty, mother love, or any other human emotion that separates us from the primitive - and gets what she wants by using others. Killing someone is not something she worries much about.This woman, taken in by the Trask brothers after being found nearly beaten to death on their doorstep, marries one, beds the other and bears two boys who are by the brother not married to - twins - just before she leaves the good man who thinks he is their father - from her childbed, without a backward look. The story gets better and more incredulous with each passing page. You are given insight into any number of human conditions, characters, motivations, and finally, betrayal of yet another trust between brothers.It's one of Steinbeck's best works. He is a master of the written word - one who can pull you into the story even if you come from a different world than the one you are in as his fascinated reader - and ask you to feel it move you all the way there and back. There are these others by Steinbeck that number among my favorite reads and grace my personal library:\\"Grapes of Wrath\\"\\"Cannery Row\\"\\"The Red Pony\\" which is an unusual story about a young boy and his horse - of a love lost, but with responsibility and maturity painfully gained - book from my youth, but which is much more than a child's story."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Standing in front of monsterous shelves at Border's, staring at my summer reading list with 600 pages of Steinbeck in my hands, I think: \\"My teacher is trying to kill me.\\" That was two years ago.If I could pin down any one reason or instance that transformed me from the proverbial couch potato to avid reader, this epic novel would be it.Steinbeck's East of Eden is absolutely spacktastuler (yes, so good, I just had to fabricate a word for it). The novel, set in the early 20th century, follows the story of the Trask family. A parallel to the biblical story of Cain and Abel, the conflicts between members of the family in two generations serve to explore the nature of good and evil and mankind's tendencies toward each. Steinbeck is able to envoke deep-seeded, universal questions while stunning the reader with a playful subtleness.Perhaps most defined is the developement of character. The reader cannot help but fall in love (or undying disgust)with each of Steinbeck's masterfully crafted personas.The book is long - 600 pages in four parts - but every bit the worth and more. The ending, not to be spoiled, even served to leave a beading tear in the eye of this hopeless \\"tough guy.\\"Truly a masterpiece of modern times."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"How does one write a review about \\"The East of Eden?\\"It is so full of beauty that the words are still absorbinginside of me--Steinbeck is a master storyteller--and this book follows three generations of families and the choices they make in life, how each choice affects the next choice.I adore how Steinbeck will throw universal messages in for the reader--deep directives about religion, racism, and most of all---how the choices we make in life NOW can be our down-fall in the end.\\"East of Eden\\" is perfection--with its language, images, universality, humour, and profound intellegence.I will not go into the characters--because one must read the enire book to get the entire essence--and you will not be the same afterwards. (But I will say \\"The Chinese Servant\\") is used by Steinbeck as a sort of wisdom, guru, conscience. He is superb.\\"East of Eden\\" would not be the book it is without \\"Redemption\\"and wouldn't you know it-- Steinbeck throws that in too!*****This book will live forever***** Perfection."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"In \\"East of Eden,\\" Steinbeck catches the subtlety of life that consistently eludes us. Steinbeck constructs unique and brittle characters out of thread--each with its own particular color--and seamlessly weaves them into a beautiful fabric of experience and life. The exhibits of fear and joy draw the reader in simply because the reader is reading about himself. The character Lee--commenting on Genesis--says that a reader only enjoys a story in as much as they see themselves in it, and the ultimate story is one that everyone experiences as their own. Steinbeck strived to create such a story, and \\"East of Eden\\" is the result.The parallels to Genesis are not as blatant as one would suspect. The 600-page novel breezes by and a majority of it can be spent forgetting its metaphorical nature. Steinbeck masterly navigates the storyline through straits of drama, introspective commentary, philosophy, theology, and simple beauty. Many of the conclusions are figurative and implied, and much of the meaning is in what is not said rather than what is. It is only when Steinbeck has let you forget the story he mimics, that he will quickly remind you, giving you an entire new context to contemplate.The novel is dark at times. Every character is severely flawed, and Steinbeck is relentless in his portrayal of weakness, vulnerability, and sorrow. Yet, every character is dripping with realism and humanity; the result is a depth and beauty to the characters that is rarely experienced. Every character is so real it feels as if you could get up, walk next door, and talk to them as an old acquaintence.The novel imitates the Genesis story in an American setting, but \\"East of Eden\\" is simultaneously a commentary and reinterpretation of the same story. It ignores the plot specifics, morals, and instead grasps the essence, the heart, that makes the myth timeless and applicable to anyone with a beating heart. \\"East of Eden\\" is more than a biblical metaphor, more than good and evil; it's the story of the birth of man: the marriage of good and evil, and their residual struggle within man. Ultimately, it's the celabration of the free will that makes us human, and the simple joy of existence.This is a beautiful peace of literature. The writing is simplistic and a pleasure to read. Steinbeck's narration is well-crafted, and the plot trods along at a lofty and steady pace. Definitely the best piece of fiction I have read in a long, long time."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have to put in my 2 cents for this classic. I can think of only two books which have created a world which has affected my soul as much as the real people in my life. One is Anna Karenina. The other is East of Eden. Steinbeck from the first page casts a spell. It is as if he is really telling his story of his ancestors, the Hamiltons. We are taken back to a post Civil War pastoral world with grassy scents and golden light. The prose is beautifully simple, rich, Mozartian. It is the most economical 700 page book I can think of. The &quot;joy of creation&quot; Steinbeck felt when writing it is evident. That joy makes up for its artistic flaws. I envy the readers who will be reading this novel for the first time. You're in for a treat."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It would be trite to call this the greatest English-language book ever written. That would be too car salesmanish. The back of the book tells you it's about the struggle between two brothers. I feel that's oversimplifying it. It's about the struggle about a group of people from prostitutes to farmers to soldiers to children to geniuses to simpletons to millionaires to hobos. It blends Western and Eastern philosophies and makes you realize that at the core, most beliefs are the same because most people are the same. And infinitely different.But this isn't only a philosophical romp for over 700 pages. The prose is some of the most beautiful I've ever read. A passage about a rabbit getting shot with an arrow moved me so much I read it about 10 times when I first encountered it. The book took a long time to read not because it was difficult, but because I kept going back over and over. The problem I've found with novels this long is the author's seeming inability to finish it gracefully if at all. But here, the final scene couldn't be held together better and be more satisfying.Yes, you do need to get through the first 50-100 pages, but after that, you'll realize it was a labor of love"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a great book to read if you're looking for plot, style, story and structure. John Steinbeck is obviously the best in all three categories. After all, the man did win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962. I was in the navy way back then, and we were right in the middle of the Cuban Missile Crisis, so literature was the farthest thing from my mind. But, after all these years, I've finally gotten around to reading this masterpiece and, I assure you, it is well worth the six hundred pages. Plus, the Penguin book format is so easy to manage.East of Eden is all about a man named Adam Trask who, after being discharged from the army and inheriting a small fortune from his deceased father, settled in rural Salinas Valley, California around the turn of the century. He bought a farm and, over the course of his life he survived a fatal love attraction, a horrid marriage, reared two sons, met some life-long friends and wonderfully colorful characters, and even tried his had at business. For the most part, heartache and sorrow were his rewards. Such is life. But that's just the storyline. To me, this book was more about style than story. The way Steinbeck constructed his story, developed his characters, twisted his plot, and the beautiful descriptions he used made this book a joy to read, as well as an enlightening literary experience. I thought it was great.I recommend East of Eden to anybody who is interested in reading his or her way through the American classics."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Is is possible that Netflix may boost literacy? I just did a Netflix mini-retrospective look at James Dean's films: \\"Rebel Without a Cause,\\" \\"Giant\\" and \\"East of Eden.\\" Watching the complex story of \\"East of Eden,\\" reminded me that I had never read the Steinbeck novel from which the film was adapted. This came as a surprise to me, since I am a huge fan of Steinbeck's writings and have long considered \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" among my favorite novels. So, I embarked on reading the novel. I was expecting it to be good; I was unprepared for the depth of the writing and the brilliant insight into human nature that marked Steinbeck's writing at this stage of his career. In my opinion, if he had never written another novel besides \\"East of Eden,\\" he would have been worthy of the Nobel Prize that he won in 1962.The story is a complex and very moving modern setting of the Cain and Abel story told at multiple levels through several generations of the Trask family. Adam and Charles Trask lay the groundwork for the narrative by vying for the affection of their father, an ersatz Civil War hero who carved out a reputation and a fortune by misrepresenting the role that he played in key battles of the War Between the States. The saga continues into its main section with Adam's two sons - Cal and Aron - struggling to please him. Adam is raising them as a single father - with the not inconsiderable help from Lee, the live-in Chinese cook - after his wife abandoned the family shortly after giving birth to the twins.The most profound musings that stand as the intellectual and spiritual center of the novel are found exactly halfway through the narrative. The setting is that Lee, the Chinese cook, is having a theological discussion with a neighbor, Samuel. The crux of the discussion bears on varying translations of Genesis 4:7, in which God addresses Cain and implores him to overcome the temptation to sin. Lee describes the result of two years' of study by elders in the Chinese community who had undertaken to understand the issue in all of its subtleties:\\"After two years we felt we could approach your sixteen verses of the fourth chapter of Genesis. My old gentlemen felt that these words were very important too - 'Thou shalt not' and 'Do thou.' And this was the gold from our mining: 'Thou mayest.' 'Thou mayest rule over sin.' The old gentlemen smiled and nodded and felt the years were well spent. It brought them out of their Chinese shells, too, and right now they are studying Greek.Samuel said: 'It is a fantastic story. And I've tried to follow and maybe I've missed somewhere. Why is this word so important?'Lee's hand shook as he filled the delicate cups. He drank his down in one gulp. 'Don't you see?' he cried. 'The American Standard translation orders men to triumph over sin, and you can call sin ignorance. The King James translation makes a promise in \\"Thou shalt not.\\" meaning that men will surely triumph over sin. But the Hebrew word, the word timshel -\\"Thou mayest\\" - that gives a choice. It might be the most important word in the world. That says the way is open. That throws it right back on a man. For if \\"Thou mayest\\" it is also true that \\"Thou mayest not.\\"\\"Yes, I see. I do see. But you do not believe this is divine law. Why do you feel its importance?\\"\\"Ah!\\" said Lee. \\"I've wanted to tell you this for a long time. I even anticipated your questions and am well prepared. Any writing which has influenced the thinking and the lives of innumerable people is important. Now, there are many millions in their sects and churches who feel the order 'Do thou,' and throw their weight into obedience. And there are millions more who feel predestination in 'Thou shalt.' Nothing they may do can interfere with what will be. But 'Thou mayest'! Why, that makes a man great, then gives him stature with the gods, for in his weakness and his filth and his murder of his brother he still has the great choice. He can choose his course and fight it through and win.\\" Lee's voice was a chant of triumph.Adam said, \\"Do you believe that, Lee?\\"\\"Yes, I do. Yes, I do. It is easy out of laziness, out of weakness, to throw oneself into the lap of deity, saying, 'I couldn't help it; the way was set.' But think of the glory of the choice! That makes a man a man. A cat has no choice, a bee must make honey. There's no godliness there. And do you know, those old gentlemen who were sliding gently down to death are too interested to die now?\\" (Pages 301-2)Steinbeck's argument reminded me of the exquisite Grand Inquisitor passage in Dostoevsky's magnum opus, \\"The Brothers Karamazov.\\" The Inquisitor confronts a Christ who has returned to earth during the Spanish Inquisition and excoriates him for having condemned mankind to freedom of choice. Both Steinbeck and Dostoevsky are delving into levels that represent the quantum physics of the soul. This is great literature - writing that combines story telling as an art form with profound examination of the human condition.Even in the age of Netflix and Grand Theft Auto IV, there is still room for great writing - and great reading.Enjoy!Al"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"\\"East of Eden\\" is a beautifully written, sprawling, three generation saga of the men and women who settled the Salinas Valley in California. The story begins far away in the East, on the farm of the unscrupulous Cyrus Trask and his two sons, Adam and Charles. Adam is an upright, honest young man who naturally draws people to him, while Charles has an angry, violent spirit.Charles tries in vain to earn the love of his father, and takes his anger at his failure out on Adam. Adam is sent by his father into the army as a sign of his love, but Cyrus keeps Charles close to home, knowing that war would release something dangerous and violent in his other son.Adam wanders for many years across the country after his service, and some of the most lyrical passages in the book describe his life as a tramp, closely mirroring Steinbeck's own experiences during the Depression. Finally he returns to the farm and exists in uneasy partnership with Charles until the mysterious Cathy arrives. The more astute Charles quickly realizes her true nature, but innocent Adam marries her and they move to California.Adam expects Cathy to pursue his dream of life on a ranch, but Cathy is a vicious, evil character with no redeeming qualities, and after the birth of twin sons she escapes only to re-emerge much later when her sons are grown. Adam hibernates for many years on the ranch, broken-hearted over Cathy's desertion, and convinced he must hide the secret from his sons forever, which become an impossible task. Repeating the pattern of their father's life, the twins Aron and Caleb vie for their father's love, with Aron effortlessly winning it while Caleb comes to believe there is something evil lurking in his spirit. But this time around, Caleb is redeemed in a way Charles never was.Steinbeck's prose is masterful, and his descriptions of the Salinas Valley, lush with the rains, brutal with the drought, capture exactly why men were drawn to the west. His portrayals of character and motives--sadly lacking in the movie--are totally convincing, and his Adam is a flawed but admirable character.Steinbeck has been a bit out of favor--at least until this was chosen as an Oprah book. As an English-as-a-second-language teacher I recently taught \\"The Pearl,\\" and that book too surprised me with its gorgeous writing and subtle imagery. (We all read it in high school but I now realize it went right over my head.) Try Steinbeck again--you won't be disappointed--my book club wasn't!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I just finished this novel. And I am totally speechless and in awe of Steinbeck's writing. I am also wondering why I have never read it before! This book would make Shakespeare proud! As most English Lit majors in college would know ~~ that Shakespeare is the world's most acclaimed playwright ~~ he writes about every emotion under the sun known to man and he makes the audience see and feel the stories that is very familiar to mankind. Steinbeck's East of Eden should be regarded in the same category. This may be a drama, but it is a reflection on humankind ~~ men who seeks to find the gold in their dreams and experience everything that is known to mankind. These men, Charles Trask, Adam Trask, Cal Trask, Aron Trask, Samuel Hamilton, Lee have sought happiness at their whim and some succeeded and others didn't. They reacted to whatever life throws their way ~~ either with strength and courage or with cowardice. No man is alike in this book and yet they are. Even the women handled things differently in this book. There is Cathy/Kate, the eternal whore and there is Abra Bacon, the eternal mother-figure.Please don't be discouraged by the long descriptive pages that Steinbeck employed to introduce his characters. They only serve to enrich the novel and make these people come alive between these pages and in your imagination. This is a classic book and it flows easily between the pages. It is also one of the most lyrical writing I have yet to read. Steinbeck's talent is that he makes people come alive and tell their stories of their struggles with guilt, sin and love. It is a book that will touch you immensely and you will not forget these people.It's a definite must-read for any serious reader.9-5-03"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A friend suggested that if I didn't like this book, it was a mark against me, and not the book itself. After reading it, I must concur. I didn't think I'd like a book set around the turn of the last century in the states... don't know why... but this story is truly timeless. It was just swell. The characters are a bit extreme (extremeley good, or bad), and that compromises believability, but I am willing to suspend cynnicism for the rest of the story.

The characters are full of mystery; I doubt I will ever discover everything there is to learn about them, they are among the most intrigueing and complex characters in any Steinbeck novel, or any novel for that matter. This novel looks deeply into the story of Cain and Abel and theology in general, but not in the boring listen-to-what-I-think-of-this manner, it is creative, mischievous, harsh, and true. In addition to being a well-thought-out novel with a captivating, complex plot, it is also an insightful study of human nature and religion."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"What more can I say; this is the type of novel I wich I could read again for the first time to completely take in all it has to offer"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I started reading East of Eden as part of an intention to read modern classics and was overwhelmed by Steinbeck's love of words.

It's interesting that Steinbeck himself is in the novel, and the Hamiltons, his mother's family, takes up half of the book. I wonder what is real and what is not, though everything except the twin's mother seems real. For example Steinbeck's mother's plane ride - was that a made-up story? Or is at least a part of it true?

Maybe it's because they're dense, maybe it's because of all the hype I've heard, but either way it takes a push for me to dive into one.This book required no push at all. I loved it from page one and wondered why I hadn't read it earlier. This novel has so many layers to it that it is fascinating as a once-through read but also allows you to delve deeper into the symbolism on subsequent reads.

I would put this novel up there as one of the first, best - revisionist, anti American novels that inspired so many movies of this genre. Basically, there are no heroes in this novel - the sympathetic characters are poor, honest (Chinese) servants, failed farmers - business and social success comes only through deception. The father of the Cain and Abel sons was a decorated Civil War hero, military experts who lost his leg in something not associated with Civil War battle, yet he promotes himself all the way up to the Secratary of War's office in Washington. Organized religion is mocked, depicted as a fraud - true spiritualism comes from the suffering of regular folks. The female character of Cathy is one of the most negative, destructive characters in American literature - a manipulative whore, prostitute, madam, tries to abort her 9 month old twins and yet she can act and succeed in an American world that is fallen, always fallen as man is failed after Adam and Eve fell out of grace and were kicked out of the garden of Eden.I feel about this great novel the same way I feel about the Revisionist Western movie - High Noon. High Noon isn't a patriotic American movie - as virtually all the characters of this small Western town are depicted as cowards, hypocrites and the whole America they represent is depicted as a lie. Yes, Communists in Hollywood wrote and directed High Noon - John Wayne hated this movie, being a patriotic America, I should also hate High Noon. But I don't - the movie is just to good, great.I give the same grudging respect to East of Eden - think it is Steinbeck's best.High Noon (Collector's Edition)"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The true measure of a great novel is whether one can open it up again after 6 months or 6 years and still find it absorbing. East of Eden is a sprawling tale of good and evil which still has relevance today. A classic of American literature."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"\\"East of Eden\\", although a bit long, is a truely worthwhile read. John Steinbeck paints a magnificent portrait of the Salinas Valley, his hometown, and encompasses The Hamilton family and the Trasks in a unique fashion. Though spanning several generations and jumping around a bit, Mr. Steinbeck composes a compelling epic tale which revolves around the fall of Adam and Eve, and the famous rivalry betwixt Cain and Abel.Steinbeck sections the novel into four parts. The theme of Part I [impulses] leads directly into what man desires most in life [glory], the theme of Part II. The greatest glory man can achieve for himself and for God, is to overcome sin through being gven a choice (which is discussed in reference to the Cain and Abel aspect). The theme of Part III is the choice that God gave to Cain [timshel] which means \\"thou mayest\\"...indicating that although he has sinned, he will overcome in the end. The theme of Part IV ties in all of the prior focuses: Man is likely to fall into sin as a result of the 'rejection cycle'. [Desire to achieve Glory] - [Rejection] - [Anger] - [Crime] - [Guilt]. Steinbeck's characters discuss this idea, and if applied to almost any character in the novel, one is able to see how the cycle works in each life.The Elia Kazan-directed film starring James Dean is very well made, however in correlation to the novel itself, does not do it justice as it only covers Part IV. The fact is that you simply cannot cover the time and experiences of a 600+ page novel in a concise manner. To capture the true essence of Steinbeck's message. Don't be intimidated by the size...once you pick it up, you will find that the intimate relationship you develop with the characters forbids you to lay it down."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I was at first reluctant to read such a long novel. I did not want to read it but my fellow students encouraged me so. However, they gave me no certain reason as to why I should. Naturally, I was driven by the sheer curiosity to read it.Now, having read the novel, I must encourage others to read it. The story unwinds in the Salinas Valley with the Hamiltons living peacefully. The gazing mountains and river valleys depict the scene. On the other hand, there is the Trask family led by Cyrus. Therefore, this novel is an interplay between two separate plots. Samuel Hamilton, an immigrant, leads a busy and honest life. However, Cyrus resorts to dishonesty and earns a gracious amount of money. The main plot revolves around the Trask Family for even the title, East of Eden reflects the generations of the Trasks.Cyrus Trask has two sons by the name of Charles and Adam. It is as if Charles is inherently evil and Adam, good. They draw comparisons to the biblical story of Cain and Abel. Furthermore, Adam bores and names two twin sons in Caleb and Aron with the knowledge of the story of Cain and Abel. Therefore, Caleb suffers as he is forced to be inherently bad. However, Caleb's life changes when Lee, the family mentor, discovers the true meaning of Timshel- \`Thou mayest.' This Hebrew meaning breaks the misconceptions of the past in that people are predetermined to triumph over evil or not. The bitter irony in this is that Caleb actually is blessed by Adam even after a rueful past and chooses to start anew, a new life.I strongly suggest you reading this novel even if you were intimidated by the length of it!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Various people have described East of Eden as a novel about various things and with various themes. The resemblance to the biblical tale of Cain and Abel, enduring conflict between good and evil, and choice of will ... all are mentioned. The book's back cover contributes also: \\"mystery of identity; inexplicability of love; and the murderous consequences of love's absence.\\" Precisely what makes East of Eden such a great book is this proliferation of ideas and themes, which can quickly draw the reader into a profound and enlightened state of mind.However, this depth isn't the only reason for you to buy this book. Though this book could easily be the subject of a college thesis, at the same time it can be read merely for the joy of casual reading. The book includes numerous interesting and colorful characters. The reader meets Lee, the Chinese cook-philosopher whose role changes from that of servant to companion...Adam, Kate's wife (only legally) the sometimes painfully honest farmer around whose life much of the book evolves.However, even the best books can have minor flaws. For one who is less-than-interested in reading, this 602 page novel (minus the introduction, which is worth reading, but not before finishing the book) could turn into a reading marathon. Also, the book is written in a unique alternating format: one chapter will focus on the Trask family, and the next on the Hamiltons. In general, however, this book is a great work of literature and one that should definitely be read by everyone. ..."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is a beautifully written novel by John Steinbeck.Within it,Steinbeck retells the Biblical stories of &quot;the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.&quot;These are told through the dynamic characters and their place in the history of California's Salinas Valley.The personalities of the main characters are played to the extreme.Adam is always extremely good and always wants to do the right thing.His son,Aron,is the same way,good and pure.Cathy,Adam's wife,is the exact opposite and is often portrayed as a monster.Caleb,Cathy and Adam's other son,can't accept it,but he is much like his mother because he always thinks of doing bad things.These main charaters are mostly used as symbols in the retelling of the Biblical stories.The first way these stories are told is throught the relationship of Adam and Charles,his half-brother.Charles is very competitive and always tries to beat Adam out of everything, including their father's love.Their highly competitive relationship is like the one of Cain and Abel.When Cathy comes into Adam's life,he immediatly falls in live with her but Cathy's feeling are not the same.Even though,she still marries him.After the birth of her twin sons,Aron and Caleb,she shoots her husband and then runs away to a whorehouse.This recreated &quot;the fall of Adam and Eve.&quot;The tragic story of Cain and Abel is again retold through the lives of Caleb and Aron.Caleb is never violent with Aron but he can't help doing terrible things tohis brother.All in all,East of Eden is a wonderful book that I recommend to anyone who loves learning about human nature."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have read East of Eden twice. The first time that I read it, I was part of an English course and I was being questioned rather extensively on the contents. Consequently I viewed reading it as something of a forced issue and I did not enjoy it at all. After I moved to California and visited Salinas and Monterey, I became excited about the idea of rereading all Steinbeck's novels and I began with this one. Time and intent has definitely changed this work for me. I was compelled to follow the interactions between the various characters almost as though I were on a drug. The parallel relationships that exist between the two different sets of brothers was, for me, the most profound aspect of this book. I felt at first, that the character of Charles Trask was completely underdeveloped until I realised that in fact, his character was continued through that of his nephew (son) Cal. I was extremely interested in the way that Steinbeck dealt with prejudice and how he chose to make Lee - the character that most of the other characters at first disregard - the most insightful character. I have added this book to my permanent collection and there are passages in it that I will reread again and again."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"So we all know that this book has many parallels to the story of Cain and Abel. What I really liked is that Steinbeck took this seemingly simple story of sibling rivalry, jelousy and murder and applied it to the human condition as a whole. Was Cain evil? Why? How evil do you have to be to be evil? Think evil thoughts, do evil deeds, feel malice in your heart? Ultimately, this story explains the struggles we all have with our dark sides. Some characters recognize their faults and shortcomings and try to overcome them. Other characters accept the bad and either exploit it, learn from it, or learn to live with it. Steinbeck takes these simple ideas/questions and applies them to a variety of characters of different ethnic and social backgrounds. Steinbeck did a wonderful job with character development. There is even good to be found in Cathy, although you have to dig. I would definitely reccomend this novel."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have read all of Steinbeck's books and have taught most of them in my classes. East of Eden is, in my opinion, his best work and possibly one of the best American novels, if not the best, of the 20th century. I highly recommend it to all lovers of great literature."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I first read East of Eden when I was 20, and in the Army in Europe. I found myself in the story, finding similarities in the life of the character James Dean played in the movie to what happened in my life.It seemed the story took all those pages to unfold until the moment that the brother in the Cain and Abel tale was told that in life, it was not about what you should do or not do but that &quot;thou mayest.&quot;Brought up by parents who had picked fruit in the Depression and lived tough times, I pondered on elements of East of Eden for a long time.It simply is a story that reads and needs to be read. It is so insightful. It's brilliance is hard to measure. And it is a classic that stands the tests of time. You could read it at any time."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"How does Steinbeck gain entrance into the souls of people, to view what they are really like? I am a man of forty, and I literally wept at the wonder of this novel. To see that others have the same thoughts, feelings, yearnings as myself even from a half century ago is stunning. I didn't want this book to end because I had become part of the family, and you never want the family to end. It amazes me how Steinbeck can write deeply, but his writing is readable. He really just sucks you into his world, you feel as though you are there around the table, discussing the Hebrew word, looking out the house into the valley, or staring at the house where the &quot;circus&quot; is going on. I enjoy many other authors, but I can't think of any that can draw you into their world as completely as John Steinbeck, and East of Eden, to me, is the apex of his work."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"the first book i read by steinbeck was \\"the grapes of wrath\\" which was quite a feat at the time. while i enjoyed the book i wasn't sure i wan't to read more steinbeck. then i picked up \\"of mice and men\\" and knew i had to read more books by this author who had left me in tears at the end of a mere 150 pages. (by the way, i highly recommend both of those books)when i picked up east of eden i had no idea what i would be beginning, besides a whopping 650 pages. the book started off a little slowly, but was intriguing becuase i live in california and have spent some time in salinas valley. then the story started to pick up, and i was into it. steinbeck put together a web of stories that introduced characters and wove together to from a massive literary net. i found each character to be as alive as my best friend; they were all developed to the fullest. every character spends their time as the main character of the book, and while it sounds confusing it is amazingly effective and paints a rich picture of each person. this makes the whole experience of the general story unique and more detailed than most authors could hope to achieve.my favorite character in this book is lee, the chinese man who started off as a minor and creepy character but devolped into a person i could swear could visit me in the flesh and start an intriguing conversation. i recommend the book just for the experience of getting to know lee.about halfway through there is a hefty discussion about the bible, and for an atheist like myself it was a bit of a turn off at first. but then i saw how steinbeck was using the moral of the story, and not examining the actual fictional or factual (whatever your belief) events of the story of eden.i cannot comprehend how steinbeck turned out this monster of a novel. it is moving, exciting, somethines disturbing, and enriching, and is a feat of the human mind and spirit. i think steinbeck often is underappreciated as agreat american novelist, but after reading \\"east of eden\\" you will never be able to stop raving."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Just a fantastic read. The novel triumphs on many levels. It is a compelling story, epic in scope (multi-generational) with complex 3-dimensional characters you can love, hate, pity and wonder at. It is a history study of the emerging culture of California from it's agricultural beginnings to it's industrial age. And it's a moving portrayal of the human animal, delving deep into what motivates us, what constrains us, what inspires us and answers the question, \\"Does our past, our genes, our parents and our experiences, doom us to a predictable future?\\" And the answer is \\"Timshel\\".

Of all the books I have read, this one has touched me the most. Read it, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"My daughter sent this one to me, appalled that I'd never read it. I send her Evanovich, she sends me Steinbeck. If I were an astute kind of person, that might explain some things. Good thing I'm not astute.I've been putting off writing something about this. I think I'm a little intimidated because it's A Classic.What the heck. The point is just to say if I liked the book and why or why not. Zillions of people have reviewed and analyzed and dissected this book, and there's really no reason for me to do that. Whew.So, on the off chance that I'm not the only cultural illiterate out there, East of Eden is the story of the Salinas Valley of California, and about two families, the Hamiltons and the Trasks.I had a little trouble following the connections between people at first, but it became clear later on. The Hamiltons are Steinbeck's family--in fact, he's in the second part of the story himself as a child, and my guess is they're there to make the story personal, and to contrast with the Trasks and provide a nudge to them once in a while.Mostly, it's the story of two generations of brothers: Charles and Adam Trask, and Caleb and Aron Trask. Adam was his father's favorite, which caused a lot of problems between the brothers. He later marries and his wife gives birth to twins: Caleb and Aron, and the pattern threatens to repeat itself.There's a bit of heavy-handed Cain and Abel imagery there, even down to the names, but the characters are so convincingly realistic that it never interfered with the story, and indeed was only apparent when I put the book down for a while. What I really enjoyed was the struggle between Caleb and Aron, trying not to repeat the pattern, and the realization that everything wasn't exactly as it seemed from the outside or on the surface."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I read East of Eden. I certainly wasn't expecting to be swept away in Steinbeck's eloquent prose or on the edge of my seat, barely able to wait for the ending and yet not really wanting the book to end. At times this was difficult to read--Steinbeck is a master of showing the depravity of humanity--and at other moments you're blown away by his understanding of the good in all of us as well. He shows us that life is about the choices that we make, and not about the blood in us. Genetics have nothing to do with what our life can become, and Steinbeck works this into the novel beautifully. This book grips you and doesn't let you go even after you finish it. It tears away at your pre-conceived notions about life--and takes your breath away with the truth of humanity and what we are capable of--both for good and for evil.Hauntingly, painfully beautiful in places, and just plain painful to read in spots, East of Eden is truly a masterpiece. It's not always easy to read, but even when you're disturbed beyond reason at what is happening, you can't stop reading. It's hypnotizing. Definitely one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck is recognized as a literary genius and he won the nobel prize for literature and rightly so.

After having read Steinbeck's other work, The Pearl, I thought that East of Eden might end up being a long, overly drawn-out description of some vines running along a white wall. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this masterpiece, a great retelling of two classic biblical tales. The characters, if anything else, make this a fantastic read.Like a good 90% or more of Steinbeck works, East of Eden takes place primarily in the Salinas Valley of northern California. It details the lives of the Trask and Hamilton families, particularly of Adam and Charles Trask--the first generation, and Aron and Cal Trask--the second. Between each set of brothers stands the unequal love of a father, a darkness within a man's heart, and the recurring scar which comes to mark those who are \\"darker.\\" From Adam and Charles to Aron and Cal, both sets of brothers face trials in their relationships, between the dichotomy of love and hate. This varying dynamic, polar in its nature, is touching in its realism. The depth of the characters, from their good sides to their bad, their joys and sorrows and triumphs and jealousies, make each pitiable and sympathetic in their own way. Cal, who is somewhat of a protagonist in the second half, strives to find a balance between the good he wants to see in himself and the bad he knows is there. This battle, in his soul, is easily relatable to--a young boy who wants to be loved, doesn't know who he is, and wants to be more.Aside from the male figures, one of the other main characters, Cathy Ames, is considered the Eve of the story. While conventionally seen as a figure of pure evil, the bringer of sin into the world and upon men, I find her the most intriguing--and the most inspiring, of all. While she is depicted to commit evil after evil, senselessly drawing men into their dooms, feeling no remorse whatsoever, there lies the greatest hope in Cathy, who like Cal, seems aligned to the dark side in her nature. But for all of her evil, for every terrible act she makes, the hope of something good within her stirred more hope than any other element of the story. Cal, while inspiring in his struggles, is different from the tragically alone Cathy, whose seeming fall into the darkness draws me in more than anyone else. For her, I truly hoped some light would shed.All in all, I am delighted to have been able to read this novel. Though it was a rather long read, and for academic purposes, it was so enthralling that it drew me in from the get-go. A good two days into it and I was possessed, unable to put it down until I had finished. I would truly have to recommend this novel to anyone who has the time to sit down and plow through 600 pages--it's well worth it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"When it comes to human's struggle against evil, John Steinbeck has it all. Through the coexistence of Cathy and Sam Hamilton, the two main opposite forces in East of Eden, Steinbeck immediately foreshadows that a moral fight would be the essence of the novel. The book centers on two brothers' struggle to please their father, who then favors one and scorns the other by accepting the gift of only one son. Sounds familiar? Yes, it is the famous story of Cain and Abel. (Reading the fourth chapter of the book of Genesis would greatly help in understanding the plot and its foreshadowing.)One might wonder: so why base a book on such story? The answer is straight and simple: it is part of us and we tend to deny it. The story of Cain and Abel is the second story accounted in the Bible after that of the Creation, therefore making it one of the most important, original ones. Although being one of the primitive stories, the account of Cain and Abel holds numerous themes found in quotidian life. The opposing characters of Cain and Abel represent the forces of evil and good, respectively, in human nature. While Abel represents the love and innocence in our nature, Cain represents the jealousy and hatred. Abel, as described in Genesis, is a young, innocent shepherd who offered to God \\"the firstborn of his flock and of their fat,\\" which demonstrates his unfailing love for his Creator (NKJV, Gen. 4.4). Because God chose Abel's gift over Cain's, the latter became jealous of his brother and a feeling of hatred started to foment inside of him, resulting in the tragic death of Abel and the unbearable punishment of Cain.One of the highlights of this novel centers on the discussion of knowledgeable Lee about the meaning of timshel. According to the original Hebrew translation, the word means \\"thou mayest,\\" a translation that illustrates a human being's ability to choose between Good and Evil. In order to make such a decision, one must first know the difference between each choice. The character of Adam evolves from an obscure, ignorant follower of Cathy's evilness and cajolery, to a potent, dependent man, able to overcome his trepidations and Cathy's temptations. Adam succeeds only after realizing Cathy's genuine persona. Adam's evolution parallels Genesis, which says, \\"Then the Lord God said, \`Behold, the man has become like one of Us, to know good and evil'\\" (NKJV, Gen. 3.22).The struggle that Adam faces and finally overcomes is a reflection of humanity's ability to overcome any trepidation that it might face daily. In a sense, it gives hope to the hopeless, happiness to the sad, destination to the adventurer, goal to the living, life to all."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is going to be a book that lasts for centuries. It's one of the most modern, classic novels. John Steinbeck pains my heart with his characters, but I think that's his intention; there's a sprinkling of all his characters inside all of us, and I think that's the beauty of his writing. There are few books I've read where the character is the one talking, not the author.

Every time I reread it, I read it slower and read more parts aloud and let the story decide the pace of its telling. I've most recenty listened to the audiobook, while not perfect, having someone speak aloud at a controlled pace has allowed me to picture each detail more completely. And the more detail I could hold in together, the richer the experience becomes.The number of and the amount of time Steinbeck spends on non-central characters was something I used to find that tiresome at first, having to get to know a new character just when I stopped thinking he was going to put in another one. It was a long time before I reread it, but after that, it became easier to see that Steinbeck wanted to use these characters to more clearly lay down the chain of consequences. I have a feeling that Steinbeck wanted Salinas to be as much a character in the book as the Trasks and the Hamiltons and how, through its citizens coped with the changes from the post civil war era to the early 20th century. Steinbeck grew up in Salinas after all and parts of the story have to do with tracing his lineage and his childhood, and perhaps he wanted the readers to know the town as well as he did (and I by now think it's a perfectly reasonable, respectable decision).Whether or not you dislike the antagonist of the book depends on what you're willing to accept but John does make an explanation for why she does what she does. This can make it harder what to think about her as a person, if at all. The ideas I had about all the characters at the start of the story weren't exactly the same in the end. In fact, by the end, all I could do was just take the info in and suspend my judgement until I don't know when. Perhaps that's the whole point. He writes as if this has happened to someone we know and lost contact with, someone we wouldn't judge because we know them personally. I guess that's how I know that Steinbeck accomplished his mission."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"\\"East of Eden\\" is a magnificent novel with a great story line. The main themes in the story are redemption, inheritance and most important of all, free will. Please read my full review at my blog: mehdijamei . wordpress . com"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's American epic, East of Eden, is a complex analysis of good and evil in society. The book follows two families over three generations (from the end of the Civil War to the beginning of World War I) as their lives intertwine and the characters are faced with a series of tough moral decisions. Reading this book is like being caught in a giant moral dilemma; Steinbeck provides the reader with enough information to form opinions on the morality of the characters in the book. This forces the reader to make tough decisions about who is good and who is evil, while Steinbeck never ceases to shock the reader with the actions of his characters.Steinbeck's novel is held together by the complex and highly developed characters he features as the focus of the book. There are several important characters that can all be defined by a very distinct set of qualities. There is the extremely wise Samuel Hamilton, the intelligent, but naive Adam Trask, and the notoriously evil Cathy Ames. Steinbeck spends a great deal of time developing these characters and the reward is a satisfying representation of America in a period of dishevelment as industrialization and west ward expansion are the focus of society. The plethora of characters created by Steinbeck creates a complex and intricate balance in the novel; the actions of one character will undoubtedly affect all of the characters in either a positive or adverse way. These characters are what truly makes this novel an American classic; Steinbeck's ability to create a memorable cast drive the rest of the story.One of these characters, Cathy Ames, may be the most evil, twisted character ever created in all of American literature. The reader is introduced to Ames as she murders her parents by lighting their house on fire. From this point on, it is clear that Ames is the embodiment of evil in the novel. As Ames becomes ingratiated into the main plot, more evil actions ensue, including the attempted murder of her husband and the murder of a madam in charge of a brothel. These actions occur before Ames becomes truly evil by the end of the novel. Another of the more memorable characters in East of Eden is Lee, the Trask family's loyal Asian servant. Lee is meant to play the stereotypical Asian role in the novel, but Steinbeck attempts to break race barriers by incorporating Lee into the main plot of the novel. Lee is extremely intelligent and very wise. He puts up a facade of a stereotypical Asian servant around ignorant and arrogant Americans. However, around people he trusts, such as Samuel Hamilton and Adam Trask, he reveals his intelligence. Lee is very complex and Steinbeck ensures that he plays an important role in the novel.The novel lacks a clearly defined plot; it follows two families over several generations as they struggle to establish themselves in the Salinas Valley in California. However, the novel does act as an allegory to the Biblical story of Cain and Abel. There are several obvious references to the book of Genesis throughout the novel (East of Eden, Adam Trask, and the twins Caleb and Aaron, meant to represent Cain and Abel), creating an interesting outlet for Steinbeck to analyze religious and social issues prominent in society during this era of American history. There are times when Steinbeck's commentary is somewhat subtle and there are times when his commentary is blatantly obvious as the narrator provides insight into the state of society during this time. However, unlike other fictitious novels that attempt to tackle heavy topics such as religion, Steinbeck is able to provide this commentary without sounding too pretentious; he doesn't claim to know the answers to some of the more controversial issues regarding religion. This adds depth to Steinbeck's already complex and layered novel, contributing to the intricacy of this intelligently written novel.East of Eden, like all of Steinbeck's novels, is full of descriptive passages that are essential in establishing the setting for the novel. The novel also takes place in the Salinas Valley of California, the same place that Steinbeck grew up in as a child. Steinbeck's knowledge of the region enables him to provide deep, descriptive details of the setting for the story. The setting is almost as important as the characters, as the distinct environment of the Salinas Valley shapes their behavior throughout the novel. In fact, the Salinas Valley is a metaphor for the lives of the Hamiltons and the Trasks. The valley appears to be heavenly and fertile, but as one digs into the soil unexpected layers of clay, dirt, and rock are revealed. The Hamiltons and the Trasks also appear to have it all together, but as the reader is familiarized with these characters, it becomes clear that they struggle with a great deal of internal conflict. Steinbeck's emphasis on setting also adds to the complexity of the novel, creating a memorable multilayered epic that has become an American classic.In writing this novel, Steinbeck took on a nearly impossible challenge; he attempted to write a novel that would encompass ideas about morality, religion, and politics, while remaining intelligible to his audience. Steinbeck deserves to be commended for accomplishing this feat. Reading this book should be a requirement for everyone as it successfully touches the reader emotionally, logically, and ethically. The highly complex, but relatable characters will surely find a way to sneak into one's heart and become a conscious reminder of ethical behavior. This novel will truly change lives and this is what has kept it moderately relevant in today's society. Reading this novel will not disappoint."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"New book arrived with markedly creased front cover. Less than perfect. When advertized as brand new, I am one to expect that the item will really appear as brand new. My \\"new\\" book did not."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It's a big, masterful book written in commanding prose and it overflows with big issues. The big psychological and moral ones as they occurred to me were: 1.) Acceptance and rejection by God and father, 2) nature-versus-nurture and \\"Timshel,\\" and 3.) the contrast of the self-imposed suffering from living a lie (Trask) versus the natural suffering experienced by an open and loving family (Hamilton). These are good big themes; everybody suffers about in equal measure and the West is opened. To explore the established major themes in East of Eden, you can borrow your kid's Cliffs Notes and see charts of the parallels to the Bible.Keep in mind that this was written in the era when the relatively new concept of \\"psychology\\" was emerging into the American consciousness. Before this time we just worked and, if the mule didn't go lame, we ate- all angst was real and there wasn't the luxury of pondering psychology.The real meat and potatoes of this huge 20-year story lie in the expertly crafted telling of daily life at the opening of The American Century. The dramatic unraveling of the Trasks and the decent but painful lives of the Hamiltons are deeply driven by the yielding of the fathers' horse-and-buggy era values to the relentless societal pressures at the onset of the 20th century. Steinbeck creates a beautifully detailed log of the period, a movie for the mind shown in the sharpest contrast and brilliant color. The delightful character of Lee, the Trasks' Chinese-American servant, forms a perfect fulcrum. Through his enduring wit and insight as an outsider we see the Trasks in perspective, not just a family in crisis but as symbols of the crash of the polite balance of the 19th century as World War I looms and global thinking arises. I can think of no other character that better fulfills this role except perhaps Tyrone Slothrop in Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow. Both of these great novels tell of a transformation in American values in a period of rapid change (relative to their era). Both are the masterworks of their respective times and authors.It seems clear at the end of the tale that Caleb Trask sets forth from his troubled Eden with the beautiful Abra, after shattering his brother and father's dream world resulting in their destruction. This escape troubles me and is made only a little more tolerable through the allusion to the Biblical story of Cain and Abel. Cal is left to deal with his evil side and bear the burden of his sins as was Cain. He hasn't departed his father's home with any clear moral lesson, so where is the mark on this latter-day Cain that he should receive from his father that will protect him from the \\"curse that is too strong?\\" The film is killer; Elia Kazan nailed it casting James Dean as Cal, masters of unresolved tensions but he rather blurred the ending."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Our book club loved this book. A true masterpiece with great characters and fantastic writing by one of America's best authors"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is one of those books that most people want to read once before they die. It will not disappoint.The book is sweeping and not interested in following the conventions of most novels. I for one am very glad to have gotten to know the Trask and Hamiltons."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden beautifully captures several generations of America and it migration west. A little long-winded at times, though, I can't help but feel that Steinbeck got carried away because he didn't know where exactly he was headed, leaving us with a bit of a flat ending. Nonetheless, a great read -- although lacking in the poetic brevity ofThe Grapes of Wrath (Penguin Classics)"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I reread this book and realized that it is one of my all time favorites. His use of the language, characters and crises brings together the most powerful personalities and emotions described as only Steinbeck could do it. Treat yourself to a revisit and you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I first read this book 38 years ago and the characters in this book remain as vivid as the California landscape that Steinbeck masterfully details. Who can forget Cathy's innocent-faced evil, Adam Trask's flawed goodness, Lee's dual identity as undeucated coolie in public and intellectual in private, Cal's pain at being rejected by his father, Kate's murderous duplicity or Samuel's strength in friendship? The dry foothills of California's Salinas Valley, the rough side of Salinas (the town where Steinbeck grew up), Monterey, even San Francisco's Chinatown are lovingly detailed in this portrait of the California of Steinbeck's early years. Members of the Steinbeck family including John make cameo appearances in the book, although a reader would need to have that fact pointed out. Curiously Steinbeck allows no motivation for Cathy's (Kate's) evil- she appears to be simply bad seed, whereas Caleb's greatest sins are seen as understandable reaction to Adam's failings as a father. But is Caleb doomed to evil? As Adam says on his dathbed, \\"Timshel\\", \\"Thou mayest\\" triumph over evil."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The length of the book is long, but I didn't mind AT ALL. When I finished reading it, I hadn't wanted it to end. I wanted to keep along with the Trasks, and the Hamiltons. I wanted to see what became of Caleb and Abra and Lee. The Characters were great, and did not want to leave them. This book has some of the most dynamic characters. Each character had a very important part in the book. I believe that character and symbolism were the most dominant elements to this book. Steinbeck's imagination created a group of great 3-dimensional characters that you didn't want to leave. I liked diging down into the characters, and analyzing their symbolism... Sam Hamilton got me the most by far... and Cathy. The surprises kept me reading, and there were times when I couldn't put it down. Great Great book"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a very good book, but not my favorite from Steinbeck. (Unfortunately any book by John Steinbeck automatically gets compared to other books by......John Steinbeck. That's pretty tough competition.)The main drawback for me was the characters - they weren't as &quot;real&quot; as others he's created. In the &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot;, for instance, I could easily imagine any of the characters as actual people I could meet (if I lived in the 30's). I didn't feel that way about anyone in this book. I realize he made everyone more extreme to help show the contrast of good vs evil, but a 5-star novel should be able to make a strong point about human nature without resorting to characters that are often more symbolic than real.Having said that, this is still a wonderful book to read. One aspect I loved (that I haven't seen mentioned in other reviews) is how Steinbeck wove the story of a region &quot;growing up&quot; with the stories of his characters. Too often, the history of an area talks in great detail about how it was first discovered and settled - and then jumps all the way to the present. But sometimes the most interesting stories are how an area got to the present - How did all the land get taken? How did people react to the first cars? What were the early cities like? This book has all those little tidbits and more - telling us how the Salinas Valley grew up.And, like so many other reviewers, I found the philisophical journeys amazing. The story of &quot;timshel&quot; (&quot;thou mayest&quot;, versus &quot;thou shalt&quot; or &quot;do thou&quot;) was great, and chapter 34 distilled good versus evil down to its essence - I got chills reading it. Another reviewer called Steinbeck a genius, and I agree. Still, I don't think East of Eden compares to some of his other greater works."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I am amazed by critics here ripping apart Steinbeck's writing ability. my only previous exposure was &quot;The Pearl&quot; and &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; in high school years ago. I read this book on a friend's recommendation and was moved by Steinbeck's powerful use of language. The Chinese cook Lee and his commentary on the Cain and Abel story helped me understand the importance of man's free will in ways I never had before. What more can we ask of great literature beyond a new understanding?"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It was a great read, perfect for vacation"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Reading this book is not like reading a book; it is like living several lives at once. It is like listening to a beautiful piece of music and feeling your soul awaken so that tears of joy fill your eyes. East of Eden is long, detailed, and very slow. Don't try to read it all at once. Savor it as you would life itself. Pray that it never ends even though you know it will. It is a shame that this book never got the acclaim it deserves. The conversations between Lee, Adam, and Samuel are so amazing and full of truth. I am constantly fascinated by John Steinbeck's innate knowledge of people. It was his greatest gift and he used it as well as anyone could."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I first read this book when I was in junior high.Soon afterwards we took a family vacation toNorthern California, where we visited John Steinbeck'shouse. As I stood in the foyer of his home, my thoughtswere, approximately: &quot;OH MY GOD. JOHN STEINBECK STOODHERE. EAST OF EDEN. RIGHT HERE.&quot; In high school, afriend of mine become so absorbed in the tale that she readit as she walked home from school. Uphill.This novel is full of passion, ecstacy and heartache.It follows three generations of one family in theSalinas Valley, modernizing the Biblical tale ofCain and Abel. The prose is beautiful and unusuallydescriptive, even for Steinbeck. Read it and laugh,smile and weep."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Evaluation: I first heard about this book from Oprah's book club. It made me interested in the book because of the high praise she was giving it, which persuaded me to read it. The beginning of the book starts off talking about several different families, jumping from one family to the next in each chapter. It made it a little difficult to tell what was going on and where the heck the story was leading. After I got an understanding of where the book was going, I wasn't able to put the book down because I wanted to see what was going to happen next. The book is very versatile, having action, laughs, drama, and that always exciting anticipation. It's a book unlike one that I have ever read. It doesn't focus on one idea in which the book revolves. The book is told through generations, giving the novel many ideas to revolve around, keeping the reader interested at all times in the book. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I feel almost guilty for not liking this book more.I was excited to read East of Eden. I think it is fabulous that Oprah decided to reinstate her book club with a focus on the classics. In addition, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" and \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" were highpoints in my junior and high school English classes. Even the themes, Cain versus Abel, good versus evil, destiny versus free will, seemed so potentially powerful, juicy and deep.Yet I found myself only mildly immersed in the novel. The symbolism seemed overdone, the dialogue unnatural, the character development lacking. A very masculine read, most of the female characters, with the exception of Abra, were either extremely unlikable or underdeveloped. If Cathy's role as the evil temptress is a nod to Eve in the Bible, it seemed a bit extreme.To be honest, the story does weave the themes throughout the story in an interesting way. Steinbeck's descriptive narrative can be beautiful, but can also be a bit long winded. Sam Hamilton, the wise, bumbling lover of words and dreams, and Lee, the Trask family servant and subtle family advisor, were interesting characters.At times, I felt that Steinbeck was looking for opportunities to brag about his ancestry and these side bars were not always of much value in the long saga.In a nutshell, I felt reading this book was an accomplishment, one that brought relief when it was over."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I love John Steinbeck and have never know another author I've enjoyed so much. He gets a little carried away at times with descriptions of his homeland, but this is by far the greatest novel ever written. If you truely want a review of this book just start by reading the dedication. I believe he says it all there."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck showed me once again his amazing storytelling abilities in East of Eden. The character of Lee is one of the greatest characters in an American novel, but, unfortunately, the rest of Eden's characters are rather 2-dimensional. Although the lessons directed towards the reader are important, Steinbeck went a little bit too heavy on the analogies. It had some flaws, but Steinbeck's storytelling is able to pull it up."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I love Steinbeck and was excited to read this novel. Well, it wasn't his best. It is a very long book and I think there were less insights in the 600+ pages than in the 90 pages of &quot;The Pearl.&quot; The major insight can be summed up as &quot;timshel&quot; meaning thou mayest. Mostly, the novel is about the Trask family... two brother, hmm, Caleb and Arron (?) anyway, Cain and Able. It's also a history of sorts of the Steinbeck family. One part I didn't like was the extreme sexism. Both in lack of female characters but also in the main female character (Kathy) being a cold-blooded... Sure, some women are mean..., but there are sweeping generalities about all women being teases, cold, etc etc. The parts about the Chinese man (Lee) are very good. Overall, I like other Steinbecks better... try Grapes of Wrath, Of Mice and Men, The Wayward Bus, or Cannery Row. Just my opinion."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely.

At the part where Adam Trask goes to his wife's whorehouse to finally face her, and comes out triumphant, I had to stop reading and let out a shout of victory.

Though I'm not a Christian, this story touches me for weeks... and I truly enjoy reading every page."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A Christian Critiqueon John Steinbeck's East of EdenEditorial #28 by Joseph Yosuk LeeJohn Steinbeck has an interesting view that man is more loving than God Himself. Despite Steinbeck's incorrect view of God, East of Eden is actually based on the book of Genesis from the Bible. The Bible says that God is just and hates sin, but He also values our obedience. This is why Abel obeyed God by offering an appropriate sacrifice. On the other hand, Cain disobeyed God by offering a sacrifice tainted by his depravity, and by murdering his brother Abel. Cain was jealous of God's blessings to Abel, and he was hurt when God rejected him. Steinbeck believes that it seems unfair from his perspective that God blessed Abel for his obedience and rejected Cain for his disobedience.In East of Eden, John Steinbeck portrays Adam Trask as a type of God and Cal and Aron (Adam Trask's sons) as a type of Cain and Abel, respectively. Adam Trask acknowledged Aron, the character representing Abel, because Aron obeyed his father by going to Stanford even though Aron wanted to drop out of college. Later, Cal, the jealous brother, indirectly murdered Aron although Aron was actually killed in World War I. Adam Trask forgave Cal, while God did not forgive Cain. For this reason, John Steinbeck believes that God is far less loving than man.John Steinbeck failed to see that Cain had no remorse for his sin against his brother, while Cal did. Cain never asked God to forgive him, while Cal asked his father to forgive him. Last of all, John Steinbeck failed to see that Adam Trask was a finite and sinful man. Adam Trask did not possess the infinite and eternal characteristics of our holy God. Even if Adam Trask were a perfect and sinless angel from heaven, Adam Trask did not have the infinite power to pay the penalty for Cal's sin. Only Jesus Christ can do that"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This hard cover edition is an excellent collector's piece.

I love, inhale and am treasuring every page. Has stirrings of Wallace Stegner's Angle of Repose."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I always wait at least a week to write about a book that I finish. This window of time provides the necessary distance that a mind and imagination need to realize that a world no longer exists. That world and every small detail of it lasted 600 pages, but no more and no longer. I take this time to reassess reality and draw that arbitrary line between what is real and what is fantasy. The best fiction transports you and may even take a person longer to come back to center.Critics consider East of Eden one of Steinbeck's most ambitious novels. Admittedly, when I first picked it up, this critic called Steinbeck a little pretentious for scribing the 600 pages set before me. I stand corrected. I have yet to read a novel that was so closely connected to the psychology of humanity and aware of good and evil in such a deep and comprehensive way. This was not revealed through the storyline that was forced onto the characters, but through the descriptions of the characters and their careful dialogue.I was most fascinated by two characters in this novel: Catherine and Cal. Catherine, also went by Cathy or Kate in parts of the novel. Catherine was evil incarnate. As her name changed and she established a new identity, her evil changed shape as well. Catherine's soulless demeanor is best described by the narrator, \\"Her self was an island\\" (157). While some critics consider her the most fascinating Steinbeck character, I find Cal far more complex. Cal thinks he is evil; he struggles with his desires and believes he has no good in him. He discovers he is the offspring of a despicable woman and finds confirmation in what he's always known by instinct: he's got bad blood. What I find most fascinating is the way he hurts his brother, Aron. He hurts his brother by telling him the truth. I champion honesty in all circumstances and find this quality in a person or a character to be one of the highest possible virtues. This is not what is considered valuable to the Trask family nor the author. After the truth is revealed, death follows on multiple fronts. The cause and effect of the plot suggests that physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual deaths are a consequence of truth. This is deeply unsettling insight into a culture that is more concerned with the appearance of good than the reality of evil."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck is one of the greatest American novelists of the past century. All of his work is outstanding and East of Eden is a remarkable example. The characters are larger than life so that they stand out against the human condition. Samuel Hamilton is the essence of goodness, Cathy Trask is evil personified, even to the mark of Cain on her forehead. The book covers three generations in the lives of two families in the Salinis Valley of California. The first part deals with Samuel, then the plot shifts to Adam and Cathy Trask and finally to their two sons. As the title indicates a biblical theme runs through the book. The Chinese servant Lee, uses the word \\"Timshel\\" meaning \\"thou mayest\\" to indicate that man has free will to do good or evil. The characters struggle with good and evil for some 600 pages. Finally, the end comes but it is really not an ending, just a continuation. I rarely give five stars to a book, but East of Eden deserves it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"So why should anyone bother posting, or on the other end reading, a review of a novel that has already been established as a classic and also already been reviewed to oblivion. My late arrival to the reading game is no real excuse. Neither is my reluctance to read Steinbeck for so long due to the submission I have allowed on my part to the passing opinions of holiday readers that Steinbeck is simply a dry read. When I turned twenty four, I went on a reading tear of four hundred and fifty books in five years in what I see now as a subconscious attempt to recover an early stage of Proustian academic and social development after not having cracked open one book prior to that time. During that stretch, I had never had the desire to read anything written by Steinbeck. This changed toward the end of the last school year when I saw a copy of East of Eden by John Steinbeck on a student's desk. As a high school English teacher, I find elation in inspiring students to read books beyond what is assigned in the classroom. Last year, I found a new book on the desk of one of my students every week. When I asked for what reason she is reading all these books, she responded by saying that she wanted to break my record. I grabbed the copy of East of Eden from her desk and asked if the reading wasn't too dry and slow. Her reply was simply that \\"The writing is so beautiful.\\" To see a high school student in a regular English class read on his or her own is a welcomed surprise; to hear the student say that such writing is beautiful warrants investigation.Once breaking open the cover of the novel, I discovered that all of my previous prejudices about the author's writing content and style were grossly misappropriated. I had committed the worst sin anyone hoping to become a scholar could commit through judgment based on the opinions of others without ever having read or understood a single word in the novel. The best way I could describe my experience with the novel is this. While reading East of Eden, my friend would tell me \\"the best part is coming up.\\" For me, the best part was the very first page of the novel. Then, the best part was page two so on and so forth until I finished the novel.The only flaw I could see in the novel is that the description of how Lee is presented seemed pointless and a little racist. Otherwise, the novel was an absolutely perfect one in my mind. Steinbeck is able to burrow into the soul of the major characters in the novel of which there are many. I found myself rooting for characters only to swiftly turning against them and vice-versa. Small characters become big and people who I thought were going to have a big impact never undergo any real change. To say that a book is engrossing is a fine compliment, but to have the heart broken and the spirit inspired multiple times throughout the novel is rare. After having read this book, I felt like I had lived. The characters became the types of friends one considers part of one's extended family.If you ask a common acquaintance in scholarship or academic environment, very few would raise an eyebrow over the enthusiasm over this novel. East of Eden's absence is in the desired book lists of the every-reader. The most common opinion I hear about the books that people read are what is new and what is different. For this reason and perhaps also the apprehension of being bored to death by something that is out of date, these classics are avoided. I like the new and the different as much as the next person, but I also like what is good. Steinbeck not only brings life to his characters by being able to draw the reader into participating in the events and decisions of the characters' lives, but he is also a master craftsman of language. If the reader cannot find himself or herself lost in the lives, thoughts, and actions of the characters, he can find a paradise in the beauty of the descriptive language, the precise word choice, and the fine weaving of the well crafted sentence."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"simply one of the best books i have ever read.

The characters are so life-like and you are sure to be able to relate with them, and even know people like them (especially Cathy). Please read this classic, if you do you the characters will become old friends (and enemies) of yours and it will seem as if you are part of their family."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I decided to read it because it was 1. a classic, and 2. on Oprah's book club list. This has been the nicest thing Oprah has ever done for me. Hands down the best book I have ever loved. I have re-read it many times over, and the emotions stirred each time are just as powerful as the first time. HIGHLY recommend."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"When it comes to deep and inspirational, John Steinbeck has competitors beat. His motivational piece East of Eden is thought provoking and very rousing. Exceptional in both its meaning, purpose, and its writing, East of Eden should be on everyone's reading list.Basing his story on the biblical story of Cain and Abel, John Steinbeck provides a deep, insightful view into the argument of fate versus free will. With many insights, Steinbeck introduces a notion that motivates people to take control of their fate. This novel showed me that we are not restrained or confined to the limits our predecessors have left behind. People are in control of their own lives and can choose to change and become successful. Steinbeck's theme is broad, but works for many aspects in life. This book is essentially John Steinbeck's view on human society. Each character in the story represents some facet of humanity. Whether it be good and evil, or jealousy and love, Steinbeck provides an interesting plot to surmise the interactions and battles of these varying characteristics.With heavy influences from the bible, one drawback is that the reader should be very familiar with biblical stories; otherwise many themes can be overlooked. By just looking at the title, East of Eden is a sort of epilogue of Genesis. East of Eden's themes and storyline can be confusing if not even understandable if the reader has no information background on the bible. I highly recommend reading or at like skimming the bible before reading this book.His writing is entertaining, not hard to read or understand. The plot has its share of twists and turns, making this story not too boring. Diction is not elevated so there is no worry in misunderstanding the text. Overall, this is a great book that can teach important life lessons. Highly motivational and a great read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's East of Eden is truly a work of art, blending history and Biblical allusions into a masterpiece. The story is set in Salinas Valley, California, and follows the journey of the Trasks and the Hamiltons, two families whose fates intermingle in a beautiful and devastating relationship. The characters each find his or her own path in life and inevitably meet one another, impacting each character's life in the most profound and unique way. Throughout the novel, Steinbeck touches on powerful themes, including fate versus freewill and the search for one's true identity as well as the complications and consequences of both requited and unrequited love.The novel is separated into three sections, each an interesting story that reveals a part of the characters' lives. The stories overlap, as characters grow older or pass away between sections. Relationships are renewed, broken, or newly established. As the plot progresses, the characters become involved in more than one story, creating a complicated yet beautifully woven story.Each character on his or her own contributes part of his or her life to the ever-growing plot. From the secretive Cal and the lovable Aron to the murderous and vengeful Cathy, each character presents a different personality, either fitting or contrasting with other characters. The reader can sympathize with Cal, who is jealous of his good-natured brother Aron and wishes to be accepted as much as his sibling. The reader can relate to the boys' experiences, innocent young children who grow up and commit sins and lose their childish naivet&eacute;. Referring to the story of Cain and Abel, Steinbeck elevates the story of these two brothers to Biblical proportions, setting the foundation of behavior and emotions that every person goes through. The effect of Steinbeck's allusions is that the reader applies the story to his or her own life, making chilling discoveries on how similar people are, no matter the difference in character. The relationships between these unique individuals of the novel have such a powerful impact on their lives that the reader is forced to stop and wonder at the ways people are affected and altered, regardless of the size of the change.Steinbeck's masterpiece reveals to the reader the way people touch each other's lives and the impact of these changes through the intricate relationships between his characters. East of Eden is at once both powerful and mesmerizing, a literary journey that captures the audience's heart and leaves the reader deep in thought long after completing the book. East of Eden is highly recommended, not only as a beautiful work of art to cherish but also as a guide to self-discovery."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is an epic, powerful book of hope, despair, suffering and permission for humanity to fulfill it's potential. This may sound dramatic but East of Eden is one of the most thoughtful books I have ever read. The level of depth that is so subtly put into the book has a profound impact on the reader: the idiosyncraties of life, which we so often take for being individual to ourselves are really vividly shown to be universal. The book isn't so much a novel but a treatise on human nature and a philosophy for life. This is a big claim so I'll try and justify it. But really, this is a book that needs to be experienced rather than read so any review is only a shallow representation.It takes a novelist of Steinbeck's skill to pull the deep philosophising off in a non-condensending or patronising manner. Yet, he handles the book beautifully, the philosophy comes from two very strong and intriging characters, Samuel and Lee, both outsiders beloved by those close to them who are able to advise the other characters and, by proxy, the reader too. Through these characters' strong voices, the other actors are guided through their lives, the stregth of hope that they give out is the difference between life and death for some characters. The ideas of the book are obvious when read but stay with the reader and offer a simple approach to a lives beset by complications - put simply, you may do what you want in life, you learn for yourself and although help and strength may be offered by other people, ultimately you are responsible for your own life. And for whether you are satisfied when death takes you.The book is strong in many areas, such as the depth of knowledge gained about American history and the American psyche, the deep love shown to its people and the strong, interesting characters, shown extra love in their crafting because many are based on Steinbeck's own family. However the level of detail in the book slows down the narrative tremendously: this isn't a novel that can be rushed through without missing the crux of the book; the contemplative tone means that it will always be a slow read. The plot is also quite simplistic and easily predictable. It could be reduced to a few lines but in doing so the fine details and love that is so apparent in the book would be lost. The plot is secondary to the environment, characters and, above all, to the ideas of the book.If this type of book sounds intriging to you, please buy or borrow it quickly, as it will be a book that you won't forget for a long time and offers the reader a lot. Despite the heaviness of the topics and some of the vindictiveness shown by some characters, the book leaves the reader in hope rather than despair by the end. Even if it doesn't sound appealing and the size of the book puts you off you should try this book. It is a rare masterpiece and one which will be as relevant in 100 years as it is now with much wisdom on offer to any reader, regardless of their world experiences."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The main thing that makes Steinbeck great to read is that he's actually wise, he has genuine insights to impart to his readers. In this book, he often \\"tells\\" instead of \\"shows,\\" which is supposed to be bad writing technique, but it works for Steinbeck because what he has to tell is so interesting and thought provoking, and because he tells it so well. His characters are beautifully and lovingly sculpted, even his \\"monster\\".Before I read it, I had reservations. I was worried it would be too long. This was not a problem, because Steinbeck's writing is so good, and I was sucked in quite early in the book. I've read much shorter books which were much more laborious to read.I was also worried it would be too dreary--after all, a \\"modern re-telling of Cain and Abel\\" is clearly going to be tragic. I had also heard that the book is humorless. And, it is true, a lot of his other work displays a lightness of touch, a subtle sense of humor, even when dealing with big, harrowing stories. (After all, there were even passages in the \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" that made me laugh out loud.) This book mostly lacks that light touch. What he does still display here is a humane-ness, he seems to me to be non-judgemental in his treatment of most of his characters, even as he shows them being \\"sneaky\\" or \\"mean\\". And I suppose that may be the thing I liked best about the book, the humane way he treats his characters, while putting them through the choreography of a compelling, moving story. This is not one of those epics about which you say to yourself, \\"Wow, I'm so proud that I was able to slog through that enormous, diffficult thing.\\" Even though it's not a pretty story, this is a big, easy read, with all the \\"epic\\" characteristics the other reviewers talk about. Good stuff."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book describes suffering fleshed out. This book tears apart the meaning of humanity, and leaves the meaning of the world to rest on individual shoulders of toliling men and women. This book slaps you in the face and ignores social behaviors that say, \\"privacy, please!\\" This book is, very possibly, THE BEST.Only in darkness does mankind duel with their bare toughness. Only in darkness does manking face reality - one that says, \\"who is with you? Look into heaven! Who do you see there?\\" The soul squirms. \\"Tell me the truth!!!\\" screeches nothingness, and suddenly man looks into the blank twinking of the heavens, and sees NOTHING.Light depends on love. The love of God allowed man to be able to come back to \\"live with him\\" happily for all eternity. We are to sacrifice ourselves to him; no questions asked. He loves us - why should we not love him? The weight of pleasant, painless joy depends on existence of something compassionate in heaven. But, strip it all away. Feel the blows of the cautious parental hand, the constraints of truth, the pressures of life. Feel the pains in happiness, the perverseness in striving for perfection. Look at the dark side to find a truth that will kill you, for in blackness there is no such thing as heaven or hell. The blackness will not lie.This is what East of Eden is all about: satisfaction.Interesting pieces from the book:\\"You are one of the rare people who can separate your observation from your preconception.

I am usually a slower reader, but completed the 600 pages in less than a week. Steinbeck's prose is enchanting. The characters, particularly Sam Hamilton and Lee are entirely believable.The message of \\"thou mayest\\" is timeless and profound. For Steinbeck to find this essential truth buried in one of the oldest and most commonly known stories in the western world is remarkable. Steinbeck's insight that is so valuable because it names an essential mindset that provides enormous leverage in the battle to find your voice. You will be better off for reading this book.I aspire to teach this novel in class someday."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I had this book sitting on my shelf for a year before I finally could give the book the attention that it deserved. Once I started, I became engrossed. When I finished, I finished in a flurry, devouring the last 400 pages in about four days.The themes are universal. The storylines are familiar to most Westerners. The story unfolds patiently and deliberately. The characters are mostly set in opposition (traitwise) of each other for purposes of showing contrasting approaches to life.I did find a dry humor occasionally in the book. I did find the book to be universal not only in human conflict but also its timeless in its observations, especially about how the 'now' different from the 'good old days' or in its comments of how generalists have little future.I did enjoy some subtleties in the writing at times. For instance when writing Joe's (a minor character who worked for Kate), Steinbeck used very simple words and short sentences to illustrate the unsophisticated nature of the thoughts. This made the sentences read quickly and served to highlight how shallow the internal monologue really was. After all, if deep thoughts require complex sentences and expert word usage, how does one convey simple thoughts?This is one of the best novels that I have read, perhaps the best (not necessarily my favorite) novel that I have read from an American author."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is the colorful three-generation saga of an American family (the Trasks) embroiled in their emotional, ever-so-human contest with the moral forces of good and evil. Set in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the story follows Cyrus Trask, his sons Adam and Charles, and Adam's sons Aron and Caleb, through their eventful, changing, sometimes violent lives, sweeping from a farm in Connecticut to Steinbeck's home in the Salinas Valley of California. As the novel unfolds, we meet personifications of \\"good\\" in the character of Samuel Hamilton, Adam's kind-hearted neighbor whose nine children help fill out the story, and \\"evil\\" as represented particularly by Kate, Adam's malicious wife who fittingly comes to run a local whorehouse.Steinbeck provides us with what is presumably his own interpretation of the Bible's Cain and Abel story through the guiding, balanced commentary of an unexpectedly erudite Mr. Lee, Adam's American-born Chinese servant. In the Bible, Cain, angered by God's rejection, kills his brother, Abel, and suffers lifelong guilt from his misplaced revenge. For Steinbeck, man (we are all Cain's descendants) is neither predestined (thou shalt) nor commanded (do thou) to rise above sin; rather, the individual has freedom of choice (thou mayest). Importantly, through individual choice, each person is free to direct his own life to attain true glory and the triumph of the human spirit. Ultimately, when a person dies, he is judged not by his wealth, influence and power, but by the answer to a simple question: Was he good or evil, loved or hated?In my opinion, the noticeable flaw in this otherwise exceptional work is Steinbeck's deliberate placement of his characters into a Cain and Abel framework, with Charles and Caleb being troubled Cain, and Adam and Aron the fairer Abel. The book reads as if Steinbeck first decided on the philosophical theme for the work and then applied his adroit literary hand to build interesting, absorbing characters to fit the mold. I believe that the novel could have become an even grander work of literature if Steinbeck had more naturally allowed his striking talent for rich character development to enjoy a still larger role, while relegating the Cain and Abel theme to a more subtle, purely motivational position."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is easily one of Steinbeck's best novels (and that's saying something considering how many great books he's wrote). The novel itself is an allegory following the Biblical accounts about the fall of man in the garden of Eden and Cain and Abel set in rural California. Although the book is quite long, its a fast and easy read. The only problem I had with the book is that Steinbeck, at times, tends to make the themes (free will vs. destiny) and the allegory a bit overly-obvious. But this is a minor point and its a great book (Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize shortly after this novel). I would highly recommend it and am glad that Oprah has brought this book out of the required reading lists for high school english and back into the public eye."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have become dismayed at the popular books out today. The writing is predictable, shallow, and not very challenging. I've decided to go back to the classics and East of Eden was first on my list, thanks to Oprah. I found Steinbeck's writing style intriguing....specifically how he uses time/action lapses where everything isn't spelled out in black and white....you have to think, recall, use your imagination to fill in the gaps. I do have a question for someone: What was the significance of the word Timshel? I remember it mentioned in the story but haven't been able to locate it to refresh my memory. Could you help me out?"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Hold on if it is boring at first. It's an old book and just like an old car takes a while to get started. Once into the book the lives of the individuals becomes quite comforting and enjoyable"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Spectacularly developed characters to go with the gorgeous writing one expects. The story is one that takes place from the nineteenth century until the late nineteen teen years. It evolves from a family in the east, the Trasks, a girl from near them, and the families, primarily the Hamiltons, who develop the Salinas Valley in California. The characters vary from some impeccably honest and good souls to perhaps the most evil character this reader has ever encountered. She's introduced in chapter 8, which ranks high on the list of creepiest things I've ever read. The counterparts are terrific, for this reader Sam Hamilton's life and outlook and the wisdom, loyalty, patience, and goodness of Chinese man Lee, who begins in the story as a servant in the family that descends from the Trasks mentioned above. Almost all the characters lean to one side or the other of the good/evil line, with some having very human elements of both, and with nearly all having internal demons they address by either choice or necessity. In a way, ahead of his time, Steinbeck raises some interesting nature/nurture musings in his reader. A fine, fine read, particularly if you enjoy novels of families over time. This was my fourth Steinbeck, and I hugely look forward to more. It's great."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Upon reaching the age of 50, it occurred to me that there were vast gaps in my reading history; renowned works of literature that I had somehow avoided during my high school, college and post graduate academic careers and then in the long period of largely pleasure reading since. Such authors as Hemingway, Dickens and Steinbeck had been almost completely ignored. This book was the latest in my effort to remedy this sad state of affairs and upgrade my reading list.Having recently read Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men, I was familiar with the historical period and geographical setting for this Steinbeck work. The story is essentially one of two families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons, their histories and the relationship between them. It becomes clear midway through the novel that it is largely autobiographical, as one of the Hamilton daughters marries a Steinbeck.Having read other Steinbeck works and several by Dickens during the last six months, I'm struck by the similarity in character development between the two writers. Despite vastly different writing styles and subjects, both authors' works are marked in the extent to which their novels are character driven. Many times there is no \\"story\\" or progression of events, as much as simply following characters through the course of daily existence. It is the richness of the characters that has elevated the works of these renowned writers and this novel is a perfect example of this.Two families co-exist in the Salinas Valley during the early years of the 20th century. The family members and those that they interact with are some of the most vivid and vibrant characters I've ever encountered in my four decades of reading a wide variety of works. At its heart, the story revolves around a multi-generational, modern day adaptation of the Old Testament parable of Cain and Abel (brother named Charles and Adam, Caleb and Aron). At one point, when asked his brother whereabouts, Caleb responds, \\"I don't know. Is it my job to look after him?\\" Sound familiar? The analogy extends to the title of the work itself, whereas Cain is banished to the land of Nod, lying East of Eden.This is a magnificent work of literature and one I highly recommend."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I do not usually like long books, or books that include insanely long descriptions of settings, towns, and people. However, this book was different. It is so long for a reason. You get to know GENERATIONS of a family. You meet the parents when they're young and their children when born. You leave the book feeling like you know the history of this family... like you KNOW them... not just know how they acted in one or 2 different situations. Like you know them inside and out. I loved this book and put it right up there with The Catcher in the Rye as books that have made a difference in how I live & view my life."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Upon finishing this book, I was in awe. At his sharpest, Steinbeck weaves an intricate web of characters, all of whom encompass both good and evil, yet enable us to fall in love with each one of them, even the worse ones. Through the despair, cruelty, and pain, there lies hope and pure honesty of human emotions that force you do to your own introspection, leaving you begging for more and speechless once you've finished."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I just finished this novel a few hours ago after 3 days of continuous reading. This will probably be one of my favorite books i've ever read. One who reads the book will grow with adam, cal, aron and lee. I don't read much but i cannot give this book enough stars. So descriptive, one will get lost in the dusty west."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is the reincarnation of Genesis 4. With a thrilling plot, Steinbeck retells the story of three generations and the constant struggle between good and evil, bringing his allusions to a more modern example that easily relates to the reader. Even though the novel begins with a brief and confusing introduction of characters, Steinbeck's unique and clever recipe fortifies the escalading moral of timshel, or \\"thou mayest\\". By describing the backgrounds of the character, Steinbeck asserts that each character had the choice to become whoever they became by the end of the novel.The novel's powerful biblical allusions, discerned between its thrilling lines, engage the reader subconsciously in a battle between good and evil. From phrases like \\"Am I my brother's keeper\\" to Cal's desperate want to please his father, one can predict the fate of these characters based on the story of Cain and Abel and the original sin. Steinbeck, however, ends his novel with the word \\"timshel\\" to add a moral sense to the novel: one's choice of becoming good or evil.According to the story of Cain and Abel, God chose Abel's gift over Cain's, causing jealousy to foment inside of Cain, resulting in the death of Abel and Cain's unbearable punishment. Steinbeck, however, ends his novel on a note that his reader does not expect. Instead of being punished for his jealousy and selfish motives, Cal is granted another chance when Adams, lying on his deathbed, blessed him, like Jacob blessed Esau, and he told him \\"timshel\\".Steinbeck's unique characterization is a testimony to the brilliance of the novel. Cathy and Samuel Hamilton are polar opposites. Cathy, who makes others stumble, commits suicide with an overdose of morphine. Sam Hamilton, on the other hand, dies a peaceful death after raising nine successful children. Adam, who was first tormented by Cathy's betrayal, overcomes evil with the help of Sam Hamilton. With his last encounter with his former lover, Cathy is desperate to retain power over him. She even offers to have sex with him to prove that he is not better than she is. Adam, however, refuses and leaves with a serene smile. He has triumphed over evil.Steinbeck's incorporation of Lee's speech about the varying Hebrew translations of \\"timshel\\", cleverly manifests the moral of his novel. The theme of Good overcoming Evil is a constant reminder of the individual's choice. Steinbeck's theme gives hope to the hopeless, peace to the restless, and light to the darkness, because fate does not apply in this novel."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"If the phrase \\"Great American Novel\\" implies a work of scope and substance, dealing with what is unique in American life, rooted in a deep knowledge of time and place, filled with characters who might well be our own forefathers, and infused with a strong moral purpose, EAST OF EDEN certainly fills the bill. At 600 pages, it is a much longer book thanOF MICE AND MEN(103 pages) or evenTHE GRAPES OF WRATH(416), but it is filled with all kinds of light: the bright simplicity of Steinbeck's language, the spark of his humor, his shining song of the land, and the rich glow that comes from his deep understanding of human beings, especially imperfect ones.Steinbeck himself appears in the novel as a young boy, and one of the threads in the story is the tale of his maternal grandfather, Samuel Hamilton, who emigrated from Northern Ireland in the middle of the 19th century and came to the Salinas Valley in California. There he raised a large family more on the proceeds of his work as a well-driller and handyman than through much success on his hardscrabble farm. The stories of Steinbeck's older relatives are scattered through the book as a touchstone of basic American values of faith, hard work, and the capacity to dream. One becomes rich when the automobile comes to Salinas, another dies in poverty, but most simply marry and raise families of their own.But the central character in the book is a New Englander, Adam Trask. We see him as a boy, in a complex relationship with his half-brother Charles. Sent by his father, a Civil War veteran, into the army, he knocks around the country for years before unexpectedly coming into some money and settling in the Salinas Valley. The main part of the book follows the growth of Adam's sons Caleb and Aron to young adulthood, and it is clear that some of the old history of Charles and Adam is being repeated. Or of Cain and Abel. For that oldest of all stories about colonists in a new land -- farmer, hunter, man of action, man of dreams -- obviously has great resonance for Steinbeck. It becomes a symbol for American aspiration and American violence, a paradox of how two members of a family can be so alike and yet so different, and a challenge that goes to the heart of individual morality.Steinbeck had used such resonances before, most notably in the final scene of THE GRAPES OF WRATH, but here he is constructing an entire novel around the exegesis of a biblical text. Some of his scaffolding is a little obvious, notably the prevalence of names beginning with A or C, and the numerous philosophical discussions. There is a serpent in this Eden, Cathy Ames, one of the great female psychopaths in literature, whom Steinbeck announces as a monster even before her birth. Goodness is represented first by Samuel Hamilton, and later by Adam's Chinese servant, Lee. But for all this polarization, Steinbeck's writing is so grounded in realism, and his treatment of good and evil so nuanced, that it is no longer a matter of how the old story repeats itself, but of how flawed human beings may claw back from the brink and be the masters of their own souls. This is a book to make you think -- but also one to make you laugh and cry, and above all to glory in this wondrous country and its people."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is a sheer delight.

I personally prefer Steinbeck's earlier works, such as \\"Cannery Row,\\" \\"Sweet Thursday,\\" and \\"Tortilla Flat,\\" but found that \\"East of Eden\\" was worth the time to become reacquainted with this masterful author.But this novel is lengthy at 600 pages. It's also complicated, multi-faceted, and requires patience and understanding to get through. You can read a lot into the story as an analysis of dysfunctional family life, or enjoy it for the incredible, intelligent piece of fiction that it is. Either way, it is well worth the journey."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Most people will never read \\"East of Eden\\". If they want to find out why John Steinbeck is celebrated as an American icon of the literary world they'll usually pick up something a little less daunting like \\"The Pearl\\", \\"Tortilla Flat\\" or one of his other smaller books. Even if they are willing to spend time on one of his more epic works, they usually turn to \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". That is a shame, not because his other works are great; they certainly are that, but because \\"East of Eden\\" is a masterpiece that tackles the age old issue of the dual nature of man in a manner that we can all related to.Where books like \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" and \\"Crime and Punishment\\", tackling the same issue, are weighty and hard to navigate (Don't get me wrong, they are worth the effort), \\"East of Eden\\" is engrossing and captivating. Using the story of Cain and Abel in Genesis not only as part of the story but as the basis for his characters Aaron and Caleb (Their father's name is Adam), Steinbeck explores the balance between wanting to do good and doing evil as well as the motivations behind them redefining them to make us look at both in a new light.Cain, in the Bible, takes on a new life and I found myself able to understand better why he did what he did and oddly enough, relating to him. While I've never killed my brother (There are certainly times I wanted to!), I can understand the feelings of rejection he had that brought him to that place and, after all, I think that this is part of the reason it's in the Bible, not so that we can set ourselves above him but rather understand that the nature of Cain is in all of us and that God loves us in spite of it (Cain, after all, was protected by God. The \\"mark of Cain\\" wasn't to brand him a killer but rather to mark him as a man protected by God).Steinbeck does, at times, ramble; the book is, granted, a daunting one but it is also a classic for a reason. Someone once said \\"We read to know that we are not alone\\" and I couldn't agree more. There is a quote that I had stenciled on the wall of my study where my 3,000 volumes (and growing)reside which reads \\"The man who does not read good books has no advantage over the man who can't read them.\\" It is attributed to Mark Twain but it's questionable whether it came from him or not. Either way, it's true. If you are not illiterate (you wouldn't be able to read this if you were) than count yourself one of the blessed and fortunate, then, go one step further and pick up \\"East of Eden\\" and read a book that is not only a \\"good book\\" but a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have to admit, when I felt the length of the novel weighing in my hands as i picked it up from the bookstore, I was a bit intimidated by what I could expect. I knew that East of Eden is probably one of the most renowned and famous piece of American literature of all time, but nevertheless, I was pessimistic when I began reading. However, that soon changed when I began to realize the brilliancy of the novel and recognized the masterpiece that it really is. This novel is truly one in a million.The story is set in Salinas, California, where Steinbeck himself grew up, and follows two generations of the Trask family, the main one with Adam and his sons, Aron and Cal. The characters of Aron and Cal are purposeful allusions to the biblical story of Cain and Abel, and Steinbeck parallels them with great success. Not only does he follow the storyline, but Steinbeck is one of the few authors that is able to dig deep into the human soul and come out with something truly revolutionary: their inner-most vulnerability. His brilliant portrayal of these characters make them almost life-like, and in some ways, by spilling out their souls for me to see, I felt somewhat connected to them, and was able to share in their triumphs and falters, joys and miseries. Steinbeck so expertly integrates the story of Cain and Abel, a son crying out for a father's love, and the sibling rivalry that reins over it. This book has what every reader wants, wit, humor, perspective, and insight, all brilliantly tied together by the classic tale of two brothers."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is truly a novel of unfound proportions. It plays on the juxtaposition of naivety and wisdom, truth and faith, struggle and redemption, and most importantly, good and evil. Within the given boundaries of 600 pages, Steinbeck explores the psychological and mental desires of everybody, while also enlightening the readers with a theory on the purpose of life and its attributes.The main storyline follows the vicious cycle of two generations of siblings in the Trask family, while also playing on the biblical reference to the stories of Cain and Abel, and Caleb and Aron. The two set of brothers, who set the stage for the novel, are always in conflict with one another in their desire to gain the love of their fathers. In its exploration of their interaction with the people around them and with their fathers, Steinbeck uses the brothers in order to explain life as the Bible does. He directly calls upon the stories in the vastly popular book in order to expound on God's meaning of life as it pertains to society and how people should view their lives in respect to others. He creates a whole commonalty of characters that help extenuate and expose the interactions of people and their effects. Cathy, another important figure in the book, is Steinbeck's way of placing evil in a light that takes a tangible form. Cathy is one character alone that while she amazes and builds suspense for the reader, she also disgusts and shocks the reader with her cunning ability to manipulate people at the lift of a finger. Her evil genius is solely a product of her desires: to get out of work in dismissing responsibility, to subjugate blame, and gain an enormous control over people. Steinbeck also delves into the meaning of life and how it is defined completely on the ability of choice. He acquaints the readers with the word \\"timshel.\\" Etymologically speaking, the Hebrew word directly translates to \\"thou mayest,\\" which Steinbeck uses to express his viewpoint on choice. He tells the reader that only he has the ability to choose the path of his life, and it is he who can conquer sin and break from past trends.Ultimately, the book brings out the true battle of good and evil as the Bible interprets it, and reveals the true definition of life. As Steinbeck explores the issues that surround life in terms of faith, trust, and love, he creates an unbelievable book, despite its licentiousness, that leaps out of the boundaries delineated by society. The characters, the themes, the story itself, all of it comes together, creating a momentous book by all standards."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"After the slaying of his brother, the biblical Cain dwelt in the land \\"east of Eden,\\" protected from the wrath of men by the divine mark placed upon him but vulnerable to his own sense of guilt and its consequence, a forlorn and hateful existence. Does Cain still have the choice of salvation through self-determination or is he foredoomed to damnation?The answer to this question is crucial to the characters in Steinbeck's novel, where parallels to Cain and his brother, Abel, are abundant. Predestination or self-determination? Both philosophies come to bear on the characters in this story. We see the unrelenting descent into sin and depravity by the child Catherine as her cold and calculating acts become ever more heinous and she devolves from the girl Cathy into the woman Kate, the madam of a house of sadism. At the end, Kate frightens herself into suicide, which, by the way, is one of Steinbeck's powerful ironies inasmuch as the person whom Kate fears is, unbeknownst to her, already dead.Of all the persons whom we meet in this novel, Kate alone seems to have no hope of salvation, and this hardly seems fair for she alone seems to have had no choice. She alone appears predestined to damnation. She alone feels no remorse, no guilt, indeed nothing at all. She alone is utterly cold and empty of human emotion. She is preternaturally evil, and she seems to have been born thus. Is she, then, the counterpart of the biblical Eve, whose act of disobedience was so unforgivably heinous that not only she but all of her progeny were driven from the Garden of Eden into a dark, painful world and made to suffer for her Original Sin for as long as mankind shall exist? (We must accept Christian mythology here for sake of discussion.)As the biblical Eve was the consort of the biblical Adam, and the dam of Cain and Abel, so Kate begets Caleb and Aron, who are raised as the sons of her husband, Adam Trask. The fact that Adam's brother Charles was the biological father adds even more to the ponderous weight of sin that courses through the novel. Can the generations ever be freed of spiritual darkness? The answer lies in Timshel, the Hebrew verb meaning, according to the Oriental servant and philosopher Lee, \\"thou mayest,\\" a translation different from that commonly accepted in the King James Version of the Bible.Lee suggests that God continues to give man a choice, free will to work toward repentance and salvation or toward sin and damnation. \\"Thou mayest\\" follow the course that thou will. Caleb, even though he feels that he is mean and ugly and that his actions led to Aron's death, hence making him a murderer as surely as Cain was a murderer, may nevertheless prove to be the turning point and achieve salvation. If he manages this, it will be through the influence and aid of Abra, and her presence in the story saves Steinbeck from being labeled a misogynist, to which his portrayal of Kate would surely have led. Still, the turning point lies in the future beyond the end of the novel, and Steinbeck does not tell us whether or not Cal succeeds. Abra's name inevitably reminds me of that of Abraham, too; are she and Cal destined to be the founders of future \\"saved\\" generations?These are only a few of the major themes that weave through this work. We could also explore the fatal flaw shared by Adam and his son Aron, their failure to see reality and their insistence of living in a world that is as insubstantial as their nave dreams. Thus do they contribute to their own destruction. We could examine more of the ironies of life that permeate this novel, as they do all of Steinbeck's creations. Suffice it to say that EAST OF EDEN is full of both interest and meaning, for it speaks to the essential question of mankind's spiritual salvation, a question that has resulted in tremendous schisms among theologians, and it speaks to this question through a constantly evolving plot that captures the reader's interest immediately and pulls him through the novel without pity!This book probably belongs on the \\"must-read\\" list of American novels, and I commend it and its message to every literate adult (and precocious teenager) who possesses the will and the courage to examine the most basic of human choices and who is willing to decide for himself how to translate \\"Timshel.\\" However, there is a prerequisite reading assignment. Before starting EAST OF EDEN, do read at least Chapters 3 and 4 from the Book of Genesis. They're short, but without some knowledge of them, the reader will miss the point that Steinbeck so intriguingly makes."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I've always wanted to read more classical literature but I just didn't know where to begin. Bad memories of high school English class haunted me into my adulthood and limited my reading. Therefore I was very enthusiastic when Oprah's announced the idea of her new book club focusing on the classics. I thank her for giving me a means to read books that have stood the test of time. I believe EAST OF EDEN was a wonderful first selection as its plot is great in depth and scope. Primarily set in the early 20th century (beginning during The Civil War and ending with World War I), this book follows the life of Adam Trask as he finds his own Eden in the Salinas Valley of California. The characters are three-dimensional and believable. The most comprehensive is Cathy, Adam's wife with a very dark soul and is full of evil and hate. I have certainly never met a character like her before. Also unforgettable is Lee, Adam's Chinese-American servant who always managed to add much great philosophical insights into the events unfolding in the Trask household. In addition to the excellent character development Steinbeck included social commentaries on the founding of the West. I believe he did a very good job of balancing the good and the bad of Western expansion, particularly in regards to racial issues. I also appreciated Steinbeck's method of writing himself into the story as the narrator and even using his real name that is indeed rare. I didn't rush through this book as I would normally do but rather savored each chapter, however small or big. It has been a long time since I have read a book that has captured me like EAST OF EDEN has. This book will reside in a special place on my bookcase further enabling me to enjoy it for year to come. Bravo!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"\\"East of Eden\\" is a truly wonderful story in which explores the meaning behind evil and good and contains incredible character psychology. The main storyline of this book follows the inevitable cycle of two generations of brothers in the Trask family to live out the classic Cain and Abel story. Two brothers live in conflict as one receives love from a father figure while the other does not. It is interesting alone to watch how each brother progresses in his character so that the generation flaws will be repeated. The story alone is well written, but it is the characters that truly drive the storyline. Throughout the whole novel, I find myself trying to find out why a certain character does the things they do, pondering upon their psychology. The character of Cathy is definitely one that will keep you on your seat. Cathy is a character in which has no sense of goodness within her and has the power to manipulate people to her will. Throughout the story, I find myself completely attached to the book just to find out more about Cathy so that I could analyze her behavior. When I thought I understood her character, she would do something that would change my whole view of her. Her character becomes even more complex as it is intertwined with Biblical references as well. The characters all are complex and as deep as Cathy. I do have to admit that the characters initially seemed odd in the first third of the book. Cathy uses her \\"body\\" to get her way and Adam, Cathy's husband, is completely oblivious to everything around him, but the characters eventually grown on the reader. Each of the characters explores the different parts of human psychology. One characteristic that becomes familiar is the damage of broken families on children. One character develops a fake imaginary world in order to cope with the fact that his mother was no longer with him. The depth of characters is so great that you will find yourself reading on just to find out more information on the characters.The characters are great but also the theme of good and evil also plays a major part in the story's greatness. This story questions the actual what good and evil are. It truly makes the readers think about the good and evil in their lives, whether the book is right or not. With the good and evil theme, the option of choice comes into play. The reader will grow familiar with the word \\"timshel\\". This is the Jewish word relating to the choice of mankind. \\"East of Eden\\" specifically refers to the Biblical wording of the Adam and Eve story. In the original manuscripts of the Bible, God actually said mankind \\"mayest\\" conquer over sin rather than the common belief that mankind will conquer sin. It puts the choice of man to whether or not conquer sin. In the story, the character of Cal has to choose whether he will follow the path of his mother sin or to live his own life. Cal believes that the sins of his mother have passed on to him. All this and more are contained in the book \\"East of Eden\\". The philosophy will keep you thinking about not only the story's characters, but also your own life.\\"East of Eden\\" is an entertaining story about the story of Cain of Abel being repeated through generations of brothers. However, its main strength is the fact that it makes the reader think. Whether it be about the character psychology or the philosophy of the book, the reader will be captivated by the complexity of the book. Though the concepts may be complex, the characters are used in a way in which they will embody such concepts. In this way, the concepts become as clear as daylight to any reader. Overall, this book is great for those who like to be intrigued and to follow growth of individual characters."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The greatest novel which I have ever had the priveledge and delight to read. God bless John Steinbeck, or better yet, John Steinbeck bless himself for having the capacity (and choice) to choose such a frotuitous career, which yielded the most sophisticated and human epics penned by any American authors hitherto.East of Eden is the finest of Steinbeck's novels, and the way that Eden and the Fall have been oriented into the story of the Trask and Hamilton families puts a whole new light on existence itself. What is man? Is man a species who is predestined by original sin to carry a guilt within them, and upon every meditation to yield that guilt into their disposition? Or is man a self-governing being who can make the choice to tear the mask of guilt off of his face and conquer his own destiny?To attempt to throw you headlong into a preview/summary of the novel is not my intent in this review, but to forebode a mission into the heart of American literatures finest accomplishment.This is the type of book which you close and stare at for 20 minutes upon finishing, and then procede to take a majestic walk through a park, or better yet a bad part of the neighbourhood, and brood over the lessons you have just learned about man, the universe, and the meaning of life itself.In sum; read the book.Thou mayest."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Read the other reviews for plot synopsis and lit crit. The reason for the three-star review: Oprah's Book Club edition (and this probably applies to the Centennial edition as well) of Steinbeck's epic masterpiece has been bespoiled by sloppy proofreading. Riddled with typos and spelling mistakes galore, this edition is frustrating to read. I typically don't buy anything with Oprah's name on it, but this tome was available used for only three bucks on Amazon, so what the heck. Penguin is one of the premier publishers of classic literature, and I am heartbroken that Penguin chose to print something so rife with errors. What disrespect to Steinbeck's genius."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is my favourite book. Many an author dreams of achieving what Steinbeck achieves in this novel. It is a family saga that captures the essence of living within its pages and focuses on the individuality of lives - and the absolute power that those lives have to shape others.It is the most spiritually alive and aware book I have ever read. It encompasses the best and the worst of what it means to be human. It always moves me to tears because it makes me realise that we all hold failure in our hearts - and yet it inspires me to believe in the greatness of the individual. None of us are beyond loving.Focusing on two families with very different upbringings and influences, it studies the often harmful effect of relationships on ego and the desire of every child to be loved - every child but one.Cathy is a woman who looks only to herself and seems to feel no guilt or remorse for her actions. She is born entirely selfish.In complete contrast to Cathy is Samuel, an inspirational and charismatic figure who loves all. The underlying message of the novel is that despite the surrounding environment we all have a certain potential, and we all &quot;Mayest&quot; achieve it. If some of us fail to reach our potential it makes us no less valid. Just by living we have made our mark. The message is that we &quot;May&quot; , not we &quot;Should&quot; or we &quot;Must&quot;.I read a lot - and this is the most human novel that I have ever read - and the most forgiving. It is that forgiveness that inspires me."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"THIS BOOK TOOK ME A WHILE TO READ, BUT I'M GLAD IT DID. IT GAVE ME A LOT OF THINGS TO THINK ABOUT, AND I WAS NEVER DISAPPOINTED. SAD YES, LOT'S OF TEARS DID FORM. IT HAS AWESOME THEMES, AND CHARACTERS. EVEN THE CHARACTERS YOU THOUGH YOU HATED TO BEGIN WITH, YOUR IDEAS OF THEM CHANGE, BECAUSE THEY CHANGED. THEY REALIZE THINGS THAT DIDN'T REALIZE BEFORE. THIS IS ONE OF THE WAYS YOU CAN TELL A GREAT BOOK FROM A GOOD BOOK. THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL THREE DEMSIONAL FULLY FORMED PEOPLE, THAT YOU FEEL YOU KNOW. SAMUEL, HAD INSIGHT, BELIEFS AND HOPES. HE HAD CHILDREN THAT HE WISHED THE WORLD FOR, AND FRIENDS THAT HE INFLUENCED. THIS STORY DEMOSTRATES THE RELATION BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN, AND HUMAN, AND HOW LOVE CAN BE AS, CRIPPLING AS IT IS PLEASURABLE, THIS IS BOOK IS A DEFINITE READ."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck parallels this story with the biblical &quot;fall of man.&quot; This story comes from the murderous rivalry of Cain and Abel and the banishment of the Garden of Eden. The novel is described as the collapse of two families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons. I, however, see it differently. Although both families certainly experience bitter tragedies in this novel I do not see the story ending with those tragedies. The only presence of biblical texts is in the analysis of the murder of Abel. The discovery revealed is that &quot;thall shall&quot; (must) or &quot;thall will&quot; (it is inevitable), but that &quot;thou mayest,&quot; that the only constraint laid upon us it that of permissability - no restraint at all. In essence this leaves the end result up to man. Without debating the inherent goodness of man one need only see the beauty in which characters of this novel exist. The end result is not unknown, only the circumstances.Although a long read it is a great one. Partially because of the length of the book and partially because of its depth this novel can be a very weary read. I suggest reading it a bit at a time, and allowing time in between reads to let the content filter into you.Have patience; you will be rewarded."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I LOVED this book. It explored the nature of good and evil through several generations of families, from both a spiritual and psychological view. I also enjoyed learning more about this history of settling Salinas Valley. Great read!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I'm re-reading the classics of my youth.

It was wonderful-John Steinbeck sure knew how to tell a great story."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck captures the simple truths about humanity in a compelling and intriguing story. I hadn't read any of his other books, and now I look forward to them all."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"After reading Of Mice and Men I chose to read East of Eden because I liked the style of Steinbeck. I knew that Steinbeck knew how to tell a good story and with this book he did not fail. However, the story was a long one. It took exactly 601 pages. But, other than the length the story of East of Eden is that of a family and the struggles of marriage and life in an unknown land. It illustrates very well the hardships of growing up with a single father or mother. It is also riddled with biblical allusions. The main biblical allusion is what encompasses the whole story is the story of Cain and Abel. This appears with the many conflicts that occur between the brothers in this story. It also encompasses a frame device where Steinbeck through flashbacks tells a story of family heritage playing a role in the future. Overall East of Eden is a great book that I would recommend to anyone who has the time to read this book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is a book that I have santed to read for a long time but kept putting it off. I am so glad I purchased and read it recently. The sibling rivalary goes from generation to genertion just like Cain and Abel in the book of Genesis in the Bible. I certainly enjoyed the vivid iscriptions of the characters and landscapes in this book. The text is excellent."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Calling East of Eden \\"Steinbeck's masterpiece\\" is a bit misleading, like saying JFK was Joe's \\"best kid.\\" It depends on your criteria, for starters. If I could only save one Steinbeck novel from a fire, it would be Grapes of Wrath, not East of Eden. East of Eden begins with a few hundred pages of sentences you can savor one after the other. Once Caleb and Aron come along, things bog down a bit, and that sense that you are spending every minute with something delicious and fine wavers a bit. But Steinbeck pulls it all together in the final pages, and it's worth the wait.This is not a novel for the impatient. If you are looking for sex and violence, chances are your tastes are too jaded to appreciate what you will find here. Steinbeck doesn't tell you in gynecological detail what she does with the cigarette, for example, or devote a dozen pages to Cathy's beating. It's not a novel for the flippantly cynical; I don't share Steinbeck's opinion, but his fundamental belief in the goodness of humankind is touching and admirable, because it is not just polyester sentiment.Mercifully for the reading illiterate, Elia Kazan's film is brilliant and reasonably close to the novel, so you can \\"know\\" East of Eden without the bother of reading it. But if you have an interest in the writer's craft, you will be missing something special. The almost mystic lyricism of Grapes of Wrath is modulated here into an elegaic prose, and Steinbeck's politics are not on the forestage. But Sam Hamilton and Lee are American types no one captured more accurately and completely, and Lee's insistence, that the story of Cain is THE story, the only story, turns out, as things come to a close, to make more sense than one might wish."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The quintessential story of good vs. evil. Steinbeck was at his best in his \\"Big Book.\\""},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is one of my favorite books. Most of the book takes place in the farmland of the Salinas Valley in northern California. It's a big book and has lots of characters but the main characters are Adam Trask and his twin sons Aaron and Caleb. Adam is a good man but sometimes very simpleminded. He sees things black and white and can be stubborn. His two sons are complete opposites. Since Aaron does what his father wants, he's Adam's favorite. Caleb, or Cal, can't do anything right in his father's eyes and so tries hard to win his love.My favorite part of this book is how personal Steinbeck makes it. He doesn't just talk about the Trask family; he also spends a lot of time telling about his mother's family. It makes it seem like the story he's telling could be real, or at least it's rooted in his family history. The first time I read it made me wonder what my neighbors were up to and what type of stories they were hiding.As much as I like the book, I wish there was more about the Chinese servant Lee. Lee would go into Chinatown in San Francisco and it made me want to know what happened there.I would recommend this book to people who like well told stories about the problems families create for themselves."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is a masterpiece second to Grapes of Wrath among Steinbecks works. The novel is heavily allegorical so if you dont like allegory even if well done you wont like this novel. However the allegory works for me and I enjoy welldone allegory. The novel is quite philosophical at times but it is compelling throughout.I enjoy a more philosophical novel so this really works for me. This is a masterpiece and is thought provoking on the nature of good and evil and how initial perceptions can dominate a person that even reality cannot break it down completely as Adams misjudgement of Catherine leads him to favor the son that strongly resembles her with bad results a great novel"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A beautiful and moving family saga based on Steinbeck's own family history and the story of Cain and Abel from the book of Genesis in the Bible. It's always nice when you read a classic and realize it's a classic because it's wonderfully written, evocative, and resonates with your own understanding of the human condition. The Hamilton family, dreamers and farmers without financial success, interact with the Trasks, a successful but troubled family. Lee, Trask's Chinese cook, is an especially attractive, nuanced, and non-stereotypical character, while Cathy Ames, Trask's faithless sociopathic wife, is one of the most fearful villains in literature. Especially moving are the theological debates about freedom and destiny between Hamilton, Trask, and Lee. A must-read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I was really impressed by the characters and themes that Steinbeck drew and tackled in this novel. I was blown away especially by the character of Lee since he plays such an important role in the novel and he's Chinese. At the time of the novel and its publication, I could not think of characters in novels or in film where minorities were not caricatures or stereotypically portrayed, so I was really surprised to find Lee so well drawn out. He was such a significant moral force in the story.I've read Steinbeck's other work and this is his masterpiece. For 600 pages, you get to live with these characters and it's sad when the book ends. The only thing to do is to reread and it's definitely one of those books worth rereading."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I was beyond excited to be reading this book. I had never read Steinbeck before, and I was itching to start. Well, let me say, it was a difficult thing to do. Steinbeck's style is interesting. He's not so much verbose as he is long-winded. You won't find the abundance of adjectives that characterize Fitzgerald's works, but you're going to find a lot of sentences. As such, the story moves at a plodding pace. Now, considering that the story also spans roughly three generations, well... It makes for quite a long read.But if you can get over the pacing and the style, it makes for a very good read. There's no apparent plot in this book; it simply follows the the life of a family over the years. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it gives the story a lack of direction at times. More or less, the story exists not in and of itself, but rather as a vehicle for the theme: choice. Some might call it good vs. evil, but that's not it at all. It's rather the choice between the two, or to be somewhere in between. There are a lot of religious allusions made in this book, and they might go over the heads of some.Characters here are interesting to say the least. At the surface, some are unequivocally evil, others pure as snow. And yet, at the end of the book, you're left wondering if that was so. There's an illusion of flatness with many of the characters, especially Adam and Cathy, when in fact each one is incredibly deep. The other characters are all interesting, realistic in the most part, and people you can deeply feel for.Overall, the book is deserving of being called a classic, if only for it's deep theme. Everything else is really peripheral to that it seems, though not lacking. Steinbeck's style might put some off, but if you can overcome it, then a great ride awaits."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I'm not going to summarize the book, just give my opinion. East of Eden is great, which is something to be said by me because I am not a John Steinbeck fan. It was brilliantly written and truly enchanting. I recommend this book to any kind of reader, young or old. Some parts were slow, but definitely worth it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"For years I've wanted to tackle Steinbeck's \\"East of Eden.\\" I knew going in that it was a retelling of sorts of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, and the sin that \\"crouches on your doorstep, waiting to devour.\\" I suspected Steinbeck would make it his own, setting in his beloved Salinas, California. What I did not expect was this sprawling, gritty, wise, and sometimes beautiful classic.Adam and Charles Trask are the first set of protagonists, two brothers at odds. They are only precursors for Adam's own sons, Cal and Aron, who will be even more at odds, a division rooted in part in their mother's cold-hearted choices and philandering. Cathy/Kate, their mom, is one of the most vivid and three-dimensional portrayals of evil I've ever read in fiction. Adding some moral balance to the cast is Lee, the loyal and long-suffering Chinaman. His studies lead to life-changing decisions for Adam and his sons, based on the differences between a fatalistic approach to life or one born from the freedom to choose.While the story reads at times like an exploration of the early to mid-1900s, Steinbeck parallels this earthy tale with the slow unfolding of biblical events in Genesis. He follows that script without being predictable or bound by it, instead showing its immediacy in the human soul and mind. These characters could've lived thousands of years ago, or they could live next door today. That's the brilliance of this novel. Yes, it can be stodgy in parts, even pedantic, but Steinbeck's willingness to let his characters wrestle with life's ugliness and its unknowns make the lessons feel worthwhile and well earned.I loved this book, after trudging through the first thirty pages or so, and realize why it's a classic. Where Hemingway stripped down language and reshaped American literature, Steinbeck took that same gritty, manly writing and gave it back its heart."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I loved this book.

I will spare you the praise that everyone has so readily offered and focus on the Centennial Edition itself. I love it. I love the look, I love the binding and the cover, and I love how the pages are sort of roughed and uneven along the edges. It gives the book a unique feel, a character, something that says \\"classic\\" which is what a book should say for this story.Get the Centennial Edition if you can over the Oprah's Book club edition, which has a big red banner and obtrusive font on it which, I feel, mars the quality of the story that the book holds. I borrowed the original from the library ages ago, and only recently bought two copies for two friends who loved it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is amazing. I never tire of the plot or characters, but while the story is extremely enjoyable, it is the compelling characters that Steinbeck created that truly give the book its merit.As the excerpts on the book covers suggest, East of Eden is a loose epic retelling of the Biblical stories of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel. Set in the Salinas Valley in the early 20th century, the novel involves the Trasks and the Hamiltons, telling of three generations of these families. The introduction to East of Eden is, while not as intriguing and momentous as the rest of the book, still successful in drawing in the reader. It is easy to understand both the story and the characters because of Steinbeck's simply composed sentences, though the characters introduced in the beginning have less depth than later characters. Because Steinbeck weaves over three separate stories in one novel, his plot may seem disarrayed and confusing at times. Ultimately, however, this contributes to the wonderful reading experience, as the reader is able to experience multiple stories involving contrasting characters and different paces. The book never gets sluggish or monotonous, because of the overlapping plotlines.East of Eden is such an incredible book because the depth of the characters causes the reader to feel a wide array of emotions. Cal, for instance, is possibly the most appealing and intriguing character in the entire novel, despite Steinbeck's continual assertion that nobody likes the dark, secretive boy. Everyone can relate to Cal and his struggle to overcome the evil quality inside himself, and emerge \\"good\\" like his twin brother Aron. Everyone can understand Cal's desire to be accepted, his desire to be loved and appreciated. Everyone knows what Cal is going through when he tries to vindicate himself by trying to get revenge on those who favor his brother. He is jealous and he is vengeful, but he is also loving and sensitive. Cal's complexity makes the second half of the novel so wonderful to read- his progress from a dark little boy to a mature, caring young man is amazing. Steinbeck's characterization is excellent, but he also writes scenes in which Cal and Aron are simply innocent, curious boys, rather than profound, universal characters part of an epic tale. East of Eden is so easy to relate to, but it is also a fantastic ambitious saga.One of the most common criticisms of the book is that the main antagonist, Cathy, is an unrealistic one-dimensional character, but she is, in fact, a complex character, as she embodies several types of evil, rather than just cruelty or insanity. She is written very sophisticatedly; if her severe lack of humanity and warmth seems unrealistic, it is because, in comparison with the other characters, Cathy is blatantly evil. There is no other character as depraved as Cathy in the story; even Charles desires love and displays fondness for his Adam, and Cal ultimately chooses goodness. Besides, Cathy does show brief episodes of weakness, which obviously show that she is somewhat human and not just an antagonist who opposes the protagonists and then suddenly disappears. The book begins to move at a faster pace when she is introduced, and as her mind disintegrates, the reader is left to wonder what her true level of humanity is, and whether she should be pitied. Cathy is one of the most fascinating characters in the book, because the nature of her wickedness is so intense that it easily heightens the suspense of the story.Though I only touched on the more prominent aspects of East of Eden, the entire book is worth reading multiple times. Every single character is unique, realistic, and wonderful in some way. The plot is extensive, but there are so many different facets to explore, especially because Steinbeck elaborates on universal themes such as light versus dark, good versus evil, jealousy versus love. It is not be the simple plot that gives this book its wonderful quality, but the actual experience of reading through the history of the families and experiencing the multiple feelings this book incites that will make you fall in love with it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"My book club recently picked this as a selection (for a two-month gap!) and I was delighted. I don't remember the last time I read a book that had such great character development and a lovely story to follow. It hasn't been predictable. I think it'll lead to great discussion."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is the story of three generations of the Trask family who live, love and farm in the Salinas valley in Northern California. What is amazing about this book is that the plot sequences progress like a daytime soap opera. It's got affairs, shootings, family betrayal and more. The writing is of such high quality the story never feel melodramtic. The weight and implications of people's actions will pull at your every emotion without ever felling over the top. The characters are complex in the sense that they grow over the course of the book and are surprisingly unpredictable if you are able to experience this book without much prior knowledge. This is one of those rare \\"classics\\" that could actually be considered a \\"beach book\\" as it can be a serious page turner.East of Eden really shows off the range of Steinbeck's abilities as an author. Usually various works by any \\"classic\\" have a similar feel, theme and writing style. While this may be somewhat true for Steinbeck, East of Eden is really of a different nature than the social commentaries Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrath. Because of this, the book has a wider appeal and this is one that anyone looking to read some great literature should pick up.Bottom Line: A must read by anyone in who is looking for an engrossing and well written book. It is long so its not for those who shy away from \\"projects\\"."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I bought this book and read the first chapter. I put it down for six months. I found the beginning to be almost painful. Where's the story? I had heard that this was a classic, so, determined to get through this book, I dove back in.I am thankful that I stuck with it. After the first 40 pages, the story really launched into an interesting tale of good an evil. This story will help to change the way you see yourself. The book can be summarized by Steinbeck's monologue on page 413 (Chapter 34):\\"It seems to me that if you or I must choose between two courses of thought or action, we should remember our dying and try so to live that our death brings no pleasure to the world.\\"\\"We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the never-ending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.\\""},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The characters, the scenes, the descriptions- - all so natural- - are brilliantly brought to life in this American literature classic that seems to recreate a true-life documentary about Central California at the turn-of-the century.With a straightforward story populated by a variety of characters, this book tells the saga of two families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons. The style somewhat resembles James Michener's in terms of his talent also to quickly acquaint you with locations and characters and put you on a first-name basis with them. The saga brings you into the lives of the characters and stirs your emotions like a mixer running on high-speed. Have you uncontrollably screamed out loud when reading a book? Well, I did at this one because of Kate (Cathy), who makes your blood boil with rage.Although Kate doesn't take honors as the main character, she does steal the show in my eyes. She is the essence of e-v-i-l, a four-letter word in her case. Kate is the most memorable character because of her cunning, lying, scheming, and wicked personality, which is not easily forgotten. Steinbeck first talks of monsters as a way of introducing Kate. Monsters, he says, can be born through no fault of their own from human parents and defined through deformities such as huge heads, tiny bodies, no arms, no legs, etc. But then he asks, \\"... just as there are physical monsters, can there not be mental or psychic monsters born?\\" This didn't fully click in my mind at the time I read it because I hadn't witnessed Kate in action. It's after she starts her series of sinister deeds that you come to realize the significance of what Steinbeck meant by \\"psychic monster\\". You'll love to hate her.Among the characters, the two with the best heads on their shoulders were Abra and Lee who added a touch of class by stating common-sense facts in such matter-of-fact fashion. They showed unfaltering determination to deal with life's hard knocks by taking them by the horns, seeking practical solutions in the same down-to-earth way that would grab a sack of potatoes and start peeling.I know some people have criticized the book, saying the two brothers, Cal and Aron, parallel and trivialize the biblical Cain and Abel. They commented that the story is too trite, pat, and overly simplistic in symbolizing \\"good versus evil\\". Maybe I am at fault since I try not to construe too much symbolism into every book I read, as in this instance. I took this story at face value and for that reason the \\"good versus evil premise\\" and the \\"Cain and Abel Story\\" never crossed my mind. In the end I was rewarded with a thoroughly entertaining story that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book was one of the most passionate books I have ever read. John Steinbeck tells a moving tale of two brothers and how their lives are changed by the people around them. Initially sounding like the biblical story of Cain and Abel, Steinbeck puts a new twist on the traditional story, compelling you to see the characters and your own life from a different perspective. It's amazing to witness your emotions and sympathies shift as the story progresses and it's thought provoking to see Steinbeck's distinction between good and evil. After you finish this book, you will find yourself going over and over the symbolism in the story, how the plots twists, and the insight into the sources of good and evil. This book ranks at the top of \\"My Most Favorite Books of All Time\\" list and will spend little time on my bookshelf as I re-read and re-read this book, gaining something new each time."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Love is a powerful thing that can work both ways. Never before has this been so plausibly demonstrated as is the novel, East of Eden, by John Steinbeck. This individual work won the Nobel Prize for Literature, and not without due cause. The story takes place in the beautiful but mysterious Salinas Valley of Northern California. The book runs from the later 1800's up until the First World War, etching in the details of people from all walks of life. Rather than choosing the young hero or heroine to gladly steal the plot away, Steinbeck chose to tell his story through the more humanistic people of the Old West. Samuel Hamilton, a main character, is an inventive man from Ireland that chose to settle on a dusty and barren stretch of land in the Valley. He has his hardships through his life and his creativity gives him losses rather than gains, but still he is a happy man with many children. This is because love was present in his life. The other main character, Adam Trask, leads a rather different life. He is given no love that he can truly appreciate and grows in fear of his own stepbrother. With little love in childhood, he leapt to find it in the outside world. This novel is such a masterpiece because it combines all human elements without enchancing them to make them more heroic or even more humane. Where we often want to shy from the truth of our past because it is not always gloriuos or rightous, I believe that this book opens your eyes to the world and the murderous consequences of love's absence. This book is compelling beyond belief and certainly earns the title of being the best of John Steinbeck's later career."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"If you love California and literature, this book is for you! \\"Samuel rode lightly on top of a book and he balanced happily among ideas the way a man rides white rapids in a canoe. But Tom got into a book, crawled and groveled between the covers, tunneled like a mole among the thoughts, and came up with the book all over his face and hands.\\" This is a book that will get all over your face and hands and you will love it.Steinbeck has innovative, articulate and beautiful ways of describing his family - their strength of character as well as his love for them.\\"Her faith is a mountain, and you, my son, haven't even got a shovel yet.\\"\\"She had no love of places. A place was only a resting stage on the way to heaven.\\"\\"I believe a strong woman may be stronger than a man, particularly if she happens to have love in her heart.

It is admirable that Oprah Winfrey used this large, complex novel to present to her audience.Steinbeck wrote \\"East of Eden\\" in a burst of energy over several months in 1951. He loved this book among all his works and, literally, put himself into it. The first-person narrator of the story is, indeed, Steinbeck himself speaking in his own voice as a a grandson of Samuel Hamilton, born in Ireland and a hero of this novel.Steinbeck said that he wrote \\"East of Eden\\" to tell \\"the story of my country and the story of me\\" to his two young sons in order to demonstrate \\"the greatest story of all-- the story of good and evil, of strength and weakness, of love and hate, of beauty and ugliness, how these doubles are inseparable.\\" (Quotation is from the chronology in the Library of America edition of Steinbeck's novels, 1942-1952 at 963.) For all its melodrama, length, sometimes black-and-white characterizations, and preachiness, the novel achieves its goals. I was transfixed by the book, couldn't put it down, and read it in a short time.The story includes the \\"doubles\\" to which Steinbeck refers as well as some others. The book is the story of two families, the Hamiltons and the Trasks. It is the story of two Trask brothers, Adam and Charles, and of the two twin sons of Adam Trask and his wife Cathy -- Aron and Caleb. Both Adam and Charles and Aron and Caleb replicate in their own ways the Biblical story of Cain and Abel. Steinbeck gives this story a full, biblical style exegisis as the reader sees the story of the conflict between good and evil play out in double over the course of the book.The Trask family and the Hamilton family are settlers in the Salinas Valley in California. \\"East of Eden\\" develops a fine sense of place and when I finished the book I felt I knew an area and its history that I have only in the most superficial manner seen myself. Samuel Hamilton, Steinbeck's grandfather, figures prominently in this book for his wisdom, his stoicism, his inventiveness, and his other-wordliness. His wife, Lisa, is also portrayed with a great deal of love.Perhaps the most memorable character of the book is Cathy Trask who becomes \\"Kate\\" after she leaves Adam Trask and returns to the profession of prostitution in which she was engaged before her marriage. Steinbeck calls her a \\"monster\\" and well he might. The portrayal is striking and even nuanced at the end for all the starkness.Lee, a Chinese servant, is also well portrayed for his subtelty, wisdoms love of learing, and ultimately, devotion to the Trasks and understanding of himself.This is a sweeping, dramatically told story which captures the land, the good and evil of which people are capable, and the importance of what in the Cain and Abel story is described by the Hebrew word \\"Timshel\\" with which Steinbeck concludes his novel. People have the capacity for both good and evil and the power for choice -- to understand the good and reject the evil. The story is told in a humanistic rather than a theological way.\\"East of Eden\\" is a memorable work of American literature that deserves the attention it has recently received."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Normally, I'm not a fan of John Steinbeck, and I wasn't sure how far I would get into this book before my normal put-it-down-and-forget-I-ever-picked-it-up reaction kicked in. But I was very pleasantly surprised when I literally could not put this book down. He brought the Salinas Valley and the characters to life in such vivid detail and evoked in me such strong emotions toward these characters. I was really wowed by the biblical Garden of Eden parallels, and I really enjoyed that he didn't just start right in talking about one family. He started out with backgrounds about Adam's and Cathy's families so I felt like I really knew them by the time they started acting out their places in the story. I also liked how skillfully he interwove the Hamilton family into the story and how he brought in the big issues of the day--i.e. WWI--and somehow brought it down to the level of the story to make it relevant. I felt like I was right there watching it all unfold around me."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"My goodness, what an absolutely outstanding book - I could not put it down. It brought me to tears many times as it caused me some serious reflection. The characters were vivid, sentance structure was pure art, and sometimes I actually felt like I knew the people and could completely relate to the complex drama of family secrets and the petty shames many of us (me too) locked into our smallness. At 601 pages, I was done easily in under a week. It was well worth my time and I believe a very compelling narrative on free will from a Christian perspective.This book is very relevant, well placed historically, and a testament to freedom and the creative potential of the human spirit.\\"Timshel - Thou Mayest makes a man great, that gives him stature with the gods... That gives a choice, the way is open - can choose his course and fight it through and win... This is a ladder to climb to the stars... A path is open, new and bright... Thou mayest rule over sin... You must master it.\\"\\"The lightning shattered the air into quaking pieces.\\""},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Another Steinbeck classic! I have never been disappointed with a Steinbeck novel and this was no exception. Beautifully written and just flows so easily. It is quite lengthy and VERY descriptive but it wouldn't be true Steinbeck if it were not. Well worth the time for me."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"One of my all time favorites. I read this book many years ago and recently purchased it for my home library. I enjoyed reading it just as much the second time around."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"No other author shows you the human spirit during America's Great Depression era like John Steinbeck. Eden's characters are simply amazing; each possessing subconscious energies guiding them toward the turmoil and passions which ultimately shape their lives. The character of Lee affected me beyond my own realization, until I reached the very last chapter. I read this book, believing I had figured each character's fate, but found instead a continuous and renewed bewilderment as the tale unfolded.You won't be able to put it down!!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck's reflection on the story of Genesis in the Bible is both intricate and reflective. The story serves to illustrate common themes and issues embedded within the family structure and society as well. He is also able to make a point about the existence of free will in each individual's destiny.One of the aspects that make this book quintessentially American is the diversity of the characters' qualities, both good and bad. Lee is perhaps the most uniquely complex figure in the story-he is not only a role model and parental-type figure for both the Trask boys and Abra, but deeply philosophical about man's existence in life, and the struggles he faces. Lee really is the force that keeps the Trask family afloat when the strains of life hit several members, namely Adam. He is able to single-handedly pull Adam out of his disillusionment with Cathy. Lee is so poignant to the novel because he reaches others at a level that most fail to reach, and he helps Adam begin life anew with his two sons. Cathy represents one of the darkest and malicious characters in literature, and is seemingly at the opposite spectrum of Lee-she represents destructiveness, cruelty, thoughtlessness, and cynicism. Cathy (later Kate) is not only hurtful to others around her, but there are times when she literally shuns goodness when it is in close proximity to her. Even her physical condition, in which she hates to be around light, is representative of her sinister mentality about the world and her rejection of benevolence. Samuel Hamilton is depicted as a great man, a go-getter who captures the attention of his listeners because of his stories and his great vision for invention. Samuel is seemingly underappreciated by most in the novel with the exception of Lee and Adam, who cherish his knowledge. Samuel's impact on both Lee and Adam come much later in the story and after much reflection on their part.Another compelling aspect of Steinbeck's work is the definition and reflection on the idea of wealth. In many instances, \\"physical\\" wealth means very little. Will Hamilton is a character who believes in the principle of attaining wealth, but is very one-dimensional. Cal first sees wealth as an access to gain favor with his father, but then winds up rejecting this idea, and literally burning the money he had acquired. Kate gains a good deal of money from her brothel business, but it is money that brings neither happiness nor goodness to others. In direct contrast to these characters, Samuel Hamilton and Lee embody a \\"spiritual\\" wealth in the novel. Samuel, for instance, works hard, invents many things, and collect very few material rewards, yet his friendship is the most significant to others. Lee, similarly, is not wealthy, and comes to terms with his role as a giver rather than one who needs to acquire monetary gains. He seems to accept this role, and even rejects the one chance he does have to go to San Francisco and begin a business adventure. Steinbeck's larger message could be that the notion of \\"wealth\\" is more symbolic than physical.Perhaps the most consequential issue explored is that of free will-that we are all in charge of our own destinies despite our blood or our stations in life. This is revealed in Lee's explanation of the phrase \\"thou mayest\\", and the idea of choosing our own destination-good or evil-is illustrated most significantly in the character of Cal Trask-who wavers between choosing good and evil for much of the novel.This is a thoroughly powerful book, perhaps one of the forgotten treasures in literature. Steinbeck is able to draw you in, and although this novel is quite lengthy (over six hundred pages in length), it is a captivating story with complex ideas, characters and symbols."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is the saga of a family and their search for love and acceptance. The themes in this classic John Steinbeck novel are timeless and presented in such a gifted manner that time and place are transcended. The reader is drawn into a story of siblings spanning the generations, fighting to define who they are and what their lives are about. The harm that is done to them in their quest feels staggering and the fathers draw your ire for their failure to just love their sons. The repetition of mistakes on the next generation of sons is heartbreaking.The characters are full and rich as befits a classic novel. There are strong and weak aspects to each of them. In some, the evil pervades their soul, if they have one,and one can understand the question, \\"Are there some people that are just born soulless.......??\\"This is a novel to be reread many times. It is complex, and to reach into it's depths could be daunting if you only read it once. What appears to be the central thought at one age will be completely overtaken by a different reflection after a subsequent reading."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Recently I reviewed on Amazon.com the film East of Eden with James Dean and Jo Van Fleet, mentioning that the movie was little more than a few chapters at the end of John Steinbeck's great novel. The performances by Dean and Van Fleet, who won the academy award for her work, were superb, but the book is much much better than the film for several reasons.One of these reasons is a great story. Some readers may shy away from the classics thinking they may be long on art and short on an entertaining plot. In the case of East of Eden, these readers would be wrong. From the opening pages we are drawn into the lives of two families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons. Steinbeck's mother was a Hamilton and Steinbeck enters the story toward the end to give his account of his family and their relationship with the Trasks in Salinas, California. We follow the lives of three generations of Hamiltons and Trasks as they struggle to find meaning and purpose for living. The biblical story of Cain and Abel is the foundation on which the novel is built and the rivalry of Cal and Aron Trask (the Cain and Abel of the Bible) for their father Adam's love is one lynchpin of the novel. Unlike the Bible, Cal does not kill Aron directly, but may be said to be responsible for his death. Anytime Cal, the James Dean character in the film, is involved with the plot, the story moves quickly forward and is genuinely entertaining.The same can be said of Cathy Trask, Adam's estranged wife, who becomes Kate, the madam of a whorehouse. Cathy is a perfect example of the bad seed. From her childhood where she kills her parents in a fire to her suicide at the end of the story, she does no good thing and evil follows here wherever she goes. Like Satan in Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost, she is the most interesting character in the novel, even though her portrayal is, for the most part, one dimensional. We wait impatiently for each of her entrances in the story to see what bad business she will initiate. Her encounters with her son Cal, both in the book and in the film, are highlights for the reader and viewer.One more character worth noting is Lee, the Chinese servant of the Trask family. Lee is always the voice of reason and goodness. He is at the center of the discussions that form the heart of the novel; that is, that we are allowed by God to choose the direction and purpose of our life. The novel ends with Adam saying from his death bed, \\"Timshel,\\" that is, \\"thou mayest.\\" The glory of being human is freedom of choice. We are neither predestined nor commanded, but allowed to decide our own way.East of Eden is a great American novel, not perfect by any means, but ambitious in its size and scope and incomparably better than almost all the best sellers that sit on top of the New York Times top ten list, at least in my opinion. Readers who are interested in a story of families trying to find some meaning and purpose in life are sure to be genuinely entertained by the Hamiltons and Trasks as they struggle to survive in the land East of Eden."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Of all his novels, Steinbeck seems to pour the power of his immense skills into this one. It's as if he needs to prove to himself that he is worthy of all the accolades heaped upon him. Yet there is an ingredient that seems to be missing in this work when laid beside his many other achievements. In Grapes Of Wrath and Of Mice And Men, Steinbeck never labored, never faltered as the characters and story lines developed into crescendoes of drama and excitement. In East Of Eden, the characters are developed slowly, deliberately; the pace is tempered to accomodate the author's labored struggle to go beyond his talent and yet, the reader is treated to a third demension, beyond character, beyond story, to that of the author who seems to be saying...&quot;I will not rest until I have given you my best.&quot; Steinbeck proves to us he is afterall, only human; but only after he gives us this super human effort. While East Of Eden may not have been his best novel, it was by far his best work."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I enjoyed East of Eden immensely. Not only was it a very entertaining read, it was also very enriching. Like a previous reviewer mentioned, it is beneficial for the reader to be knowledgeable about the Bible (specifically the book of Genesis) prior to reading this book. It is the type of book that, after finishing it, will make you just sit and reflect. It offers a lot of insight on human nature, focusing on the potential for good and evil in everyone.The struggle between good and evil is the dominant theme in this book. Steinbeck talks of the choice that everyone has to be either good (represented by the character Adam) or evil (represented by Cathy). The cast of characters is one of the best developed and most interesting I have ever encountered in a novel. All the characters have a purpose and bring the story to life. I highly recommend this book. You will not regret reading it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"i've been trying to figure out why i liked this book so much. i was expecting to find it long and dull.When the first chapter was entirely narration, without a single peice of dialouge or plot, i almost put the book down then and there (actually, there isnt any dialouge until the bottom of page 24). However, i actually found myself enjoying even the long discriptions of scenery that i usually skim or skip entirely.The plot was fast, but somehow the book kept the feeling that it was slowly plodding along. It almost has the feeling of reading a history textbook. for some reason, however, i was completely intrigued, and had trouble putting it down for long.Actually, to talk about the book's \\"plot\\" is a bit of a stretch, because the focus of the book is entirely off of action. Many key events happen \\"offstage\\" (to use theater terms), and some are only implied. Steinbeck focuses on motivations, and the characters thoughts and emotions, rather than the actions themselves.everything i usually i love about a novel, this novel didnt have, and this novel had alot i usually hate in a novel, and yet i still found myself enjoying it immensely. i guess thats y its a classic."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK!

You won't regret getting this book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A classic, yes. A great story, yes. A philosophic treatise, perhaps. Above all, a well written novel in the tradition of great literature.This is a book that I had to read over and over, and that still made me think with the tenth reading. Some of the book is biographical, the story of Steinbeck's Irish Presbyterian family especially his grandfather's move into the Valley around Salinas and his struggle to raise a family on the marginal land available when he arrived.The fictional characters are the story, and the land is the story, and they are done masterfully. Is he trying to tell a story, yes of course he is. Is there an underlying theme, there is, and it is obvious. Does he have a moral viewpoint? he sure does, and this book is trying to sell it. Is there a compelling, well written story around them to tie it all together, you bet!Adam Trask, his brother Charles, Adam's son Aron, and his brother Cal. As everyone points out, the A's and C's. The story 'as old as man', the story of Cain and Able, of competition, rejection and revenge, first through Abel's eyes, then through Cain's. And there's enough explicit dialog to insure that you see that.That story is impossible to tell without support, and an outsider. Support through Lee, the Chinese-American cook/philosopher looking for his own history. The outsider, Sam Hamilton (Steinbeck's grandfather), poor where Adam is rich, rich in 'soul' where Adam is poor.All this brought together by a strong narrative written by a man attempting to write his masterpiece. He accomplished his goal. And when the world wouldn't see it, he quit writing fiction. It's a shame."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is one book that I picked up to read over my vacation at the beach. I finished it before we even got to the beach. I knew I liked Steinbeck, but I had never heard of this one before (unlike The Grapes Of Wrath, Of Mice And Men, etc.) Boy, am I glad I picked it up! At the part where Adam Trask goes to his wife's whorehouse to finally face her, and comes out triumphant, I had to stop reading and let out a shout of victory. This book also made me cry, laugh, get angry and sad. It's one of the few books I have read that has made me feel so many different emotions. To any of you who have read the book already, Timshel."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book contains the most lyrical descriptions of the equisite agony of youth I have ever read.

From the minute I started reading it, I had a hard time putting it down. Steinbeck manages to keep you hanging throughout the entire book. The characters are so incredibly real. I am just hoping I can find another book that leaves such an impression."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is awesome. no comparison whatsoeve"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Forced to read this, well, hefty book for my English class, I began reading it with a bias. I WAS WRONG!!! This book is awesome! There are deep characters, comic characters, beautifully written passages, universal themes! Although it is not as acclaimed as Grapes of Wrath, this book is much better!!!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Though it took me a few tries to start this book, once I got into it, I could not stop turning the pages. It is a heart felt stroy of two brothers struggling to get along with each other and to fit in with the rest of the world. This soul-gripping heart-holding novel brings truth and shows that all stories may not have a happy or unhappy ending."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I really loved this book. I have gotten &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; twice, but never seemed to be able to finish it. And although &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; was thought provoking, it was certaintly not an epic novel. But this book kept me by it's side till it was finished."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Yes, it took Oprah to get me reading a \\"classic\\". I have always been meaning to, but when she brought back her book club, that was it. I know this book has gotten very mixed reviews over the years, as well as the author himself. It seems you either love Steinbeck or hate him. After reading East of Eden, I love him. I am a big fan of the good vs. evil, so this book was right up my alley. I enjoyed pretty much everything about it. I liked the characters, the suspense, the story and the way it was written (so very easy to read- I didn't have to pull out my dictionary once!). Don't get me wrong, it's not impeccable, but it is a great read. To anyone who is thinking about starting to read \\"classics\\"- this might be a great one to start with!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Another compelling piece of excellence from the great American novelist. I'm glad Oprah added this to her collection on order to get the widespread coverage it deserves. Competing with Mark Twain, aka Samuel Clemens, Steinbeck ranks amongst the all-time best of American authors. Bravo!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"If fiction reading is not your thing, if you are a non-fiction reader like myself, but want to get a flavor of what \\"East of Eden\\" is about, watch the original movie with James Dean as Cal. If the book bores you, the movie will not. This movie came out 1954-55. Dean's portrayal of Cal Trask is powerful and moving. I could identify with his feelings as a young person who desperately wants his father's love and approval, but is not the favorite child, and can never please his father. The role of the stern father is played by Raymond Massey. The TV movie \\"East of Eden\\" with Jane Seymour was good too, and covers more of the book, but I prefer the original movie for obvious reasons (James Dean)."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Oprah got me to read this classic. It is her first pick in the new beginning of her book club. I really liked the book and had a hard time putting it down once I started it. It really made me think about what influences we have on the way a child can end up with the background that Caleb and Aron had. Sad how Cathy was a influence without even raising her boys. Lee was the only good role model and stable enough to keep the family together."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"That's the first sentence of East of Eden, and it only gets better from there. This life-altering novel is much more than a retelling of the Cain and Abel story. It is a masterfully crafted depiction of the human spirit that works its way into your life before you've even realized it. Steinbeck's writing is genuine and simple, uniting plot and philosophy seamlessly throughout the book. I draw so much inspiration from the character of Lee: eloquently honest and observant with others and himself. With a little help from Oprah, East of Eden is no longer such a secret....it would be selfish of me to keep it one."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"What a fun book. Steinbeck creates memorable characters in a sweeping soap opera. If Oprah gets more people to read this one then more power to her. Don't even think about watching the movie instead of reading the novel. The movie leaves out all of the juicy stuff."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck can be a bit heavy-handed at times with metaphor and moral, but this book is a wonderful read. I discovered it as an adolescent 30 years ago, and it still ranks as one of my all-time favorites. I'm delighted that Oprah has introduced it to a new generation! You are going to love this book. It's a can't-put-down page turner."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck surely created a masterpiece here as he explored themes such as love, hate, and knowledge. He wove an intricate web of characters and plots into a beautiful tapestry of american writing.The story follows the interaction of 3 families: the Trasks, Hamitons, and the whorehouse owned by \\"Cathy Trask\\". The Trask family is bound to horribly repeat the story of Cain and Abel over and over again. It teaches us of our most devestating flaws and our most vital goods. This is a must read for any lover of great literature!!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A friend once asked me, \\"Hey do you know any books that I can read over the summer?\\". I said, \\"Well, what kind of book are you looking for?\\".\\"Umm... A book that is very thought provoking. A book that has an exciting storyline. A book with multiple themes. A book that would want you to never stop reading until you finished it. Oh and one more thing. How about a book with a lot of biblical allusions. Biblical allusions always intrigue me.\\"\\"Well my friend,\\" I said to him, \\"I have just the right book for you. Have you heard of the author John Steinbeck?\\"\\"Yes I have. Isn't that the dude who wrote the book The Grapes of Wrath?\\"\\"Yes he is. Well the book I am about to suggest is written by the same author. The book is called East Of Eden. Say...there is a biblical allusion in the title itself.\\"This book indeed is full of biblical allusion such as the story of Cain and Abel. Some of the themes in the book include love, good vs. evil, and morality. Yes, I know this book sounds like a whole bunch of comentary and not much of a plot. But infact, one of the things that makes this book great is the great storyline. I recomend everyone to read this book. Its really fun and educational too."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"->While it is often said that quality is much more important than quantity, there are times in which you can slap the two together to get a surprisingly good result. Such is the case with John Steinbeck's immense novel, East Of Eden. Although famous for his earlier novel Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck considered East of Eden his more important, life-long work for him. \\"I've been practicing for a book for 35 years, and this is it. There is only one book to a man,\\" he said to his publisher when he completed the novel in 1952. Indeed, this novel is a truly a culminative work of Steinbeck's->The story is tragedy, with rays of hope strewn throughout it and a moral lesson behind it. It is about the intertwining destinies of two sets of people in the Salinas Valley: the gregarious and emotionally diverse Hamilton family and the passionate, moody Trask clan. The book centers many of its themes around biblical references, such as the fall of Adam and Eve, and the deadly rivalry between Cain and Able. The importance of individual identity, and the consequences of blind love are also discussed.->The book is a example of great story telling. Steinbeck had a natural flow of language that the reader can relate to and uses practical, to-the-point diction to easily communicate his story. The progress of the Trask family's development from zealous and impulsive into contemplative and vigilant is fascinating to watch. Steinbeck makes you either love his characters or loathe them, depending on whom he's talking about. There's something about his writing that compels you to read on to the next chapter to learn what new tragedy or jubilance will afflict the character next. It is simply a book that you won't put down; that is, until you realize how much time has gone by.->As with many long novels, the vastness of the plot is sometimes too much to handle, and is the book's main weakness. The plot is inherently hard to follow at times, because switching back and forth between the two families proves to be challenge. And with the huge number of characters involved over the span of three generations, keeping track of who's who is no easy task. The book often goes into tangent-like sub stories from time to time about non-significant characters, and the author's purpose of doing so is not always apparent.->Technicalities of length aside, Steinbeck here has truly written a classic with undying themes and a compelling, tragic story. If you ever have a fair chunk of time you can dedicate to serious reading, pick up a copy of East of Eden."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It's a shame that Oprah chose this of all Steinbeck's novels to resuscitate her book club. 'East of Eden' is, in my opinion, Steinbeck's worst.This was Steinbeck's bid to enter the lofty realms of the 'serious' author. So it is predictably bleak and angst-ridden, its characters constantly mired in futility and frustration.How different from the far sunnier (and more distinctive) novels, 'Tortilla Flat' and 'Cannery Row' and 'Sweet Thursday' -- any of which would have been a more agreeable choice.....This is as close as Steinbeck comes to one of those potboiler sagas that just seem to go on and on and on, grinding through decade upon decade, and generation upon generation.Pick anything else by Steinbeck.Anything."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I bought the book for a class and I was very thankful for the quick delivery."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"the last two words of this book change the world for me, and they changed the world for these characters.Don't know what they mean? find out!its necessary to understand them, without them we aren't free.

There were several stories going on at one time, but it wasn't confusing...it was like following a saga of two different families. Very intriguing!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"While reading this book, I often wished I could call up Mr. Steinbeck and discuss it with him. He writes so candidly and sagaciously on human emotion, struggle, and inner purpose. John Steinbeck believed that knowing a man makes it impossible to hate him; this book shows that."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book has been a joy to read and it is one book that is certainly worth reading again. East of Eden will have a permanent spot on my bookshelf - a book that I plan to keep for my young daughter, so she can read it when she's older. It is a timeless classic."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I am NOT - repeat - NOT a reader. But I've just discovered 2 books that knocked my socks off. One fiction; one non-fiction. The non-fiction, Make Every Girl Want You, showed me how women want to be treated; the fiction book, East of Eden, was BETTER than Of Mice & Men & Grapes of Wrath. Although maybe that's because I was FORCED to read the others back in high school! I loved the biblical references throughout this piece of art. It takes place between the Civil War & World War I, & features 2 sets of brothers. I guess I can really relate to this because I have 2 brothers, I we have gone through similar circumstances (although, luckily, in times of peace, not war). Anyway, great read - Kudos to Oprah. I couldn't put it down, & I'm not typically one to read novels!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I don't think words can describe &quot;East of Eden&quot;. I read it three times - once in Russian and twice in English; and it is still mysterious and attractive for me. I hope you will love it as much as I did."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I admit I am only 1/3 of the way through this book, but I have been so impressed with the depth of the writing, the color of the language and the art in play. While Steinbeck clearly is painting with broad brush strokes, and presents a simplified and overplayed image of woman as source of destruction/evil, I still find myself drawn in by the story and the substance of the book thus far. A good choice to kick off Oprah's Book Club again, if only to see a promising, flawed, and complex piece of fiction receive a wide audience. Kudos to her for bringing a work like this to the masses."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"When I was in middle school, I read Steinbeck voraciously. I cried at the end of Of Mice And Men to the point of total embarrasement. I blinked hard at The Pearl and wanted a Red Pony. Little did I know, that ten years later I would pick up East of Eden and discover (to my shock!) that Steibeck, though a good story teller, was a terrible writer. Lord knows intelligent people will disagree with me on this one, but I found East of Eden to be trite, oversimplified, and downright silly at about every turn. I'm sorry to say that my Steinbeck days are now officially behind me."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"&quot;East of Eden&quot; appeals to the unthinking reader like few so-called &quot;classics&quot; out there. The characters are either very, very bad or very, very good; everyone talks portentiously; readers are given to understand that Steinbeck means to teach us Important Lessons. But there's really nothing to be learned from Steinbeck's black-and-white world; his novel has no connection to reality as we know it. &quot;East of Eden&quot; belongs in the &quot;must to avoid&quot; category; do yourself a favor and, if you insist on having a basic understanding of this book, wait until your children are reading it in high school and get yourself the Cliff Notes. I promise you won't miss a thing."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"With this calamitous effort, John Steinbeck makes an effort to create an epic masterpiece. Unfortunately, his brushstrokes grow too large, and the panorama that results has too broad a scope. The book loses its focus in its ramblings, and, consequently, its significance. In the early pages you'll meet some characters who are possibly the most irritating, two dimensional elements in any work of fiction since The Scarlet Letter. However, this doesn't matter because Stienbeck will dump most of these characters in no time. Most of the characters live on farms except for the whores and the others. I personally don't live on a farm and am feeling somewhat depressed about it. Now look at that last section(From In the early pages to depressed about it.). It went absolutely nowhere. If you can find some way to stretch that little bit to the length of East of Eden then you'll have your very own masterpiece."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I was surprised that this book was written by Steinbeck. For high school, I had to read this book during the summer and I had to put it down in the first few chapters. It didn't seem real and Cathy (the main women character) is so cold and evil. It is a dark novel that will make you cringe and throw up-well that's how I felt. The novel shows the worst in people through the characters."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"whats all the hype about this voluminous novel that says absolutely nothing. It was hard reading--too many characters--two many families-and -insignificant families ,as well , to the plot. It was a waste of my precious time.Is it because it is Steinback's work that this material got praised. No fair-the book was not worthy. The message was scanty if their even was a message or plot. The writing itself was not worth mentioning . An outstanding author he is not (in my opinion). No more Steinback for me."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Personally, I liked the movie better. Jane Seymour was brilliant!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"In spite of all the good reviews raving about this masterpiece, I don't like it and I'm not going to struggle with it anymore.

Quite simply, this is the single most over-rated novel in the canon of American literature. Let's face it; all of Steinbeck's novels are actually pretty bad. It's a miracle that he won any literary awards, let alone the Nobel Prize for Literature. The fact that Steinbeck's work so easily lends itself to animation (see the Warner Bros. cartoons inspired by &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;), gives you a hint of the complexity of Steinbeck's characterizations. Unfortunately, &quot;East of Eden&quot; lacks the excitement or interest to make a good cartoon. A must to avoid."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"a story of familya story of mena story of boysa story of betrayl and redemptiona story of enlightenment"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Why is this a bad choice for anyone looking for lesiure reading? First, it is incredibly long, around 600 pages if I remember correct. Second, it is very difficult to follow due to the number of characters involved and number of plots going on. Third, and most importantly, it is incredibly boring. This book is completely uninteresting and turning the pages becomes more of chore than a pleasure.If memory serves, this book was to be Steinbeck's crowning jewel. Thus, it comes off as contrived and, as with all things overly planned, too complex."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I've always wondered why Grapes of Wrath got the Pulitzer Prize and more general acclaim, because East of Eden moved me more. Sure, they both bear many trademarks of great literature--timeless themes, universal characters yet detailed descriptions, intellectually challenging yet emotionally resonant, and so forth--but really, is the story of a family that migrates any grander than the story of a family that mostly stays in the same place?To summarize this tome is beyond my skill, and I believe its relevance is so widespread that I'll only point out a few types of readers for whom East of Eden would NOT apply: anyone who's always gotten along perfectly with their parents and siblings; anyone who's always had perfect romantic relationships; anyone who's always understood perfectly what they want to do with their lives. But unless you fit those criteria, buy it, and buy it now."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This was recommended to me by a friend because she thought I would enjoy the California scenery and history. This book totally exceeded my expectations. Steinbeck is an amazing story-teller. This novel is woven in such a complex, precise manner, with no excess details, that I marvel at his writing prowess. There is a reason it is a classic. I was bummed to come to the end of the book and I will definitely read more by this author. Why don't more modern writers write books of this quality? After reading this book, I feel like a lot of the more modern fiction I have read kind of sucks. In other words, this book is incredible and others should read it, especially people who intend to become professional fiction writers."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is among Steinbeck's best novels, and it is usually ranked among his top three or four, but not quite as good as \\"Grapes of Wrath.\\" I have read most of his works including the present, which is a must read for Steinbeck fans. It has excellent prose and good drama but the story becomes a bit predictable for the last 100 pages of the 600 pages. That is the primary difference in terms of literary merit or being a good read. It is a pre-World war I novel set in northern California, and it is set partly in a small town and partly in a rural settings. The story is about family interactions, especially parent child relations, and uses three generations of characters from two families. There is less politics than in some of his other novels.John Steinbeck (1902 - 1968) was among the best known American writers of the 20th century. He won the 1962 Nobel Prize for literature. His 1939 Pulitzer Prize winning novel, \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" has over ten million copies in print.Steinbeck was born in rural California, went to Stanford, and spent most of his life in California. He has been associated with the plight of farm workers and others. His books have been very popular and many were made into movies and stage productions. He won an Academy Award nomination for best story in 1944.I have read a number of his novels and am still surprised with the quality of his work - especially his short stories and short novels. The present work is a longer novel, 600 pages, which covers three generations of two families split between Connecticut and the Salinas area of northern California. It is a long and descriptive story but not as descriptive or as intricate as \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\" That Pulitzer novel tends to spiral down emotionally. Here in \\"East of Eden\\" we have a few peaks and valleys and a number of emotional hooks. Steinbeck manages to work in some clever literary ideas and names by using references to biblical passages. The characters are interesting. However, because of the similarity in the families, generation to generation, the story becomes a bit predictable towards the end, more predictable than his other works, and many readers will be able to guess the end by page 500 or 530.This is a good book and it has good characters including the mother Cathy, and it has a number of interesting secondary characters. Also, the subplots, the overall structure, and the prose are good.It is not a heavy read and takes a few evenings to read. The middle part of the book is very compelling, almost a page turner. I liked the book and recommend it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This one slowed me down on reading Steinbeck. It was long and slow moving. It was overly philosophical. All the characters in this novel are philosophers. The movie was better than the book - the good actors covered the difficult plot. But there is no one to cover the poor reader. I finished it because I like Steinbeck. He lost it on this one in my opinion. He tried to say too much and consequently he made me sleepy. It was somewhat reminiscent of Gun Smoke - big tall character who are very wise and very deep. Hard to swallow.Richard Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\""},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I found this book to be fairly enjoyable and full of beautiful gems. I wrote down pages of quotes that I thought were worthy of being remembered. I reveled in many of Steinbeck's descriptions and elaborations. However, I do understand how many people could find this book obvious and simple.To me it was an inspirational read much in the same way that the Bible can be moving. I took much value away from reading this novel because I began to look at it as an example of good and evil. A simplistic illustration that allowed the writer to voice his thoughts about life. This did not necessarily create a great turning point in literature, but I believe it did what it was intended to do; make the reader reflect.I was not left with an overpowering thirst to run out and add this book to my collection but neither did I regret the time I had spent reading it. I would definitely recommend this book because I believe it is worth pushing through the boring parts to have the entire work to look back at and ponder. After all, over 100 of us had comments to share about it.\\"Perhaps the best conversationalist in the world is the man who helps others to talk.\\""},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is my favorite book. Steinbeck brilliantly combines the biblical myth of genesis 4 and a story of two boys from the not so distant past to recreate the story of cain and abel in much more detail, depicting their struggles and fears, temptations and realizations, and seamlessly integrating them into the greatest book i have ever read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"requires your full attention! some oarts are a little dry but it's a must read before you die."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read this book about 25 years ago, and remembered loving it.

I gleaned more from it now that I am 50, but I still enjoyed it at 25!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Any book 600 pages long is going to be with you for a while. I have found that long after I finished reading the book, I was thinking about the statements made in this novel. I love the description of the town of Salinas' reaction to WWI (Part 4 of the novel)...so eerily mirrors our sentiments to the War on Terror. There is so much material to discuss in this novel particularly on inheritance both monitarily and in our genes...what traits are inherited from our families. I wish I had a Steinbeck in my family that could write a memoir of our ancestors. Awesome book!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a great book for anyone who has time to spare.

If willing to invest a little bit more time in one book, it is well worth it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book was very, very good from beginning to end. I especially liked John Steinbeck's conflictedness over whether human nature is good or evil. I won't go into the resolution and conclusion that Steinbeck comes to throughout the course of the book because it would ruin the climax for future readers. My advice to readers would be to approach this book with a mind ready to decode profound meanings. This way, the reader and the work will have the relationship that both deserve."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Long before Oprah and her book club, I was a kid in school and ran out of books to read. My Mom had the whole collection and I grumbled at the plain dictionary-type covers. Little did I know that I was about to read a collection of the most magical author I've ever known. East of Eden is something that you can only experience yourself. It's my favourite out of all Steinbeck's novels (and there isn't one bad Steinbeck book that's not good). I recommend this to you, your family, your friends, your children. I think everyone should read this book once in their lifetime."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's work deserves the attention it receives. In the masterpiece \\"East of Eden\\", the reader looks deep into the human soul to see tragedy over two generations of a family. With a story that parallels Cain and Abel from the Bible, readers may have familiarity with the general theme. However, the final story takes a more modern twist.Even in his childhood, Adam Trask is simple. He is dominated by a military minded father and an intimidating brother. Motherless since his birth, he learns many of life's lessons the hard way. After returning from a tour of duty in the military forced by his father, destiny literally comes to Adam's front door. After being badly beaten by a client, Katherine crawls to his front porch for help. Having inherited money from his father, Adam takes in Katherine and cares for her despite his brother Charles's objection. Katherine and Adam eventually marry and move to California. When they arrive, Katherine becomes pregnant. After giving birth, she leaves her husband and newborns to start a brothel. This leaves Adam alone and devestated again.The twins are a reflection of their father and his brother. Cal is rough around the edges much like Charles. Aron is soft much like his father. With their mother absent physically and their father emotionally vacant, the boys are raised by their father's Asian housekeeper Lee. As they grow, the boys are unaware of their mother's career. Cal learns first. When he tells Aron who has returned from college, Aron is so devestated that he joins the military to fight in World War II. In effect, Aron loses his will to live. When Aron is killed in action, the boys' father has a stroke. Cal takes the burden of his brother's death and his father's stroke on himself in much the same way his brother and father accepted various burdens. Had he not told Aron about their mother, Cal feels that Aron would have never joined the military. As a result, the burden of guilt and sin lives in another generation.While the book runs off track at times, the story and its human interactions are fascinating. I remain undisappointed by any work by John Steinbeck. Certainly, this is among his best works."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Desire is at the threshhold but you can master it. When the cards have been stacked against you can still manage to sweep the pot. Steinbeck's craftsmanship is only exceeded by his ability to find the nut of the issue and crack it wide open for all of us to partake of it's nutty fruit. His best."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This wonderful book by Steinbeck gives a panoramic history of the Salinas Valley which the author uses as a microcosm of America as a whole. The story outlines the lives of two families in the valley. They are The Trask and Hamilton families. This book would probably fit in the genre of historical romance, but it's much more than that. Steinbeck delves into the differences between good and evil. The plot and storyline are much more sweeping than some of Steinbeck's other books. The timeline of the book is from the American Civil War to World War I, and it covers the entire United States. Steinbeck does a pretty good job with his characterizations. His best character in the book is Cathy Ames (Adam Trask's wife). She appears so innocent to people that she encounters, but this faade hides true evil. The book is fairly long, but quite readable."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck, John. East of Eden. Canada: Viking, 1952. 602 pages.East of Eden is one of Steinbeck's greatest works of literature. It is a book about the good and evil of the world and how the human race has the freedom of choice between the two. The story takes place from the end of the civil war to the end of World War 1. The setting ranges from a small Connecticut town to the Salinas valley in California. One of the most interesting things about this book is the author incorporates his on family history into the story line and characters. East of Eden has a straight forward theme on the fact that \\" All novels, all poetry, are built on the never-ending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me (the author) that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.\\" This is one of my most favorite books to date, and I highly recommend it too anyone who enjoys Steinbeck books or is new to him."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Hard to get in to but then it get's interesting and then get's slow.I read it becouse it was Oprah's book club pick was I dissapointed no.Overall the novel is emotional and a epic a masterpiece.You'll never read another book like this.It's hard to read but trust me it's fullfilling in the end."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The prose sparkles and the characters mesmerize in John Steinbeck's masterpiece \\"East of Eden.\\" The main character's name is Adam Trask. He has several conflicts with his brother and his life is quite rough. The book also brings in the author's family, and features much wisdom about life. The only reason not to read this book would be the fact that prostitution does play a major role in it, so younger children might not be able to handle it. Still, all in all, an excellent book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I enjoyed reading the book but I after reading it I felt as though the book had no point. There was no story or direction in the book. After finishing it, I didn't have any thoughts on life or feel as though I was entertained. There was so much action in the beginning but the storyline seemed to stall in the middle and come to no real conclusion. The book is missing something."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I must say that I'm truly in awe of John Steinbeck's uncanny ability to write such a masterful novel with so many intracies and fill six hundred pages with an engaging story without wasted words.I know that the story is not supposed to be completely realistic, and it should have some mythical quality to it; however, the huge flaw with this book is the long and abundant philosophical dialogue. The characters bring up abstract ideas by the dozens, and sometimes it is way too much for one novel.One minor flaw is the exaggeration of a few personalities, such as Sam Hamilton. He is exalted by the narrator in such a way that I grew tired of reading about his endless quirks and subtleties page after page.The rest of the book makes up for these flaws, but not entirely. Many of the relationships are gripping and interesting, especially between Charles and Adam, and Cal and Aron, two pairs of brothers from different generations.Kate is the mythical character, acting like a serpent in the garden of Eden - she is probably the best and most interesting part of this book.Characters Lee and Sam Hamilton should have been played down. In the later pages of the book, John Steinbeck seems more concerned about surprising the reader with annoyingly unexpected philosophies on life instead of subtly driving in the themes of the story.I also wish that the story of Cain and Able were not directly mentioned and stated by the characters. We the readers should be allowed to discover or see the metaphors ourselves. East of Eden became a less interesting metaphor as soon as Lee and Sam suggested naming two twin boys Cain and Abel.Best line of the book: \\"Am I supposed to look after my brother?\\""},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It is surprising that so many people seem to love this book. I found it drifted from place to place and ended up feeling like a bad soap opera. The layers of analogy and metaphor wash over you as you go through it. Probably a good beach book but if you have other things you are interested in they will likely be more satisfying."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I am only 1/4 through the book and have already noticed a very obvious misspelling and periods where there should be commas, etc. I think the editor should've done a little more homework. I know it shouldn't bother me, but it does. Call me crazy......"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I was very delighted by my book: there were no torn pages, no marks, it was like a brand new book!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This review is on the classic \\"East of Eden.\\" I rate this book 5 star although I did not enjoy reading it. I appreciated it only at the end because the story is well thought out and written, but the story itself depressed me."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Just finished reading this book. I think it would have been much better if Steinbeck kept to one story-line of Adam and Cathy and their sons. Chapters were written about the Hamilton and Steinbeck families which I felt had no relation to the story at all (you could skip those chapters and still understand the book). Also, I felt the dialogue between the characters during the last third of the book to have been trite and wooden, and was just filling the pages rather than saying anything really meaningful.If Steinbeck had kept this to one main story-line rather than digressing with stories of other families, he would have written a faster-paced, SHORTER, and more interesting novel."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is by far my favorite Steinbeck novel. This is, in my opinion, one of the finest pieces of American literature. I enjoyed every word. I read it over and over again to enjoy Steinbeck's world."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Simply put, this book is a masterpiece and is my all-time favorite book. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Amazing. Six hundred pages of amazement. This novel is a page turner and will keep you occupied. With an equal distribution of suspenseful plot and biblical allusions, John Steinbeck adds a twist to the well known Cain and Abel story, creating two generations of brothers who endure all, injury, betrayal, isolation, curiosity, faithfulness, appreciation, doubt, and deceit.This story begins with Charles and Adam Trask who are brothers who constantly bicker for their father's attention. When Cyrus, their father, publicly favors Adam over Charles, Charles becomes consumed by his jealousy and goes so far as an attempted murder. After this incident, Charles and Adam are not the same towards each other again; however, isolation and much time apart have partially repaired this broken brotherly bond. One day Adam meets Cathy, a beautiful yet weak girl, who he nurtures and eventually marries. Cathy and Adam have twins, Cal and Aron who are representations of Cain and Abel. Similar to the process that their father went through, Cal and Aron also bicker for Adam's attention. Since Aron is liked more by others and seems to have a bright future (his incredible knowledge that will land in college), Cal wonders why he cannot be like Aron, and so he begins finding answers by searching for his runaway mother, Cathy. When Cal learns about Cathy's real character, he wonders if a part of her is within him and if it is causing all the pain and darkness he feels. He wants to find himself and discover who he really is instead of whom people think he is.Based off of popular biblical stories, this novel is incredibly well written, yet easy enough to read without a dictionary handy. Despite its length, this novel is not drawn out and the events occur fast enough to forget about its length."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A biblical parallel to the stories of Cain and Abel and the Original Sin, East of Eden is written by John Steinbeck in the 1950s. Steinbeck beautifully captures the social and economic atmospheres of the late 19th to early 20th centuries, and gives an honest depiction of man's struggle in a society. There was no fluff or buffer as Steinbeck presents only the very truth in this novel. From Adam Trask's generation to that of his sons', they all faced the challenge of surpassing their inner fears and jealousy. This constant struggle truthfully conveys an ever-existing problem that remains unsolved today.Once I look past its daunting appearance (a whopping 762 pages!), this book is definitely a page-turner with its complex plotlines and dynamic characters. While there is a distinct climax (Cal, enraged and jealous when his father rejects Cal's gift of $15,000, takes out his anger on Aron by telling him about their mother's life as a prostitute and takes him to see Cathy at her brothel), the rest of the eventful novel retains a high interest level throughout with constant twists and turns.Steinbeck also introduces the interpretation of the ultimate message of the story, centering on the Hebrew word \\"timshel.\\" When Samuel Hamilton reads one translation of the story, the story seems slanted, but as Lee finally reveals through his investigations, the word is not a command, but rather a choice \\"thou mayest.\\" The original sin was the choice of humans, but Cain, and now Cal, can choose for themselves to overcome the inherent evil within them by taking a stand. They will never be perfect, but from now on, they can seek what they know is right.This novel is a pleasant surprise as compared to other Steinbeck's novels I have read - most of all however, is that it has worn off my mentality that John Steinbeck = dull. East of Eden is anything but dull."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"If you do not have much time over the next couple days, DON'T read this book. Not only will it eat away your life, but also you will be distracted by whatever you need to do. Rather, wait until you have a nice week or so to spare. The book's masterful and entrancing writing had me awake in the wee hours of morning, unwilling to stop reading the story's beautiful progression.Successfully paralleling the novels' tale of two families to the Biblical story of Cain and Abel, John Steinbeck intertwines the aspects of the allusion to reflect the actions of the pairs of brothers in the story. Furthermore, he even corresponds the first letter of the brothers' name to be C(ain) and A(bel), with C jealous of A.Each character is imbued with a collage of complexity and struggles. Adam Trask is overly trusting and inability to see people as they really are while his brother Charles Trask fails to attract the approval their father. Adam's twin sons, the next set of boys, subsequently have their troubles too. Aron suffers with moral sensibility, whereas Cal strains like Charles to find the acceptance of his father. Complementing these composite brothers are Cathy, Adam's malicious, yet pretty wife, Lee, the helpful Chinese assistant, and Samuel Hamilton, Adam's poor unfortunate, but kind neighbor in the Salinas Valley who aids him throughout the novel.Steinbeck's style is plainly awesome. The captivating style entices all. Its eloquence mimics the Biblical allusion wonderfully. The contrasting characters bring layers of intricacy to the story. Each is supplemented by the question of an innate destiny and how much they truly are affected by it.In conclusion, for your life to be complete, you must have read this book. The book is essentially the epitome of literature, the apex of novels, the zenith of stories. If you have some spare change, go out and add this masterpiece to your collection. It definitely is worth every half-a-penny."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book could not have been written in 1952. It is too sexy, too vibrant, too....awesome, but it was, and you should read it and add it to your top ten collection of best books ever."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I hadn't read any Steinbeck since high school and I didn't remember liking him all that much. But East of Eden was highly recommended to me so I decided to give it a go.I have to say I liked it. I then watched the movie and boy, was that a lot different. But I liked it too in its own way.The story is really a timeless one and essentially a retelling of Cain and Abel times two. And if you don't have a knack for the Biblical symbolism, well Steinbeck screams it at you every chance he gets ( I think Cal actually says, \\"Am I my brother's keeper\\"). I was worried about how it would end but I thought it did so very well."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"While this book is a little rough around the edges (I believe this was Steinbeck's intent and therefore part of its beauty), it delivers with amazing insights into theology, human nature and psychology. Steinbeck writes in such a way that you find yourself not just reading a story but experiencing the events as if you were there witnessing them. This book drew me in from the beginning and satisfied at every turn. It is a wonderful look at the nature of God and humanity from an unorthodox perspective. Very enlightening and rewarding."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck delivered another great America novel with one of his masterpiece, East of Eden. When I first picked up the book from the shelf of Borders, I was a little intimidated with the thickness of the book because long lengthen books tend to contain a lot of rambling and eventually I would loose interest. But because of the positive feedbacks I heard about the book, I decided to give it a read. The book was simply amazing and I'm glad that the length of the book didn't intimidate me as much.Steinbeck begins the book with the setting of Salinas Valley, California. With the beautifully written description of the valley, Steinbeck introduces the start of the Trask family and the innately malevolence woman Cathy. The sympathetic Adam Trask takes in the ferociously beaten girl, Cathy, after he finds her on their doorstep during a rainy night. After taking care of Cathy's injuries, Adam finds himself madly in love with the girl. Cathy has extreme physical beauty, but the nature of her immorality is at hidden. Adam marries the girl and soon Cathy gave birth to twin boys- Aron and Cal. The young couple moves onto a plantation next to the Hamiltons. Then Cathy shoots Adam by the shoulder and flees from the city. Torn by Cathy's love, the confused and deprived Adam raises the twins with the help from his Asian helper, Lee.Steinbeck then shifts the focus of the story to the Hamilton family. Samuel Hamilton, the man of the house, alludes to Steinbeck's grandfather. He describes Samuel to be a highly respected character with a brilliant mind. Through out the story, Samuel Hamilton becomes a great inspiration to Adam Trask. But when Adam takes Samuel's idea and starts the cargo business, the Trask family fells into poverty.In the middle of the book, Steinbeck begins to unravel the mystery of Cathy. He starts this with her sons Cal and Aron. It is inevitable for the sons to not question about their \`deceased' mother. But the words escapes and Cal finds his mother in the brothel of a city not too far from Salina Valley. After Adam learns the location of his wife, he travels to the city in search of her. Adam learns the abusive history of Cathy and the reasons to her beating on that raining night when they first met. Later she poisons the owner, Faye and takes over the place under an infamous title. Knowing that his sentimental brother will be crushed to know he has been lied to, Cal tries the best to keep the secret. But one night when their father chose Aron's gift over Cal's money, jealousy overwhelms Cal and the secret flees as well. After Aron learns about the truth, he immediately enlists in the Army claming that he has no emotions left to care.There're more to the story after Aron goes to war. The book is enriched with plots, emotions, conflicts, and descriptive insights. I simply love Steinbeck's creative story line and the highly sophisticated way he played with the adjectives. The story is allusion to the Book of Genesis especially Chapter 4 of the story Cain and Abel. Steinbeck managed to obtain many of biblical references to the story without giving obvious ending to the book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who simple is looking for a good read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's East of Eden covers two families interwoven histories from the American Civil War to WWI. Most of the characters and events represent Biblical characters and events pretty overtly. One Biblical and philosophical theme constantly grappled with is the eternal question of good and evil. Steinbeck's answer to whether humans are destined to a life of good or evil is with a Hebrew word in the Bible: Timshel!, literally translating to 'thou mayest.' While the characters appear to be inherently good or bad, they are not that simple. As Steinbeck attempts to prove, humans dictate their actions.At times East of Eden is jumpy and a mumble jumble of references and tangents. Yet Steinbeck's ability to cover the behemoth topic with pretty direct writing is impressive, and more than makes up for the wild tangential passages. After reading a brief synopsis of Steinbeck's personal biography, I see much of Steinbeck and his family comes alive in the characters. Steinbeck succeeded in covering an immense range of issues loosely following his own family history, and still maintaining his central thesis. Even though the first hundred pages are slow, I recommend this book, even to those with a lay knowledge of Genesis. Keep pressing through and enjoy Steinbeck's enlightening work and imaginative characters."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I had read this book and thorougly enjoyed it so I sent it to my grandson who is 21 who basically is not really a \\"reader\\". His reaction to the story was worth everything to me. He now wants me to send him more classics which in itself is a miracle. So more Steinbeck and now Faulkner, Williams and whatever I can think of."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have never felt the need to review a book before, but I just finished reading East of Eden for the second time. I read quickly, but this time I read slowly and savored every page. As a long-time resident of Monterey County, I am touched by the poetic descriptions of places locals take for granted. The Salinas River which runs underground in summer made a dry river bed into a lyrical image that I have never lost. The beauty of the conversations between Samuel Hamilton and Lee, the sadness of the anecdotal stories that claim only a page or two, and the history of the area combine with the larger story seamlessly. Steinbeck didn't just write -- he conjured full-blown images that stay with me long after I put the book down."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I loved this book! Since other reviewers already made comments with which I agree, I won't go into details. If you like your books to have meaning and importance in them, this book is for you!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Amazing American literature.

Its hard to totally understand but the words are invisible and on the pages are people and places you can easily visit.

It's a long book, but it is well worth the time. Fantastic!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"'East of Eden' shows yet again what a master John Steinbeck was. This manages to mix his usual poetic styling with a story of utmost cruelty, sadness and pathos that you are left profoundly moved and affected. This novel doesn't flow quite as easily as 'Grapes of Wrath' and has more asides to comment on the story and points being raised, but this made for a more in-depth experience and one that leaves you thinking about the themes to a greater degree. The introduction is very good, but be aware it has many spoilers and is best read after you've read the novel through, I didn't do this and some aspects of the story were slightly ruined as a result. Steinbeck has the power to draw you into the novel and make you delight at his turn of phrase and the emotions he evokes within you. You feel yourself despairing with certain characters and smarting at the injustices portrayed, as well as a whole host of other emotions, the mark of a great novel. This wont leave you feeling especially upbeat, but it will leave you profoundly moved and different from when you started it and I don't know about you but I cherish and respect that in any book. Snap it up and immerse yourself in the world of this book. HIGHLY recommended.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is a positively wonderful book.

It's a great story about the struggle between good and evil in all of us. One of my favorites."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Oh Steinbeck. You and your accessible classics laden with allegory!This novel is an American classic in every sense that it can be: It's a going-out-west story. A family story. A foraging off the land story. A story of fortune. Of dreams and thwarted dreams. Of what makes a man (or woman) who they are.Steinbeck \\"himself\\" narrates the story--though from a still-omnipotent perspective--giving a unique tie into the story and also increasing the feeling that (though we know their innermost thoughts and motivations) we are merely observing the characters. We are all players in the Great American Drama of our lives.Steinbeck smacks the reader a little hard with the allegory stick--it's heavy handed and its explanations feel inorganic compared to the rest of the story--but the characters are so finely drawn that we forgive him. The players are in themselves flawed and good (or flawed and flawed), with depth--tragedy and fortune carefully portioned.Through the novel, we get the sense that our lives will repeat on a loop; the scenery will change. The players will change. The times will change. But there will always be the same kind of people in the world playing out the same acts of their lives. Perhaps this makes the Cain and Abel biblical allusions (heavy handed!) not so far-fetched after all."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read this as a teen, but didn't appreciate the power and beauty of \\"East of Eden\\" then. It is Steinbeck's best work! I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"And I am gearing up and reread it. I happened upon the movie and fell in love with James Dean. So, then I found the book at the local library. I couldn't put it down. There was so much more than the movie offered!

It's a good study on good versus evil and how people have a choice to be good (or evil). Don't read it just because Oprah said to. Read it because it's a great classic and a great read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is without a doubt the BEST book I have ever read. Even if you are not a fan of classic American lit you will love this book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I recently reread East of Eden. The first time I read it, I thought it was powerful, the second specatcularly powerful. The timeless issues in this book, Cain v. Abel, father and children, knowledge and its pursuit, and of course the concept of pursuing one's own destiny reverberate through each chapter. Whether dealing with Charles and Adam, Lee, Kathy, Caleb and Aron or Samuel and the Hamiltons, the book raises so many questions worth pondering and discussing. I would add this is one of the great book club books. Anybody with a love of thought should read this."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a book I could hardly put down. I love the way Steinbeck weaves the characters together. It was an excellent book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A fantastic story about people, psychology, places, american culture and history. I read it first time 40 years ago and I'm even more moved today."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"At 600 pages, East of Eden is a serious commitment but one that is well worth the effort. It beautifully captures life in America from the Civil War to the end of WWI while creating page-turning excitement thanks in large part to the terrifying machinations of its villain Cathy Ames, possibly the most insidious figure in all literature. (And I mean that.) It is an incredibly ambitious, meandering, sweeping, disorganized and totally mesmerizing experience. It is far from perfect. The allusions to the story of Cain and Abel started to border on tiresome, and some generous editing would have been welcome. But that doesn't take a way from the book's hypnotic power and the magic of its finely portrayed characters. I felt that I knew Samuel Hamilton and the servant Lee, like they were sitting in my living room. Character development is the book's greatest strength, along with the dream-like descriptions of the Salinas Valley. Just beautiful."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Loved the second time as much as the first. What a great writer. Grapes of Wrath is another great Steinbeck read. Everyone should read his works."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This has been a classic I have missed over the years. Thankfully I have the maturity to grasp the issues of the &#34;bad seed&#34; , &#34;duality of man&#34; and &#34;thou mayest&#34; for the learned evil and or sins of man. This is truely a fascinating novel with issues that still plaque us. How the heck did Steinbeck put this together?"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Great character development! Wonderful discussion about why man has the ability to choose a life of good vs evil. It's obvious why it's considered a classic"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a beautiful but brutal story of sibling rivalry, parent-child relationships, and the inherent good and evil in each one of us. The novel spans three generations of the Trask family, beginning with the amoral patriarch Cyrus, who invents himself as a heroic soldier but is actually a thieving failure in the army. His two sons--Charles and Adam--recreate the story of Cain and Abel. Charles is smart and bitter over his father's obvious preference for Adam. Adam is naive and unimpressed by his father's affections. Adam marries the beautiful but sociopathic prostitute Cathy, who sleeps with Charles on their wedding night and shoots Adam after bearing twins. The twins--Cal and Aron--recreate the story of Charles and Adam in a pathetic and depressing historical retread.The overall theme of this tale is that each person has good and evil within them, and must consciously choose the moral path. Steinbeck rejects the idea that a person is inherently good or evil and has no control over his destiny. Even the evil Cathy ultimately recognizes her immorality, and seems to regret having no love in her life.I found the characters dealing with Cathy to be the most interesting. Cathy and Lee were the most finely developed character in the novel for me. Though Cathy is primarily \\"evil\\" and Lee is primarily \\"good\\", both characters contained complexities and contradictions more finely tuned than those that were present in, for example, Adam Trask and Samuel Hamilton.I can't help but compare this epic novel to Steinbeck's other opus, The Grapes of Wrath. I enjoyed the Grapes of Wrath more, because the characters were more multi-dimensional and the story more fluid. Here the characters seemed like symbols more than actual people--pawns in Steinbeck's obvious allegory. Nevertheless, this novel is worth your time to read. It contains beautiful prose and thought-provoking ideas. This highly ambitious novel succeeds on many levels, and is a pleasure to read and ponder."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"These book is one of the greatest clasics you can come across. It is a serene insight in relationship on man-women and brotherhood issues. Though is not very crystal on answering the question why the main character is so sentimentaly naive and as such against all odds, but still the situation, the consequences of it are colorfuly depicted. It's a book how Good can survive against the Evil but still it gets the shorter end of it. There is no ideal or divine realization that good will win overall. Being truly and naivly good doesn't mean that you will be awerded for it and that a true love can win at the end. It can be farse to itself."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I first read East of Eden as a freshman in college. To be frank, ABC was premiering their miniseries, and I wanted to have some knowledge base before it started. To say that I am not a fan of Steinbeck is a severe understatement. Whenever we were required to read one of his novels in high school, I truly wanted to cry every time. I went to a very small college in Wisconsin, and the library only had one copy of the book that had not been checked out in a loooong time. I brought it back to my dorm room with the idea that if nothing else, I could use it to aid with my insomnia. By the end of the first paragraph I was hooked!! To say that it was a difficult read puts it mildly. It really does have the power to strip pieces of your heart away as you take the journey with Cal. It's also one of those books that you know that when you finish, you will not come back to it for a long time. You can't. The emotions are just that powerful. I watched the mini series afterwards, and was pleased at how true they tried to stay to the basic essence of the book. I'm glad Oprah's brought this beauty back into the light for everyone to enjoy. But, be prepared for the bruises that your emotions will take along the novels journey."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden by John Steinbeck captivated my interest, leaving me spellbound during many incidents. However, I sometimes felt like a fish trying to catch a bait that was put before me and snatched away just when I wanted to take a big bite. That is, I could almost never guess the outcome. The characters often seemed to switch positions from being the good guy to the bad guy, and perhaps that is the way of temptation, luring a good person into doing evil things. Adam should have remained pure,Cathy should have had more decency but was a &quot;wolf in sheep's clothing,&quot; and Charles, though presented at first as an icon of everything that was good, all to soon does an about face being lured by his ego and loose women. The characters battle against each other and the strong forces of nature to transform resistant land of the Salinas Valley in California to a garden of splendor, all in a backdrop of the Civil War years. Steinbeck splendidly uses his mastery of language and genuis at depicting one-of-a-kind characters to create a tale of love/hate, good/evil, trust/deception, poverty/wealth cleverly intertwined so that a second guess turns into a soured truth with a hole in it. I highly recommend the reading of this book with its unpredictability, even though the reader may feel manipulated and deceived, just as the characters often were."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I was a little apprehensive to start reading this 602 page long novel, but after the first 40 pages or so, I really got into it and couldn't put it down. The characters are well thought out and have distinct, unique personalities that make the reader feel as if he or she knows them. To get the full meaning of East of Eden, I read Spark Notes after every chapter. Doing this helped me understand the relationship between Cain and Abel, and Charles and Aron. The only complaint I had with this book was that it seemed to end quickly. It seemed a little predictable and put a damper on the wonderfully written 550 preceding pages. However, East of Eden is my favorite novel written by Steinbeck, and I will definitely read it again."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The Story written by John Steinback reaches into new depths of exploring a persona of identity. Resembling the tale of Cain & Abel, the conflicting forces of good and evil wage war with the dream of Eden. The power of goodness prevails, the mystic background of those who can or cannot be trusted, are all included in this all-out deep thinking novel. This novel stresses the such points on frienship, bitterness, dealing with decit, persistence to achieve, and a twisted romance leading to disaster.For those who will enjoy reading a fast pace, deep thinking, adventure, romance, this book is worth the reading and worth the time. The con of this novel, is the amount of page reading to do, not unless you like long page books, or the difficulty or understanding level. Overall though, this book is a classic that cannot be ignored and a book for almost everyone."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden cannot be looked upon as strictly good versus evil, as it appears with Adam and Cathy. To the reader, Adam appears to be the extreme \\"good\\" while Cathy appears to be the extreme \\"evil\\". Taken from a different perspective, can Cathy be seen as \\"evil\\" when she does not view herself as being \\"evil\\"? Is Adam \\"good\\" or merely human? Without analyzing the complexities of the language, the story will appear to be solely good vs. evil. Without the mindset that the characters are either good or either evil, the characters are more believable and realistic despite some of the extremes of good and evil such as Cathy's apparent lack of all the good that people can have.East of Eden also parallels the fall of Adam and Eve and the rivalry of Cain and Abel. The parallel to the fall of Adam and Eve is quite subtle and not as easily apparent as the rivalry of Cain and Abel. For example Charles and Adam, and Caleb and Aron represent the Cain and Abel pair. Although the parallels do exist and even have recurrences throughout the novel, Steinbeck does not make it the main point of the novel. The use of these biblical parallels serves as a backdrop to the story.Ultimately Steinbeck shows that people have a choice over good and evil having the choice to be good or to be evil. As an example from the novel, Cal (Caleb) recognizes that he is evil yet chooses to attempt to lead a good life as portrayed through Aron, his twin brother."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book opens up with the most persuasive commercial I've ever encountered - it's a commercial for California. And it stays on such a standard for the rest of its great length. It encompasses so many of the struggles, feelings, and victories that \\"the man's man\\" feels, and that the rest of us can feel too. This book is so human. We find ourselves wanting more than anything for Adam Trask to be stronger, for Charles to do something good, not for goodness' sake but for his own. We want Samuel Hamilton to come over to the Trask house again. We want to go there and live in all of this.Then, as Cal and Aron grow up and distinguish themselves from one another, we find their most distant of moments our saddest, their laughter becomes ours, and near the end (which I won't spoil) we want so much for Adam, Cal, and Aron to have more time to spend together. When I finish this book the next time around I'll have to give my brother a call. or maybe just go home for a week to spend time with him. Great book. Great book.Even for the reader who remains separate from the characters, East of Eden is a story about the most intriguing of human actions. The reason I say this book is so human is because of the characters. They make the action, of which there is plenty, not the other way around. It is not a boring book - Steinbeck filled it with plenty of interesting and complex characters who all refuse to be spectators and show themselves instead to be agents of goodwill, love, hate, evil, jealousy, ambition, and embrace."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is one novel I read when I want to appreciate the mastery of the writing as well as the pleasure of the story itself. Steinbeck sure has a way with words! The story itself is almost the stuff of soap operas - two brothers and a woman one of them marries, twin children abandoned by their mother (the aforementioned woman) who becomes a madam, and a wonderful Chinese character who is never quite what he seems. But what a wonderful story it is!The characters are very well drawn, and Cathy is one of the best evil characters to fill the pages of a novel in a long time. There are of course the parralels to Cain and Abel, but that was a fairly simple story, and this one certainly isn't! A truly great read and one I highly recommend."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is my all-time favorite book. It is the old story of Cain and Abel with a few twists--most of which you don't see coming. The characters are well drawn and thoroughly believable. This is a gotta read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"As the title implies, East of Eden by John Steinbeck contains a plethora of biblical allusions. These allusions primarily stem from the first book of the bible Genesis as references range from Adam and Eve to Cain and Abel, even sometimes quoting the passages directly. The many parallels add interest to the novel as the reader is able to see the interesting interpretations presented by Steinbeck.While this book does maintain a great tie to the Bible, knowledge of the Bible is not required for one to enjoy this novel. Steinbeck's masterful intertwining plots along with his thought provoking style are engaging, creating a desire to continue reading. His writing is not immensely difficult to read, yet was dense in incite. East of Eden causes one to question aspects of one's own character, leaving an everlasting impression on one's way of life. East of Eden was truly a pleasure to read. ..."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is my all-time favorite book from my all-time favorite author. I read the first 175 pages towards the end of the eighth grade before giving it up for several months. This year, as a freshman, I read the rest of it and was blown away. It is a beautifully crafted piece about family, love, and human fate. It retells the story of the fall of Adam and Eve and the rivalry of Cain and Able in a way that shows the relevance of the story in todays time and the dangers of making your children live as you want them rather than as what they are. The Grapes of Wrath got more praise because of its' social applications but I feel that this is Steinbeck's finest novel.Timshel!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I hadn't read John Steinbeck since high school but returned to him a year or so ago when our book group read his novel \\"The Winter of our Discontent.\\" Following that, I read several other Steinbeck novels and recently had the good luck to read \\"East of Eden.\\" It is admirable that Oprah Winfrey used this large, complex novel to present to her audience.Steinbeck wrote \\"East of Eden\\" in a burst of energy over several months in 1951. He loved this book among all his works and, literally, put himself into it. The first-person narrator of the story is, indeed, Steinbeck himself speaking in his own voice as a grandson of Samuel Hamilton, born in Ireland and a hero of this novel.Steinbeck said that he wrote \\"East of Eden\\" to tell \\"the story of my country and the story of me\\" to his two young sons in order to demonstrate \\"the greatest story of all -- the story of good and evil, of strength and weakness, of love and hate, of beauty and ugliness, how these doubles are inseparable.\\" For all its melodrama, length, sometimes black-and-white characterizations, and preachiness, the novel achieves its goals. I was transfixed by the book, couldn't put it down, and read it in a short time.The story includes the \\"doubles\\" to which Steinbeck refers as well as some others. The book is the story of two families, the Hamiltons and the Trasks. It is the story of two Trask brothers, Adam and Charles, and of the two twin sons of Adam Trask and his wife Cathy -- Aron and Caleb. Both Adam and Charles and Aron and Caleb replicate in their own ways the Bible story of Cain and Abel. Steinbeck gives this story a full, rabinnical exegisis as the reader sees the story of the conflict between good and evil play out in double over the course of the book.The Trask family and the Hamilton family are settlers in the Salinas Valley in Northern California. \\"East of Eden\\" develops a finse sense of place, and when I finished bhe book I felt I knew an area and its history that I have only in the most superficial manner seen myself. Samuel Hamilton, Steinbeck's granfather, figures prominently in this book for his wisdom, his stoicism, his inventiveness, and his other - worldliness. His wife, Lisa, is also portrayed lovingly.Perhaps the most memorable character of the book is Cathy Trask who becomes \\"Kate\\" after she leaves Adam Trask and returns to the profession of prostitution in which she was engaged before her marriage. Steinbeck calls her a \\"monster\\" and well he might. The protrayal is striking and even nuanced at the end for all the starkness.Lee, a Chinese servant, is also well-portrayed for his fine mind, wisdom, tact, love of learning, and, ultimately, devotion to the Trasks and understanding of himself.This is a sweeping, dramatically told story which captures the land, the good and evil of which people are capable, and the importance of what in the Cain and Abel story is described by the Hebrews word \\"Timshel\\" with which Steinbeck concludes his novel. People have the capacity for both good and evil and the power for choice -- to understand the good and reject the evil. The story is told in a humanistic rather than a theological way.\\"East of Eden\\" is a memorable work of American literature that, as a result in part of Oprah Winfrey and her edition of the book, is receiving the attention it deserves."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have to admit that I read this book because of the warm praises it received and how it touched so many lives. And...I have to agree.The book plays with the ultimate struggle with good and evil. Cathy, symbolizing Satan, looks for the evil in each person and tries to draw it out and exploit it. Steinbeck says, \\"And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.\\" Cathy has to continue to change. She changes her name and story constantly. After the murder of her parents and the shooting of her husband, she changes to Kate and becomes a prostitute in a whorehouse. This is the story of evil. Satan can always conceive new and creative ways to lure people to him and yet the evil always dies and is forgotten. On the other hand, virtue is remembered and honored from generation to generation. Samuel's teachings and philosophies are often relied on long after his death. Lee incorporates Samuel's teachings into his upraising of the Trask twins. Therefore, good always conquers in the end as it does in East of Eden. Cathy begins to realize reluctantly near the end of her life that the evil on which she thrived caused her downfall. She had trained herself never to trust anyone and in the end Cathy even began to doubt herself.The most obvious case of an internal struggle between good and evil is present in Cal, whom I feel I strongly relate too. As a child, he is aware that his light-haired brother is favored over him by nearly everyone. When Cal finally confronts his mother, he believes that Adam loves Aron more because he looks like Cathy. Cal's peers are scared of him and he has no friends. The first young girl that that twins meet is won by Aron. Cal often feels that he has no choice in his evil actions. He believes that his mother's blood that runs through his veins causes him to be bad. Most of Cal's evil actions are merely because of his desire for love and acceptance. \\"...everyone in the world to a large or small extent has felt rejection...and there is the story of mankind.\\" Cal has felt this rejection throughout his entire life. He knows that Abra favors Aron so he tricks the young girl to try to win her love. But underneath Cal's harsh appearance, is an earnest desire to live a good life. He has a genuine love for Aron and a desire to protect his weaker sibling. \\"In uncertainty I am certain that underneath their topmost layers of frailty men want to be good and want to be loved. Indeed, most of their vices are attempted short cuts to love.\\" In Cal, one can see the entire story of mankind unfold-the search for love, the feeling of rejection and hopelessness, and finally the acceptance of one's individuality. Steinbeck successfully created a story that will endure for generations because of its truth and honesty of the story of mankind and our constant battle between good and evil."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read this book back in November (2002) and was quit surprised when Oprah picked this masterpiece as the book that brought her club back... Even without Oprah's backing this is probably one of the GREATEST books I've ever read. You can't put the thing DOWN!In this story, which is loosly based on the book of Genesis insident between two brothers at war(Cain & Able), John Steinbeck gives a brutal examination of almost every nook and kranny of human nature: sex, love, betrayal, hypocrisy, greed, jealuosy, etc... and successfully weaves these elements into a heart wrenching tear-jerking story you'll always remember.This book is one of Steinbeck's most powerful novels since the Grapes of Wrath, and it's realism is POWERFUL enough to invoke a number of EMOTIONS in all of it readers. Buy it. You can't go wrong."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"What I want to know first is why, until now, no one had told me to read this book. If I could break the 5-star rule and give this book a 9-star rating, I would. It is currently, through the rose-colored glasses of my own perception and taste, the best book I have ever read. Steinbeck is my new favorite writer.For books of this caliber, it seems a waste to relate the story in some kind of abridged synopsis. When one says a book recently read was good, people tend to ask the question, \\"What's it about?\\" The better question for a book like this might be \\"What makes it good?\\" The first question forces the reader to relate the storyline like a plot-spoiling movie trailer. The second encourages the reader to explain why the story is worth reading while preserving the integrity of the book. After all, the purpose of the book is just that--to relate the story.I believe that good books entertain you, better books teach you, but great books inspire you. This book does all three. It is an ornate and cogent poem of a novel--relational, affecting, captivating. Every other sentence is profound. Steinbeck wastes no words. There is no filler--though the book is 600 pages--and not once did I feel as though I were working to get through it. The writing is absorbing and the content stirring, heart and mind.For the first time in a long career of novel consumption, I did not binge on this book. It was so spectacular that I forced myself to moderate how much I read in a sitting. This is a filet mignon of a novel. Read it. Savor it. Tell someone else to do the same."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"When i first read &quot;East of Eden&quot; back in 1986 I remember my teacher telling the class that we had 3 weeks to read the book and have a book report ready to discuss during week 4. Then the teacher handed out the books and the class started making noises, ie...moan, no, oh. The book was as fat as the phone book and look/sounded &quot;B&quot; boring.I began reading East of Eden the following day. I remember it was Friday night and I had just finished watching tv and wanted to start reading this boring book to see what non-sense I was in for. The first chapter grabbed me and wouldn't let go. The story is very realistic and has great character development. I'm not going to talk about the story because there is too much to talk about, but it plays on a lot of emotions and it will make you use your imagination, much like you/we did when we were children.Thanks John...You will always be remembered for this great classic novel.P.S. some literary boneheads/stuffy people ( you know who you are) disliked this story, but for those of us who like jam on our toast (not dry) you will like it.....Daniel"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden was originally published in 1952, and the setting for the novel is the late 19th and early 20th century. I still enjoyed reading East of Eden though, because there are timeless themes presented in this book. Sibling rivalry, guilt, and betrayal are some of the main themes in this book. It was ironic and interesting to read how 2 sets of brothers from different generations compete for the approval and love of their father.There are many memorable characters with strong personalities in East of Eden. I loved the complex character of Cathy. She is a whore who shoots her husband and abandons her family. This incident leaves her husband Adam shattered and confused in the beginning of the story. I loved how Adam becomes a stronger person and a better father later in the book. I loved the supporting character named Lee in this novel. He is a loyal servant to the patriarch Adam Trask. He is also the primary caretaker to Adam Trask's sons Caleb and Aron.I loved reading about the development of the characters especially the twins Caleb and Aron. Caleb is the curious, brave, independent, strong willed sibling who has dark thoughts. His brother Aron is the sensitive, studious one. The contrast between their personalities is very interesting. The most intense part of the book is when Caleb learns of the existence of his mother and confronts her.East of Eden becomes a very predictable book about a third of the way in, but it is still a wonderfully written book. I simply loved the evolution of the characters especially Adam. East of Eden has themes of sibling rivalry, guilt, betrayal, loss, and the American dream of getting ahead and raising a family that are still relevant in society today. I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I chose to read this book for my high school's required reading. It was a great decision.Though this book goes slowly (took me a week to read), it doesn't feel slow. Steinbeck's lavish descriptions of the lush California transport me there.But this book isn't meant to revolve around the plot. The characters drive the plot, not the other way around. I agree that the many of the characters are hard to relate to, but I can understand them. From the most evil character, Cathy, to nice guy Sam Hamilton, I could see why they chose to commit each action. The youngest characters in the book, Abra, Aron, and Cal, are easier to relate to by teenagers such as myself.Though this book was written half a century ago, the themes are timeless. There is the battle between good and evil, which encompasses sub themes like jealousy.Overall, this is a book that's worth your time."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"When I read this book, it launched me on a personal goal to read all of his novels. I have completed almost all of them and anticipate re-reading them all over again!He has personally inspired me to appreciate the beautiful lands of California's Salinas Valley and Monterey. The history of the valley and coast is widely recognized because of the stories and novels by Mr. Steinbeck. He publicized their unique problems in a literary format widely received and applauded at the time. It is obvious that by the endorsement of Oprah's book club, his writings are as fresh and pertinent as ever._East of Eden_ is a powerful novel spanning generations and focusing on two brothers, Adam and Charles. As profiled in the editorial review, the family dynamics becomes incredibly complicated. This complication is the facilitator of future difficulties and the impetus of a great story you should not miss.His novels struck a chord in many people, myself included. Each one of his books propelled me forward to read another, and another. It is worth stating that one of my happiest days ever was to re-visit Cannery Row and explore the places he wrote about."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I've crossed another classic off of my \\"to read\\" list, and boy am I happy I read this one. This was pure satisfaction from start to finish. John Steinbeck's East of Eden is an amazing book that embodies the intersection of literary weightiness and readability. There are plenty of epics out there that span generations: Colleen McCullough's The Thorn Birds or Isabel Allende's The House of the Spirits, for example. Those books are a joy to read and you can luxuriate in the authors' virtuosity as characters are added to weaving storylines, but East of Eden seemed to have more weight to it. Unlike many epics, which to thrive on love, unrequited or forbidden, Steinbeck's book focuses on the struggles of brothers seeking their father's admirmation. From the title alone, it is obvious that this notion is Biblical, and the book's Biblical quality becomes its center. For the first time in a very long time, I did not rush through the book's last chapters, eager to get to my next conquest. I felt that pang that you sometimes get when you finish a truly magnificent book, the pang that is part sadness at the experience of reading the book being over and part a feeling of that book permanently lodging itself in your memory to be drawn from and remembered with reverence. There are, I think, very few books that can produce this sublime reading experience, but East of Eden is on that short list."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck has managed to carry a biblical idea into the future, taking everyday characters and bringing them to life with ancient tradition while allowing his readers to see the commoness of man through both good and evil doings.Not only is this book biblical in theory but it is biblical in proportion as well at 600 pages it is a testament to Steinbeck that he was able to sustain his idea for such a lengthy saga. I read the book voraciously and finished it within two weeks, a first for someone conducting a busy life. I will be forever haunted by the impressive characters I came to know so intimately in the pages of \\"East of Eden\\". Steinbeck mastered the art of transferring biblical characters into believable modern life, Adam and Eve, Moses, Cain and Abel etc... Steinbeck convinced me that all people hold within themselves a choice between good and evil and he further instilled in me the fact that I have a choice (timshel) to embark on whatever journey my soul so wishes. I once believed that evil stemmed from abuse or neglect but I am better able to realize now that evil sometimes is just inborn. Steinbeck's words make you question your own choices and prepare you to some extent for the outcome of those choices. Although a choice may seem easy today its repercussions can destroy you tomorrow.I am amazed how this novel can actually apply to the modern day accusations about American life as well. I highlighted one paragraph and will refer to it often when I am finding that I have become spoiled by this American way of life, \\"Lee went on, \`That's why I include myself. We all have that heritage, no matter what old land our fathers left. All colors and blends of Americans have somewhat the same tendencies. It's a breed-selected out by accident. And so we're overbrave and overfearful-we're kind and cruel as children. We're overfriendly and at the same time frightened of strangers. We boast and are impressed. We're oversentimental and realistic. We are mundane and materialistic-and do you know of any other nation that acts for ideals? We eat too much. We have no taste, no sense of proportion. We throw our energy about like waste. In the old lands they say of us that we go from barbarism to decadence without intervening culture. Can it be that our critics have not the key or the language of our culture? That's what we are, Cal-all of us. You aren't very different\\" (Pg. 570). As I search for connection in the world, not just as an American, but also as a human this paragraph says it all. We are a wasteful, ambitious and free nation that tends to exaggerate our excess and ignore our contribution to other nations in this world out of habit and a sense of security. These luxuries are something we have a choice to share or misrepresent. I can only pray that the novel of our lives ends with as much compassion and insight as did Steinbeck's, \\"East of Eden\\"."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I hadn't read this book in years and years, so I just picked it up again recently. I have to admit, I didn't enjoy it as much the second time around. And it is not as good as &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; or &quot;Of Mice and Men.&quot; Still, even though it is not Steinbeck's best, it is better than most books I have read in my life (were this by any other author, it probably would have gotten five stars). I thought the story was captivating, and I didn't want to stop reading. I just loved the characters, even though they are a bit one-dimensional. The book often alludes to the Bible, but don't worry about missing the hidden themes, Steinbeck lays them all out in the open. If I have one major complaint, it would be that the ending lacked drama. Other than that, this is Steinbeck at his near best."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I've read books by Steinbeck before this one. Actually, now that I think about, I read a quite a lot by him. But none of them hit me like &quot;East of Eden.&quot; I think he was truly at his best when he decided to write &quot;East of Eden.&quot; The characters are fascinating, and the way he seems to tie several different sub-plots together is absolutely amazing. His other books like &quot;The Pearl&quot; or &quot;Of Mice and Men,&quot; showed that he was a good author. But &quot;East of Eden&quot; shows that not only is he an extraordinary writer, he has gift for portraying human relationships skillfully. Truly, his use of character interactions is astounding. And each character is wonderfully full and complete, lending a multi-faceted quality to his book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I am a voracious and selective reader and recently decided to read this book as a departure from the contemporary novels I generally read. Steinbeck is a flawless writer! His powerful character sketches especially of Cathy (Kate), and interweaving of the families' complex and profound stories provoke visceral and lasting impressions. Steinbeck is hard to beat, in any era!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"In East of Eden, Steinbeck craftily analyzes and challenges many aspects of human nature. He expressly voices a powerful message in 'Timshel', meaning that people hold the choice over their fate and over their defeats. Steinbeck conveys this idea passionately throughout the book as he represents the story of Cain and Abel between two generations of brothers. East of Eden rejoices in the human spirit and is made to inspire one in time of trial. Since Steinbeck portrays life where one can overcome defeat, he captivates people with the ability to triumph.Through compellingly lifelike characters, he constructs the human spirit and shapes them with infinite shades of darkness and virtue. Characters such as Sam Hamilton, Cathy Ames, and Lee are deployed to depict the free and inventive soul, reclusive guilt, austerity, and the influence of religion and human power. Steinbeck not only employs the characters with superficial features, but investigates these character's souls to communicate a deeper understanding of their nature. East of Eden's portrayal of human phsyche and universal philosophy is magnificently strewn and engrossing."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The bible is possibly one of the oldest and most read book in the world. There have been countless numbers of books based on biblical allusions, and \\"East of Eden\\" by John Steinbeck ranks top among the ones that I have read. The novel is a modernized re-creation of the story of Cain and Abel, two brothers in the Bible. Steinbeck incorporates the themes of this old biblical story to explore the truths of the human soul.The story details the layers of good and evil through the characters and relationships of the families of Adam Trask and Samuel Hamilton. Adam Trask is a man who, blinded by illusions and a lost within himself, travels to California with his beautiful, but insidious, prostitute wife. There he meets Samuel Hamilton, a man poor in money but wealthy in life. The novel chronicles the development and relationships of the two men, their families, and the people surrounding their lives. It is an excellent novel, for Steinbeck effectively integrates his message throughout the book.This is not a carefree, happy novel; rather, it is very dark as it explores the blacker areas of the human soul. Despite the foreboding mood and circumstances of the novel, Steinbeck manages to assert an uplifting message about the strength of human goodness and the perseverance of the human soul. Although the novel is fiction, he magnifies human nature through exaggerated circumstances. We may see a hidden part of ourselves, whether it is deceit on one occasion or jealousy on another, through the characters in the novel. We may also realize that the true message of the novel is indeed a very essential part of our lives. Perhaps this is why I feel that East of Eden is such an exceptional novel: not only does it bravely delve into an exploration of human morality, but it causes us to reflect on our own existence."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Forget the movie. It stinks. read the book instead. This is a wonderful book. I have heard people say that it is all symbolic and metaphorical, and not in the least realistic. That is not true. The background characters, such as Adam and Cathy, are certainly symbolic. I'll concede that. Adam is unable to bear evil, and in a sense, he is good, but he, in his goodness, is cruel to his son Cal by not accepting him for who he is and always comparing him unfavorably to his twin brother Aron. Cathy, who is a person completely lacking a conscience, to the point where she sees nothing wrong with incinerating her parents to steal their money. But she is still attracted to the &quot;good&quot; character of her son Aron, and tries to protect him from Cal. She recognizes that there is something about Aron that is admirable that she doesn't have. What she can't see is that Aron, like his father, can unintentionally be cruel. What Adam and Cathy represent is that good and evil is never complete-- Adam is evil because of his goodness, and even Cathy is not a complete monster. Now to Cal, who in my opinion is the main character. Is his rage realistic? As a twin, I think so. I don't want to kill my sister, but there are times when I wish she were dead. Or at least far away and out of my life. I don't want to be constantly compared to my sister, who gets better grades, who is nicer, who is more religious. I can understand Cal's rage, becuase I share in it. Poeple say they wish they had a twin, to share secrets, to have a best friend always there, etc. What they don't realize is that the bad part comes along with it. You can't get away from this person. You live in the same house, go to the same school, perhaps belong to the smae cicrle of friends. Soon, perhaps when you are about five years old or so, I'm serious, you want some time to be alone. And you can't find it. You want to be your own person, and you can't and you rage against the person who prevents that. You try to acoomplish something on your own. What else do you think Cal is doing when he invests in beans. But his father takes away his pride in that by saying he wasn't fair to the farmers, and again, compares him negatively to his brother. I have not yet had such a problem. But if I did, I know I would be so angry at my sister that I would want to hurt her as badly as I could. cal does that to Aron, when he shatters all of Aron's illusions about their mother, showing him that she is a murderer and the madam of a whorehouse. So don't say a book isn't realistic just becuase it is outside the range of your experience. Maybe it is part of someone else's experience. maybe you just don't understand. What amazes me most, is that Steinbeck, who wasn't a twin himself, understood. The man was a genius. Oh, as a side point, Steinbeck quotes a hebrew word from Genesis. Timshel. That is slightly incorect, as there is no such conjugation of (m,sh,l) The corect version is timshol. A slight difference, but notworthy to any hebrew speaker. It means that you, in the future, will conquer or rule [something] Steinbeck was pretty close."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Well, this particular title has certainly brought about some interest in a number of people. And I thought no one read the classics anymore...After writing my review I began reading the novel again, for at least the fourth time. There is one interesting passage early on dealing with the sanctity of the individual human spirit, and of the author's pledge to defend the individual's right to think freely, to the death if necessary. I found it odd, at first, that this passage was included at the particular point in the story, since the concept of choice and free will was not brought up until quite later. Given the fact that the novel was published at the height of the McCarthy era, however, it does make some sense. John Steinbeck, as it was taught to me, was considered only a minor master in the field of literature, certainly not the equal of Hemingway or Faulkner. I've always disagreed, and I have wondered to where this disparaging attitude among many academics can be traced. Not all of his novels were masterpieces. &quot;In Dubious Battle,&quot; while a great story, often reads like propaganda. Steinbeck fares better with stories such as &quot;Grapes of Wrath,&quot; &quot;East of Eden,&quot; and &quot;The Winter of Our Discontent,&quot; which present to the reader a much more balanced and ultimately more authentic take on human nature. He does, however, show some interesting weaknesses in his portrayal of female characters. Despite his flaws, Steinbeck was a compelling author, and certainly a voice of honesty. As was once stated, he &quot;had no mind to be an unoffending comforter and entertainer...&quot; And that from the Swedish Academy after presenting the author with the Nobel Prize in 1962. Certainly Steinbeck was no lightweight escape novelist."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It was three years ago when I picked up this book for a way to pass the cold winter days in Virginia. Having come from a dysfunctional family, and fearing that I would be doomed to repeat the past of my family and after fearing that my mother would someday awaken within me, this book changed my life and my perspective on life and how I see it. It is the summation of many philoshical viewpoints on God and self-determination all rolled into one story. The story does take a while to pick up, but I am glad that I stuck with it. Anyone who sticks through it and allows Steinbeck to flesh out the meaning of his novel will be pleased with the end-result. It is a great lesson/message for anyone who has had difficult people in their families (who hasn't?)."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is clearly a great novel. There is crime and psychopathology and horror. There is adventure. There is lyricism. It does drag in places where it preaches about deeply old fashioned values and dissects. There is definitley something old fashioned about it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is my all time favorite and I see myself rereading it in the future many more times - there is simply so much to learn from it!The writing is beautiful in its simplicity and meaning. There are various story lines that initially seem unrelated yet converge together like streams into a river. The description of the surroundings is so eloquent and makes you feel like you are right there in California. The plot can essentially be boiled down to good vs. evil. You can read the other reviews for more informative plot synopsis. Essentially you just NEED to get this book, sit back and enjoy."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is one of my favorite works of fiction. It is rich and multi-layered. That the allegory is so obvious does not detract from the story, since it is, in essence, a universal tale of human nature. The Grapes of Wrath (Steinbeck's more famous novel) is more political, while East of Eden is, again, a study of human nature. Between the two, I find East of Eden to be better written. Both have intercallary chapters, but whereas the intercallary chapters in Grapes of Wrath seem like abrupt diversions from the main story, they are better integrated within the immediate world of the characters of interest in East of Eden.I read East of Eden when I was 15 (it was part of my high school curriculum), and I've decided to read it again, at the age of 29. I am certain that I will appreciate facets of the work that escaped me 14 years ago.Anyway, it's a must-read. One of the great works of American literature."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is amazing. I read it in school and I usually hate the books we read but this book is truly amazing.

I've read some of Steinbeck's most celebrated novels and none of them even came close to this one.I have been in the sciences for some years now and have neglected reading novels. I was convinced to pick up this one by a friend who swore on his life that I would never regret reading every single page of this tome. He was definitely right. Despite my impatience and my harsh criticisms of most the novels I read, I found this one to be engrossing due to each character's fantastic description and roles they play in the story. Despite the fact that the copy I had was over 900 pages long, I found myself wishing it had never ended. The book stayed in my mind for weeks after I finished it. I have never had a novel impact me so much in my life and I will never forget it. Everything else I've read since then has just seemed like complete garbage.I look forward to the day when I have a copy on my bookshelf and my future child gets old enough to pull it down and read it. What a reward, what a gem."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It would be impossible not to rank John Steinbeck along with Mark Twain and Faulkner as one of America's greatest writers.

With \\"East of Eden\\" I'm reminded how brilliant his writing is, but also never to let his other books gather too much dust."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"\\"I enjoyed this American classic by Steinbeck - complex story with many characters and stories interwined, in a tale of good and evil literally personified. I found the story a bit overloaded with parallels to the story of Cain and Abel, particularly the naming of various characters, but, overall, a very enjoyable read, making me want to read more Steinbeck."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. Very beautifully written, almost poetic while being gritty, raw and a real page turner. Doubles as a history book of the California valley."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Excerpt from the first page of East of Eden:\\"I remember that the Gabilan Mountains to the east of the valley were light gaymountains full of sun and loveliness and a kind of invitation, so that you wantedto climb into their warm foothills almost as you want to climb into the lap of abeloved mother. They were beckoning mountains with a brown grass love. TheSanta Lucias stood up against the sky to the west and kept the valley from theopen sea, and they were dark and brooding -- unfriendly and dangerous. Ialways found in myself a dread of west and a love of east. Where I ever gotsuch an idea I cannot say, unless it could be that the morning came over thepeaks of the Gabilans and the night drifted back from the ridges of the SantaLucias. It may be that the birth and death of the day had some part in my feelingabout the two ranges of mountains.\\"Oh my goodness, who wouldn't want to keep reading?The sheer beauty of the location is conveyed so incredibly well, along with the harsh reality of the less lush and fertile, but still awe inspiring countryside. The first pages absolutely captivated me, I don't know that I have ever read such beautiful descriptions of a place. I'll be honest, sometimes lengthy descriptive writing bores me a tad, I want plot, a story, I want to know what is going on with the people in a book. Oh, I like vivid descriptions, especially vivid descriptions of something magnificent as much as the next person . . . but don't make those descriptions take pages and pages please. Not so with East Of Eden, I could read John Steinbeck's representation of the Salina's Valley all day long.I don't think there are many coincidences in East of Eden, there seems to be symbolism everywhere, that goes beyond all the C and A names and boys giving unappreciated gifts to their father. I wonder if there is something symbolic in the description of the eastern Gabilan Mountains seeming to be warm and representing the love of a mother, I wonder if they represent Lee the Chinese-American servant and if the dark and dangerous Santa Lucia mountains of the west represent Cathy? This is a book I could read over just to try and find nuances that I am sure are there but I have missed. It is that kind of book, you know you are missing stuff. Well, I'm at least sure that I am missing stuff! That isn't a criticism, it is praise. I think I could dig my teeth into this book again, albeit for different reasons the second time around. I rarely read books again, unless years and years have passed."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Awesome book. i would highly recommend to everyone. Very hard to put down once you start.So if you want a great book to read. You must choose this one. 5 Stars!!!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. A great story concerning the interconnected families of the Hamiltons and the Trasks, over several generations, as they become prominent in the Salinas Valley. As Steinbeck says, this book is about the central issue of good versus evil, and whether we have the ability to choose how to live our lives. It's also about sons and fathers, what blind love can do to you, and how you need to see the world for what it really is. Each character is truely unique and engaging. I could not put this book down, and loved every moment of it. Steinbeck is an amazing author."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I hated Of Mice and Men, The Pearl, and The Red Pony. John Steinbeck didn't seem to grasp that superfluous pessimism is annoying, especially three books of the stuff. The setting in this book, a lethargic farm, was very similar to those I had hated and for about 100 pages I also hated this book. It came as a surprise when I realized I loved it.Despite what many think, the characters are only at first glance one-dimensional. As the story progresses that you realize that things are not as they seem. The supposedly good Aron is ungrateful, the supposedly bad Caleb is repentant. As a matter of fact, I found myself openly rooting for Caleb and hoping he'd make the most out of the story's theme. The book also contains one of the most interesting, and perhaps most evil, female characters in all of literature: Cathy. The first-hand account of her miscreant doings and psychopathic thoughts was quite simply incredible.And I must say that the ending of this book was fantastic. It was both uplifting and powerfully written. I couldn't put the book down, which has happened to me only about ten times. I definitely recommend this book as it is now one of my favorites. It stresses the importance of choice and that, despite the expected outcome, a person is always in possession of it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck has this incredible way of making you feel like you're a part of the families you're reading about; like you're living their lives right along with them, and East of Eden is a particularly great example of that. After 600 pages, I was sad to come to the end."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I first read \\"East of Eden\\" and three other books by Steinbeck when I was in my twenties. I have to admit that, back then, I wasn't taken with the man and his storytelling. I am now about the age that Steinbeck was when he wrote \\"East of Eden.\\" Today I have enough life experiences under my belt to truly appreciate and hear what the man had to say. Today I have fallen in love with Steinbeck.\\"East of Eden\\" has been reviewed to death over the years, so I will limit my comments to a few special notations that I made. As I read \\"East of Eden\\" it struck me that Steinbeck's background as a journalist and his curiosity about human behavior in general molded him into an excellent armchair psychologist. Indeed in East of Eden, Samuel Hamilton recommends William Jame's voluminous \\"The Principles of Psychology\\" to his son Joe. I also wondered if Steinbeck the journalist \\"borrowed\\" from the Lizzie Borden patricide case as he wrote of the methodical premeditation of Cathy's first murders. Aside from the sociopathic Cathy, Steinbeck's characters impressed me as truly beloved by their author. In fact, Steinbeck seems to me a deep lover of humankind with all of its flaws and struggles. Unlike many authors who seem detached or put off by their own characters, Steinbeck reveals himself as forgiving and understanding of his characters' foibles and craziness. I love him for that.Steinbeck summed up this great story best when Lee tells Samuel: \\"And I here make a rule - a great and lasting story is about everyone or it will not last. The strange and foreign is not interesting - only the deeply personal and familiar.\\" Perhaps that is why I needed to compile that large portfolio of life experiences in order to belatedly fall in love with Steinbeck. And that is no doubt why \\"East of Eden\\" will endure as a great and lasting story."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I bought this book as a gift. The friend reading it has termed this to be the \\"FINEST WRITING I HAVE EVER READ\\" and \\" beautifully explained plot, as big as life characterizations\\".This plot is woven around a biblical thread placed in a California setting and will disappoint NO one who reads it!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I recently finished reading this novel and fell in love with the characters, the story itself and the message of both good and evil, as well as the concept of \\"Timshel\\" or \\"Thou Mayest\\".John Steinbeck is without a doubt a superb storyteller. \\"East of Eden\\" has many facets and dimensions within it. Somehow or another Steinbeck is able to write a multi-dimensional story with phenomenal characters and keep the entire novel cohesive from start to finish.I had a difficult to wanting to do anything but read this novel once I started reading it. The writing is fantastic and entertaining... The characters are fabulous and there was always so much going on in this novel that you eagerly want to find out what is going to happen next!This is a must read novel. Steinbeck is such a wonderful writer that I can see why he won the Nobel Prize for Literature!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's classic is a story about every family. It's a story about the first family. In a totally unoffensive nonreligious style his Cain and Able takeoff examines the cyclic nature of humanity. We frequently find ourselves eerily following in the footsteps of our parents. Or find ourselves with the ones most similar to those who have hurt us before. Ultimately, \\"East of Eden\\" gives an example of how to break the mold. Whatever holds us back, whatever our mistakes, Steinbeck shows how it is possible to break the cycle, how we can learn from the past, how the greatest endowment of humanity is choice."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Hard to imagine a greater defining work of the 20th century ... the story is so complex and multilayered, and yet so simple and clear in its narrative. The reader finds a lot to ponder in its pages, and many times I had to put the book down for a moment and merely think about its truth. Like the following:\\"And I feel that I am a man. And I feel that a man is a very important thing -- maybe more important than a star. This is not theology. I have no bent toward the gods. I have a new love for that glittering instrument, the human soul. It is a lovely and unique thing in the universe.\\"The story of Adam Trask, his sons and his good friends -- Samuel Hamilton, the handy-man philosopher; and Lee, the house servant and wise man -- is a parable of how we all struggle between the forces of good and evil, placed in a rough and beautiful American milieu, the Salinas Valley, Steinbeck's Garden of Eden. Adam is caught between hope, conveyed by a strong desire to prosper and transcend, and the deep wound of a dark secret, conveyed by his failed marriage to Kathy, a serpentine soul who dwells in darkness and evil. In this crucible his sons, Caleb and Aron, act out the tragic drama of earthly competition, fratricide and redemption that is the inheritance of the children of Abel and Cain.In this Eden we encounter ourselves in our reckless, restless existence. Over a conversation with Lee, Caleb hears about the wild adventurous nature of Americans, violent and generous, fearful and bold, who \\"go from barbarism to decadence without an intervening culture.\\"And in another, between Lee, Samuel and Adam, the reader faces the core challenge of living: While we are not commanded to be good, neither are we predestined for it. \\"Timshel,\\" Lee quotes from the Fourth Chapter of Genesis, the story of Eden itself. \\"Thou Mayest.\\"Poised between right and wrong, good and evil, life and death, this masterpiece asks, which do we choose?"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"When I bought this book, Steinbeck could not have been further off my radar. I suppose I expected a solid, picaresque novel that was good in a musty \\"literature\\" sort of way. I could not have been more wrong. I don't think that I have ever been punched in the gut more times by a work of art. The mixture of mythology and gritty realism never felt forced, in fact it made the story even more fluid and vicious. It is a wonderfully sad, dark, violent and oddly hopeful chronical of human frailty, loyalty and weakness. It is one of the supreme achievements of the art (all forms, not just literary) of the 20th century. After I read this, I bought everything by Steinbeck that I could get my hands on and buried myself in eleven more of his works before coming up for air."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck's novel is truly a masterpiece as he weaves the stories of two unique American families and exposes the character's deepest, darkest thoughts, particularly those of Cathy and Cal. Each character is carefully constructed and the personalities are told in great detail. The story begins when Steinbeck describes the serene land in the Salinas Valley. I felt mesmerized by the beauty of his language, for he describes things extensively- from appearance to scent. I could imagine the wild flowers in spring and the tiny Victorian houses right before me. From the complexity of the characters to the meticulousness of the setting, this novel is simply beautiful.Even the structure is unique and it is evident that Steinbeck took a lot of time to perfect the order in which his story would be told. In Part 1 of the novel, Steinbeck alternates between the Trask family and the Hamilton family each chapter. The families are on different parts of the country and have no relationship whatsoever. It is not until part 2, where the two families merge in Salinas, California. I found this method very clever because I was able to differentiate the families in their respective environments. It was interesting to read the characters' pasts because it would certainly affect their futures. For example, the fact that Adam Trask's father lied to him as a child accounts for Adam's determination to be a good father for his own children; Cathy's poor childhood and the lack of parental love account for her horrible actions towards her children. As the story progresses, I learned that Adam's tough character is a result of serving in the army. Away from his family, Adam had to be independent and strong- both physically and emotionally.In an attempt to start a new life, Adam bought a piece of farmland from Samuel Hamilton. However, the story immediately turns dark and somber as Cathy, Adam's new wife, abandons her twin boys. Cathy is a dark character and she is the epitome of evil. She is a selfish woman who blames her wrongdoings on other people. Every word Cathy said made me despise her, for this woman neglected her children to run a brothel. Cathy's dialogue in conversations with other characters made me develop only disgust for her. Steinbeck was careful in his writing because after depicting the evil Cathy, he would switch to men of wisdom: Lee and Samuel Hamilton. These characters offered relief from the tense drama occurring by offering peace. Lee and Samuel, firm believers in God, spoke straight from the Bible to convey a sense of goodness. Unlike Cathy, these characters care for the twin boys and are proof that there is still good in the world. Cathy's ruthless nature is passed on to her son Cal, as he struggles to form his own identity. Cal feels trapped between good and evil, until the wise character Lee offers him profound advice. He learns that he is his own person and is not doomed to be evil like his mother. Cal is a human being (whereas his mother is a \\"monster\\") and thus is subject to make mistakes. I developed so many emotions from reading this, such as joy, relief, sadness, pity, and utter disgust. Even though I found some parts to be predictable, I felt that the entire novel was filled with suspense. There was not a single moment that I wanted to stop reading. This novel is so intriguing because it explores the dark side of the human mind, including such concepts such as revenge, sin, and evil."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The novel East of Eden, written by John Steinbeck is an incredible novel that can be easily read and understood by anyone of any age. The simplicity of Steinbeck's writing allows readers to fully comprehend his descriptions and ideas on life's realities. John Steinbeck's use of the Biblical story of Cain and Abel illustrates the imperfection that lies within the realities of life and how that imperfection ultimately gives Man the opportunity to dicate choose the style of life for oneself. As many people might think East of Eden is a boring novel with no excitment, on the contrary, East of Eden is a page turning novel that takes the reader on to the edge with unexpcted twists and turns during the novel's most exciting moments. East of Eden examines how life is never how it is planned. Life will never follow the perfection that is envisioned, but it is through the imperfections in life that Steinbeck reveals that makes it so close to reality, a reality where everyone has flaws and no one is capable of abandoning those flaws."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is the most interesting book I have ever read. Slow paced and somewhat unorganized, yet the book presents powerful and unique characters, making the book even more intriguing. Adam and Charles and Aron and Caleb recreate the old Biblical story of Cain and Abel. Battling between the choice of good or evil, the characters allow themselves to shape their lives. Therefore, Timshel or &iexcl;thou mayest&iexcl;, the power of choice, is the most important underlying theme in this book. The choice helps characters to reflect oneself and to mature by recognizing their own mistakes. Read this book! I strongly recommend it. And learn how to make right choices, which could change your life."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden takes the Biblical story of Cain and Abel and brings it to life with the characters. Analysis of the story reveals the belief in the power of man and choice. Complicated relationships and personal struggles in the characters portay life as it is. East of Eden is a book which discusses human nature.It looks into the hearts and minds of people, revealing both the good and bad that battles within a person.It stresses individuality and the hardships of life as well as the joy that can be found in living.He portrays numerous characters, each unique, developing them and describing the struggles and personality, revealing both strengths and weaknesses,just like any other person. Stuggles such as rejection, longing for love, ignorance, blindness from love, search of identity, shame and guilt, anger, and many more are expanded on and looked into.It brings understanding to the reader of differnt issues and patters in people. The story is well developed and written, containing much thought and insight.It starts with differnt stories but craftily intertwines as the story progessed, developing into a complicated web of relationships and lives. Many connections are made throughout the book, making the book a complete whole with constant substance, bringing it to life.This book contains a lot of useful information and insight that can even be applied to the reader's own life. It may allow greater understanding and personal growth. This book is definitely worth reading. It is by far my favorite book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Throughout East of Eden, John Steinbeck creates characters that are intriguing but pushes their personalities to the extreme ends of the spectrum of good and evil, making them difficult to relate to. Despite this, the characters' interactions and the history that they weave makes a compelling read. The parallel to the Biblical story of Cain and Abel is clear and at times, the familiar struggles of the \\"Cains\\" of the book provoke an empathy that the more angelic characters fail to stimulate. Even the evilest of characters such as Cathy, can be identified with more then the more moral characters, such as Adam, and, without a doubt, make for a more interesting read. Still, despite issues with characterization, the book pulls you into its world of interweaving stories and one quickly gets lost in trying to sort out the intricacies of relationships and human traits. Despite puzzling family history stories that will have you wondering about their exact significance to the rest of the book, the parallel themes of guilt and forgiveness tie the book together from beginning to end."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's East of Eden creates a dramatic story that keeps the readers on the edge of their seats waiting for what might happen next. It talks of human nature in both extremes, good and evil. These extremes are incorporated in his theme of good versus evil. People aren't born as good or evil. Rather, everyone has a choice to become better people or not. This key theme of \\"choice\\" or \\"timshel\\" is carried throughout the book by Lee, the Chinese servant, and Cal, the manipulative child who matures through mistakes.The book is so vivid because John Steinbeck grew up in Salinas Valley. This personal experience adds to the realistic settings he creates. It makes the extremes of human nature more real. The theme of good and evil explains our personal conflicting emotions. In the end, like the characters, we learn that our choices determine our destiny. East of Eden is a great book to learn about human nature and destiny with his realistic imagery."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck thoroughly demonstrates human nature within each character of this novel. Themes such as good vs. evil, hate, jealousy, love, and family relationships are present throughout. Steinbeck successfully retells the Biblical story of Adam and Eve in a modern version set in Salinas California. He also manipulates the story of Cain and Abel through two generations of brotherhood. Although there are allusions to the Bible, the foreshadowing of events is not as predictable as one may think. One suggestion that may increase the understanding of this novel is to read the story of Adam and Eve, and the story of Cain and Abel found in the first book of the Bible: Genesis. All in all, Steinbeck does a spectacular job in accurately referring to the Bible, and using his creativeness to capitvate the reader."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's East of Eden has been one of the most influential readings of my life. Within merely 600 pages, Steinbeck enlightens his readers with the most controversial and enthralling issue of life: its purpose. If you have ever doubted your existence or questioned who or what you are living for, this book will definitely pour you with insight. Contrastingly, if you have never encountered these doubts, this novel will force you to reevaluate your cordial acceptance. Steinbeck oversteps the boundries of traditionality and conservatism and audaciously expresses his unfiltered, most purest thoughts. There is never a dull or meaningless moment in this book. Although the plot of events may appear somewhat unorganized and haphazard, each incident has its unignorable significance within the novel and a single misplace or change of word would desecrate its message. Not only that, Steinbeck is amazing in his character analyzations. Through his detailed and meticulous descriptions, the readers are able to protrude into the character's deepest thoughts and scrutinize it from every single aspect. There is not one character that stands out as the main protaganist; each individual has his own complex personality and mindset and Steinbeck magnificently portrays this complication, inflating his characters into realistic, 3-D human flesh. He also addresses common themes, or rather experiences, that the common reader can relate to. The most developed theme within the book is that of the struggle between good and evil, but he also discusses issues such as a parent's favoritism of one child over another and the disastrous effects that are imposed upon the unpreferred child. We also see frequent themes such as love and rejection, which make the story a very personal experience. All in all, this is a mind-blowing masterpiece, as well as a heart-warming tale, that will leave you breathless and asking for more."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is not just a retelling of the biblical story of Cain and Abel. The story of two generations of brothers and their relationships is ultimately (at least in my interpretation) about human weakness as well as the strength that derives from the power of choice. Of course, there are many other themes that are prevalent throughout the entire novel, such as ancestry, love, jealousy, identity, redemption, and good versus evil.Although the story traces the Trask family from Cyrus's sons, Adam and Charles, to Adam's twins, Cal and Aron, the message of novel culminates in Cal. The offspring of an inauspicious union, it is in Cal that the forces of good and evil battle. However, he does not only represent the fight between good and evil; he also demonstrates the choice that humans have, the choice that makes us human, timshel - \\"thou mayest,\\" and proves that every man's destiny is not a result of what he is born as, but rather what he chooses to be."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I was never an avid reader of the Bible but this classic rendition of the old book's makes me want to sit down and read over the original stories again and again. Steinbeck achieves greatness through his tale of two families whose fates are intertwined and destinies preordained by the Bible itself.Although the chapter organization seemed jumbled as if the chapters were somehow mixed in a strange order,however, the sheer insight emanating from Lee and Samuel Hamilton always made me hungry for more.The lack of character development in Cathy (or Kate) is somewhat frustrating as it lead me to question why she kept reverting back to her previous ways when she's better off leaving them behind but she proves to be critical to the forced development of the weakened Adam Trask and also aids critically in the joining of the Hamiltons and the Trasks.I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It's guaranteed that East of Eden will move you and maybe even change your outlook on life."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck's East of Eden is a book that truly captures humanity in its desires in love and impulses in hatred. Everyone has the choice to choose good over evil. Cal portrays such a life of struggles between being good and being bad, and ultimately, it will be his own choice to give up or triumph. Timshel.Steinbeck also depicts the importance of family. Love is essential, or else it becomes dysfunctional and treacherous. As Adam should have learned, brother will turn on brother for the love of his father. Sibling rivalry adds to the reenactment of Cain and Able.East of Eden really sends a message that hits home at the heart. The character personalities are so real and relatable. It ranges at extreme opposites: from pure ignorance in Aron to profound understanding in Lee, from evil contempt in Cathy to loving care in Samuel. It makes us explore our own standings. East of Eden exhibits great awareness of all humankind and is such a truly captivating and inspiring book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Standing in front of monsterous shelves at Border's, staring at my summer reading list with 600 pages of Steinbeck in my hands, I think: \\"My teacher is trying to kill me.\\" That was two years ago.If I could pin down any one reason or instance that transformed me from the proverbial couch potato to avid reader, this epic novel would be it.Steinbeck's East of Eden is absolutely spacktastuler (yes, so good, I just had to fabricate a word for it). The novel, set in the early 20th century, follows the story of the Trask family. A parallel to the biblical story of Cain and Abel, the conflicts between members of the family in two generations serve to explore the nature of good and evil and mankind's tendencies toward each. Steinbeck is able to envoke deep-seeded, universal questions while stunning the reader with a playful subtleness.Perhaps most defined is the developement of character. The reader cannot help but fall in love (or undying disgust)with each of Steinbeck's masterfully crafted personas.The book is long - 600 pages in four parts - but every bit the worth and more. The ending, not to be spoiled, even served to leave a beading tear in the eye of this hopeless \\"tough guy.\\"Truly a masterpiece of modern times."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is music. Steinbeck gets it, he gets it like no author that I have ever read has gotten it before: this book is the spirit and story and soul of man in roughly 700 pages. In the past few years I've read so much wonderful literature, and nothing has ever struck me so completely with reconciling wisdom over my troubles and my condition like this novel. I don't say that about any other book, and I doubt I ever will.Every honest and open-hearted individual must see himself in Caleb Trask---and Steinbeck is there, always, with the blunt genius of some great wily grandfather, to show us what this means and who it makes us. I will never forget the lessons of this beautiful novel. It can make you so free. When I think about it I still want to weep with a passion to do and make memory. It really is that inspiring.If there was ever anything about this book that I didn't adore from the beginning it was the fact that Adam, Cathy, Caleb, Lee and the rest had to be players: they play parts in a fiction for a message, and the potency of their flaws and characters could not reflect the harsh complexity of, say, Dostoevsy or Tolstoy's people (I suppose this came accross to me so starkly because I had just been reading these Russian authors). What ended up amazing me more and more about the book as I got further was how REAL Steinbeck could make has cast. I'm still not sure how he did it, but I literally feel like I know these men and women. Maybe thats why I want to say that Steinbeck &quot;gets it&quot;: the characters, enacting such a strict and siple fable for an's nature are just SO real. I've never met anyone who's read this novel and doesn't count its people among some of the most real and beautiful characters they've come across in literature. You'll never forget them. No kidding.The second half, by the way, is richer in all of this than the first. The first half is great, but the second half (now that, I suppose, the first half has made you good and ready) is pure gold."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East Of Eden is my favorite book of all time. It is not nearly the best, the most respectable, the most polished or most intellectually compelling, but it is my singular favorite. It reminds me a bit of Chaucer's Cantebury Tales, often enough relying on the bawdy, even the implausible-- or occasionally knowingly dubious science-- to further plot entanglements, but ever weaving hooks of melodramatic delight. Steinbeck writes inside a woman's brain as can very few men. He artfully meanders through different lives and generations, often willfully steeped in bits of caricature as with Adam,Samuel and his wise Chinese friend, frequently surrounds us in contrived circumstances, all by design. How else can we be introduced to Catherine/Kate: the single most deliciously evil bad seed who ultimately emerges as the single most deliciously willful, outrageous,independent and morally indifferent woman of her century, a woman who, in recollections well prior to the film's focus, gives birth to unlikely twins in the most amazing of circumstances.One of those third generational boys is portrayed- in his single most brilliant performance riviting from its opening moments(among only three films in which he ever appeared)- by James Dean as Cal Trask. That film version commences fully two thirds through the book. We watch a young man following an older woman who pretends to be unaware of his presence. That particular slice of drama slowly builds to shocking enlightenments. For me, the other book (of roughly that time) to film leap a single character's brilliant portrayal so effectively is Rostand to Ferrer's Cyrano, but I digress.At first I had difficulty with the author's opening in East of Eden, which takes us through nearly a score of scene setting Salinas Valley pages before Steinbeck begins his masterly hypnotic storytelling. When I posed this personal dilemna to a classrom of students, they were fairly evenly divided on that author's decision. The half who loved it were almost all studying art as their elective, whereas the other half had chosen another course. Later in life, when I came to draw as a hobby, I too appreciated Steinbeck's initial soft scenic opening before many following tempests.From too perfect paternal men both Asian and American of one generation through too flawed authority in another, there finally arrives in a third at least one character who has a chance at something both plausible and good. We herein also encountered women too hot, too cold and like, in the fable, one just right, once again all by design.My beloved shrink sister-in-law (at the time) gave me two great pieces of advice: get a shrink (which I did) and read East of Eden (which I did). My favorite memories of teaching involve that book multiple times in the context of an NYC gifted program.Finally, I am so jealous of most who are reading this indulgent review. The presumption is they have not yet, for the first time, realized the joy of savoring this unique treasure, perhaps both in the literary and film version. Steinbeck is, for me, along with Hawthorne, the greatest American writer and storyteller. I would love a selective bout of artful amnesia to experience such memorable firsts once again."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"for me this book was life changing. excellently written, captivating, in depth character development.

I find myself just stopping to think and digest sentences and paragraphs, because I felt really moved in my spirit; and delighted by unexpected epiphanies revealed throughout.It is timeless, it could be a 1100 years from now, and still one could relate.

Find out what kind of destiny is in store for Cyrus's offspring; Cal and Aron, Adam's sons, in this well written novel based in California.The Trask brothers will have a life like none other for they will prove different, and throughout this story we will be entertained by the people who surrounded this family; those who tried to make them appear as normal and tried too hard to accept them. We will also, meet those who knew too much about them and carried their secrets to their graves.However at the source of this book is Cathy Ames who will be responsible for their good or bad future in an indirect way.A page-turner that will keep you up all night. If you haven't read any other of John Steinbeck's books, please get your hands on The Grapes Of Wrath after this one. It is something to write home about.Rewiiewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar(SUGAR-CANE 26/12/04)"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Like everyone who went to highschool and college I read Steinbeck. Somewhere in my literary past I read EAST OF EDEN and my memory of the book is positive.However, over the last week or so of driving and doing mindless tasks around my house, I listened to Richard Poe's reading of EAST OF EDEN. The resonant tones of Poe's voice mixed with the masterful story telling of John Steinbeck make for a magical experience.For those who do not appreciate the classics and do not understand the power of Steinbeck, I urge you to listen to Poe's version. He makes the characters come alife. You can feel the evil of Kate and the wisdom of Lee. You can feel the pain of Cal and Aron and struggle that they lived.EAST OF EDEN is a wonderful and power story that recreates the story of Cain and Abel. There are a thousand term papers and phd dissertation in this work. Classes and discussion groups could go on forever.The version I had was 22 CD's and it seemed like a lot when I got started. By the time I got to the end, I was sorry it was over."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I was ready to read a classic and almost at the same time Oprah opened up with this one. (I usually read historicial/romance and needed a change) I have to say there are times when I cannot put the book down and others where the story is exceptionally slow. It is also a dark story, more evil and dissapointment and death then good, even though it gets its point across. I am enjoying it, only 3/4 the way through, but so far, it is so-so. Grapes of Wrath was much better. Hopefully there is a happy ending, but I doubt it.***************************************************************Finished the book, glad I read it and also glad it is over. The end really picks up speed and is quite entertaining, but the ending is so-so. Maybe I am missing something, but still liked Grapes of Wrath better."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book was so good that I couldn't sleep until I had finished it. Cathy Ames is a delicious character who also kept me up at night thinking about the things she had done. I think she is my favorite character feom any book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden has so much potential to be a book which has more of a satisfactory impact. This book, was at times poorly written, contradictory, confusing, and unfortunately boring. I say the book was poorly written at times because John Steinbeck spent so much time writing this book (several years I believe) and he could not manage to create many characters which interested me. Also, he included too many characters which were not important to the novel and even makes it unclear who the narrator is in the novel. I think the book is somewhat hypocritical because the novel's emphasis on freewill as one of its themes is not expressed through all the characters. Cathy Ames for instance, is condemmned as a devil during the entire course of the novel. How can you claim that freewill exists, and then permanently condemn one of your characters to a satanic status? I think that makes the book boring because it causes the plot to be too predictable, and at some points dry and corny. I am not saying that this book was completely awful though. The three stars I gave were for, the decent character development of Charles, and the insightful amorphisms provided by Lee, the Chinese servant of Adam. Also, Steinbeck's development of Cathy also had its strong points, but overall, I was disappointed at the way many character's dealt with their dilemmas. At times I was left feeling jipped at the outcome, or craving for more than what was provided. Overall, the book has strong themes, and a sufficient plot, but is hindered by its poor organization and mild character development."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck plays a cute little trick in East of Eden, a re-tooling of the Cain and Able story; all the &quot;good&quot; character's names begin with an &quot;A&quot; and all the &quot;bad&quot; character's names begin with a &quot;C&quot;."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book was very good.

I know I am an anomaly from all the other positive reviews this book has received. I came to read this book upon the prompting of my mother and sister who both enjoyed the book immensely.I stopped reading \\"East of Eden\\" the other day. I just couldn't take the brutal nature of some of the characters. I do not remember feeling so upset and disturbed when I read \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" \\"The Red Pony\\" or \\"the Pearl\\". That was a long time ago so my memory has been dimmed by the years maybe it was in those books as well.I wonder if the character Kathy/Kate was the summation of all the horrible women Steinbeck ever knew. Reading page after page of the demented things she did was just too much for me to justify the read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Classic characters and plot. More of how the more things change the more they stay the same."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"\\"East of Eden\\" is a good book, however it is a bit on the tedious side. After a time, the plight of Adam Trask seems pathetic, and you start to not care about his outcome. Samuel Hamliton is a strong force in the book, which is lost at his death. The most interesting characters were, in my opinion, Charles, the brother of Adam Trask, who we do not hear from in the later part of the book, and Cathy/Kate. Cathy's emotional detachment makes her dangerous and interesting, as she makes a life for herself.Ultimtely, I am pleased that I stuck with the book, but I would recommend Steinbeck's \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" or \\"Of Mice and Men.\\" Both of these novels are not such a chore to read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck is considered a great writer and for years I heard this was his masterpiece. I finally picked it up one day because I loved the movie (the version with James Dean). I quickly found out that the movie only covered the last fourth of the book. Still, despite the length (601 pages), I decided to read it anyways. Man--this was a struggle! It's a slow-moving \\"epic\\" that follows the Trask family from the Civil War to WW1. There are tons of characters and situations but it's not an easy read. Steinbeck was a good writer--his descriptions of California and Salinas Valley are beautiful. However when it came to characterizations and motivations he was terrible. All the characters are either evil or good--very black and white. No shades of grey. They don't speak--they preach. I don't think anyone ever talked like this in real life. Every single event or twist is oversimplified and talked to death. More than once I got the unpleasant feeling that Steinbeck was talking down to his audience. Also whatever his message was (I'm assuming he had one) it's totally lost as the story just rambles on and on and ON! As for the ending--it's kind of silly and pointless. It doesn't even SEEM like an end. It seems Steinbeck just got tired of writing this and gave up. I got through this hoping there would be some point (or POV) but there wasn't. I'm surprised this was published in 1952. Some of the material (mostly dealing with sex) was pretty explicit. I heard this was not a big hit because it was considered too simplistic and anti-climatic. I agree! The movie simplified it even more (but the Hayes Code was still in effect so they had no choice) but it was more interesting. It some excellent actors (James Dean, Raymond Massey, Julie Harris) fleshing out their characters and even gave some motivation and feelings to Kate (Jo Van Fleet won as Oscar for her acting) who is just evil and nothing more in the book. It's never a good sign when a movie adaptation has more interesting characters than the book! So--it's too long, too obvious and just rambles on and on for no rhyme or reason. Skip this one."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Or you may not. However, should you decide not to you are comitting a serious error.Steinbeck proves himself to be a THE American novelist as he masterfully weaves history, the bible, and his own family into one story. Steinbeck considered this to be the book he was destined to write. Therefore, if you're a big fan of his other works you MUST read this. This is storytelling at its finest."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Although I have not finished the book,East of Eden, I believe I have read enough of it to critique it.The book is set in the early 20th century in the Salinas valley of California. The book is separted into three parts, two of which I have read. The two main characters are both men, one lives in California and one lives on the east coast. The two characters don't meat untill about 200 pages into the book. Each character has an interesting life, but the book seems to focus more on the character Adam, more than the other, Samuel. The character that lives in California, Samuel, has a family of 9 and is a very intelligent man. The character that lives on the east coast, Adam, grew up with an emotionally cold and detached military father. He and his older brother lived as bachlors untill Adam was about 40.The begining of the story moves very slow, it is only when a third character is introduced, Cathy, that the story becomes interesting. Adam finds her beaten on his door step, nurses her back to health and marries her, but Cathy is an almost inhuman woman and never wanted to marry Adam. She is cold, distant, and calculated. Her real personality is shown by how she reacts to her and Adam's two sons when she gives birth.John Steinbeck has given this story a plot similar to that of the biblical story of Cain and Abel. There is that type of sibling jealously not only between Adam and his brother, but also between Adam's two sons. Steinbeck rarley has all the charactes in this book coexist. For the most part, each chapter is about a speific character and their individual life, not how they exist with the other main characters in the book.Overall I would say that this book moves much too slow for most readers. Although the detail is great, there is very little action or excitement. Every time the book seems like it is picking up, it goes right back to its slow pace. Out of what I have read so far, there has mabey been one whole page of action, combined. If you enjoy a long book full of vivid detail, this book is for you, but if you prefer drama and excitement in your reading, you will most likley not enjoy this book. On a scale of one to five, I would give this book a 3."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"After being required to read this &quot;novel&quot; in a literature class, I sighed feeling the weight of this 600 page book burdening down my summer. Once into the book, however, I wasn't able to put it down. This timeless classic shows the American Dream of moving west to find a better life. The parallel between the generations of Trasks and also the &quot;greatest story ever told&quot; of Cain and Abel. This story deals with a child's greatest fear of not being loved and the means if forgiveness. Not just your average novel, East of Eden is a story of life."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is one of those books that you long to get back to when you're at work or grocery shopping or wherever!

One of my favorites!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"My father introduced me to Steinbeck when I was in the 7th grade. I started with \\"Tortilla Flat\\" and was immediately addicted. I then began reading everything I could get my hands on...with the exception of \\"Grapes of Wrath\\". In 8th grade we were given a list of \\"American History\\" books to choose from to do a book report on. I searched desperately for a Steinbeck book and nothing was listed! I finally went to the teacher and insisted that I was mature enough to handle \\"East of Eden\\". She reluctantly agreed to let me read the book for my report and I have been forever grateful! I grabbed the book from the library that day and was finished with it in two days. I remember feeling such a connection with the characters. I felt that they became friends. I jumped into writing the book report with a lot of enthusiasm and received an \\"A\\"! To this day, fifteen years later, I consider \\"East of Eden\\" one of my all time favorite books. I have reread it on numerous occasions and always walk away with a feeling of astonishment and a certain sense of envy that I couldn't develop the writing techniques of a genius author like Steinbeck. After all these years and all these rereads of Steinbeck's other works, I am finally working my way slowly, but surely, through \\"Grapes of Wrath\\". My only regret is that I put it off so long. After all, the top ten spots have been filled. Apparently, I'm going to have to extend it to the top twenty!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is definitely Steinbeck's greatest masterpiece.

It is one of the greatest novels of this century and deserves every bit of praise that it gets. I really could interact with the characters.

Hope, abandonment,impassioned love, pure evil, friendship, loss...and above all the search for reason are unusually well embodied in this special book. I kept thinking that the old adage,&quot;they just don't write 'em the way they used to&quot; is absolutely on display here. And I'm not sure even with all the writing talent that is out there that it would be possible to write this kind of book today - the moralizing and questioning is vintage mid 20th century. Wonderful author, wonderful book, wonderful residual memories."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"a beautiful perceptive discussion on human consciousness and frailty - sweet and sad dialogues - an incredibly dense book about america and the the demon and spirit of our biblical heritage."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"If you enjoy John Steinbeck this is a must read, the characters are overwhelming. Once you pick up this you will not be able to put it down. I cannot put into words my feelings as I read the book, totally engrossed. Regardless of what I say, I cannot do EAST OF EDEN justice. In short WOW! I will now continue my quest to read everything Steinbeck has ever written. Do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is perhaps my favorite Steinbeck book. I recently moved to the Monterey/Salinas area and started reading Steinbeck. I also recommend Tortilla Flat and Cannery Row if you are interested in the area and like reading good books. If I'm not mistaken, I thought John Steinbeck disliked Salinas. After reading East of Eden, Salinas disliked him to the point of refusing to keep his books in the local libraries or schools. Now Salinas is on the verge of opening &quot;The Steinbeck Center&quot;, a multi-million dollar facility about his life and times. You can even eat lunch in the house he grew up in. I find it disturbingly ironic that even though Steinbeck and Salinas shared a strong mutual dislike while he was alive, now Salinas is the &quot;Steinbeck Capitol of the World.&quot; It's a shame what people will do for a quick buck. I'd have to say that Stienbeck's feelings toward Salinas are warranted, even more so today."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is a philosophical investigation into the human mental condition, emphasizing greatly the struggle between good and evil. It explores the complexities of such varied themes as depression, lonesomeness, hate (from Cain and Abel), and of course, love. But one should read this novel with a proverbial \\"grain of salt\\". Steinbeck will sometimes replace character development with his own analysis, much as a historian would look upon past events. For example, he begins a paragraph with \\"When I said Cathy was a monster...\\" To the reader, this may be an emotional anticlimax to the plot; it gives the tales a feeling of redundancy. Why not let the stories speak for themselves? It may be that Steinbeck is teaching us something with this novel, something important, something life changing - Timshel."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"We make many choices in our everyday lives. We decide what clothes to wear, what food to eat, and what we want to do with our lives, but how many of us decide whether we want to take the evil path or the \\"good\\" path? Steinbeck addresses this important choice in East of Eden.Overall I feel that this is an excellent book because of its well rounded characters and its enduring theme of good vs. evil. Each character has his/her own story and Steinbeck intertwines these stories in clever fashion as the relationships between Adam and Charles as well as Caleb and Aaron resemble the relationship between Cain and Able in the Bible. East of Eden is definitely worth your time if you are looking for a good book to read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Have you ever read a book that you can't keep down? East of Eden is that book. East of Eden is an amazing story by John Steinbeck. He incorporates biblical themes from Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel. His characters portray good and evil and the importance of control. The plot twists keep you turning pages. It is exciting to see the development of Cathy, Adam, Cal, Aron, and Lee. However, the orginization was less than satisfactory. Steinbeck would reach a climax then switch to another topic. Other than that, East of Eden is another phenomenal piece written by Steinbeck."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The first part of the book is a lot of background on the characters. It really helps to understand the rest of the book later on, but I feel as if I got jumped randomly without a clue from one character to a totally different character. The random jumping is the only beef I have about this book thus the subtraction of one star.The other four stars are for the plot and the development of the characters. East of Eden is more than a mere pleasure reading book. You can read it expecting to hear only a good story and finish feeling like you closed the door to the world. Themes aren't as dreary as they sound like: there's more than the theme of \\"good vs. evil\\" (actually i find that an almost nonexistent/unimportant theme). Steinbeck plays at the choice to be either \\"good or evil\\" and the difference or value of truth or ignorance. As a student, I think it's great to be reading a book where the theme isn't dry and overdone into another tedious assignment."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is probably one of Steinbeck's most compelling, realistic and multilayered novels he has ever written. Set in the picturesque Salinas Valley,East of Eden is about the story of two different families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons. Themes of fraternal love are frequently emphasized and commonly allude to the biblical tale of Cain and Abel. Steinbeck eloquently intertwines the families' life experiences while creating a dynamic group of characters that shares a common thread of good and evil sentiments. Steinbeck explores new levels of heartache, jealousy and sexuality in his writing, and also sticks in brief interludes of strong political opinions against the U.S. government and World War I. His style of writing was surely inventive during his lifetime, and definitely still stands out from other novelists of the 20th century."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is an excellent book but i would not recommend it to the faint of heart. It deals with many issues of human nature such as the struggle with sexuality, good versus evil, and stories from the Bible. I found it fascinating how well it coincided with how humans work. To those of you afraid that it might be a dark, depressing book: it really isn't that bad! Steinbeck's descriptions of the Salinas Valley are lovely and the characters in the novel experience happiness. But that is all intertwined with many other events and happenings . . .I won't tell what. I hope that those of you who purchase East of Eden enjoy it!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This novel by Steinbeck easily won me over the first time reading it. The wording of this book is simple yet interestingly complex. Throughout the novel, you are introduced to 2 main generations between two interacting families, the Hamiltons and the Trasks. Most of this novel though is focused on the brotherly rivalry the Trask brothers, of both generations, experience. A wedge that drives the brothers apart is the continual struggle for the love of their Father.The brotherly rivalry described through the description of both generations parallels greatly with the biblical story of Cain and Abel. Also a very interesting biblical term, timshel, thou mayest, is mentioned several times during this book advocating the CHOICE for oneself. This book is extremely enjoyable to read!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"While I did find this novel enticing, enjoyable, and a fulfilling read, I did at times find East of Eden by John Steinbeck somewhat unorganized and hard to understand. For a majority of this novel, I couldn't put it down. Themes of good vs. evil as well as love become apparent to the reader. Characters are well developed and liked by the audience. Unfortunately, it was difficult to keep track of what or who you were reading about. Steinbeck would go for a chapter on one character in one setting and then completely jump to another family or character in another city. It was in the hope of the reader that these two families, the Hamiltons and the Trasks, would one day cross paths. In many ways I found this novel much like a soap opera you would find on television. There is Cathy, a whore of a mother to the sons of Adams children, Caleb and Aron. However, it is unknown to the audience if they children are even Adams, possibly being his brother Charles who Cathy slept with at one point in the novel. I found myself getting so in depth into one part of the novel and just when it got good or revealed a fact about a character, Steinbeck would go and change everything all around. If you are looking for a quick read, this isn't your novel. If you are ready to maybe read sections over a few times to understand what is going on then this is your novel. Steinbeck is an amazing author however maybe this isn't his best work."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck incorporates a number of biblical themes in his novel, East Of Eden. I strongly recommend readers to have an affirmative grasp on the Bible before reading the novel. It was not until my friend mentioned some major themes of the Bible that I fully understand the Steinbeck's intentions. The themes that prevail in this novel are family values, free will, and the ultimate choice of good vs. evil. Note: the reader can understand the novel without a strong biblical background, but one will gain so much more if one is able to incorporate the novel's themes with that of the bible. Biblical themes set aside; the plot of the novel is entirely captivating. The binds of brotherhood and family are constantly tested and the reader is able to witness firsthand how important personal values contribute to one's success in life."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I loved this book. My favorite Steinbeck book (have read Of Mice and Men, Cannery Row, The Grapes of Wrath and The Moon is Down). I read The Grapes of Wrath just prior and I found Eden to be the better of the two. It was a book that I had trouble putting down. The characters were great."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It is the rare book that hums like a sweet concert of history, drama and soaring wisdom. \\"East of Eden\\" does that and more. Its tale unfolds in measures that tease with insinuation and deeply satisfy with masterful, gorgeous prose that is both precise and soul-warming. And it is utterly, inescapably readable. There is not one passage that wavers from hard, piercing storytelling into whimsy or tangent. The novel's dialogue is sparse, and largely unremarkable, with one exception. If you've read it, you know who I'm talking about. If you haven't, you'll want to find out."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is the first Steinbeck novel I have ever read, and I have to say that I'm hooked. The prose is unbelievable, the detail stunning and the characters have a gritty realness to them that I've never experienced before. You loath them one minute and love them the next. Only Shaara's The Killer Angels has ever taken me on this kind of ride before. Great book!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I first read EAST OF EDEN when I was in High School, and I thought it was one of the greatest books I had ever read. I've just finished it (for the 3rd time) all these years later, and it still remains one of my favorite books.Steinbeck's talk of the Hamiltons and the Trasks is lyrical and magical. This is simply one of those books that everyone should read at least once in their lives."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"When I first started reading EAST OF EDEN I was surprised by the fact that it did not rush into the saga of Caleb and aron Trask. I was also somewhat shocked by the vulgarity. But as I read on i saw that John Steinbeck wasn't being vulgar, he was giving a provocative look at what human nature really is, down to the ugly roots of imperfection.This book starts out with the story of good-hearted Adam and his wild brotehr Charles. Their father is harsh and they both come off with emotional issues. When Cathy Ames shows up at their house, beaten and in need of care, Adam rushes to her rescue. She is sweet and angelic and he falls in love, and they are married. Little does he know evil lies beneath her pretty face. She has a past of murder and is completely heartless. She is unfaithful to him on the very night of their wedding, and in just gets worse from there. After the birth of their twins she shoots Adam, leaving him desolate and in a state of shock. Eventually he comes out of it with the aid of his wise freinds Lee and Samuel. Adam recovers somehwat from his shock and starts raising his boys.This is where Aron and Caleb come in. Aron is beautiful and loved by all. Caleb is covered in a cloud of darkness and he is loved by very few. All he wants is acceptance from his father, and all Adam wants is him to be like his brother.With a splendid cast of unique characters, this book is amazing. It goes very deep and while it does ramble at times, the story is one of both good and evil, loved and unloved, love and hate."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read this book for the first time many years ago because I am a John Steinbeck fan. I thought that Grapes of Wrath was wonderful, but this book is even more mesmorizing. You can picture the characters and actually feel the good and evil and confusion in each of them. I read both Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden at least five times. Both are lengthy, but both tell a story that will keep you up all night reading. If anyone has seen the old movie, it no way compares to the book. What did compare to the book was a television mini-series way back in the 80's which starred Jane Seymour as Kathy. It was wonderful and so portrayed this book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Here is the intertwined story of two families-the Hamiltons and the Trasks-that Steinbeck masterfully explored questions of good and evil, inherited depravity, perfectionism, and free will. This book is drawn out of the well of the Old Testament story of Cain and Abel. A great read-I only regret it is finished. The almost-fatalistic approach can be depressing at times if you imagine humans as better than they really are, but there are enough glimpses of hope? and goodness to keep you with him. My favorite author is Michner-mostly because he writes of places and generations. This book is similar, but besides doing the place-generations thing, the author tosses in a paragraph or phrase (about one per ten pages, for me) that are so stunning in their crafting and depth of thought that I would sometimes would lay the book down at that point and go meditate on the porch for an hour on that single phrase. I now have a whole new group of people who are a part of the pantheon of good and evil? in my mind (some busts appear in both pantheons): Cyrus Trask(I know someone like him), his favorite son Adam (A Isaac-type guy) his unfavored brother Charles. I know even better the next generation: Adam's sons Cal(unfavored, a lot like the God-be-merciful-to-me pray-er) and good Aron. Sam Hamilton is a stand-out example of good and in a curious way his straight-laced wife which reminds me of many stern holiness folk of the past generations. The real central character of evil is certainly Cathy (later Kate). Whew-are there really women this evil? Abra Bacon remind me of a girl I knew in grade school, and perhaps Steinbeck is successful in making the central character a Hebrew word-timshel. Buy the book and love it as I did. -Keith Drury, Associate Professor of Religion, Indiana Wesleyan University."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I love this book - but I feel a certain shame about the Oprah book club logo. This book stands as a masterpiece without any endorsements from a pop icon (fad if you will). For someone like Oprah to vainly attatch her name to piece of art is kind of like blasphemy (though oddly enough I don't consider myself religous). Does anyone else out there think it is distasteful to attatch your name to a classic and sell it around the world -as if the book wasn't capable of communicating on its own? Steinbeck is a great author - and he is not to be insulted by this horrid oprah book club logo - restore his works properly like any respectable artist!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Personally, I consider it to be the best work of Steinbeck. It is well-written, moves along well (with the exception of a few passages) and builds up characters (for the most part). It's not a perfect read, not a horrible one - but a good book. I can't say that about a vast majority of books.The themes behind the book are far reaching and as old as any story's. Good verus evil, free will, and what truth is or can be. The use of Cain, Abel, and Timshell are laced in the idea of sin. There are characters and ideas that are quite good in nature and being, and those that are nearly pure evil. The outcome is a bit predictable and smacks of popular religion. The contrasts may be overdone and the characters a little too foreseeable, but it makes for a good read - and isn't that the point afterall..."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck has always had a very odd style of writing; he tells the reader the theme of the next section before the section. This style of writing can often be aggravating, especially because I personally would like to discover the theme alongside the characters, not before they do. In addition, Steinbeck goes through the whole family lineage of the Trask's etc. before starting the actual narration. I can see why Steinbeck would want to set the scene of the book by going through the family lineages, but the extent that Steinbeck did this was slightly to much.

Though there are many flaws in the book, Catharine is one of the best characters in literature of all time."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I found this a difficult read, but ultimately rewarding, and it wouldn't be fair to give such a well-written book anything less than 4 stars just because it wasn't written in my preferred style. \\"East of Eden\\" is a sort of repeat of the Biblical Abel and Cain story in modern times, in modern terms. A masterpiece of American literature. I'm usually not a big Steinbeck fan, I prefer Hemingway and F. Scott Fitsgerald. But even I felt the power of this book and I couldn't stop reading. You'll never forget the Trusks.David Rehak(...)"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden draws from the biblical story of Cain and Abel, reliving the age-old theme of good versus evil. The similarities between the brothers in this novel and the biblical brothers are numerous. First, note the \\"C\\" in Cain, Charles and Cal, and the \\"A\\" in Abel, Adam and Aron. The fathers in the book represent God and Cathy (Kate) plays a very convincing Satan.In Genesis Chapter four, Cain and Abel both offer gifts to God, and Abel's is respected and accepted while Cain's is not. Similarly, in East of Eden, Charles gives his father a knife and Adam gives him a puppy; Cyrus loves the puppy but does not use the knife.Years later, Cal and Aron are in the same situation with their father, Adam. Adam wants nothing more than the gift of pride that Aron gives him through his scholarly endeavors, and rejects the gift of money from Cal. There are many similarities between Cal, Charles and Cain, but also one major distinction that sets Cal apart from the other two evil characters. Cal recognizes the malevolence in himself and hates it. On that basis, a part of him is as good as Aron, Adam, and Abel. In the end, Cal is redeemed because he can bring himself to ask for forgiveness."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"As a little girl in Denmark, I read it for the first time and fell in love with the Salinas Valley and the people who settled there. Later, I visited Salinas and the Steinbeck museum. The book, which I re-read regularly, had a big impact on my life - and the story of the origin of the word 'timshel' is fascinating and riveting. The discussions among Adam, Sam Hamilton, and Lee are my favorite scenes of the book. Steinbeck will always be close to my heart.... Kirsten Weinoldt"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"After several distractions, and more than two months, I finally reached the end of Steinbeck's so-called 'epic'. Apparently, I should have watched the movie instead.There's not a lot to add to previous reviews. The story is long, unfocused, long, rambling, long, cliched, long, tiresome, long, repetitious, and not short.The scope of the story is simply too large, and there are too many characters who ultimately add nothing to the drama. The 'modern day Cain and Abel' angle is worn into the ground long before the story even turns its attention to Cal and Aron. The previous generation(Charles and Adam) make perhaps the dullest pair of charcters ever put together in any work of fiction, and the long, incresingly frequent digressions to catch up on the Hamiltons, the progress of American history and its impact on Salinas, and the state of the prostitution industry, serve to slow this book to a glacial pace.The Chinese housekeeper, Lee, is perhaps the only saving grace in the second half of the book, although the final scene involving he, Cal, and Adam redeems some, if not all of the novel's shortcomings.Generally, 'East of Eden' disappoints, because it asks readers to make a long-term emotional investment in a largely lifeless and dull saga, populated (with only a few exceptions) by cardboard characters.In my view, Steinbeck was at his best with more compact novels or short stories. 'Eden' might have worked better if Steinbeck had followed the more loosely-formatted framework of 'Cannery Row', rather than weighing down this story with so much verbiage."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"What can I say about East of Eden. This book is a masterpiece. This book made me love reading. I have never in my life become so envolved in a story. I recommend this book to everyone. If you pass this book by you will be denying yourself a truly wonderful experience. The story is timeless and thrilling."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Without a doubt, this is good writing. This is a wonderful book for school reading and book club discussions. However, if you want to kick back and enjoy a fun book, I don't think this is it. There were times when I was bored. At times when I had to put the book down, I found it hard to pick it up again. Once I considered giving it up completely.There are quite a bit of profound discussions (about life, morals, family, etc) between the characters Lee, Samuel, and Adam. Half the time, I haven't a clue as to what they're saying (I may not be an intellect, but I'm not dumb either). I had to re-read some of the lines or paragraphs to get a better understanding, only to find that some of the verbiage was irrelevant to the story. It seemed such a chore having to constantly interpret what they said into simple English.Steinbeck sets up each scene by giving us some insight into history, or by describing the land and people. For most part, I found it to be overly descriptive; some parts either too long and dragged out or simply unnecessary. Also, much of the descriptions are repetitive. It&#65533;s burnt into my brain that Cathy has tiny pointed teeth, that Aron has a pretty face, that Ethel is dumb. I must admit though, however boring it was, it did helped to paint a clear picture in my mind as I was reading the book. I guess that's what makes it good writing!!!All in all, I&#65533;m glad I read this book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck took his turn at the Cain and Abel story, turning it into a towering epic of the westward journey of Americans to the promised land of California. The book is richly detailed, and certainly Steinbeck's most ambitious effort, but ultimately fails to deliver on its central theme. The book is a continuous battle between opposing forces, beginning with the Civil War and ending with land development and the railroad system in California. Caught in the middle of this sprawling epic is a pair of brothers, who find themselves living out an eternal grudge match. The supporting characters are the most interesting in this novel, such as the Chinese cook who becomes so involved in the story of Cain and Abel that he pursues the topic with his elders in San Francisco's China Town, and even searches out a direct Hebrew translation to resolve the meaning of the parable. He finds that the intended word was \\"may\\" and not \\"shall\\" overcome sin, thereby reaffirming man's free will. But, for the most part this is a heavy handed novel, falling short of Steinbeck's better novels, \\"In Dubious Battle\\" and \\"The Winter of Our Discontent.\\""},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"There were times, in the middle of the book, when I was so bored by the writing style and I wanted to stop reading it. But I was patient and it paid off. At times I wanted to give the novel two stars, then three stars, then four stars, and it probably deserves a full mark. But I'm keeping it at four stars to tell some readers, especially those who haven't read classics before, that it's not an easy read.I've read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\" by Dan Brown before reading this. They were entertaining throughout, but you forget them the moment you finish them. East of Eden, although boring at times, had an impact on me and changed the way I look at life. It just gives you wisdom and a new perspective. And that's what makes a book a great book. I may revisit this epic again."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It was gewtting towards the end of my senior year in high school.

If you don't agree, you will still have had the pleasure of knowing intimately the wonderful characters of Steinbecks East of Eden as if they were your own extended family, a truely great gift from such a talented author."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is primarily set in the Salinas Valley, California in the time period between 1900 and 1918. Primarily, but not exclusively: some chapters are set in Connecticut and Massachusetts, and the story also goes back to the period of the American Civil War.Two families and their intertwined stories feature in the novel: the Hamilton family, and the Trasks. The Hamiltons anchor the story: Samuel and Liza Hamilton (John Steinbeck's maternal grandparents) and their children convey a sense of life and continuity in the Salinas Valley. The Trask story is of two generations of brothers: with each brother trying to win the love of his father. The how and the why of this struggle is beautifully depicted. From the first generation's Adam and Charles to the second generation's Aaron (Aron) and Caleb, the enduring themes are the battles between good and evil; love and hatred; and acceptance and rejection. It is the possibility of change through the exercise of free will: \`Thou mayest' that adds such a rich dimension to the novel.\`Virtue and vice are warp and woof of our first consciousness and they will be the fabric of our last, and this despite any changes we may impose on field and river and mountain, on economy and manners.'It is the characters who make this story come alive. Cathy Ames, who becomes Adam's wife, is a truly evil character. And yet, for me, the most monstrous action in the novel is Adam's passive withdrawal from his sons rather than her acts of violence. Cathy may be a monster:\`I believe there are monsters born in the world to human parents.'But acts of monstrosity can be passive as well as active.Two of the characters are simply wonderful: Samuel Hamilton and Lee stand out for their wisdom and humanity. This is a complex, multi-layered novel that is magnificent in a number of different ways. I first read it over 30 years ago, have just finished re-reading it and intend to read it again.\`It's hard to split a man down the middle and always reach for the same half.'Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is my favorite work of fiction, and I think it could be in contention for the best work ever."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have to say that this book came as a surprise to me. I saw the movie recently and was spell-bound so went and got the book immediately, and have to say that it is now actually the best book I've ever read. Personally, anyway. Something you have to understand, it is a very easy book to read. While lots of acclaimed books have pages upon pages of impossibly tiresome 'details' of the most uninteresting things, the pages in this are told simply through stories, as if Steinbeck is telling it over a coffee to a friend. There's none of the \\"the stalks were high and brown, and the golden sunlight lit the condensation like a miracle from the sky\\" nonsense to fill out pages. Everything Steinbeck explains is told so through one story after another, and in that way it is easy to see that this is clearly quite a documentation of his own life and memories. Which I personally think is the most wonderful form of storytelling. The characters are great, too. The first part has a chapter where one brother goes out with a hatchet to murder his other brother. Then not too long after we hear the tale of the most wicked woman ever created, Cathy, who kills her parents by lighting their house on fire. This is gripping, intriguing stuff. I can't believe it was written so long ago. I've never been much of a fan of Steinbeck's until now (we had to read Of Mice and Men in high school and that was okay), but now I have the great urge to buy all his books and have the time of my life all over again."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The Bible deeply influenced John Steinbeck winner of the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature. In \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" he takes his inspiration from Exodus; in East of Eden it comes from the primeval stories of Genesis.The long 602 book was published in 1962. The novel begins in Connecticut where Adam Trask and his older brother Charles live on a farm owned by their father Cyrus. Cyrus is a bigwig in the GAR and has a wooden leg from his Civil War service. We later learn he stole money from the GAR. The Vice-President of the USA and Secretary of War attend the old man's funeral. Adam enters the army for ten years while his irascible brother Charles stays on the farm making a fortune. There are shades of Cain and Abel in the tumultous relationship between these brothers.Adam marries Cathy Trask who has burned her parents to death in a fire at her New England home. She has the face of an angel and the mind of a devil. After Adam and Cathy move to Salinas California she becomes pregnant. She gives birth to Cal and Aron but deserts the boys. She shoots Adam running away to a whorehouse. She later murders Faye the madam and becomes rich. She is one of the most evi women in American fiction. She will later meet Adam and her two sons in bitter confrontations. Cathy's suicide takes her to the secret place where she believes Alice in Wonderland waiths for her! Cathy is a greedy, horrible, cruel and devious witch!Adam and the ever faithful Chinese servant Lee raise the two boys. On the night Cal takes Aron to the house of prostitution owned by Cathy the two boys engage in a fight. They also resemble Cain and Abel from the Bible. Aron elists in the World War One American Army and is killed in combat. Cal falls in love with Abel's longtime girl friend the beautiful and kind Abra Bacon. Adam who has suffered a stroke following the shocking death of Aron forgives Cal for his sins. As the last page ends we know Adam is at peace with his oldest son.The novel is a big three masted ship which also looks at the family of Samuel Hamilton, his faithful wife Liza and their brood of nine children. The Hamiltons are good people and are friends with the lonely Adam Trask.East of Eden is one of the greatest novels ever written in the United States. This reviewer has read it several times and enjoys it each time. It deals with such big subjects as love, hate, sin, forgivenss, the love of the land and what it means to be an American. This book is essential reading!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I LOVED this book. I bought it and got about half way through but became very busy with school and had to put it down. I picked it back up and finished it a couple years later, when I had more time, but I am pretty sure I lost a lot in the time between. I can't wait to go back and read it again!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Biblical accounts abound in this John Steinbeck novel revolving around the turn of the century Californians - on a tale loosely based upon relatives or neighbors of the relatives of the author's heritage.East of Eden is the quite simply where Cain - of Cain and Abel fame - was exiled. The two stories within this tome are of Adam and Charles Trask, and the sons of Adam - Caleb and Aaron whose names mirror alphabetically Cain and Abel: a theme for both the stories of Adam and Charles (note the initials) and the sons of Adam.Within the confines of the novel are great parables and stories of the pilgrimages of persons who made the America of today so great. But, the personalities include evil - including the mother of Caleb and Aaron (Aron) - Cathy, later requesting to be called Kate. She is quite simply stealth: \\"I believe there are monsters born in the world to human parents,\\" Steinbeck writes in the novel. \\"Some you can see, misshapen and horrible, with huge heads or tiny bodies; some are born with no arms, no legs, some with three arms, some with tails or mouths in odd places...And just as there are physical monsters, can there not be mental or psychic monsters born? The face and body may be perfect, but if a twisted gene or malformed egg can produce physical monsters, may not the same process produce a malformed soul?\\"This monster belies all human nature when she gives birth to Caleb and Aaron and on same date abandons them. She leaves them to do what she does best - be a woman of ill repute and ridicule men at her trade. \\"She combines the brains of a businessman, the toughness of a prize fighter, the warmth of a companion, the humor of a tragedian. Myths collect around her . . . \\"Amid this novel of human weakness exists strong literature. \\"Samuel Hamilton rode back home in a night so flooded with moonlight that the hills took on the quality of the white and dusty moon. The trees and earth were moon dry, silent and airless and dead. The shadows were black without shading and the open places white without color.\\"And, amid this novel arises a person or two of great character. The first is Samuel Hamilton - believed to be based upon the grandfather of the author. Secondly is the protagonist Adam Trask. And, lastly is my favorite, Lee, a China man who aids Adam in raising the twins when his monstrous wife leaves them to raise the two infants. He is more than just a helper. He is a philosopher - a topic to be discussed more thoroughly later. As Adam states, \\"I don't see how you could cook and raise the boys and take care of me and still do all this.\\"In the great philosophical dialogue, we return to the Bible - and not surprisingly to the Cain and Abel where Lee discusses how the King James' version differs from the American Standard translation of the Genesis chapter of Cain. To decipher how the difference came about, Lee read the Hebrew version and found a difference in translation in the word timshel. And, this little discourse in the first third of the book cannot be forgotten - as that word and the differences of translation become the focus of the ending. So when you go to the end, and if for any reason you forgot the great philosophical dialogue between Lee and Adam and Hamilton about the word timshel, save yourself time and go to [...] where it is all delivered in a few strokes at the monitor. In effect, it is whether you believe there is fate without choice; or does man have the ability to control destiny by choice.There are also great anti-war undertones. \\"There were people who gave everything they had to the war because it was the last war and by winning it we would remove war like a thorn on the flesh of the world and there wouldn't be any more such horrible nonsense.\\"It has been three decades since I read Steinbeck. And, to be certain, many of the undertones about timshel or the ignorance of youth would probably have been lost upon my younger reader's eyes. Maturity abounds in this novel written in less decorous language, but beautifully painted verse, of the life and times in romantic agrarian northern California when it was truly the land of fruit and plenty.At this time of my life, when I have read most of this author's works, and all of the acclaimed works, I must claim this to be my favorite. This is a masterpiece. And probably because of its size and occasional rough topics, not the choice for classrooms. Unfortunate choices by the classrooms."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is John Steinbeck's greatest work! It is full of wisdom and has lots of autobiographical material about the author. Steinbeck writes beautifully so that the reader gets a clear picture of the people and places in the story. It is a study of good and evil as the story unfolds. You can draw your own conclusions as to whether there are any completely good or evil people in the world, and what the author thinks. It shows Steinbeck's love of the Salinas area in California and makes you want to visit. As it traces three generations of families, you don't want to stop reading until you find out what happens to them."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Great novel, emblematic of Steinbeck's story-writing, including thematic spacer chapters. Classic novel that really gets at the heart of the human condition."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Critics of this novel will tell you that it's a heavy-handed, melodramatic, bloated example of literary self indulgence; and frankly these are valid complaints. And yet I enjoyed this novel - quite a bit actually. Steinbeck, for all his shortcomings, is an accomplished story-teller and I found myself consistently reading \`just a few more pages' instead of putting the book down. What can I say? The novel's flaws are maddeningly apparent, and yet I genuinely looked forward to each opportunity to pick the book up again.To address the (perfectly valid) criticisms of this novel:1. It's heavy handed: It's hard not to argue with this criticism. Steinbeck is about as subtle as a sledgehammer with his use of themes in East of Eden. We get it. Cain and Abel, Good vs. Evil, Free Will vs. Destiny. At one point Cal (aka Cain) is asked if he knows where his missing brother is and Cal replies \\"How do I know, am I supposed to look after him?\\" (aka \`Am I my brother's keeper?'). Personally I would have liked to have seen Steinbeck use a lighter touch and let readers interpret the novel for themselves.2. It's melodramatic: I can't argue with this criticism either. Frankly, it's a big sprawling multigenerational soap opera; more guilty pleasure than literary masterpiece. But the fact that it's a Steinbeck novel gives you a rare opportunity to indulge in a guilty pleasure (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) and read a \`classic' at the same time.3. It's boated and self-indulgent: Did this novel need to be 600 pages long? Of course not. The central story with its Good vs. Evil theme, centers entirely on the Trask family. But the novel tells the story of two families; the Trasks and the Hamiltons. The Hamiltons are Steinbeck's own family and in fact John narrates much of the story as himself. True, real Hamilton family members play pivotal roles in the fictional Trask family saga, but Steinbeck dedicates a considerable portion of this novel to telling his family story (that's the self-indulgent part). The result is that the novel meanders, lacking focus, particularly during the middle portion of the novel. The Hamiltons are mostly absent from the final quarter of the novel and the momentum picks up considerably as a result.East of Eden, particularly in its final quarter, is remarkably entertaining and compulsively readable. To this, I attribute Steinbeck's gift for story-telling. The bottom line: despite myself, I really enjoyed this novel. I can't give it five stars because of the novel's shortcomings, but if you are looking for a guilty pleasure that you don't have to feel guilty about (on account of it being a classic novel written by one of the 20th century's eminent writers) look no further than East of Eden. This is a far cry from Steinbeck's best work (although I understand he is most proud of this novel, probably because of the self-indulgent telling of his own family story and its celebration of his beloved Salinas Valley) but it is still well worth reading. 4 stars."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Perhaps every great novelist has one truly great novel. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is outstanding, but \\"East of Eden\\" is Steinbeck's best novel and one (1) of the five (5) greatest novels ever written (in my opinion).Not only does Steinbeck make Genesis Chapter 4 the centerpiece of this novel, he literally wagers the success of this novel on one (1) Hebrew word found in Genesis Chapter 4: \\"Timshel\\" (\\"thou mayest\\"). Steinbeck wins the wager. Actually, he breaks the casinos-all of them-at Vegas by basing his novel around \\"Timshel.\\"This book is a stunning work of achievement. If you enjoy fiction, you should love \\"East of Eden.\\""},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"There are no words to be wielded that would surely elate this book any further than what others have wrote.

I first read it at about age 12, and fell in love with his descriptions of the Salinas valley. I went to California in 1984 just to see how Salinas looked 30 years after the book, and it was just that beautiful with the miles and miles of cultivated fields. The characters are real, the plot is pure Steinbeck. You know what is going to happen, yet you continue to hope for human behavior to change. I have never forgotten the way Lee's group of Chinese scholars worked to decipher that one word which meant \\"thou mayest\\". Those kinds of details make John Stenbeck unforgettable."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The power of the written word to express the deepest emotions of life is evidenced beautifully in this classic story of love,jealousy, and redemption.

I found myself putting the book down at times, just to stop and think about what I've read, and savor the little bits of humor and wisdom. It's been a long time since I've found characters that have stuck with me long after the book has been read. It's not an action-packed, page-turning adventure at all, and would probably make a horribly boring movie. It's more of a home-cooked, slow-simmer novel in a world of fast food stories. I believe that the more you put into this book, the more you will get out of it. Put the time and effort in, and you will most likely end this book a little different of a person than who you were beforehand."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Let me start by saying, I would NEVER have read a \\"classic\\" if Oprah did not suggest it.....but this book is WONDERFUL!!

True to Steinbecks' descriptive writing, it once again delved into the human pysche and the root of hatred and evil. It showed mankind's struggle in where else, but California. Kind of like a family history, but a decent storyline. If the beginning seems a tad boring, dont worry the end gets quite good. The book was greatly fascinating and it kept me hooked to the very end.

I found Cathy Ames a frightening yet interesting character and kept attempting to figure her out.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"In my opinion, East of Eden tops everything written by John Steinbeck. Although it is a biblical story, Steinback doesn't present it as such. It's a modern-day Cain versus Able story. If you liked this book, you'll probably also like From the Heart by Kendall Bell. Both of these books are very inspiring."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"My problem with this book isn't its length, because to me length is an asset when the book is fascinating-I didn't feel the length of Crime and Punishment, Anna Karenina, Mandela's Long Walk to Freedom, and these are all 500 page plus books.The problem with this book is that although there is a sort of guilty pleasure involved that keeps you going for a very long time-how evil is this woman?-it does not pay off. We all enjoy stories about fictional characters without a conscience, because it creates all kinds of interesting possibilities. But after a while, the heavy symbolism of Cain and Abel, the repeating family tragedies, and so on, become tedious and the book just drags on and on until you just can't wait for it to be over. This is not an indictment of Steinbeck (or Oprah, whose book recommendations are usually very good), because I've liked other writings of his and he is certainly an American treasure in his depiction of so many early twentieth-century experiences, social situations, etc.This book didn't really have much of a moral in my opinion, which is fine, but the writing style wasn't good enough to compensate for a lack of it and to stand alone based on the beauty of the writing."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I know most people say this is an incredible awesome book, but as most classics, it has \\"its parts.\\" It has some parts that will keep you sooo interested, but there are others that really feels like the author was just filling out pages. There are characters that have nothing to do with the plot, but have 30 pages about them. As most classics that I have read, the general plot is awesome, but don't expect all the book to keep you awake. There are parts where you will need real will power to keep going, so just be patient, and continue reading."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is by no means a good representation of Steinbeck's ability to write. He uses the most overplayed theme in literature of good vs. evil. The seemingly obvious plot and significance of motifs (or lack there of) lend to a pretty weak recounting of his family history with the infamous Cain and Abel tale woven into the plot. Much of the book is spent in narrative form, and when the simple and stolid characters do get a chance to talk, their words are tasteless and lack energy or fervor. The plot didn't seem to move anywhere as I was repeatedly caught hoping for the book to end (it drags on for 602 pages). In addition, Steinbeck attempts to use old fashioned cliches and metaphors, and fails miserably. It is obvious that he tries to incorporate deep significance to certain aspects of the book and fails miserably. For example, he uses this metaphor several times: \\"she must have had a pelvic arch of a whalebone, for she had big children one after the other.\\" Maybe it's just me, but that's not very inspirational. Lastly, Steinbeck crushes all chance for the reader to think for him/herself (even though there wasn't much thinking to do about this book anyway). He reveals all the symbolic, deep thinking, significant ideas through his character dialogue and by outright statement of them. At the beginning of Book IV, he expressly states the main theme of the novel to the reader, ruining all chance for the reader to think beyond the level of a first grader. Overall, I was not very impressed with the level of writing in East of Eden. Maybe this is because I had such high hopes for Steinbeck material. Nonetheless, many people happen to like this novel. It could be better (much better)."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Though it's been years since I read this book it still remains to be one of my favorites.

Condion of book appaling."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is probably what Michner was reading when he started creating his books. Steinbeck does this big drama like no one else can. The story is really good, he keeps it moving and it is really engrossing. The book is filled thoughout with plenty of interesting and complex characters. He does a great job describing California. This is not his best work but an all around great effort."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is an amazing book. I wasn't sure what to expect when I first opened it, but then I was hooked. This book teaches you about good and evil. Every character was interesting enough to be their own character. from this book I learned a lot about the world in 1900 and today."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"My husband and I have a tradition. Ever since our honeymoon 8 years ago, we've read books aloud to eachother. East of Eden was our latest. Having read Grapes of Wrath together 4 years ago, we thought nothing of Steinbeck's could top it. These two books are very different books, so I'm not going to say one is greater than the other. There was a different focus, they are so different you can not call one greater. But we were amazed at the greatness of this book!!! We were so engaged in it that we read it much faster than anything but Wilkie Collins(it's impossible not to read WC fast...but that's another review.) We were very attatched to the characters...these are not shallow characters you don't care much about. You want them to succeed! You want to see what is going to happen to them. It's a very introspective book, you WILL remember it, it affects you. So just start reading and don't worry about being bored or worry about choosing the book which was Steinbeck's best. Just start reading."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"All I can say about this book is that I loved it. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down, and I finished it in about two days. It completely encompassed me. I have never read Grapes of Wrath but Steinbeck called that his one book... If that is his one book then I don't know what you would call this besides amazing. I am so glad I got to read this treasure."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read this book quite quickly, in about a week, for school. I found that it was very entertaining and that it shows the depths of evil possible. There are two sides in this book. Evil and good. The evil is shown in characters like Cathy and Caleb. How? Well, you'll have to read the book to find out. I can ruin it for you, though. All I have to say is that this book has sex and whores, farms and pidgin talk, lies and lies, sins and naiveness.The main character is the towering Adam Trask, whom I think is too gullible. Why? You can figure that out by reading the book. I recommend it. It's quite long though."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is the reason I passed Junior English. The thickness at first turned me off but Steinbeck makes it so riveting I could not put it down. The character of Cathy Ames/Kate is the reason why I love this book. She is a disturbed evil being whom I love to hate and her actions make you want to read further to determine why she is the way she is. Cathy is one of the greatest characters I have read about in a long while"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is absolutley fascinating. I read it in highschool and I cannot wait to read it again some day. Steinbeck creates such dramatic images, it really is a great classic."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is a probing, philosophical work focusing on the inner struggle between good and evil. Steinbeck creates angelic characters in Adam and his son Aron, pure evil in Adam's wife Cathy, and a testy coexistence of the two in Caleb and Charles. He strips away the shells of these characters, exposing human nature and its many complexities to the reader. Powerful emotions like love, jealousy, and shame shape the novel and its characters. Steinbeck writes with rugged honesty and incomparable beauty, making East of Eden a treasured American classic."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is about two families--the Trasks and the Hamiltons- whose destinies will intertwine. The relationship between Adam/Charles, re-enact the rivalry of Cain and Abel, while Adam's marrige, the fall of Adam and Eve. The story takes place in the rich farmland of California's Salinas Valley. In the first generation, Charles and Adam were introduced, Cahrles as Cain and Adam as Abel. Though Adam was not killed by his brother Charles, he was beaten badly. Luckily, as both grew older, their relationship changed for the better. However, the rivalry amongst the two brothers was passed in Adam's twin sons, Cal as Cain and Aron as Abel..... Adam's marriage to Cathy was never he thought it would be. Like Eve, Cathy brought troubles in Adam's life. Cathy left her family and became a whore, in which led to her death. The only man that helped Adam get through his hardships in life was Samuel Hamilton, who became his dearest friend. I highly recommend this book because it's a powerful piece that deals with sibling rivalry as well as the loss of ones love."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is the kind of book that is a true joy to read. The bittersweet ending is the highlight of this study of one family's internal conflict. The character of Samuel is one of the richest that exists in literary history. His words are always a comfort both to the other characters and to the reader. East of Eden is John Steinbeck's grand opus. Some will be daunted by the length but Steinbeck can warm any reader's heart with finely drawn characters, an intense plot, and beautiful imagery. Do not pass on this!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It's the classic of classics! John Steinbeck is amazing at bringing all the characters and minor details together, weaving into one grand plot. I don't know what else I can tell you about it without telling you the actual story. It's great. Read it. You will love it. That's all I can say."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"When I first picked up East of Eden, I was not sure that I would enjoy it. The first 40 or so pages did not hold my attention, but it seems that once I turned to page 41, I was HOOKED and could not put the large novel down until it was done.The stories of the Hamiltons and Trasks intersect so beautifully and Lee's character is one that I will probably remember forever. So many of his observations about Americans and California are ones that were true in the 1900s and continue to ring true a century later. I highlighted many passages in this book as ones that I won't forget and would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"These book is one of the greatest clasics you can come across. It is a serene insight in relationship on man-women and brotherhood issues. Though is not very crystal on answering the question why the main character is so sentimentaly naive and as such against all odds, but still the situation, the consequences of it are colorfuly depicted. It's a book how Good can survive against the Evil but still it gets the shorter end of it. There is no ideal or divine realization that good will win overall. Being truly and naivly good doesn't mean that you will be awerded for it and that a true love can win at the end. It can be farse to itself."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Honestly, I thought the first 400 pages were more compelling than the conclusion. However, this book is quite remarkable. The Biblical theme of Cain/Abel with Charles/Adam and Caleb/Aron is a haunting revelation into the complex balance between good and evil that defines us as human beings. Cathy (Kate) is without a doubt the most devious and evil literary character I've encountered EVER in literature. Every scene she was in I couldn't wait to see what happened!I do recommend this book, despite its flaws, because the glimpse into humanity is powerful. It did concern me a bittoo when I realized that 3 of my 4 children are named Adam, Caleb and Kate!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Excellent book. The characters are SOOO well developed and the insight into the human mind so profound that I will have a hard time picking up a typical murder mystery again. I spent much time pondering some of the magical paragraphs and exhalting in the fantastic ending. It is great after reading the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" since it also considers the true origins of parts of the Bible. This is a great read and a great book club selection."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Excellent book!! Much better than in highschool, go figure!

I'm a life-long admirer of Steinbeck. That's caused me to go back and re-read each of his books several times over the years. I find my tastes have evolved. Some of my favorites in 1960 have become least favorites. Not so, East of Eden. I loved this book as a young man and love it still as a curmudgeon."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I recently re-read this book and think it's amazing. Although it can be convoluted and unfocused at times, it's central themes are amazingly relevant and important. The question of whether the sins of the father (and mother) taint us forever, or if we can be reborn, speak to what America, and more specifically California, are about - places to come and start a new life - where the future, not the past, is important. Although I'm not a big fan of the James Dean version, I would like to correct some things that Alan Cambeira says in his review. Although I agree with his dislike for the movie, some of the details in the review make me wonder if he knows what he's talking about. First, he says the movie was shot in black and white. This isn't true, it's in vivid color. Second, he says James Dean's father is played &quot;imperially by Anthony Quinn.&quot; This is also false - it was Raymond Massay. I don't mean to nit-pick, but if you're going to criticize something, you should know what you're talking about."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a novel that successfuly weaves strands of fact with threads of fiction to create a stunning tapestry of American life that is timeless. The novel is based in the early part of the 1900's and despite it's massive length (over 600 pages) Steinbeck manages to draw you in and make you think. His characters are richly drawn so that you almost know them. I believe this is because we can find a little of each character with in ourselves. This book is the very best book I have ever read and that says a lot because I am constantly reading. Pick up East of Eden today and take the journey to the Salinas Valley. You will not regret it!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"What is so great and compelling about the stories of Genesis, that of Cain and Abel in particular, is that they are eternal. Steinbeck successfully conveys this in a modern retelling, where the reader can relate more successfully to all parties involved. He uses the helpful technique of telling the first story through Adam Trask's eyes, who plays the role of Abel. For the second generation, it is Aron (the Abel figure) who is now aloof and distant from us and we relate to and understand Cal (the Cain figure.) However, this is not the only story that is being told.At the same time is being woven in stories of love, human nature (and seemingly inhuman monstrosity,) betrayal, and pity. Steinbeck helps us understand these diverse characters by immersing us in them for what seems like years. This novel really feels like an epic to read, and although it seems to be impregnable and dragging, you finish feeling enlightened and wishing you could read it for the first time again.Clearly the most important message Steinbeck wishes to convey is the element of human choice. No god or higher power of any sort compels you; your destiny is not predetermined. You have the choice to do good OR evil whatever your circumstance. We hope for Cal that he understands that he is not condemned by his mother's evil and his seemingly inherited hatred, and we also relate this precept to our own lives. For this reason, as well as its simple storytelling merits, I feel that East of Eden far outshines The Grapes of Wrath as a chronicle of the human condition.Many don't understand Steinbeck's obsession with the Salinas Valley and if they do, they don't understand why they have to be subjected to reams of pages describing it and its inhabitants. Some reasons may include westward movement (i.e. struggling back to Eden) and also that it provides an effective parallel in many ways to a hard land that is east of Eden. This is no heavenly garden of Eden, but its inhabitants incessantly toil to overcome.To understand about this and many other tools that Steinbeck employs, I highly recommend that with this book you read \\"Journal of a Novel: the Writing of East of Eden\\", (the name is something like that) In this journal Steinbeck would begin every day of writing with a journal entry to his dear friend and editor Pascal Covici. He makes obscure references to the book that necessitate constant referral back to the pages, but it is understandable enough. This journal is more useful in its function of helping the reader understand John Steinbeck and where he is coming from; his passion for invention, his own fears and love for his two young sons (in fact he wrote this for and about them,) and his feelings on contemporary subjects all show what a multi-talented and opinionated man he was. One of many gems in these pages is his discussion of children, and adults' attitudes toward them. He basically says that adults often discount the opinions and needs of children as fanciful and useless, because these adults have forgotten what it is like to be a child. On the contrary, Steinbeck says, adult thoughts only get more cloudy and jaded as they age, whereas the thought of children is pure, deep, and real, even if they can't always effectively communicate it.So in addition to a helpful companion to East of Eden, Journal of a Novel is important life-reading in its own right.Anyway, I highly recommend East of Eden and feel that any reader should lay aside a lot of time to read and re-read this complicated and moving novel. If you go too fast, you might miss something. In Journal of a Novel, Steinbeck effectively said with no reservations, \\"This is the one. Everything else I have written has been practice for this one.\\" This \\"everything else\\" is a distinguished body of literature, so why don't we take Steinbeck at his word and confirm his quest for greatness, realized in this epic."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I literally live near Sam Hamilton's and Adam Trask's, just east of King City, so this book is close to my heart. Save &quot;Grapes,&quot; this is my favorite of Steinbeck's novels. His descriptions of the King City-Salinas area are so real. The book was written a while ago, but here, along Highway 25, &quot;East of Eden&quot; lives on. Great book!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"this book is a summary of what are good feelings and bad feelings,but i think the goal of John Steinbeck is to prove that althrough the life is ruled by badness and godness,there is always a solution.you must not forget &quot;timshel&quot;:everything is possible"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"While approaching the end of his career, Steinbeck attempted to weave together an epic of two families, culminating in the gigantic work of East of Eden. Covering a period of over 50 years, the novel tries to do so much more: the retelling of the Cain and Abel story in the farmlands of the Salinas Valley which was Steinbeck's home and the setting for many of his works. If there is any fault in the novel that stands out, it is in the heavily contrived nature of the storyline and its characters. In spite of this, Steinbeck wrote with such force and utter conviction that the reader is asked to be carried along on faith. One does not enter into such a pact lightly. For his part, the author presents his tale with honesty and integrity. It is not asking too much for the reader to take him at his word. This saga of the Trask and Hamilton families covers the gamut of human experience, and while many of the characters are despicable in nature, the reader may feel a degree of empathy for them. This is no small feat for an author. As in earlier works, Steinbeck is unrivaled in setting the scene, in this case the Salinas Valley he knew so well. There is a love-hate relationship here. Life is hard, especially for those unfortunates who struggle in the arid wastes in the foothills. This is home to the Hamiltons, an Irish immigrant family scraping out a living from its meager topsoil. The interior of the Valley is described as rich and bountiful, and the other family described in the novel, the Trasks, enjoy its fruits. In time these two parties meet, and through their association, their lives are enriched. Steinbeck chooses this novel to introduce the character of Cathy Ames, a monster with the face of an angel. Nowhere in literature is found a more frightening and twisted individual. This evil in the form of innocence is thrust suddenly into the life of Adam Trask, and from here on the novel broadens into a tragic epic. Having entered into a pact with the author the reader is begged to forgive Steinbeck for the various contrivances he employed to bring his story to life. For those who have seen the awful movie with James Dean, forget it. Give Steinbeck the benefit of the doubt and read the novel."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck's East of Eden is a masterpiece. It is at once an epic narrative, a human drama, a journey through lives and generations. It is also a very simple story--that of original sin, of brothers and sons and fathers, of love. You might think that it is long, and it is--but once you get going time will fly because you're having fun!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"You know, from the outset of the description of the Salinas valley, that you are in the hands of a master. Steinbeck takes you on a voyage through American History, and more importantly, deep into the hearts of human beings. The book was long, yes, and sometimes Steinbeck seemed to harp on notions of good and evil; but every chapter seemed to leave me with a fresh and lasting insight on the human experience. As he said in his introduction, the story is meant to be a box full of tales about humanity. A book that everyone should read, swallow, and use as a measure against the world around them."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"If you love drama, or don't get enough in your real life, this book is filled with it. From the beginning you meet two families, one of course is the soul of the book. This of course is the Trask family. First you meet Adam, he of course is this first son, also symbolizing religious aspects. Then you meet his charming bride Kate. If ever there was a bad seed, here it is. By book 2 of East of Eden, the two boys are born. This being Cal and Aaron. Two handsome twins, that in reality are nothing alike. Finally book 3. This is where the James Dean movie comes in. But as usual, this book is not given proper justice in the movie. The total irony of the end, is a complete surprise, and by the end you want more. If ever their was a dysfunctional family, you meet it in the Trask's. I loved this book and can read it over and over again. It is completely unlike his other novels, such as The Pearl, or The Grapes of Wrath. It actually has a little bit of bittersweet justice, that we all have a tendency to enjoy."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"No-one understood human frailty the way Steinbeck did. No-one can talk to me like Steinbeck does in this classic novel. The best review of his book is that of Steinbeck himself:&quot;Nearly everything I have is in it, and it is not full. Pain and excitement are in it, and feeling good or bad and evil thoughts and good thoughts - the pleasure of design and some despair and the indescribable joy of creation.&quot; What would I give to have talked with this giant of a writer!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"When I first sat down with this book, I was afraid that it would be soap-opera blather -- sort of a &quot;Great American Novelist Decides To Write a Harlequin Romance&quot; disaster. Needless to say, I was dramatically wrong; this is the best novel that I have read in a long time. The story is engaging, but never melodramatic; the characters may be simple, but only in the sense that real people are simple too. The theme developed in the book is that all struggles between men are struggles of good and evil. It takes a good writer to be able to write a novel with that theme and never have it seem hokey; it takes a truly great writer to be able to tell the reader, in a short chapter in the middle of the book &quot;This book is the story of good and evil.&quot; In my years of reading so far, I have read only one story that is this much of a fable yet is still memorable, months later, in vivid detail -- that is, of course, the Book of Genesis (Adam/Eve, Cain/Abel, Noah, etc.). I am in no way a religious person, but I am familiar enough with the Old Testament to know that Steinbeck's re-telling of the Cain and Abel story is a masterwork.

The first chapter is boreing and drawn out. BUT, after that first chapter the story grabs on, and never lets go. I LOVED it, and every time I reread it, I love it more. If you can't get through the first chapter, skip it.

It is a book about man's concience; agreat book -- one of the greatest I have read, and its epic storylineis filled with wonderful characters and constant action.The story transcends three generations, the breadth of the countryand several families and explores its characters and their actionsas only Steinbeck can. Read it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Giving this a 2 star because that is to mean \\"I did not like it\\" -- does not mean to report anything about what literary value this novel might have to others.I found this lengthy novel filled with cardboard characters, drawn in broad strokes, nothing nuanced or believable. The narrative voice did not appeal to me, at most times it was omniscient, seeing all that a particular character saw, thought and did. Then, randomly, a first person in the form of a cousin of some of the characters, dropped in and assumed the role of storyteller, only to disappear in short order. This provoked a skeptism of the narrative voice, which was difficult to overcome. Especially given that the narrative voice was repetitive, drawn to long passages of dialogue that seemed not at all like dialogue but more like lectures. And totally devoid of humor, wit or self-deprecation of any sort. Story teller took himself far too seriously, in my opinion.Plot was primarily a repetition of symbol after symbol, good vs evil, self torment unbounded. One driving issue for Steinbeck seeming to revolve around the translation of a verb included in one of the texts included in Old Testament. Great deal of weight given to whether the verb might give man the option of determining his own destiny, as opposed to the \\"Presbyterian\\" idea of pre-determination. So if you think you would like to spend 600 pages on this issue, and if you believe understanding man's destiny hinges on this translated verb from an ancient writer's text, then this is your book, I suppose."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is probably Steinbeck\\"s best work. I read it when I was 14 or 15 yeaars old and am now reading it again at age 50. My public library had an old yellowed copy which I could not read. Great book, read or read it again. I was dissappointed with the typeface, way too small but the work holds up."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Finally! This was quick, simple, and they sent a used book which was exactly in the perfect condition they described...... the package even had a small smiley face with a note to enjoy. Corny? Maybe, but I felt like a real person took an interest in wrapping and mailing this spell-binding classic story of good and evil in which the characters are as alive and real today as they were in the early 1900's. This is truly a book to keep and re-read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This was a good book but I cannot rave about it. I enjoyed wondering about Adam Trask's life with its ups and downs. The characters were very fascinating and the story line easily fit many of the characters into the events naturally. Yet, in this day and age, there seems little astonishing about the book. The whorehouse and the description of Cathy/Kate are heard everyday from city life. I hear about more unusual lives from the morning news. Yes, I know unusualness was not the purpose of this book. It was written so that we can see how relationships, lies, and love affect the normal and abnormal person (if there is such a thing). Relationships become the corner stone of our lives and build us to our full potential or in some cases break us down to nothing. So, choose your friends and family wisely."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I just finished East of Eden by John Steinbeck, one of the greatest American novelists. Though it wasn't this novel that inspired Bruce Springsteen to write his father trilogy (Adam raised a Cain, Independence Day and my Father's House) it might as well have been the similarities are startling, both between the author and the singer as between the novel and the songs. Both Springsteen and Steinbeck are autodidacts when it comes to social and religious matters, both have been known to weave that subject matter into their works. The most pronounced link between Springsteen and Steinbeck might be Grapes of Wrath but East of Eden shows that Bruce attraction to Steinbeck is far from coincidental. In short the novel deals with the heritage of sin. Steinbeck modeled his novel to Genesis and especially to the story of Cain and Abel. The novel is a slow unraveling of a family drama over three generations, with the focus on the last two. It was his most ambitious yet controversial novel at the time. Although the novel works at various levels, the level of inter familiar relationships is where the relation to Springsteen's music strikes the clearest chord.In the centre of the novel is the upbringing of Cal(eb) and A(a)ron, the twin \\"sons\\" of Adam Trask. Their youth is plagued by the secret and sins of their parents. Unbeknownst to the twins their true father is Adam's brother Charles. Their mother, Kathy, they are told died at birth although in fact she rejected her marriage, her children and all that is good. Kathy ran of after giving birth to Salinas where she runs a brothel. When the oldest born, Cal, finds out he's is burdened by this. Cal feels his mother's sin in his blood, experiences it as something he barely can escape. \\"In the darkness of your room, your mother calls you by your true name, You remember the faces, the places, the names, You know it's never over it's relentless as the rain, Adam raised a Cain\\" Springsteen sings; \\"You inherit the sins, you inherit the flames\\", the song continues. Both the novel and the song pose a question. Is sin something we inherit out of the pain of our parents, is it in our blood, can we possibly escape the trappings our parent set for us.In the novel the question around the heritage of sin is discussed in length. Ironically it takes a Chinese servant, Lee, to shed some light on the case. Almost as if Steinbeck wants to tell us we need a foreign view to understand ourselves, to show us our trappings, to be our mirror. Thought Steinbeck might also have wanted to stress the universality the heritage of sin. Anybody who's ever read close into the Bible already knows that it's not free of contradiction and mystery, some of it spurns from translation as not all Hebrew let's itself easily translated in other languages. Steinbeck shows us through Lee that the whole notion of heritage of sin might be as a result of clumsy translation. In the King James Bible God promises Cain he'll conquer sin, where as in the American standard Bible Cain is commanded to rule over sin. \\"Thou shalt rule\\" or \\"Do thou rule\\", two translations, a world of difference. Both seem to imply we inherit sin, but the way we conquer sin differs. In the first God takes away our sin, in the second He commands us to stay free of sin. In both cases man is left without will. It has been decided for him what sin is and that it must be conquered, the only difference is who does it. God or man himself by command. The translation drives from the Hebrew \\"Timshel\\", more purely translated \\"Thou mayest\\", implying a far more open question, leaving it open for man if he'll recognize sin and if he'll conquer sin. Steinbeck in East of Eden radically reinterprets the Bible giving us free will and choice, close to making God irrelevant. If we have free will and choice, if we can decide for ourselves independently, God is no longer all powerful. Not only that, it means we can shake ourselves free from our heritage.This realisation is close to the understanding Springsteen reaches in Independence Day.\\"Well Papa go to bed now it's getting lateNothing we can say is gonna change anything nowI'll be leaving in the morning from St. Mary's GateWe wouldn't change this thing even if we could somehowCause the darkness of this house has got the best of usThere's a darkness in this town that's got us tooBut they can't touch me nowAnd you can't touch me nowThey ain't gonna do to meWhat I watched them do to you\\"In Independence Day is enclosed the realisation that the past cannot be chanced, it is something we carry with us and between us the rest of our (joint) lives. But Independence Day is also an affirmation of free will. In this song it seems that Springsteen no longer feels trapped in his heritage, he starts to make his own choices. The darkness can no longer touch him he exclaims and Springsteen decides on a different path as the one his father set out on or may have intended for him. The analogy is almost Biblical. Cast out of the Garden man set out on his own path making choices God neither intended nor wished for us but we have made with the free will installed in us.With the unravelling of the novel Steinbeck starts to focus more and more on Cal and his relationship to his father. Steinbeck lets Cal play out a question that troubled him in the Bible. Why would God take preference over Abel's offer, does God have preferences, does he love some more than others. Steinbeck also shows our basic human need for recognition, our need to be accepted as full individuals by our parents as he lets the triangular relationship between Cal, Aron and Adam unravel. In the novel Aron develops as character that seems to meet Adam's wishes and desires. Adam sees in Aron the son he wanted, in Cal he seems to see the negative no matter how hard he tries, in his mind affirming the Sin he must have inherited from his mother, affirming he's no good. Although Cal has declared his independence earlier in the novel, his hunger for recognition fails to die causing him to hate his brother and hurt him severely. When Cal asks for his father's forgiveness and acceptance on his dying bed Adam just says Timshel, he may give him that, leaving the question unresolved but also leaving the choice of acceptance and forgiveness with Cal. He is left to forgive himself, he is left to accept himself, he is left with his own choices for bad or good despite how his father may perceive him.A same kind of sentiment seems to breathe from \\"My Father's House\\", the song where Springsteen revisits his Father, looking for some closure but finding none. \\"My father's house shines hard and bright it stands like a beacon calling me in the night, Calling and calling, so cold and alone, Shining 'cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned\\""},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I enjoyed Steinbeck's big novel. I once lived not far from Salinas and the feel of the land and people came back to me.The characters seem to live soap opera lives, though this novel could not have been faithfully filmed in 1952. Some of the language seems orotund, but Steinbeck is careful to put such talk in the mouths of exceptional \\"characters,\\" purposefully stylized to carry the novel's ideas. (I wish I knew men like Samuel and Lee.)Steinbeck's prose rarely draws attention to itself. You keep turning the pages because of the couplings, shootings, deaths and inspirations over three generations. I am uncertain if the casual style is to his credit. I think the book could have been better written, yet kept its commonplace language. But, how much can you change something before a new essence is created?That question goes to the heart of this book. From the outset you know this work is highly ambitious. Genesis contributes symbols and nudges themes. For most of my life, I have brooded over events and tried to track down their causes. Are things pre-ordained or is volition real? Do people have an immutable nature or does the warp and woof of becoming change their being? This argument continues to rage and one can find it beneath many disputes in biology, religion and politics. As I read through the novel, I kept a mental balance sheet to see how Steinbeck would ultimately apportion it. Would the mark of Cain be passed on or would sweet love and reason triumph?I am happy in the outcome. Neither side wins, but both remain on the field. It's an American ending from this most American of novelists."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"One of the most significant vignettes in this book appears in the opening to Chapter 13, wherein Steinbeck appropriately recognizes humans as our planet's sole creative species, and champions the concept of individuality.He wrote, \\"And this I believe: that the free, exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable thing in the world. And this I would fight for: the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes undirected. And this I must fight against: any idea, religion, or government which limits or destroys the individual. This is what I am and what I am about. I can understand why a system built on a pattern must try to destroy the free mind, for that is one thing which can by inspection destroy such a system. Surely I can understand this, and I hate it and I will fight against it to preserve the one thing that separates us from the uncreative beasts. If the glory can be killed, we are lost.\\"This is part of the reason a book such as \\"East of Eden\\" will continue to be read for pleasure, for study and for enlightenment -- whereas some communistic political hack's ghost-written piecemeal autobiography is destined by its nature to be a mere flash in the pan, and nobody will ever read it again after she has departed the stage."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is the story of the everyman. It exemplifies the idea of good and bad living within one person, and the idea that doing the right thing is always a choice, a statement of free will. This idea is not professed by perfect people, as the perfectly evil and the perfectly good in the novel are the exceptions. Those who don't fit in, don't have the ability to understand the choice, perish by their own hands. This books is about the decendents of Cain, you and I. Flawed, but forgivible. After all, God did not kill Cain, but sent him into the world."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I thought the review below by bluejaye99 to be particularly interesting. I dont think Steinbeck is in the absolute top rank (with, say James or Faulkner or Twain) but he is a fine story teller who uses words much more fluidly than most American writers. Yes, this book has its clumsy parts, but it is easy to read and makes an impressive beach book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is not a story. Rather it is a collection of stories about semi-related events occurring over a period of about 50 years, which in and of itself would not be such a bad thing, but East of Eden is so long! The style of Steinbeck's prose is erratic at best which, again, wouldn't be so unpleasant if East of Eden weren't trying to pass itself off as a novel. The basis of the story's symbolism is evident from the first chapter, but Steinbeck doesn't stop there. He hammers his message home with a three ton sledgehammer that is about as subtle as a train wreck. For example, each generation in East of Eden has a Cain character and an Abel character, and Steinbeck dives relatively deep when he begins the name of the corresponding characters with a &quot;C&quot; and an &quot;A&quot;. That seems to be the limit of his subtlety as this bludgeoning draws slowly out over the torturous course of over seven hundred pages, finally grinding to a leadenly melodramatic finish. And yet, at the end of this gruelling road, the message is still frustratingly vague. The reader has suffered for nothing. The sporadic insertion of episodes totally unrelated to the rest of the book is reminiscent of bits of trash floating in a river of sludge from some factory's drain pipe. John Steinbeck is that factory, and in East of Eden he pumps out page after page of superficial writing. As Steinbeck would, were he writing this review, extend the metaphor beyond its use, one might even consider East of Eden a waste product from the creation of masterpieces such as The Grapes of Wrath and Tortilla Flat.I see that East of Eden might contain a modicum of interest for students of Steinbeck (I myself have researched the man and used this book to defend a thesis), but someone looking to become acquainted for the first time with the power that Steinbeck can wield would be better served by The Red Pony or one of the afore-mentioned alternatives."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"If you've read any of Steinbeck's other books, don't expect anything different from this one. You either love him or you hate him. I've never been a fan of his, but it had been a while and having made such an impression on Oprah, I decided to give East of Eden a shot.It seems trite to say the book was depressing, but heck, it was really depressing. The message is that we all have free will, but that's not breaking news to me and reading it was too much like tedious homework. The lesson was conveyed and learned, but it was not an enjoyable process. I just couldn't connect with the characters which, in my humble opinion, were never developed enough to incite any real empathy from me. I just watched on in disgust.In looking back, I recognize the genius and the simplicity of the theme and how he incorporated it into the novel. I'll also admit (reluctantly) that the book was very well written and successfully delivered the message. I applaud Steinbeck's writing skills, which is the only reason I gave it 3 stars.Alas, in the spirit of the book, we all have free will, so I won't choose to read Steinbeck again. I was disappointed in the read, but I'm sure my book club's discussion will be interesting. If you are in a book club or want something to talk about at the water cooler, then have at it. If you are just getting back into reading or looking for a good book to sink into, I would suggest you look elsewhere. If you don't know where to start, look at the reviews from a favorite book, find someone who had a similar opinion and look at that persons lists and other reviews. I've found some real gems that way."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I first read EAST OF EDEN when I was in my early teen years and remembered I was absolutely captivated by it. (I had run out of reading material and raided my mother's bookshelves at the time) I remembered the story read as a sort of soap opera with larger than life characters and I simply couldn't wait to find out what would happen next. It also helped that the novel takes place in California - where I live - and that just seemed to add to my enjoyment.So, when I picked this novel up again I was very much looking forward to it once again. I felt I would be re-visiting a few old friends. I was to be sadly mistaken. Unfortunately, this go round I found this novel tedious and mostly boring. Gone were the larger than life characters. They had been replaced with people who seemed more unreal than anything else. Steinbeck rambles and meanders - a lot - to the point where I wanted to simply skip entire chapters or yell, \\"Get to the point!\\" He wrote this book towards the end of his career, and during a very bleak time in his life, and it seems to show. There is no focus. Steinbeck takes the reader on a long, rambling walk over the hills of California and when it concludes, we've no idea why we went or for what purpose. I doubt Steinbeck knew, either.I think the biggest problem I have this go round that I didn't have when I read this book the first time, is that I compare it to THE GRAPES OF WRATH. By far, this novel comes far, far short of that one, and that is perhaps where I'm making my error.The language of Steinbeck is beautiful, there can be no doubt. He can truly transport a reader to another place and time! But I would recommend that if one decides to read only one Steinbeck novel in their life, let it be GRAPES OF WRATH, and not this one. It is a far better written book and far more important one as well. However, if one feels s/he wants to tackle this project, just be prepared that it is not easy to wade through. It is tedious, more than a bit boring at times, and very easy to put down. However, one may find it worthwhile in the end."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden was one of the most remarkable tales of betrayal, brotherhood, and just simply finding \\"yourself\\". John Steinback is a wonderful author and he caught me almost from the start with this book.Most of all, I really enjoyed Steinback's style of writing. Just the way he writes makes you want to read more. First, there is Cathy, when you read about her it's almost like she is right there next to you. Growing up as a whore, she gets lost within strange thoughts, and is almost \\"devilish\\". After murdering her parents in a house fire, which was only the start of her terror, she runs off and isn't heard of for a long time.Then there is Adam, an almost robotic man, who isn't alive or dead. He just exists. He is very much in love with Cathy and his life revolves around her. She has other ideas though. She cheats Adam on their wedding night and leaves him after her twin boys are born.The two brothers relationship is also a very good example of Steinback's writing. They have a very realistic care towards each other. They would get a long very well, then get in a massive fight and one would leave.Throughout the book, it was easy for me to \\"paint a picture\\" of exactly what is going on Whether it be the setting or characters, it was all very vivid.The only downside for me was I had a difficult time getting into the book and following it at the beginning. But, honestly, once you start getting what is going on you won't be able to stop reading it. So that was the only thing I didn't like because it was a REALLY good book and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys getting into books with style, great characters, and close to the realistic events that happen in life."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have yet to read a poor Steinbeck book and I think this was his all-time best (Grapes of Wrath is a close second). The author has an interesting take on the Cain & Abel story. Basically, depending on which bible you read it has a different translation. Depending on which you choose to accept, that is how you should lead your own life.Great characters and impossible to put down. One of the few old books where I have seen an Asian character as a very deep philosophical person."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I grew up reading Steinbeck, and i love everything about him. His colourful landscapes, or the unique characters, and the poetic style of every novel. East of Eden ranks amongst the finest of Steinbeck's work, along with The grapes of Wrath and Of mice and men, but also the lesser known works which also astounded me, like To a god unknown. The length of this novel should not put anyone off, as it is an easy read that you won't want to put down. You'll end up wishing it was longer. This is a perfectly epic construe of literature. It is also great to see the recent revival of interest in this book, and many others like it. It gives the choice of reading back to the reader.This is a modern fable, and one that should last as long as the ones from the bible upon which Steinbeck constantly plays."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The book is great, don't get me wrong. The problem is that the centennial edition published by penguin has typos. Lots and lots of typos. An embarrassing amount of typos. Great literature deserves better proofreading."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck does a wonderful job of exploring the age-old theme of good vs. evil."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have no earthly notion why Oprah selected a Steinbeck work of this magnitude and scope to resurrect her book club. However, maybe without Oprah's generous promotional efforts, this particular work by John Steinbeck (1902-68) might have remained the obscure and enigmatic masterpiece that it is. Keen movie buffs will recall the attempt some thirty-odd (or more?) years ago to convert this novel into a movie [executed appropriately in funereal black and white, instead of in dazzling color ... despite the sunny brilliance of California's Salinas Valley]. The brooding actor James Dean had the role of brother Caleb, who vies for the affection and approval of his father, played imperially by Anthony Quinn. The movie version was not at all a box-office success mainly because, in my view, the story was so amazingly intricate and overwhelming with its ponderously convoluted psychological elements. The same is true about the novel: multi-layered in approach, tone, and structure, resulting in constant nervous tension and anguish. But then who would dare argue with a giant of such innovative literary artistry as Nobel Prize (1962) winning author John Steinbeck? At some point shortly after after the initial publication of this novel (1952), Steinbeck himself publically alluded to the \\"difficulty\\" (e.i.,complexity) of this powerfully dramatic work. He was totally pleased with his creation. And difficult, indeed, is this novel. I know I'm dating myself, but so what? Does anyone remember those essential Cliff Notes that regularly accompanied literary Master Works? Well, there was one for EAST OF EDEN. Believe me, this handy little yellow booklet proved indispensable to some readers 'back in the day.' A Masterful Read, so enjoy."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck depicts three generations of human beings for whom life is the most cruel teacher or torturer you can imagine. More cruelty cannot exist in life, in any human being's life, except within deportation to a slow torturing extermination camp. John Steinbeck is the American Emile Zola.And yet he finds his inspiration in Genesis, Chapter 4, verses 1-16, the story of Abel and Cain, of Abel slain by Cain and Cain punished by God with a phenomenal promotion since his descendants will be the inventors of cities, music, metallurgy and a few other essential human inventions. Many people would like to be cursed to do that. Steinbeck stops though before that future and terminates the story on the curse from God and the mark Cain will carry to protect him against an accidental and fast end, hence to enjoy his curse as long as possible. That's the God of Genesis. But a lot more about it in the novel and this review.The whole novel centers on the reading in King James Bible of the passage in Genesis quoted above and then a discussion about the translation and meaning of verse 7. The exploration of the meaning of that verse is conducted by the Chinese servant of the central character Adam (in the Bible the father of Abel and Cain), the perfectly named man since we are dealing with the descent of the first human beings in the Garden of Eden and then out of it. This verse 7 has two translations. In King James version Jehovah says:\\"If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.\\"The meaning is a promise from God to Cain, a prediction that comes from some higher authority, in a way a contract with God, with this higher authority. But in the American Standard Bible, the end of the answer is:\\"Do thou rule over it.\\"And that is an order from God to Cain (an interrogative form would have used \\"doest\\").Our Chinese servant, Lee, with the help of four learned Chinese in San Francisco and two rabbis, cuts the Gordian knot of these two translations and readings that are both wrong. They go back to Hebrew and the word concerned here is Timshel and this word means \\"thou mayest rule over him.\\" Lee identifies this as the possibility of a choice on Cain's side: the choice to rule over sin or be ruled over by sin. It is an eventuality expressed my \\"mayest\\" that leaves the choice open, unpredicted and unordered, and it could even be seen as a permission from God that gives Cain the initiative and responsibility to do or not to do. Neither a prediction for sure nor an order definitely.I am of course not going to tell the story but it is easy to show how Steinbeck invests this biblical reference in the novel from beginning to end. The reference to the Garden of Eden in Chapter 15-3 and the Eves who like apples. Four mentions of Genesis Chapter 4 in Chapter 24-2, in Chapter 47-2, in Chapter 54-1, in Chapter 55-3, one sentence and six words before the final period.Numerous other mentions of Cain's crime and punishment are scattered in the book but what is more visible is the use of the couple of initials C and A.First generation. A certain Cyrus Trask with an unnamed Mrs Trask who is Absent as soon as the second page procreates Adam. Later with his second wife Alice he provides Adam with a brother Charles. That's the second generation and the love and hostility between the two brothers are exposed in much detail. It will not lead to the death of Charles, but Adam will move west to California abandoning his brother to whom he will only write some fifteen years later to find out that he is dead. Charles' death, and his being killed by Adam is purely elliptical, purely symbolical.Charles will have no descendants.Adam runs away from Charles in Connecticut to California, the Salinas valley with a wounded woman they both recuperated on their door step. She is called Cathy and from what we know she killed her parents and was severely beaten up by what amounts to her pimp when she rebelled against him. Adam falls in absolute blind love with her and Charles wants her away as soon as possible. Adam will take her to California against her will but after she has had one sexual night with Charles. She will be discovered pregnant in California but with twin boys, false twins, the two being very different.As soon as the boys are delivered and Cathy is strong enough to walk, she leaves Adam and the boys in the sole hands of Adam's servant Lee. She shoots Adam before leaving to prevent him from preventing her from going away. That episode will ruin Adam's life and energy and he will end up living on the inheritance he got from his own father and had shared with his brother.The two boys will be named, from the Bible, under the strong initiative of a neighbour who is under the strong order from his Bible-bound wife. The boys will be named without surprise Caleb for the dark one and Aaron fro the blond one, later shortened to Cal and Aron, both from the Bible. Aaron, the brother of Moses, and his spokesman, later the high priest of the Jews when leaving Egypt, is also the one who brought the golden calf into existence. He will not go into the Promised Land just like Moses himself. Caleb takes part in the Exodus and will be one of the twelve scouts who see the Promised Land and he will, along with Joshua, advocate immediate taking possession of it. Moses and Aaron will stay behind and never get to it. These facts are not mentioned or alluded to in the novel. That C - A couple is loaded with a lot of meaning.Cathy becomes Kate and a Madame in Salinas. She will finally die remembering her favorite literary character that helped her escape her parents, and eventually kill them, i.e. Alice in Wonderland. Another C - A ouple, even if virtual.Adam will not remarry but will live with his Chinese Servant who will take care of the children. This Lee is essential in the whole novel. At the end of the novel, the nurse who will take care of Adam for a very short period of time will call him a chink and Charley, creating thus an A - C couple. Adam is thus taken between two Cs: Cathy/Kate - Adam - Chink/Charley. Of course the nickname Charley is an allusion to Charles, Adam's brother and probably a mental embodiment of this brother of his that he had abandoned to his own slow and lonely fate and death.The love and hostility between Caleb and Aron will naturally be the main course of the novel. They are Abel and Cain, Aron having the project of raising hares, hence be a herdsman like Abel, and Caleb of cultivating his father's farm, hence be a farmer like Cain. This is stated in Chapter 22-4, just after the first reading of Genesis Chapter 14:1-16 in King James Bible. It is the strong \\"thou shalt rule\\" prediction of verse 7 of this story that will determine Lee's research because he disagrees with that fatality: for him a human being is human because he always keeps the capability to choose, to operate his free choosing power.This third generation will relive the drama of their father with the girl who will intrude into the story. She is called Abra (her father wanted a boy and would have called him Abraham, both like Lincoln and like the patriarch in the Bible who is ready to sacrifice his own son Isaac - or Ishmael - on the simple command from God.) Abra will fall in love with the beautiful blond Aron, but it will eventually not work because Aron is pure and dreams her as pure, and after Aron's death she will move to Caleb who is bad just the way she is bad. And that will be another C and A couple. We have to be very careful with the use fo bad or pure in this novel. Both words are mythical and if they are mystical in a way it is essentially because they are full of mist.Aron will die in France in 1918 after enlisting for the war because he is led to his mother Cathy/Kate who he did not know before by Caleb - out of spite because Aron had been preferred by Adam and Caleb had been severely and unfairly if not unjustly rejected - and Aron thus discovers she is a Madame in a house of ill fame next door to his own family home. Another C - A - C triad surges and turns very bad in this case, Caleb - Aron - Cathy/Kate. Then Aron cannot accept this for him abominable fact that proves he is rotten at the core in spite of his absolute dream of being virginally pure.I will of course not give the many details but the biblical fable is led to the worse possible ending. Caleb's initiative, caused by Adam's rejection of Caleb, leads to the death of Aron and this death leads to a bad end for Adam. Caleb in other words kills two birds with one stone, though we could consider Adam killed the two birds with one stone. It is in fact this second interpretation that the intervention of Lee in a new triad Chink/Charley - Adam - Caleb will bring, the only moment of relief of the book with the final word \\"Timshel\\" that opens the door to the couple Caleb - Abra and a next generation. Knowing the cursing nature of God, and John Steinbeck, I would be surprised if that fourth generation were not plagued with more curses. Isn't the punishment of god to be carried out till the seventh generation?This fateful, cursed and remorseless story is told to us with an avalanche of details that we just cannot stop reading - even though the story telling itself is slow - and we are torn open with compassion, empathy, remorse, sorrow and an ocean of love and hate for Caleb who is thus turned into a plaything in the hands of God. In fact this can expand to all the male characters and a little to the female characters who are few: Cathy/Kate who is the born and everlasting ever-regenerating doomster and doom-generator in human life; and Abra who is a promise who defines herself as bad, and that is a promise indeed.The last Cain-like son and brother, if he is really saved, is saved by the alliance of the Chink/Chinese/Charley Lee with Abra, a son who was a girl and who will be a wife since she cannot be a brother and that might break the mould of the curse. The final word will come from Adam and it will be \\"timshel\\" but will that mean freedom or just the introduction to the next Caleb - Abra cursed couple in line with producing the next generation of Cain and Abel, of doomed brothers? That we cannot know and I won't tell what I may think. I shall not tell and don't tell me to tell because I may do what I freely want to do, tell or not tell included.What is left to say after this long dissertation? Not much at all. John Steinbeck's style is his own and some sentences are hard to get because they contain quite a few dangling modifiers.This book is also the enlightenment that gives the meaning of later books like Of Mice and Men, the story of two disproportionate \\"brothers\\", the big one called Lennie Small being in the end killed by the little one called George Milton, a visionary name and person who was able to imagine and describe the promised land of a farm on which Lennie would have been happy and protected.And we are not surprised the dog Steinbeck will travel with at the end of his life was called Charley. The subservient loving friend that Lee was all along in this novel whose title is taken from Genesis, Chapter 4. And when Caleb is asked by his father at the end where his brother Aron is he naturally answers \\"Am I supposed to look after him?\\" an echo to Cain's answer to God's question in King James Bible or the American Standard Version : \\"I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?\\"This answer turns Adam into God himself since he is the one who asked the question: \\"Do you know where your brother is?\\"Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I love to read family sagas and that is basically what this book is about - the story of two families - the Hamiltons and the Trasks and the background of these families' story is mostly the Salina Valley in California. This book is partly based on the author's life, or more accurately, that of his maternal family (the Hamiltons); in fact, John Steinbeck narrates the story - he is Olive's son and Samuel Hamilton's grandson. I have also read (Oprah's Book Club) that Cathy's character is based loosely on his experiences with his second wife Gwyndolyn \\"Gwyn\\" Conger.This is primarily a book about brothers and their relationship - their rivalry, their love for each other and their guilt. It is a book about Cain and Abel and how the story is recounted time and time again throughout history.All in all, \\"East of Eden\\" is great \\"storytelling\\" and a fabulous book to read for leisure, but don't expect much more than pure fun out of it. Important characters are flat (but others are so wonderfully complex and rich - like Samuel Hamilton and Lee for instance!), and the story is very melodramatic and appeals too much to cheap sentimentality; that said, it is beautifully told and I highly recommend it.I wrote a more thorough review which you can read at my blog \\"52 Books in 52 Weeks - A personal quest to improve my writing in English.\\""},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"There may be no greater threat to good fiction than high-school literature reading lists, unless it is a critic who believes that having possibly read a book in high school he remembers the book, or understood it if he did read it.I have heard it said that no one should be allowed to read Twain until he has passed his fiftieth birthday. I think you will find the same is true of most good literature, in this case \\"East of Eden.\\"You have not read the book recently? You only remember the movie (based on only the last quarter of the book)? Maybe it was assigned by a teacher.

Many of us have done it, many will continue to do it.What high school student can possibly understand Samuel's statement \\"You know, Lee, I think of my life as a kind of music, not always good music but still having form and melody. And my life has not been a full orchestra for a long time now. A single note only - and that note unchanging sorrow. I'm not alone in my attitude, Lee. It seems to me that too many of us conceive of a life as ending in defeat.\\" As far as that goes, is it possible for a high school student to conceive of the end of life for either them or their friends? How many funerals do you have to go to before you understand Adam's knowledge that it would be unthinkable not to go to Samuel's funeral, but at the same time have to maintain his knowledge that Samuel was not dead? Sure it's easy to wonder why Adam can't see through Cathy, but it takes only one failed marriage to come to the beginning of an understanding. How many people do you have to know to comprehend the sorrow that drives Tom to suicide when his sister dies?As the author says \\"Nearly everything I have is in it, and it is not full. Pain and excitement are in it, and feeling good or bad and evil thoughts and good thoughts - the pleasure of design and some despair and the indescribable joy of creation.\\" Perhaps, just perhaps, the problem most people who attempt to review this book have is that it has been too long since they read it. This book has been around for over fifty years. Many of us read (or were supposed to have read) it in high school. Many who did think they remember it, or that they understood it.It is an adult book.

I strongly recommend readers to have an affirmative grasp on the Bible before reading the novel. It was not until my friend mentioned some major themes of the Bible that I fully understand the Steinbeck's intentions. The themes that prevail in this novel are family values, free will, and the ultimate choice of good vs. evil. Note: the reader can understand the novel without a strong biblical background, but one will gain so much more if one is able to incorporate the novel's themes with that of the bible.

While he develops his thesis wonderfully by spinning a modern day version of the Biblical &quot;myth&quot; of Cain an Abel, and while he lovingly develops the characters of Cal, Lee, Sam Hamilton, and Abra, he simultaneously vents his spleen's bitterness against women, Christians, and especially Christian women. I felt over and over that Steinbeck had nurtured his prejudices and was using this novel as a means of lashing out at former lovers, Sunday school teachers, aunts and any other woman who had any level of conviction and authority over him at any point in his life. Beyond Cathy, the human personification of Satan (literally), each and every woman character in the book is demeaned until we finally meet Abra, the liberated teenager who is more like Steinbeck's male characters than any of his female characters. By the end of the book I was tired of his cranky and pedantic &quot;macho&quot;/independent voice.

I will say that East of Eden is basically a grand morality play using the Biblical Story of Cain and Abel as its backdrop.As in Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck throws in chapters that are very omniscient in scope, some might even say Biblical in tone. It is in one of these chapters that Steinbeck basically asks the reader to make a choice between good and evil in his or her life. I had to stop reading at that point and just think for a little while....that is the sign of a great author at the top of his game!Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Our book club had a lively discussion about it. Steinbeck made his characters come alive as did the various settings. It's timeless!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I liked \\"figuring out\\" the biblical parallels, and didn't mind that some of the characters weren't entirely believable, as some critics have pointed out."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I enjoyed this book. Steinbeck used Genesis and the story of Cain and Abel as a setting for the characters in this novel. It is amazing the magnitude of abuse a parent can thrust on a child, how a child can endure that abuse, then end up being horribly abused by a spouse who also had no maternal instinct or feelings whatsoever for their children. Her lack of any emotion at all except hate almost makes Cathy inhuman, an evil presence that those around her feel, but can't quite put their finger on what is different about her. All that to say that this novel carries some very difficult subjects. In smaller amounts, it carries the love and devotion of family."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I decided to read this book after seeing it on a high school reading list. I must say, for me it started out very slowly, and I couldn't keep up with the seemingly endless list of characters. But it got SO much better, and I found myself unable to put it down.I think if I would have been taught it in school, I would have given it 5 stars, but I wasn't paying attention enough to witness its true beauty.

Steinbeck's best novel by far. I read this as a teenager and reread it recently on a vacation and it was even better the second time. I was so sorry for it to end and to say goodbye to the characters... there isn't much to add that hasn't already been said in previous reviews; but I am thrilled that Oprah featured this book so perhaps more people will pick it up and experience it. A classic, a masterpeice."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Quite simply one of the most brilliant American examinations of the consequences of this kind of popular dichotomy, of our need to classify things in terms of good and evil. One warning to all potential readers, please please please do NOT see the James Dean film they made from this. The novel is incredibly rich. The Trask and other families are amazingly complex and the history of their lives and times is rich. Steinbeck was a brilliant craftsman with a great flair for allegory. James Dean was a moment of teenager angst."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Simply the best book I have ever read.

Hard to argue with that, although Grapes of Wrath, and &#34;Of Mice and Men&#34; are also terrific. An astute observer of how flawed we all are, Steinbeck shows there is hope for us if we choose to make the struggle. Sam Hamilton rises up out of the pages and, I swear, seems to be sitting down with you over coffee to chat and tell you how the world works and what a wondrous thing life is."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Books like this show the reason that John Steinbeck is considered one of the great authors of our lifetime.

The crowning achievement of Steinbeck's lexicon of inspired work. The book is operatic, pondering the burden of free will and spanning generations of a family that constantly struggles to escape itself.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to be moved, inspired, and find their new favorite book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is the best book I've read so far. Steinbeck is amazing at drawing you into the story. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I usually do not read the comments of fellow reviewers at this site (or, in some cases, at least not until after I have written my own). I was, however,interested in finding out whether Steinbeck and his tale still held interest for today's readers. The answer seems to be yes. Moreover, I was also interested in what other people had to say about the symbolic nature of the clash between brothers and its relationship to the old oft-told biblical tales going back to the \`first family'.Damn, life has definitely been tougher since the \`fall' from the garden. The morale to be derived from Steinbeck's novel is, apparently, that while the \`fall of man' under the spell of earthly temptations had its downside humankind is better for the struggle. A strong argument can moreover be made that without that struggle by fallen humankind no serious progress would have been made. That struggle here is epitomized by the characters, tensions and actions of the two brothers (in both generations father Adam's and son Aron's) which makes me believe that that Steinbeck may see this process an eternal struggle and that we are endlessly doomed to roll that rock up the hill just to have it come crashing back down on us.Those who have only seen the 1950's movie version of this novel starring, among others, James Dean and a young Julie Harris have missed some great writing about the effects of the struggle to rebuilt and attempts at redemption in the wake of the fall of Adam Trask and his struggle to change his ways. And through him, his sons. The movie (that I had seen long before reading the book) skips over the compelling first section which deals with the seemingly pre-ordained destruction of Adam, by his \`wife', and his own character, among others. Moreover, in the movie the demonic role of the \`wife' Kathy is glossed over (probably due to the less tolerate and more squeamish mores about \`fallen women' in the 1950's). She is not a \`nice' person. However, in the book she is positvely evil. Read the book and see why we, even the best of us, are all living just East of Eden."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A book that should be slowly savored to the very end."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is truly a novel of biblical proportions. Set in the Salinas Valley of California, where Steinbeck himself grew up, the story follows two generations of the Trask family, the main one consisting of Adam, his two sons Cal and Aron, and their servant Lee. When reading this epic piece of literature, I found myself immersed in the struggles, triumphs, and emotional battles of the characters, who are so thoroughly developed, I felt somewhat connected to them. There is no doubt that the story claims its grand renown predominantly through Steinbeck's ability to capture every facet of human emotion within his characters. They are intriguing, witty, flawed, unfathomable--the exact qualities that make them stand out as so real.What is also interesting about East of Eden is that it not only parallels the story of Cain and Abel, but it explores it in greater depth, exposing the emotions and thoughts of Cal and Aron. This book is all about relationships--the main one being sibling rivalry, a competition between the sons for the father's love and approval. Steinbeck does the story of Cain and Abel justice through his captivating presentation of the classic tale, showing one son who is seemingly perfect, and the other son who finds it difficult to achieve love.This story contains all the elements of a masterpiece: dramatic plot, round characters, intricate relationships, honest writing, and numerous messages about life.I recommend this book to everyone who is literate."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"In what is truly a masterpiece on many levels, John Steinbeck delivers with East of Eden a compelling tale of two families whose lives in the Salinas Valley are fascinating and seemingly intertwined. This novel began as merely a required piece for school, but as I read on, I found myself unable to put it down, often reading late into the night. The characters are realistic and masterfully tied together, their lives tied together, as if by fate. The plot provokes the mind, raising philosophical questions that opened to me different ways to view the world and choices in life. Steinbeck's story-telling is simply wondrous, saturating the novel with detailed descriptions and narration. The fact that this is the centennial edition, still wildly popular and discussed more than a hundred years after it was written, is testament to the allure of the novel. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, regardless of age, as it is an exploration of some of the most important ideals in our society. Steinbeck even stores the essence of the 601 pages into one word- thimshel, a word as important and essential to the story as carpe diem is to Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society, both tales that have enabled me to view the world in a different light, and help me become a better person as a whole."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The book is true to its title as its inner plots follow that of biblical stories of Cain and Abel, Adam and Eve and Jezebel.Now don't be discouraged. This book is full of shocking moments that will beg you to not stop reading, which is good because the book is very long. Each page will keep you wanting more as you strive to understand the connections between the bible and this book seemingly filled with evil characters whose only intentions are murdering their loved ones.Watch as the lives of several different families become connected and good and evil switch bodies. Everything that you thought was true in the beginning begins to take a path much more different than you ever though it would.Who is good and who is evil?Who will ultimately win?These questions also help to outline the major struggle in the book over being good or evil. Some are born with evil already buried deep inside them and others must choose for themselves whether they will be evil or choose to be good. The word \\"timshel\\" or \\"thou mayest\\" takes on new meanings and becomes the center of the story as it lets the characters know that they do have a say in their lives. They choose their own destinies and can decide that they will not be evil, even if they feel that everything else in the world is making them so. They have the final decision, not anything else in the world. What are your choices?"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This riveting novel is a must read for anyone, let alone a Steinbeck afficionado. The many twists and turns in the intertwining plot(s) of this novel require much attentiveness to track and piece together. Reading this novel is an adventure in itself, as Steinbeck lays out the pieces of the plot of his novel thoughtfully and carefully reveals them one at a time to create a linking time puzzle that only gets more compelling as the pages go by.Steinbeck's diction is strong and although the plot is slow to unravel, the book picks up speed after the first segment that lays the foundation for the rest of the novel. Every page nonetheless offers something interesting and captures both your attention and your wit. This is a novel that you would definitely call \\"smart,\\" as it takes pondering to finally piece together the final meaning of the book.Without a doubt, this novel will leave you thinking, \\"Wow, I would of never thought of it ending like that.\\" For any reader who appreciates fine writing, this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East Of Eden is a remarkable novel surrounding family and love written by John Steinbeck. Despite its intimidating size and thickness, the book is actually quite enjoyable and entertaining. The book presents an astounding story filled with episodes of love, despair and family. Steinbeck molds the novel to resemble the different situations found in the Genesis of the Bible: the tale of Adam and Eve and the rivalry between Cain and Abel.In this novel, Steinbeck follows the traditional story of a tragic hero alongside his sidekick battling against the evil nemesis. Adam Trask, son of the former Cyrus Trask, finds himself passively living life and attempts to find a way to grasp the days as they progress by. He searches for an essence of life and finds Cathy, whose role is the apparent antagonist of the novel. As Adam is heartlessly abandoned with his twin sons Caleb and Aron, his Chinese servant Lee helps to provide for all of them until Adam, especially, can fully recover. Lee, in my opinion, serves as the essence that Adam has been looking for, the sidekick that heroes need. While Adam drowns in desolation, it is Lee who fosters the children and tends to everybody's needs. Though he has aspirations of his own, he consistently delays them in order to take care of the Trask family.Cathy is immediately labeled as the villain through Steinbeck's dramatic descriptions of her manipulative dark side. Yet Adam was completely oblivious to her deceit that he would have done anything to please her. She eventually abandons him, leaving him hopeless and miserable. This situation alludes to the Bible as Eve betrays Adam after she bites from the forbidden apple. Both women prove to be unfaithful and bring sorrow to their lover's lives.The confusing yet deep rivalry between Caleb and Aron are almost identical to that of the Bible between Cain and Abel. As one is seemingly treated with more recognition and admiration, the other becomes envious and ultimately homicidal. Though in this particular book, Caleb is not at fault for Aron's death, Caleb senses guilt from it and blames himself nonetheless. While in the Bible, Cain deliberately kills Abel as revenge for his mistreatment from God. Ultimately Cain is punished but Caleb also finds peace within himself to not put himself at blame.The immense effect as this captivating novel ties together is just incredible. Each story, each family, each relationship depicts those of real life, which also appeals to the readers. Steinbeck concludes the entire story with the term \\"Timshel\\" as a blessing from Adam to his son. Ending on such a melancholy yet perfected note simply enhances the overall effect the reader gets as the book is closed."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is well-written book, a classic deemed worthy of reading. Steinbeck does a great job of making the piece of literature entertaining. I felt glued to the book many times because the plot would be wonderfully constructed, leading readers on an adventurous journey through the lives of the characters in the Salinas Valley.What surprised me the most were the characters in the story. Each individual character had his or her own unique personality. Each person seemed real and true to life. I would be going through the book and start saying to myself \\"oh this character reminds me of so and so.\\" Plus, the characters are dynamic and many of their personalities are not at the extremes, but instead they have both the good qualities and bad qualities of mankind. I love how I can read into each character and judge him or her through his or her actions. The subtlety in revealing the motives behind each character was astonishing. The way Steinbeck depicted the characters through their dialogue and actions was overwhelming as I soon developed my personal opinion on each character. It made me feel like I was involved in the story itself.Adding to the amazing characters is in intricate, well-developed story line. The plot was complex in that there were many subplots running through the main action. However, when I was reading, the complexity of the story did not hinder my progression because everything seemed to flow. The story was being pieced together in a rhythmic fashion as one event leads to another. The biblical allusion to Cain and Abel was also a fun thing to locate. After reading the story of Cain and Abel, I would go through the East of Eden and get excited when I would notice the similarity or the differences between East of Eden and the biblical story of Cain and Abel. Steinbeck truly does a fascinating job of weaving his story together.Although the book is rather long, the wonderful characters and amazing plot line makes up for it ten times over. East of Eden makes you appreciate good writing."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is truly a work of art. It is much more than a story about two families; in fact it is a sin to call it one. The story explores concepts that are rooted within every family: love, hate, jealousy.Drawing on the book of Genesis and the story of Cain and Abel, Steinbeck creatively weaves a tapestry of the interaction of two familial generations. Much of the story is devoted to explain the brotherly struggles between Charles and Adam (first generation) and Caleb and Aron (second generation).The interactions between the characters are quite amusing, as each pair of brothers try to outdo one another in order to gain their father's love. However, in both cases, the father reluctantly favors the one with an \`A' (Adam/Aron).To say East of Eden as one of the best books ever written would be an understatement. It is much more than a book; it is a story of life. Don't let its length throw you off, every single page is worth it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I really am not sure how I should review this book. East of Eden is mind blowing. It is, without a doubt, Steinbeck's greatest creation. I have not read all of the Steinbeck canon but I have read enough of his major works to know that this tops them all.You'll hear everyone throwing around stuff like \\"retelling of Cain and Abel\\" but that is misleading. Yes, it *is* a retelling of Cain and Abel (twice, actually) but it is so much more than that. Don't constrict your enjoyment of this book based on its parallels. Take it for what it is. It's a magnificent epic story that has some of the deepest characters in American literature. As an example, Kate is one of the most evil characters I've ever read, but she's not just a cardboard character that generally represents evil. Underneath her vile loathsome exterior you can catch the stirrings of a great conflict within her, a desperate desire for love. But Steinbeck doesn't spell it out for you. He doesn't plop it in your lap and say, \\"Think this now about this character.\\" He let's you figure it out. He lets you fill in the blanks. And it's not always too easy to figure out. Don't expect a facile read. But don't expect a boring read either. I never wanted to put this book down.John Steinbeck's characters are amazing. That is his charm. Nobody is all good or all evil, nobody is unconflicted, nobody is always a certain way. And isn't that how we are in real life? \\"East of Eden\\" has characters that are so real that they almost seem unreal. It's not until one looks deeper within the characters that one sees that what a character says isn't always what he means, or that what a character does is not always what he wants to do, etcetera.This book is absolutely mandatory for anyone who calls themself a Steinbeck fan. This book is mandatory for anyone who claims to be a lover of American literature. I would suggest this book to aspiring authors and even actors and directors to get insight into real characters, developed characters, characters that are so human that they don't make sense sometimes.Anyway, read this book. It's worth all 600 pages and then some."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This and \\"Of mice and men\\" have made me a total Steinbeck nut. Im serious, this guy can write! Timshel, I will never forget that word. I really wont, and anyone thats ever read the book will know exactly what Im talking about. I picked this book up after reading \\"of mice and men\\" which totally blew me away, not much caring for the prostituted OPRAH label on it, but because the title was intriguing. It centers in around the themes of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel, not in a religious sense but in more of a human kind form of looking at life. The defects of life and society are portrayed to a point where you really gotta sit back and think for a bit. I loved the characters too. I really felt like i Knew Sam hamilton. I loved it. Pick it up. Its a keeper."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Detailing the intertwining stories of the Trask and Hamilton family, John Steinbeck weaves an amazing story of the many aspects of life. Steinbeck chronicles the development of the Hamilton and the two generations of the Trask family, providing a thorough outlook on life as seen through the characters. Although the volume of the book is daunting, the chronology of events is extremely interesting and enjoyable to read.The first installment of the story centers around the development of the Trask family and the relationship between brothers Charles and Adam Trask, covering a variety of themes that are common to daily life. Charles is extremely competitive and constantly seeks to prove his physical prowess by defeating Adam in matches of ability. Adam, on the other hand, tries to escape his brother's anger by letting Charles take the upper hand, but arouses Charles's jealousy when he wins their father's attention. Charles however, loves his brother, but is incapable of expressing this affection, an issue common amongst siblings. The theme of sibling relationship and rivalry is present in these early chapters of the book, along with motifs of jealousy and love.As the story progresses, Adam falls in lust with Cathy, a beautiful and manipulative girl, quickly advancing the plot. Cathy epitomizes evil as she uses her beauty to her benefit. Upon the birth of their two sons Cal and Aron, Cathy abandons Adam and leaves him to sulk about the house. However, their Chinese servant, Lee assumes responsibility of caring for Cal and Aron, and helping Adam get back on his feet. Throughout the incident, Adam and Lee develop a relationship with and receive help from the Hamilton family, who are of Irish descent, and thus intertwining the two families.In the second installment of the book, Steinbeck chronicles the growth of the second Trask generation, Cal and Aron, who are replicated after the figures of Cain and Abel in the bible. While Aron receives praise and revel in the love and attention of those around him, Cal is enshrouded in his brother's shadow and grows dark and mysterious. However, the progression of events accompanies dramatic changes within each character, emphasizing themes of dark and light and the affection between brothers. The intricate plot makes the book a great choice for those seeking high quality writing and a great read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I agree with other reviewers who said this was a life-changing novel. In my estimation, this novel is second only to \\"Gone With The Wind\\" in terms of excellence. John Steinbeck has created characters that somehow never quite leave you, and a story that keeps you enthralled long after you have finished the novel. If you are interested in seeing the movie, rent the 1981 remake with Jane Seymour, Timothy Bottoms, etc. Although it seems a sacrilege to say it as the great James Dean was in the original, the remake is much better. It follows the book faithfully and is able to explore themes that could not be explored in the 1950s. Jane Seymour, at the height of her beauty, is utterly believable as the evil Kathy."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a true classic in every sense of the word. My book club read it a few years ago (before Oprah announced it as her pick). This is a must read for everybody. To me, it is about how decieving people can be, and how many people seem to be born good or evil. The story is absolutely riveting. I never read ahead in my book club, as we meet every week and agree on a certain stopping place, but I just could not put it down, and finished the entire book in a few days."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A partially autobiographical tale of Steinbeck's own family, EAST OF EDEN is also a re-telling of the biblical tale of Cain and Abel. Two brothers' lives split because of an evil and calculating woman who in turn gives birth to two boys who must face up to their past and find their true natures. One of the finest novels I've read, and one deservedly receiving its just due, at last."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Always reading classics for fun or school, I get really excited when I read a book as phenomenal as this one.The thing that made this book stand out the most to me was what I saw as a magical aura about many of the characters. They all (Adam, Catherine, Lee, Sam Hamilton) have very exaggerated traits that bring out all sorts of facets of humanity. Innocence, evil, rash, thoughtful, acceptance, love, hate--to me, each character seemed to explore one (or more) of those. I felt like I was playing in somebody's head as he went through life.Couple that with the vivid, gorgeous writing, the scenery that Steinbeck evokes of Salinas, and you've got a great book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"First, a large disclaimer. I have become a Steinbeck zealot over this past year and have found all of his work fascinating. I have always gotten to the end of one of his books and wished for more. And the same holds true for this tome, despite its great length, and as in all of his other books, I feel as if I personally know many of the characters and think of them as acquaintances.Plot review: As has been mentioned in other reviews, this is supposed to be a metaphor for Cain and Abel, but it is much more than that. Steinbeck weaves in the philosophy of choosing your own destiny as opposed to accepting your fate, as told in the book of Genesis. To do this, he weaves together many stories of families and does a masterful job of describing the good and evil found in people.Why I liked this book so much: The characters! I wish that I was as powerful with the pen as Steinbeck is so I could properly gush over them. For example --Kate: is the most vile, evil woman I have ever encountered in literature. And not because she is hateful, but because she is totally devoid of any scruples or feeling and only seeks her own gain. She is manipulative and cold and puts on the appropriate facade for whatever it is she is trying to accomplish. She also recognizes the intelligence in her adversary, and strongly dislikes those who see through her facade.Samuel: One of the jolliest, wisest, and most inventive characters you could ever hope to meet. He recognizes his strengths and weaknesses, and he has a thirst for knowledge that is enviable.Lee: The servant who is actually the cornerstone of the main character's family. A wise and learned man who can pretty much do anything he puts his mind to and keeps the family afloat when Adam dulls his senses to the world.These characters all play second fiddle in the Cain/Abel story to Adam, Cal, and Aron, but they are the stars of the show in my eyes.The book does lose its way for a little while, in my mind, when Steinbeck spends alot of time describing the Hamilton family. This part did not add much to the story to me, but I understand he was trying to describe people from his own family in this part. This part is the only reason I rated the book 4 *s instead of 5, and is but a small detractor.This book will cause you to philosophize about choices in your own life, and the characters will possibly cause you to become as much of a Steinbeck addict as I have become."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"What an incredibly written novel portraying the Biblical story of Cain and Abel! I have never come across a book this great. Steinbeck did a marvelous job in putting his thoughts and themes together throughout the book. Each characters is very well defined and each symbolizes either the good or the evil. Thimsel- \\"thou mayest\\" is a Hebrew word that means \\"GOD has given humans the choice to overcome their sins\\". This phrase means a great deal to the novel and in fact, it is the core idea of the novel. A person might inherit characterstics of his predecessors, but he is the one who has the ability choose whether to follow though it or to stand up on his own conscience."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have seen the movie and thought I knew \\"East of Eden\\". I got the book for Christmas and decided to read it. Surprise! The book is a wonderful, in depth story of the lives of many characters against the back drop of the Salinas Valley at the turn of the 20th century. It is a terrific American story. The movie uses only about 15% of the book. I am not as impressed with the movie now that I have read the book. I realize now that the movie is supported by it's fine acting rather than by the story. The story in the movie is really a cut-and-paste job of the book. Read the book. It's a real treat."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"By the time Steinbeck wrote \\"East of Eden,\\" (EOE) he had already written several American classics including \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" and \\"Cannery Row\\" to mention only a few. By then, he was a recognized master of the use of language. He could and did create complex images that evoked a wide range of thoughts and emotions. The first chapter of EOE - where he describes the setting of the Salinas Valley - lets any doubter know that they are reading the product of a magnificent writer.I have sampled a few scholarly reviews of EOE, and I was dumbfounded by the negative tone that critics have used in reference to this novel. Their problem seems to be with the heavy-handed use of symbolism. There are one-sided characters that can be nothing more or less than the idea that they are representing. Cathy is probably the clearest example of this, evil and nothing but evil. Steinbeck also portrays two sets of \\"Cain and Abel\\" brothers who act out variations of the themes of brotherly murder and being a \\"brother's keeper.\\" So, this is an interesting and valid observation.However, the wonders of the book clearly overshadow all else. In addition to the imagery, which is arguably unsurpassed in American writing, he has used the story of his mother's family, the Hamiltons of Salinas Valley, to serve as an historical backdrop for the story of the symbolically challenged Trasks. He has painted a picture of his own beginnings with flair and insight while interweaving the morality tale that creates the tension and vehicle that moves the plot along. This feat is handled seamlessly. Each family is colorful and interesting. Each individual is fully developed. As a result, each page is anticipated and savored.In the end I would say that the \\"scholars\\" need to be careful. Like all subjective evaluations, the judgement of the quality of John Steinbeck's work is relative. Perhaps he did not surpass his greatest accomplishments with EOE. On the other hand, very few novelists have come close to the artistry that flows through this book from beginning to end."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden was stunning in its portrayal of the human soul. It encompasses the Face of Mankind with all its frailities and complexities, failures, struggles, wisdom gleaned and truth discovered in the beauty of our daily lives. The book was a canvas of the human heart- from the dark, innermost monsters and demons that haunt every last one of us to the far reaches to the summit where we discover fleeting joy and light and love. East of Eden is about forgiveness and LEARNING to forgive and acceptance and about choices and the awesome magnitude of free agency and how what each individual does affects everyone around them. East of Eden can be summed up in a word: Sublime. Read it. You won't soon forget it. It is astounding in its narrative clarity and ability to transport the reader into the heart and minds of the characters and the lessons learned within and internalize these truths. Beautiful!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"If Oprah Winfrey was looking to get the American public (and perhaps even the world) interested in reading \\"classic\\" literature she could have not chosen a better selection than John Steinbeck's \\"East of Eden.\\" This is certainly not the \\"tamer\\" Steinbeck that I read in high school English class. While we may not even think twice about it today, \\"Eden\\" must have been simply scandalous when it was originally published in 1952 with murder, prostitution, and adultery just some of the more \\"adult\\" issues explored in this epic novel.Despite its intimidating length, \\"East\\" moves along quickly as we follow the life of Adam Trask - from his East Coast childhood and troubled relationship with his brother to businessman and father of two sons with equally complex relations of their own. As the title suggests, the book is a modern retelling of the biblical story of Cain and Abel story. As with most of the \\"classics,\\" the novel is rife with topics and themes to deeply delve into and discuss with your book club. My only criticisms are that the \\"good vs. evil\\" angle gets a bit heavy-handed at times and, for me, the novel loses some steam in the final quarter - but these are certainly not enough to not heartily recommend the work.The nice thing about \\"Eden\\" is if you choose not to take the \\"literary\\" route, you can still be simply entertained and enthralled by Steinbeck's plot and characters. There is enough suspense and intrigue that make it not terribly different from many of today's bestsellers."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I'm so pleased Oprah chose this book. I feel it's overshadowed by \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" yet so much more powerful. Take the time to get through the first part of the book about the history of the land and region where the book takes place -- it's well worth it to get to the meat of the story. The story follows generations of a family repeating the same cycle of hurt and betrayal parallel to the story of Cain and Abel in the Bible (you only need a cursory knowledge of the biblical story to understand). It's a gripping story, but the message of the book is all about personal choice, how life may throw us curve balls but it is up to us individually to decide how we cope and CHOOSE to live. I read this book almost 20 years ago and it changed the way I view life. More than anything, this book is very empowering and challenges readers to be responsible for actions, or lack thereof, in their lives."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"\\"East of Eden\\" is one of John Steinbeck's most fascinating and disturbing novels; a tale of envy, conflict and betrayal between two generations of brothers - Adam and Charles Trask, and Adam's twin sons, Aron and Caleb. The novel spans the period between the American Civil War and the end of World War I. Adam Trask grew up with his brother, Charles, on a farm in Connecticut. Their father clearly favored gentle Adam throughout their lives, leaving Charles, the wilder and more violent of the two boys, bitter and envious. Charles loved his father and brother deeply, but could never elicit the old man's affection. The jealousy he felt towards Adam gnawed at him constantly, and he finally left home to join the army. The brothers did not see each other for many years. Whenever Charles came home they argued relentlessly. And again Charles would go away. Finally, their father died, leaving both sons a fortune.Cathy Ames, a narcissistic, manipulative girl with few redeeming characteristics, plays a profoundly symbolic role in this Steinbeck novel. When she showed up at the Trask home one evening, beaten and close to death, Adam nursed her back to health. Gulled by Cathy's seeming vulnerability and beauty, he married her. She got him drunk on their wedding night, and while he slept, she had sex with Charles. Adam bought some land outside of Salinas, California, and moved there with his unwilling wife. He wanted to create an Eden for his Eve. Pregnant, and miserable at the thought of becoming a mother, Cathy tried to abort and failed. She stayed in Salinas long enough to give birth to fraternal twins, Aron and Caleb. Soon after their birth, Cathy abandoned her family, shooting her husband in the chest before exiting. Adam was so disturbed by the loss of his wife that he wanted little to do with his sons. The boys were raised by Lee, an Asian hired hand, who cared for them as his own. Samuel Hamilton, a neighbor and local philosopher, visited Adam frequently, attempting to jolt him out of his depression. On one occasion the two men discussed the biblical story of Cain and Able, Mr. Steinbeck's metaphor for this novel.Like their father and uncle, the twins constantly vie for their father's attention. Aron meets a young woman at school and becomes deeply attached to her. She is the first woman to show him affection. Caleb is beside himself with jealousy...and longing.The ensuing conflicts, and unnecessary alienation, between Aron and Caleb are heartbreaking. There is a painful scene when Adam repeats history, and tells Caleb, in spite of all the young man's efforts to please, that he should be more like his brother. The novel, however, does ends on a note of hope and redemption.I don't think Steinbeck's main characters are as fully developed, or as complex, as they could be because he is so intent on drawing similarities between them and their Biblical counterparts. In his retelling of the Cain and Abel story, Adam, Charles, Cathy, Aron and Caleb, are forced to reenact the ancient drama of exile from Eden. However the Biblical references are interesting, and the plot and subplots are tension-filled and moving. His secondary characters, Lee, Samuel, Abra, are beautifully drawn, realistic portraits of believable people. Their stories, histories and motives, are fascinating and add much to this deeply moving masterpiece by John Steinbeck.JANA"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The blurb on the back of this book says that it is a Biblical story, a modern retelling of the Cain and Able story. But it is more than just a clever satire. It is the story of humanity as Steinbeck perceives it, told as an allegory through two generations of two families in the Salinas Valley of California. John Steinbeck reached very far into himself to write this book. He has an incredble insight into human emotions - as I was reading his simple and beautiful prose I felt that he must have known me intimately to write to me so succintly and so personally. As it was written fairly late in his life and his career, one gets the impression that he wanted to tell one final, ultimate story that would last forever. This may be as close to that story as one man can get.The last book I read was Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson.The next book I plan to read is Love in the Time of Cholera, by Gabriel Garcia Marquez."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A fantasic novel with enough twists, turns, descent, heart ache and mental anguish to entrain even the average 21st Centruy reader.I have always enjoyed Steinbeck and after completing \\"East of Eden\\" I truly believe that he is one of, if not the quintessential American author. As accomplished as Hemmingway and Salinger are, Steinbeck has a gift for relating to the most common-place among us. His descriptive talents are unmatched and his flair for the dramatic is remarkable.If you have a few days and are in the market for a fantastic novel by one of our contry's finest authors I must suggest \\"East of Eden.\\""},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The book knocked me around, told me about people I would remember forever, had a historical context that was casual and interesting, and the characters had in and out points meaning from time to time you understood them and other times you didn't. That's what makes them real. The main female character, Cathy Ames, or whichever alias you want to use turned my insides out. I know that I would have easily succumbed to her as many of the characters did. Steinbeck incorporates little side stories that cling like branches to the main story. When I finished it, I threw it across the room. I couldn't have it around me anymore and since I've finished it, I haven't been able to get into another book. I might just have to reread it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"After a long long time I got to read something so fulfilling. Something that one can identify with instantly and it does not take much effort as well. The theme of Brother Vs. Brother is universal and appealing to all. Maybe because as children of Cain, we are all the same - A blend of Good and Bad. Wow!!East of Eden was heavy for me!!Steinbeck is so good at descriptions - love the style of writing, the dry subtle humor- the very fact that he does not justify his character's actions - the struggle of mankind, the inner conflict,is so beautifully portrayed.The Theme: Brother vs. BrotherThe Plot: Two Families in Salinas, California. The Trasks and the Hamiltons. Adam Trask who faces a life-long complex from his brother Charles Trask heads towards a new life - with his brand-new wife. The birth of his twins is a joyous moment only to result in a sad one - with Kathy (his wife) walking out onhim.He raises the kids with his manservant Lee - the ever symbolical of what is right - Chinese - who is a great human character in ages to come.The twins - Aron and Cal are poles apart and the rest is as they say \\"History\\".The Hamiltons are a different breed altogether. Nine children and Samuel Hamilton is a man who never feels the need to have more money.I guess the Biblical influence is immense in the book - but obvious it had to be!!Overall, a great great awesome read!!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"One of the most familiar stories from the Old Testament is thatof Cain and Abel. Because God was more pleased with Abel's gift,Cain murdered his brother and was exiled for the rest of hislife.Cain may have been the first murderer, but unfortunately he wasnot the last. His question, \\"Am I my brother's keeper\\" is ascrucial today as it was then. This crime is famous preciselybecause it is so universal.It is no wonder that novelists have used this story in their own work. One of the most famous of these modern parables is \\"East ofEden\\" by John Steinbeck. In fact, he uses the story at least twotimes.The first part of the novel focuses on two brothers, Charles andAdam Trask. As young boys their conflict began when their fathershows favoritism for Adam and continues throughout their adultlife, culminating on Adam's wedding night when Charles gets himdrunk and sleeps with his new wife.Nine months later Cathy's children (Steinbeck never tells us whothe father is) are born. Their very names, Cal and Aaron, tellsus quickly that the Cain and Abel story is going to be continuedin the new generation, and sure enough, it is. Adam, like hisfather before him, accepts a gift that Aaron gives him andrejects Cal's offering.The result is tragedy, and the search for redemption beginsagain. When Cal asks if he can overcome the evil he finds withinhim, he realizes that the answer is that he may, showing that hehas the power to choose good or evil for himself, a choice thatmakes him great.But the power of this book lies not just within the story itself;the characters Steinbeck draws for us are among the most vivid inmodern literature. In addition to the two sets of brothers isCathy, one of the most corrupt women I have ever encountered.From the time she burns her own parents alive to the way shemanipulates all of the men she encounters, she finds delight inevil.Balanced against her is Samuel Hamilton, a good man who findshappiness in the land on which he lives and his many inventions.When he first meets the Trasks, Adam is devastated because Cathyhas deserted her family to become a prostitute in nearby Salinas.Sam helps him to recover.But my favorite character is Lee, the Chinese sage who plays therole of the typical subservient Chinaman, but who in privateguides Adam and his boys. It is Lee who reveals the meaning ofthe Old Testament verb timshel as \\"thou mayest,\\" giving the giftof freedom to Cain and to us today. And it is Lee who must, atthe end, try to keep this family from destroying itselfcompletely.Steinbeck is a powerful writer, and this is one of his mostpowerful novels. I envy you if this is your first time readingit."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I literally could not put this down. Loose biblical parables have been around forever in literature, but what makes this so great is that it never just cops out by reducing down to one. Maybe the characters are fated or whatever, but they're also among the strongest characters he's written. Who wouldn't want to sit down for a beer with someone like Sam Hamilton or Lee? Who wouldn't want to claw out Cathy Ames's eyes? Who wouldn't want to offer some kind of reassurance to someone like Caleb Trask? A lot of sprawling, multi-generational family novels tend to collapse under their own weight, but Steinbeck is able to ground his so thoroughly in the regional sensibilities and culture of turn of the century California that you never loose a sense of what's happening or why it matters. Forget the Joads and forget George and Lennie, this is the Steinbeck book everyone should read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"First, I must confess my bias as a reviewer ofEast of Eden. This was one of the three most influential books in my life. I first read it as a teen and then reread it 13 years later. I believe John Steinbeck is one of truly great American writers. Readers would do well to look for an unabridged version as many bookstores carry the many edited versions which leave out some of the most poetic descriptions of setting in the literary canon.The entire work metaphor for Genesis, specifically the story of Cain and Abel. If Cain and Abel are unfamiliar, reading the first few chapters of the Hebrew Bible would increase the appreciation for what Steinbeck accomplished. The story works fine independently, but the meaning is that much richer when the biblical inspiration is understood.The first third of the book cover the early life of Adam and Charles Trask, half brothers controlled by an obsessively militaristic father. The one-legged former private trains them with drills, marches, shooting, and discipline from the time they are boys. Charles, the younger brother, is stronger and more fearless than Adam. Adam despises his father's rigidity. In an irony that rings true, it is the latter who ends up doing two tours in the army and the former who embraces the sedentary life of a farmer.The relationship between the brothers is forever altered by the introduction of an injured visitor named Cathy. She wins over one of the brothers. The other loathes her. Cathy is the most important character in the book, though she is very far from a protagonist.The bulk of the narrative takes place in the Salinas Valley, an area deeply imprinted in the early American West. The finest writing of the 20th century may very well lie with Steinbeck's pages of description of the Salinas Valley.Not everyone will like this book. There is no real hero, as in many classic works in the English language. It runs over 700 pages. The pace is closer to an 18th century novel than anything contemporary. Still, the characters are richly drawn and incorporate facets of all mankind. The story is timeless. The prose unrivaled by anything since.The Grapes of Wrathand \\"Of Mice and Men\\" are more popular by far, but East of Eden best demonstrates the author's skill. Few works merit the overused term 'masterpiece'. This is one."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"\\"We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the neverending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.\\" John Steinbeck, East of EdenThe preceding quote appears about halfway through Steinbeck's magnum opus, but it could just have easily have served as the epigraph. The powerful novel exhaustively explores the themes of good and evil in the lives and intertwining stories of two Salinas Valley, California families.I recently re-read Of Mice & Men, and the enjoyment it brought finally stripped my hesitation to tackle Steinbeck's 600 page East of Eden. It took a few weeks, but I was rewarded by a good story, well told.As the title suggests, Biblical themes reverberate throughout the book. The most prominent is that of Cain and Able that plays out first with Adam Trask and his brother, Charles, and then in Adam's two sons, Caleb and Aaron. The title was chosen by Steinbeck from Genesis 4:16: \\"And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden\\" (King James Version).Caleb (Cal) constantly wrestles with his sinful nature, evoking the Apostle Paul's words in Romans 7:19: \\"For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do (KJV).\\" But that wrestling leaves him more in touch with his real identity and that of those around him. By contrast, his brother, Aaron had constructed a story of his life that reality intrudes upon with devastating consequences.The book also shows the generational impacts of fathers choosing favorites among their offspring, recalling the Biblical figures of Adam and Jacob. It shows true service in the character of the household servant, Lee. And while the allegories are ever present, they don't suffocate the tale. The characters and the landscape come to life in this timeless story that I wholeheartedly recommend."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The riches fill up fast and frequently in East of Eden, so much so that you're almost certain to call it one of the best books you've ever read long before you approach the end (which won't take long either). I feared how I'd react to a book so venerated - now, at 29, I'm long past the ability to read a book I'm \\"supposed\\" to read and appreciate the dimensions of. Besides a love of great writing, what makes East of Eden so easy to read is a nimble grasp - if not an embarrassing ease - Steinbeck seems to have on the fundamental understandings of life. I can't remember the last time I read a book like this that truly made me think, \\"Holy crap, the secrets of life are in here!\\"Here's what it does right, I think, right off the bat. It's not Adam Trask, the conflicted, haunted protagonist at its center, it's his brother, Charles. In the early pages of the novel, Adam and Charles get in a fight for which Charles is to blame. Yet as you get to know the two of them, something about Charles' rage and loneliness is compelling even as he sits in the background of the novel. East of Eden moves in and around their relationship, then moves away, as Adam falls in love with Cathy, which does not go well. Yet with each movement through Adam's life, the book cuts a little closer to the nature of what makes each person tick. Not just tick, but feel, think, and keep moving.There are themes in East of Eden that are important, that I want to talk and talk to anyone who has read the book about, but I think it best you read them for yourself. What I will say is that ultimately what makes East of Eden the most humane, insightful, perhaps best book I've read is that every truth is grasped through a character, specifically conceived, always presented as an individual, never spared the difficulties of life, and never responding as any other character would. East of Eden is beautiful, brisk, orchestrated like a magnificent concert, but what it is above all is the human experience, in all is breathtaking complexity. The book had won me over long before it follows Adam's son Cal into the deep ambivalence of his own thoughts of good and evil, a man who, as one character puts it is \\"packed to the brim of every good and evil instinct a man's ever had.\\" That it becomes Cal's story is the coup de gras - a statement that life is never more vital and beautiful than when it's full of contradiction and uneasy answers."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have no problem admitting that I picked this book up for the author. I have had great success with the other books Steinbeck has written and this one is a masterpiece as well. What I liked about this one, however, is all of the lessons and hidden meanings that go along with the novel and the different interpretations that each reader has.It is important to remember that Steinbeck considers \\"East of Eden\\" his masterpiece. \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" had already become a classic in its own right but he was proud of this book in particular. Though I have to disagree to \\"East of Eden\\" being a better novel than \\"Grapes of Wrath\\", I can understand and respect all of the pride that is felt within the book.Like his other books, \\"East of Eden\\" starts out very slow and very descriptive. Steinbeck takes us into the lives of two different families; the Trasks and the Hamiltons. The two families both have farms in Salinas Valley, but one family has wealth and the other does not. Just before I wanted to throw the book across the room from being fed up with imagery, Steinbeck once again grabbed my attention with the introduction of Cathy Ames.By the time Cathy (Kate later in the novel) is introduced, the reader realizes that they are hooked to the novel. The reader has enough background on all the characters to feel like they are in the barn right next to the Hamiltons milking cows. This brings a tremendous amount of appreciation for each character.Throughout the book a series of life changing events are constantly introduced to the reader and each scene is crucial to the novel. Each and every character is essential to the novel and by the end the reader can fully accept and appreciate each one. Some people will go into all the symbolism of this book with the story of Cain and Abel, or the obvious link to the garden of Eden and praise the book for how well the story adapted to the time period it was written. Though this was very apparent and is an excellent story analyze, I chose to focus on all the goodness found in the book.Not to spoil the book, but many horribly sad and heart wrenching events take place. What I took away from the book was to look at the Hamiltons and the Trasks and see how different characters coped. It's truly amazing how good triumphed evil and really teaches a valid lesson of forgiveness. Martha Washington once said \\"I am still determined to be cheerful and happy, in whatever situation I may be; for I have also learned from experience that the greater part of our happiness or misery depends upon our disposions, and not upon our circumstances\\". The Hamiltons especially lived by this quote. It was really an eye opener and lovely book.This book deserves to be a classic and John Steinbeck deserves to go down in history of one of the greatest authors of American Literature."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"As the title implies, East of Eden is a tale loosely based on the Bible's Book of Genesis, the story of the first human beings. The Salinas Valley of the early 20th century becomes the setting for the Garden of Eden. The descriptive imagery remains to be one of the most alluring features that holds underlying meanings as well. John Steinbeck artistically weaves universal themes of contrasting forces, especially in his portrayals of the surrounding environment. In East of Eden, one becomes conscious of the interconnections between the universe and between three generations of people.Despite the dullness of the first few chapters, the ending is one that slams into the reader and leaves a sense of satisfaction at the way things played out. The plot moves faster and faster and builds quicker and quicker until the climax. Similarly, the early characters are not yet as complex as the later ones, ones that readers become more attached to.The same characters of Adam, Eve, Cain, and Abel are reincarnated in his characters of Adam, Cathy, Charles, Cal, and Aron. Their connection to the Bible makes the tale both predictable and whimsical. Although their actions reflect actions those of their Biblical counterparts in some way or sort, there is often a twist that renders the action theirs and theirs only. Each of the Trasks and Hamiltons are complex individual characters that readily exercise their own power of choice. Coincidentally, timshel, the power of choice, is one of Steinbeck's major themes, among themes of good versus evil and light versus dark. While Cal realizes his power and aims to change himself for good, other characters are less aware of their own part. One of the most enticing aspects of the story is his fight to free himself from the restraints that the Bible puts on him. Sure, he resembles Cain, but that does not mean that he is destined to be evil. It is this understanding that makes him the most interesting and perhaps the most dynamic player in the drama. Cathy, on the other hand, is simply bad and does nothing to prove otherwise. All she knows is evil, so that evil is her form of good. There is, however, a mystery to her that makes her passages of the book passages worth reading into and interpreting if only to discover her motives. Because even though we all know her evil, she elicits different levels of evil that both lures and disgusts others to dive deeper into her character.Written from different perspectives, East of Eden gives a patchwork account that can be interpreted as both helpful and tiring to read. It gives power to the reader as readers experience the omniscient viewpoint of knowing all while the characters themselves are still oblivious. But even when the story is so accessible to readers, there are still questions that the story proposes but never answers."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck's epic novel, \`East of Eden' is a depiction of his family's history in the Salinas Valley in California. Often the backdrop of many of his novels, \`...Eden' is certainly more autobiographical than most of his works. The story branches off just like a family tree, and organically the characters blossom into full life.Beginning with Cyrus Trask during the late 1800's, we develop a Jacob and Esau rivalry between his boys Charles and Adam. Cyrus is a martinet, so overbearingly so, that Adam joins the army just to get out of his sight. Later, when he returns, the boys have become men and continue their conflict, except Cyrus has died and left a small fortune to both of them. Much of the novel focuses on the transition each one takes to acquire land and place their wealth in the right direction.From there Adam is the central focus of the story. He falls in love with a woman named Catherine (also Cathy or Kate) who is a local prostitute. Through him she bears a pair of twins, Caleb and Aron, who are destined to be as different as Adam and Charles were. Adam truly adores Kate despite her livelihood, but the relationship turns tempestuous. While he finds it easy to forgive her transgressions, he can't seem to tame her wily nature.The remainder of the novel follows the aspirations of Adam's family, including Kate, whose conniving ways provide a colorful backdrop as Adam attempts to keep their mother's identity a secret until they are old enough to process her place in their lives. Many subplots intertwine with Aron being an aspiring college bound preacher who falls in love with Abra, a preacher's daughter, while Caleb tries to win his father\`s affection as an entrepreneur at home. As a heartwarming touch, Lee, an Asian-American housekeeper, adds much to the drama as a second surrogate parent of sorts.Reading Steinbeck's classic is delightful. I found the 601 pages to be a trademark page-turner from one of my favorite American authors. While I'll always revere 'The Grapes of Wrath (Penguin Classics)' as his most powerful classic, I now understand why \`East of Eden' is considered among the upper echelon of his great works. 'The Winter of Our Discontent' and \`Of Mice and Men' have an emotional immediacy that are his trademark, but his expertise is no less apparent in this novel with his ability to weave such an intricate and absorbing tale from beginning to end.As poetic prose, Steinbeck's timeless work has been reaffirmed by becoming one of Oprah's prized \\"Book of the Month\\" selections.(On a personal note, I'd like to add that 'The Red Pony' was the only Steinbeck novel I ever read in school. Apparently my educators saw the wisdom of leaving his legacy to my free time when I could savor his novels because I wanted to--and not because I had to. I read \`Of Mice and Men' during summer break during college, but I read the bulk of his famous works during the early nineties. Enjoy.)"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"When I first found myself assigned the task of reading East Of Eden, I was intimidated by its length and wondering about its significance and how impressive would be. When I finished the entire novel, there were no doubts in my mind about its ability to apply to all humanity and meld the Bible into the lives of ordinary people. I was absolutely entranced by this book. It is a masterfully crafted work of literature that deserves to be read and digested by all people, and is rightfully placed as a classic.What makes East of Eden such a masterpiece is that author John Steinbeck melds the theme to fit all humans, no matter what their background is. Steinbeck brings the Biblical tale of brothers Cain and Abel to prominence in the novel, focusing on this Biblical allusion above the many others also used. The feuding brothers Charles and Adam Trask represent one generation of the Biblical duo, and Adam's sons Cal and Aron carry on the symbolism. Although readers are inclined to sympathize with the slain brother Abel the two characters that represent him in the novel (Adam and Aron), Steinbeck skillfully blends good and evil to give readers a sense of empathy for Charles and Cal, who do not receive the same degree of attention and devotion from their fathers that their brothers possess. Cal is the person who constantly feels the need to change his environment, which in effect leads to harm, yet he is genuinely searching for love and recognition from his father Adam Trask. Using this situation as a major conflict in the novel, Steinbeck emphasizes the importance of love to all human beings and the need for love, and the dangers resulting from deprived love.At certain chapters, Steinbeck diverts from the story and delves into philosophical discussions about human nature and the themes circulating in the novel. It is in these chapters that he explicitly mentions the ideas and motifs placed throughout the book, and the chapters further enhance the uniqueness of East of Eden. A wide variety of other Biblical events and characters are represented in the story as well, including Jesus, Jacob, Adam and Eve, the garden of Eden, and many more. The entire story is not a stale Biblical parable like one would think it is, but is actually an intriguing tale with a number of different storylines crossing together that succeeds in keeping the attention of readers. The major element that keeps East of Eden exciting and enjoyable to read is the constant conflict between good and evil, involving characters such as the thoroughly villainous Cathy, the sagacious Samuel Hamilton, and the wise, soothing Lee. Steinbeck uses these contrasting characters to depict the neverending struggle between good and evil that pervades the story. It is this battle that makes East of Eden such a constantly appealing book that all people can relate to. Steinbeck's skillful treatment of characters, conflicts and the themes of struggling for love and avoiding extreme actions succeed in making any reader interested and feeling relation to the characters. The message of the novel is best embodied through the character of Lee, the intellectual servant who introduces the word \\"Timshel\\", meaning \\"thou mayest\\", indicating that people are able to have control over personal futures, and carrying the story's idea that all people can choose their own paths in life. The strength of the book comes from its ability to apply to all people, which is what, according to Lee, the best stories are able to do.The writing styles used by John Steinbeck in East of Eden are truly remarkable and something to admire. Steinbeck's skill in describing a scene or object in fresh and exciting methods and his ability to narrate in a dry voice that still captures the attention of readers is what makes the book enjoyable. When touching upon the themes in those certain chapters, Steinbeck writes as if he were engaged in actual conversation with readers, and immerses them into his explanations. To add humor to the novel, Steinbeck intersperses the narration with sharp and insightful comments about human nature and the motivations and actions of people. For much of the book, Steinbeck's language is simple but conveys deep meaning and accurately paints the images of the novel in a way that is easy for people to comprehend. Readers may feel that East of Eden is far too long to be read quickly, but the storylines and conflicts will keep readers hooked and eager to delve into the story and analysis.Overall, East of Eden is a deeply entertaining novel that accurately reveals human nature and the difficulties and trials surrounding the lives of human beings. Steinbeck efficiently blends in Biblical characters and themes and elevates the struggles of ordinary people to as religious level that has relevance for all people. Such an accomplishment is rarely achieved by any author, making East of Eden a unique novel that is interesting to read and discuss."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Great book!

I've set myself a goal to read my way through his creativity, and this book so far is my favorite of his. In fact, it might be one of the best books I have ever read. It is a book that is magnificent in scope, beginning with a strong reference to Cain and Abel from \\"The Bible,\\" to covering the United States from east to west, mostly focusing on the Salinas Valley in California. It's basically the story of two families: the Trasks and the Hamiltons (Steinbeck's ancestors; he even appears as a minor character); and the two opposites: good and evil. From whorehouses to family farms, Steinbeck has covered a lot of ground in these 600 plus pages as he writes with deep feeling, strength, and brutality. One short section on how to start and drive a pre-World War I automobile is magnificence in a nutshell. Steinbeck believed that this was his greatest work, and with ample justification."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"story totally wraps you up and changes what you think about appearances. writing style is amazing and paints such an amazing picture. incredibly impactful story"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A brilliant story told with passionate prose.

Chasing the wild ones, Apache warriors know as 'netdahe'. They take no prisoners and fight to the death themselves. A deadly game of cat and mouse, and if they capture you, you will be tortured to death: man, woman, or child.The action mainly takes place in an area known as the Solitario Desert country, a furnace hot, desolate, strip of land that only the Apache and few non-Apache can cross and survive. Eventually the land leads into Mexico and Sierra Madre area. The Apaches have escaped the reservation choosing to live in an extremely dense area of the Sierra Madre within the hidden area known as Pagotzinkay. The 'wild ones' are at home here within the pine forests and steep, deep barrancas, having narrow trails at times less than a couple of feet in width. Either human, horse, or mule, can at times tumble down into the high void falling to their death.This is the area that the U.S. Cavalry, Apache scouts, and most of all Lee Kershaw must traverse while trying to capture and kill the fierce war chief of the Apaches, Yanozha, also called El Fiero. So far he and his small warrior band have raided, raped, and killed with impunity evading both the Mexican forces and the U.S. Army forces coming after him. Will Lee Kershaw be any more successful?Anyone reading the \\"Manhunter\\" series of western novels by the late author, Gordon D. Sherriffs, will be familiar with the activities of Lee Kershaw, a legend in the southwest of that era. Lee is pretty much a lone wolf who has lived among and is blood brother to several Apaches. As it is said he \\"can out Apache an Apache\\". Although at times, they do get the better of him in this book. Especially when early on Yanohza shoots a poison-tipped arrow directly into Lee's back. Ouch!Gordon D. Sherriffs was the author of over 70 westerns with the 'manhunter' series being one of the best known. Should you be looking for a good western read with much non-fiction tossed in, check out this series by Mr. Sherriffs.

When the author sticks to the facts of the story, it is a revealing look at the politics of running a struggling auto company. The biographical information of the main players in upper echelons was quite interesting, also.However, there is a sense of the author's bias lurking throughout the pages. He manages to imply that somehow, once Toyota introduced the Corona in 1966, there wasn't a marketing misstep to be made by the Japanese, particularly Toyota. Do the nameplates \\"Crown\\", \\"Cressida\\" and \\"Echo\\" ring a bell? I won't even mention some of the other sad cars that other manufacturers have coughed up in the ensuing years, and still do occasionally, from both sides of the Pacific.Every now and again factual errors will appear, but they're so glaring that somebody with even a moderate interest in the car industry will pick up on. For instance, Honda earned customer loyalty because they \\"never dropped a nameplate.\\" Really? Where did one go in 1987 to purchase a new Honda 600 GT or Sports 800?More troubling was a hint of elitism that came up a couple of times. Was there (is there) really anything wrong with selling new cars to the blue-collar crowd? I know that some people are consumed by image, but most of us don't care what anybody else is driving, as long as they know HOW to drive it. People without a stratospheric income should be able to make a fully warranted purchase and get \\"that new car smell\\", too.Finally, too little of the book is spent explaining exactly what was wrong, quality-wise, with Chrysler vehicles. Aside from the Aspen / Volar&eacute; twins, there was precious little time given to specific examples of lax quality control or design deficiencies. Even the A/V cars were a major problem only in their first year. More detail would have been revealing as to why buyers were steering clear of Chrysler's showrooms in the late 70's, when the whole mess started.I've always had an avid interest in the auto industry, and have been waiting for somebody to write a book on the true Lee Iacocca to show the savior / charlatan that he really was. Unfortunately, somebody else is going to have to write it. This one falls short.In case anybody's wondering, I have owned several cars from both American and Japanese manufacturers, including an 80's era Chrylser product. I have enjoyed the majority of them, and the only lemon I ever picked was from a European make."},{"Title":"Behind The Wheel At Chrysler: The Iacocca Legacy","review":"I found this book provided a quite interesting history of not only Chrysler, but the entire auto industry between the years of '70-'80. I particularly enjoyed the author's insights in to Chrysler's main player Iacocca. The book did however seem to jump around from subject to subject with no clear tie-ins. I found it difficult during some portions of the book to figure out what time frame the author was speaking of, as he tended to bounce back and forth. All in all I found the book to provide some excellent information on Chrysler and the prevailing personalities and values that has kept the organization alive for so many years through so many triumphs and tragedies."},{"Title":"Behind The Wheel At Chrysler: The Iacocca Legacy","review":"He takes many liberties in trashing Chrysler products of the early 80's. For instance, he states that chrysler's 2.2 engine was based on &quot;twenty year old technology&quot; yet he offers no evidence to back up this claim. Mr. Levin also carps about the lack of technology in Chrysler's cars such as using a &quot;beam axle&quot; while conveniently overlooking the fact that other cars of this time frame used solid rear axles quite frequently. Nor does he give much coverage to Chryslers lowest cost per unit, the VNT technology used in its turbo cars, the fact it had OHC engines on the market LONG before GM and Ford, the first domestic auto company to use airbags in its cars, the firs electronically adaptive transmission.Mr Levin admitted he got little in the way of cooperation from Iacocca and it appears he wrote this tome to vent against a good yet flawed man and a great company."},{"Title":"Behind The Wheel At Chrysler: The Iacocca Legacy","review":"An interesting book that looks at the Iacocca era at Chyrsler. The book reads more like a series of articles (the author is also a journalist) than a novel, but is nevertheless an effective portrayal of Chyrsler, Iacocca and the American and Japanese auto industry of the late 70s thru the early 90s. Lots of background information on the auto industry with interesting historical tidbits as well. The book's only &quot;flaw&quot; is its tendency to tear apart the Iacocca legacy with nasty (but apparently true) stories that topple the former auto industry icon, thus providing a counterweight to Iacocca's own biographical portrayals. While not a tightly woven &quot;can't put it down&quot; book, it is nevertheless worth adding to your collection if you are an automotive buff or Chrysler buff."},{"Title":"Vavra's Cats","review":"What a delightful book!

Unlike other books about ERP (and e-business and enterprise application integration for that matter), this one is focused on the business processes and what it takes to prepare for and manage the implementation.Of course, while much of this book applies at a high level to any enterprise application, it is all about ERP. The authors take great pains to avoid talking about software, which in itself is refreshing. They also skillfully guide you through a panorama of key issues, including what ERP is and how it fits into the overall scheme of business value and competitiveness. However, the best part of this book is their implementation strategy, which explores how an ERP package is going to require changes at the business process level, how to break down the implementation into manageable stages. In this respect the book is a combination of a management overview of ERP, organizational change strategies, and project management approach to implementation.The key areas addressed by this book reflect reality. For example, all of the major challenges that you're likely to face are addressed. The critical success factors, such as training, preparing the organization for the system (from a people perspective), and the way the implementation phases are sequenced can either be learned from this book, or learned the hard way (which is sure to include schedule and cost overruns at best and a disaster at worst). In particular, the process-oriented approach that is reiterated throughout the book needs to be heeded. This is the essence of any ERP package, and it will change your organization. This book gives good advice on how to effect the shift from discrete jobs and procedures to a workflow.In addition to this excellent book I highly recommend two other resources: (1) &quot;Scorecard System For World Class Enterprise Resource Management&quot; by Travis Anderegg, which is a unique book/online survey combination you can use to evaluate the alignment of your ERP system to business processes, and (2) &quot;Enterprise Resource Planning Systems: Systems, Life Cycle, Electronic Commerce, and Risk&quot; by Daniel Edmund O'Leary. O'Leary's book completely complements this one and fills in a few gaps."},{"Title":"ERP: Making It Happen: The Implementers' Guide to Success with Enterprise Resource Planning (Oliver Wight Manufacturing)","review":"This book has a good mission and scope, and the prose is clear and straightforward. The thinking underneath the prose is, unfortunately, often confused. It's as if the paragraphs were competently edited, but not the chapters or major arguments. \\"There are three kinds of companies,\\" says page 20; on page 59 there are again three kinds of companies, and the categorization is sorta-almost the same. Five minutes of scrutiny finally reveals the two comparison-sets are not congruent. This is strange and unsatisfactory, because making them so would have been easy and certainly would serve the reader better.The book sometimes balks at simple realities. \\"One kind of company\\" already has ERP software installed and hasn't gotten the hoped-for return, and people are frustrated. The solution is to re-implement, and \\"the good news is that having the software already installed certainly makes life easier in some important respects ... The bulk of the software has already been selected.\\" But what if the software was poorly chosen and won't do the job? That's the situation I face, and none of the three categories deals with this not uncommon scenario.That's from the chapter titled \\"Software,\\" which has other problems. There are some good ideas; don't get the module organization of a software package confused with your real organizational units, for example. But there's no clear general orientation to the software issues, not much for creating meaningful comparisons between products, no acknowledgment that fraudulent marketing is a real danger or that seemingly universal terms can carry very different meanings simply by their contextual scope.My disappointment with the book increased sharply during the instructions for ROI assessment. The presentation of concepts was muddled, but I persevered and hammered out a complete ROI document. I'm a database builder, not a money analyst or manager, and I was proud of the result when I sent it off to the owners. It's now a few weeks later and I am halfway through 'The Goal' by E. Goldratt. And my ROI is false, I realize, because this ERP book fails to help the reader convert \\"better efficiency\\" into dollars returned. An improvement belongs on the ROI if dollars are returned. That means for a reduction in costs for non-production labor (for example), you have to say which salaried workers will no longer work at the company. I rewrote my ROI. I said what positions could go (including my own), but the grounding-to-earth also forced me into a lower percentage for benefits. It was the same for improvements in gross revenue. On that point the ERP book even fails to point out that a gain in gross sales is not to be interpreted as a gain in profit. Now if I were any kind of analyst, I wouldn't have been fooled; but I don't think the book should go out of its way to cloud up the core issues, and that's what this one does. I'm just glad I sent a corrected ROI (and still with an exciting return) before the owners themselves had to point out my incompetence.I won't get fooled again. A second ERP primer text is coming my way."},{"Title":"ERP: Making It Happen: The Implementers' Guide to Success with Enterprise Resource Planning (Oliver Wight Manufacturing)","review":"If You are trying to improve the way your business run: customer satisfaction, productivity, team work, cost reduction, low inventory level, etc. then implement ERP (not ES).

Further, each chapter helps lay out several different &quot;solutions&quot; to the most troubling questions (homosexuality, Holy Spirit Baptism, and what defines a Christian marriage) while always maintaining a scriptural basis for the answer. Finally, if even after reading the book you find yourself siding with the most common beliefs of many other Christians - you will find yourself much better equipped to give an answer to the hope that lies within you.

They seem to have divided the chore up by setting the novel's four characters in different areas within the realm of Cormyr, with Troy Denning handling the action with Talaslanta and Vangerdahast, and Ed Greenwod handling the war in the north featuring Alusair and Azoun. As a result, half of the novel is competently done. It is pretty easy to figure out which author did which section, because Denning's half completes the story he started in &quot;Beyond the High Road&quot; and is written in fairly engaging prose. Greenwood, on the other hand, writes as though English literature reached its apotheosis in the lesser works of Sir Walter Scott. Consequently, his sections are peppered with snappy dialogue such as the following: &quot;Sir Messenger, rest your horse. We shall tarry here for a time, while the Princess Alusair essays an attack, planned yestereve, on those who harry us.&quot; Bad prose and worse dialogue were not a problem in the first book of this series, &quot;Cormyr: A Novel,&quot; which was also a collaboration with Ed Greenwood. The first book had as a coauthor Jeff Grubb, one of Greenwood's fellow game designers at TSR/Wizards of the Coast. My theory-- and this is just a guess-- is that due to his greater prestige at TSR Grubb had either the confidence or the clout to tell Greenwood what to do with his dialogue. (I could make a few suggestions along that line myself.) The story is good, with only two plot holes, and Denning's half is easily worth reading. But if you want a combination of story and unleavened writing ability set in a world that looks suspiciously like Cormyr, read Simon R Green's &quot;Blue Moon&quot; series.An additional note about the series. This is the third book in a trilogy. If you do choose to read this book (not an altogether bad idea-- I've read much, much worse books, like one of Greenwood's solo efforts, for example), I would suggest reading &quot;Beyond the High Road&quot; first, as it does set up much of the plot of &quot;Death of the Dragon,&quot; and I rather suspect that someone who read the latter book without reading the former would find &quot;Dragon&quot; confusing. Additionally, volume 1, &quot;Cormyr: A Novel&quot; is genuinely quite good in its own right, beyond what it adds to the understanding of volumes 2 and 3. I'd advise picking that one up whether or not you have any plans to read the last two novels."},{"Title":"Death of a Dragon (Comyr Saga)","review":"The most realistic look at war and rulership that can be found in any Forgotten Realms book. If you're looking for lighthearted fare where all the good guys live, look elsewhere.If you're looking for an excellent story with characters you can care about, look here.I've read entire stories where an author has failed to do what Greenwood and Denning manage to do in only a few sentences: Make an individual character, even a short lived one, come alive. And that makes their ends all the more tragic. The soldiers dying in the field aren't generic redshirted security officers being beamed down to die like fodder. They're good hearted, often humorous lads, who you hate to see go.So good. One of the best FR books I've read.

Alusair was the most interesting between the two princesses.I would recommend for you to read the first two AGAIN!"},{"Title":"Death of a Dragon (Comyr Saga)","review":"This clever story redeems all of the plotlines previously presented. I feel both authors worked well together. Mr Denning has failed in the past and the poorly executed Return of the Shadowmage trilogy. Ed Greenwood, the creator of this world has presented some of the best and worst offerings of writing within this sprawling series. He returns to the place he knows best,Cormyr.The prose picks up the pace from the other two novels. In fact, the plot moves rather quickly, thanks to Ed. Tanalasta who whined through the first novels, finally redeems herself as a heroine. The battle scenes are memorable, yet pay homage to Tolkien. The King makes the ultimate sacrifice to save the kingdom he loves. I actually expected him to die in the first novel. His death brought tears to my eyes. He has been a character in these stories for years.I eagerly await the 4th edition storyline that promises to plotline 20 years into the future. This could be revolutionary to readers and gamers, or drive away fans like vampires at dawn! Is the world ready for the adventures of Azoun V? Time will tell. Thank you for this brilliant creation of yours, Ed."},{"Title":"Death of a Dragon (Comyr Saga)","review":"Though it's presumably the third book in the Cormyr Saga, Death of the Dragon is more the continuation of events that begin in Beyond the High Road. I didn't much like that story, but taken in whole the pair of novels is excellent. These two books should really be one, and probably would be if they weren't so long. A lot of things that didn't make much sense in High Road are cleared up, for example- what made the ghazneths and what exactly is their purpose other than wreaking wanton carnage and destruction. You also learn what exactly happened to Vangerdahast, which was a bit perplexing at the end of High Road. There's a lot of orc-killing in Death of the Dragon (hard to do Forgotten Realms without at least some of that!) and visceral battle. While the plot isn't precisely ingenious, it is exciting and generally fun to follow.As a matter of fact, Death of the Dragon is great reading- I couldn't put it down... at least for the first 375 pages. I seriously urge readers to STOP there! It is odd, really, since I've found that usually fantasy novels either stay strong all the way through or start weak and end strong. In Death of the Dragon, it starts strong, stays strong, and concludes with a whimper- the ending is probably the lamest conclusion I have EVER read in a novel. It's a real pity, because the rest of it is so great. I'm baffled as to why Greenwood and Denning chose to drag it on for 12 more pages of what amounts to useless drivel that breaks the breakneck pace of the plot and is sopping with ridiculous sentimentality. For a second it looked as if they were trying to end on a happier note, but they didn't succeed in that- and I don't think this would be a good idea anyway.If you've already read High Road, definitely read Death of the Dragon. It would be a shame to suffer through that novel and not get to this rewarding read. At this point, I see two ways the Cormyr Saga can be resolved- either another book with a well-written finale, or a truncation of the last 12 pages of this one. Since Death of the Dragon was so good for the better part, I would recommend the latter."},{"Title":"Death of a Dragon (Comyr Saga)","review":"I liked this book, and enjoyed reading it. Which is saying a lot considering Ed Greenwood came anywhere near it, and you can see his handywork all over it.

One of the strengths of this shared world is that time passes and things change. From the beginning of this series I realized that it would mark the passing of Azoun IV. Other reviewers have critisized this series in comparison with sweeping mega-novels of other authors. One of the things I have liked about the Realms series is that I'm not expected to have to plod through multiple 700+ page books to reach the conclusion. Granted the battles seemed never ending with knights killing many orcs/goblins before falling themselves but I think that this was the point. As Ilberd Crownsilver discovered, battle is not glorious, it hurts both body and mind. The only real problem I had with the series was that Vangerdahast seemed to resemble Elminster's more sinister little brother. I think the ideal way to experience this series is to read all three books consecutively which I plan to do again in the near future."},{"Title":"Death of a Dragon (Comyr Saga)","review":"Other reviews of this book say that you should read Cormyr: a novel and Beyond the high road before reading this book. I say you should read every FR novel bfore this one if you really want to get everything out of this book. This book has a huge impact on the realms as a whole. I was so wraped up in this climatic book that I didn't do any homework the whole time I was reading it. If you are a long time realms fan this book is gong to have a great deal of meaning to you, if you are a casual fantasy reader this book is going to be a hack and slash book with minor other characteristics. Me being a long time FR fan found this book to be very emotional. It shows the horrors of war and the casualties.... It is noce to see author collaborations such as this, because Denning and Greenwood have played such a big part in making the realms come alive in the past, it only seemed fitting that two authors such as this would take on such a task. Anyways read this book if you enjoy FR novels. If you don't read them, you may be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Death of a Dragon (Comyr Saga)","review":"This is one of the best, if not the best, fantasy epic adventures that I have ever read. The story is gripping; the characters are real; the plot lines are original; the magic is original; there is even an original monster or two; and there is a dragon -- a very big dragon. I read 'Cormyr: A Novel' quite a while ago and was very impressed with the magnitude of the history of the world it described. It stood out as a book-among-books because of its scope and credibility. It weaved two story lines, one of now, a strand of sky blue, and one of then, a strand of gold, to tell a fantastic tale. 'Beyond the High Road' continues the tale of now with lots of references to the tale of then to lay the foundation for 'Death of the Dragon'. Normally, I don't like books that merely set up the next book but I gladly accepted it in this case because of the wonderful story and originality that went into it. 'Cormyr' is not necessary reading but it is strongly recommended and will make 'Dragon' much more enjoyable. Reading 'Beyond the High Road' is an absolute must otherwise the reader will be quite lost and confused.Without giving too much away, let's just say that this book turns the typical stereotype of never-a-doubt that Good will prevail and stretches it to the extreme. Normally few, if any, good guys actually die. If they do it is only after the momentous battle that is the conclusion of the book. Not here. Greenwood &amp; Denning show much more reality in the battles. They must have taken cues from WWII film footage. You will see where death keeps her sting. This book will draw you into the story and make you read it because what happends next is never predictable. The story is one long perilous journey; there is no safe place to rest and no safe place to close the book.This trilogy is a must read for any fan of the genre and a great first for someone just beginning it."},{"Title":"Death of a Dragon (Comyr Saga)","review":"I liked this book, and enjoyed reading it.

It was not easy to find, as it is out of print etc., but I located it through Amazon. It was a fascinating read primarily because, due to a childhood in post-colonial Addis Ababa, he enjoyed access to a culture and area at a time (pre-WW II) when this was virtually unheard of. His writing skills were limited (lots of \\"lists\\", but, after all, it IS a diary!), but the narrative voice was strong. Cultural and political situations were very revealing, keeping in mind that the author's upbringing and existence are British Empire personified. The black and white photographs are a documentary unto themselves, a testament to his skill and bravery. Overall, a very interesting glimpse into a part of the world that has remained largely wild and under the radar."},{"Title":"Jazz Masters of the 50's","review":"Jazz critic and author Joe Golberg explains his purpose in writing Jazz Masters of the Fifties as follows: \\"This book is concerned with players who may be considered as artists. They have all come to prominence since the rise of Charlie Parker; in a sense, this book is a consideration of different uses to which Parker's discoveries have been put. To put it differently, bop, or modern jazz, is the common language of the twelve musicians discussed here, and each man speaks a different dialect. There is, of course, a tradition involved. Too often, what seems a radical departure is that only within a jazz context; other musics have employed the startling new methods for years.\\"While most of the musicians covered are familiar names to most jazz fans, a few choices might give some readers pause to question Goldberg's selection process. The twelve musicians or musical groups chosen by Goldberg are: Gerry Mulligan, Thelonious Monk, Art Blakey, Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins, The Modern Jazz Quartet, Charles Mingus, Paul Desmond, Ray Charles, John Coltrane, Cecil Taylor, and Ornette Coleman.Golberg mixes interviews, research, and personal memories to produce generally well-written chapters on each major figure, but the overall effect is a series of uneven portraits. His chapter on Miles Davis, for example, benefits from several poignant stories about meeting and speaking with Miles in a Manhattan club. On the other hand, Goldberg is never able to have a full-length conversation with the elusive Charles Mingus and this detracts from the book.Goldberg writes with admiration and some knowledge as a close listener about giants such as Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane. Two of his best chapters focus on jazz masters of the 1950s avant-garde: pianist/compopser Cecil Taylor and saxophonist/composer Ornette Coleman.Goldberg, it seems to me, is less-than-convincing in his argument for treating Ray Charles as a major jazz singer.The chapters on Sonny Rollins, Paul Desmond, and Art Blakey are among the finest in the book and provide both keen insights into their music and very interesting anecdotes about these musicians' lives.Another feature of Golberg's book that is most useful are the frequent and well-grounded references to both individual songs and whole albums that the author highly recommends.I greatly enjoyed reading this book and found it a very worthy companion to Ira Gitler's Jazz Masters of the Forties, an excellent survey of many key musicians from that era.Highly recommended for anyone seeking solid information on some of the greatest jazz musicians of the 1950s period."},{"Title":"Jazz Masters of the 50's","review":"One of the more revealing jazz tomes I've read, with a good balance of critical acumen and affection for the music with the personal lives and relationships that informed the artists' creativity. The author, the late Joe Goldberg, was a true original who approached his subjects with awareness, awe, and a easy demeanor that led to great insights in his profiles of Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Charles Mingus, Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman, Art Blakey, Thelonious Monk, Gerry Mulligan, Ray Charles and others. If you've never read Goldberg before, you're likely to learn a few things here."},{"Title":"WOODEN LEG: A Warrior who Fought Custer.","review":"About five months ago I became a father to a beautiful and wonderful little boy. Every time I look at him and hold him I think of him as a gift. I don't mean that in a religious way, because that is not my belief. I am currently reading Wooden Leg for the second time in about 10 years. In reading this book, I realized that it too is a gift. Thomas Marquis, Wooden Leg and his Cheyenne compatriots who gave of their time and memories accomplished a tremendous service to the literature and history of a time that we will never see again. It was a beautiful life, though, to be sure, it had its share of horrors. In this book you will learn about nineteenth century Cheyenne culture and religion. You will read and be enthralled at Wooden Leg's recounting of Custer's Last Stand. Marquis, who acted as his own interpreter through sign language, did a wonderful job at arranging and organizing all of the stories related to him to make it into a cohesive read. I am very surprised that I am the first to review this book. Other \\"gift\\" books include Plenty Coups, Two Leggings and Memoirs of a White Crow Indian (the story of Thomas Leforge). I could go on, but this is a wonderful start. Enjoy these gifts and share them with someone special."},{"Title":"WOODEN LEG: A Warrior who Fought Custer.","review":"Wooden Leg was there. He life spanned the end of the free-plains Indian period, including participation in Custer's Last Stand, through the early part of the Twentieth Century. His story, as told to and written by a reservation physician who befriended the Cheyenne in later life, rings of authenticity in its plain style.Although as one reviewer noted Wooden Leg may have toned down his role in the battle at Little Bighorn, his eye witness account is riveting none-the-less. One can imagine a veteran of the victorious side in that battle not wanting to antagonize Whites who ruled his world by the time he recorded his reminiscences. His account does, however, give a hard to come by description of what the Indian warriors were doing before, during and after the battle. First person accounts of that fight are extremely rare (none from Custer's immediate group, obviously) and this is an important record.Most of the book is given over to a discussion of Indian life at the end of the era of the tribes roaming free on the northern plains. This is where the book fascinates. Wooden Leg (who received his name for his ability to walk farther than any in his band), describes growing up as a Cheyenne boy and warrior as well as everyday life and its trials and tribulations. Wooden Leg tells of coming of age rituals, training in the skills that allowed Indians to live off the land, fights with other tribes and the U.S. Army. A wonderful and captivating look at a vanished way of life that is part of us."},{"Title":"WOODEN LEG: A Warrior who Fought Custer.","review":"You'll never read a more descriptive book of the political and social milieu of the Plains Indians. The first half describes Northern Cherokee life in the mid 19th century as Wooden Leg was growing up. It was a revelation to me that Indian women then are just like women now, but the way they handled their \\"issues\\" then will shock you. The second half is devoted to Little Big Horn. I will not give it away, it's like nothing you ever read about the battle before. Remember, this book is an \\"as told to\\" a doctor account in 1922, while memories were still fresh and corrobation was still possible. The author didn't publish his notes until 1955."},{"Title":"WOODEN LEG: A Warrior who Fought Custer.","review":"Seldom do you see into the Cheyenne and plains Indian culture from a Cheyenne who lived and crossed both worlds from the traditional free roaming nomads to the reservation period.

If thats what you buy this book for then you wont be disappointed. By the title you would think it was all about the Little Big Horn battle and though I'm sure it will come to that, so far (one third though the book)it has only mentioned life of the plains indians and how they built their tee pees, how they war'd against each other and also fought together. As I said I haven't finished yet but I like what I've read so far."},{"Title":"WOODEN LEG: A Warrior who Fought Custer.","review":"I know there'll be disagreement, but Wooden Leg speaks with a rather crooked tongue! He, understandably conceals the truth about his part in the Custer battle. He claims that few rifles and pistols were had by the Indians and further, that there was no celebrations that night! Hard, hard to believe!! Especially if you read accounts from the Reno Hill Battle. There were lots of fires, dancing night attacks on the soldiers.Wooden Leg claims that most of the soldiers killed themselves and the Indians did little killing! His claim of use of thousands of arrows and few rifles or pistols by Indians led to most other deaths!He understandably doesn't claim that he actually shot at any soldiers, only fired in their direction. I find this very hard to believe, especially since he was such a brave young warrior who had killed several Indians during raids on other tribes.It is fascinating reading for information about tribal ways, customs and behavior.Read it for that rather than an account of his \\"fight against Custer,\\" since according to his tale, he spent most of his time riding about the battlefield, only to just miss the killing.A huge grain of salt is in order and more reading of other Indian versions of the clash."},{"Title":"Rowing in Eden","review":"Barbara Rogan paints an incisive portrait of life in small-town America, definitely not Norman Rockwell.

While nobody will agree entirely with the list compiled, it's an absolutely fun read, especially for the fact that it includes 1000 albums. I've never seen a book try to rank a list of great albums that large.Warning: it is very British focused, especially in the top 100. As an American, I had never heard of a lot of the artists and albums here, especially the post-1990 ones. Bands such as Oasis and Manic Street Preachers apparently get WAY too high billing across the Ocean. Personally, I liked reading about these newer bands because I'm always curious to hear what other countries are listening to, but I can see why some poeople may be turned off by this.One other problem is that there's no alphabetical index in the back. They absolutely should have one in the next edition (due out soon I think!). Either by album title or artist would be fine, but it would make things much easier to reference.I've said my peace. Buy and enjoy."},{"Title":"All-Time Top 1000 Albums","review":"First off, the version that I was shipped features a much &quot;lamer&quot; cover then the one picture... Ok, your right, that doesent matter too much ;) here goes: The book is very nice, I thought it VERY complete, and agreed with many of the listings. This book would be great for someone trying to build a collection, or for someone interested about learning interesting snippits about their collection. Some of the downside of this book include its shape, the book is too skinny, so its hard to read, so its kind of a pocket book. And unlike a book such as &quot;Beatle Songs&quot; there is no way to look up a single band or single song. Because of this, I spent an hour looking through to see if &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; and &quot;Dookie&quot; were on the list. Another maybe minor complaint I have is the list in the back entitled &quot;important artists and their most important albums&quot; (thats not perfect... but somthing like that. I found two absenses that I thought were horrific! First Nirvana, who have three (?) albums in the top 1,000, 1 on which is in the top 5, and arnt listed in the important band section. And second, John Lennon. This author lists Lou Reed (former member of Velvet Underground) and not John Lennon (former member of the Beatles) I found this distressing. But all in all this is a GREAT book, and well worth the $9.00 when you get it, you will be amazed at the extras the author packs into this tiny thing. (such as the top 50 Cd sets) Thanks! ~Andy"},{"Title":"Regeneration","review":"Having just finished reading this trilogy in one volume I would find it hard to read any of the books individually. Barker really builds on characterisation and plot as each of the stories progresses. Set in Scotland during World War 1 at Craiglockhart (an institution for miltary personnel suffering from shellshock) in \`Regeneration', and moving first to England (\`The Eye In The Door') and then to the front in France ('The Ghost Road') this is an excellent look at the impact of that war upon the individual. The series is based on historical meetings between W.H. Rivers (anthropologist, psychologist and childhood acquaintance of Lewis Carroll), Siegfried Sassoon (British poet) and Wilfred Owen (poet, killed shortly before the end of the war in 1918) and comes complete with historical notes at the end of each volume and further recommended reading about the people involved.Barker is a fascinating writer with an obvious interest in the way that the human mind works, and particularly how it reacts to trauma. Some of the descriptions of the breakdowns that individuals suffer, and the incidents that cause them, are horrific and make this (at least in my mind) anti-war literature. Having said that, each of the major characters, both real and fictional, possess a longing to be part of the war even though some have already experienced the horror of being there. I was constantly trying to reassess my own viewpoints in the light of such responses.The only real disappointment I felt concerned some of the more graphic descriptions of sex (both homosexual and heterosexual) which illustrated characters responses to events, but occasionally struck me as gratuitous in their detail. Having said that, if you are interested in reading \`The Ghost Road' because of it's status as a Booker Prize winner, then I definitely recommend reading it in this format, with the other books in the series."},{"Title":"Regeneration","review":"Throughout THE REGENERATION TRILOGY Barker does a phenomenal job of detailing the psychological consequences of trench warfare during the Great War. Set in London, Scotland, and France, the three volumes focus on the principle characters of Prior, Sassoon, Owens, and the renowned Dr. Rivers. Both their personal relationships with each other and with the First World War are examined. The reader is provided a glimpse into the terrible conditions of trench fighting, and how the medical establishment viewed shell-shock as a medical diagnosis and how it was treated. Through the poetry of Owen, Sassoon, etc, the world can begin to understand the personal horrors they have witnessed of a war that many soldiers did not understand. Based loosely on historical events and characters, Barker has created a perspective of modern warfare that does not contain the quintessential happy ending.I believe each volume of the Regeneration Trilogy should be read in chronological order (REGENERATION, THE EYE IN THE DOOR, AND THE GHOST ROAD) to fully appreciate the merits of each volume. Although the plot is re-summarized at the beginning of each book, the main characters are continually being developed throughout. I just finished reading GHOST ROAD, and I have to admit that it's not my favorite of the three. I don't understand how this volume was awarded the Booker Prize when I believe REGENERATION is the strongest of the bunch. I also enjoyed THE EYE IN THE DOOR because of the exploration of societal issues during The First War, especially scape-goating of homosexuals and pacifists.Overall, this trilogy is a wonderful glimpse into the atmosphere of Britain during the First World War."},{"Title":"Regeneration","review":"Several years ago a friend recommended Regeneration; after reading it I immediately read the second two books in the trilogy. The story so moved me that I began reading all the published work of Sassoon, Owen and Brooke. After the beginning of the Iraq war, I was asked to participate in an arts project begun in my state (Wisconsin) called \\"Epidemic Peace Imagery.\\" A friend who is a textile artist and I created a collage of images and words. Sassoon's declaration is central, and we incorporated old photographs taken by soldiers in France in WWI. The EPI exhibit has traveled for nearly three years now. Pat Barker's books were the stimulus for our contribution."},{"Title":"Regeneration","review":"The Regeneration Trilogy is both wonderful and disappointing, an odd combination of characteristics for a set of novels, but then the First World War itself was characterized by heroic exhileration and utter dispair, by encrusted tradition and unanticipated revolution, by invention and backwardness.Ms Barker takes us to an institution, a quiet and somewhat remote place, seemingly safe from the savagery of the Western Front, where damaged men are sent in hopes of recovery. She quickly has us involved in several fascinating characters, the full extent of whose experiences she only gradually reveals. Most interestingly, the characters of the men themselves are only gradually revealed, as often to our horror as satisfaction.After reading the first volume, I could hardly wait for the second. It was the third volume I found disappointing. The disappointment comes through what she does with characters we have become intensely interested in, but I'll not reveal any details and leave it to new readers to see whether they agree.The characterizations of the first two volumes are wonderful (although I am not a great fan of mixing real people in with fictional characters, the practice does not feature too heavily), and Ms. Barker gives us a remarkable sense of what that terrible war meant, particularly in ordinary lives on the home front.Ms. Barker's trilogy is highly recommended for those interested in history, students of human psychology, and those who enjoy good writing and a gripping story."},{"Title":"Regeneration","review":"Just finished the final volume of this excellent trilogy . I can't help but think the books should not be sold seperately because they do build one upon the other and if you read one on it's own you might just shrug your shoulders and move on. Also I can't agree with many of the reviewers that 'Ghost road' is the weakest of the bunch .I found it a very moving finale with the edition of Dr Rivers pre war African experiences giving a necessary twist to what could be a rather over familiar ending. The other thing I felt about the Regeneration trilogy is that some of the writing cries out to be translated into if not film, then at least a tv miniseries ........but billy priors graphically portrayed bisexuality probably makes that unlikely . Shame."},{"Title":"Regeneration","review":"I think Regeneration is one of the great novels of the 20th century. Its fictional recreation of historic events and people, brilliantly imagined, and its portrayal of the moral complexity facing the characters, are both extraordinary. Rivers gradually realizes that his job is to make officers well enough to go back to a morally bankrupt struggle. Sassoon decides that even though he decries the war and its senseless slaughter, he must go back to his men at the front. The themes are grand but made human by the wonderful characters. And the little touches are so powerful, as when a pretty girl walks into a ward of dreadfully wounded soldiers and is astonished by her impact. The whole trilogy is terrific, but the first volume, above all, is a true classic."},{"Title":"Regeneration","review":"I do not believe that E.Gyurisin, whoever it may be, understands either characterisation, the reality of WW1, historical fiction,reality, or the basis of humanity.This trilogy is at turns illuminating, harrowing, appalling, but suffers none of the defects levelled at it in this risible \\"review\\".The novel has moved on and if one still required plonking exposition which expected that the reader would barely be able to join the dots in their work book then one should take note of this illiterate review.

END"},{"Title":"In Hawthorne's Shadow: American Romance from Melville to Mailer","review":"If the title I've flung at the head of this review sounds a bit overripe, it's because I want to prepare you, dear reader, for a certain reality. In Hawthorne's Shadow: American Romance from Melville to Mailer is no vademecum or enchiridion for a day at the beach! Truth be told, some of Professor Coale's prose is as dense as anything I've ever read--and as a former philosophy major at Columbia University, I've read some damned dense stuff in my time!First do yourself a little favor (as I did, albeit belatedly): look up \\"Manichean\\" if you're not already on back-slappy terms with the word. Why? Because you're going to see that qualifier applied more often in the next couple of dozen hours' reading time than you've probably seen, heard or read the word \\"mommy\\" in your lifetime. You might want to tear your hair out or at least launch the book into oblivion after you've seen it a few hundred times. But hold your horses: there are some other treats in store--most of which are neither manic nor Manichean, but rather downright delectable!In Hawthorne's Shadow is literary criticism of the highest order in which Professor Coale does a heroic job not only of explicating Hawthorne's text, but also of bringing certain other writers to the fore. Whether you buy into Coale's assertion that Hawthorne was the \\"father\\" of the American Romantic tradition and, ipso facto, the artistic \\"grandfather\\" to a lot of American writers from Melville to Didion, what Coale does quite convincingly is show you why he thinks Hawthorne deserves both accolades. Moreover, he manages to convince you (or at least to convince me!) that any number of American writers you/I might've overlooked until now are well worth a read. I may never again read Hawthorne (and even if I do, it won't be with anything like the reverence Professor Coale thinks Hawthorne is due), but I'm already chomping at the bit to get me some of that William Styron and the three Johns plus one Joan (Cheever, Updike, Gardner and Didion) Coale gets his Manichean hooks into. This, in part because I agree with his choice of Carson McCullers, Flannery O'Connor, Joyce Carol Oates and Paul Theroux for further delectation. Ditto with Herman Melville, even if my personal jury is still in question on Norman Mailer.As for William Faulkner, however, wild horses couldn't drag me back--whatever the good Professor has to say about him. And he says plenty!Is it absolutely necessary that you, the prospective buyer of In Hawthorne's Shadow, understand the difference between literary concepts like \\"Romantic\\" and \\"Naturalistic\\" before shucking this treasure-oyster of a book? No, it's not. And yet, it might behoove you to look at something Hawthorne himself wrote from Concord, Massachusetts to a Mr. Horatio Bridge on May 3, 1843 (and which Professor Coale quotes in full towards the end of the book):\\"I would advise you not to stick too accurately to the bare fact, either in your descriptions or narrations; else your hand will be cramped, and the result will be a want of freedom, that will deprive you of a higher truth than that which you strive to attain. Allow your fancy pretty free license, and omit no heightening touches merely because they did not chance to happen before your eyes. If they did not happen, they at least ought--which is all that concerns you. This is the secret of all entertaining travellers\\" (p. 206).The above quote is direct from the horse's mouth as it were--the horse being Hawthorne; and if our venerable writer is in error with that comma between \\"freedom\\" and \\"that,\\" well, he is, after all Hawthorne--a Romantic and not a pedant (as this particular reviewer may well be). And whether Romantic or simply romantic, I strongly suspect that Hawthorne would've been as wary of the appendage of \\"Hawthornian\\" or even \\"Romantic\\" to his particular style as Marx was wary of the epithet \\"Marxist\\" when carelessly applied to his person and political philosophy once upon a time.A final word by way of apology to the good Professor Coale: I read most of this book in the subway between Brooklyn and Manhattan and on the way to work. If the white noise of subway traffic and the anticipation of the next eight hours in the hell of ABC-TV had been the only distractions between pages 1 and 205, I would've counted myself lucky. The fact is, both the white noise and the anticipation were the least of my worries.But woe and worse betide you if you don't first brush up on \\"Manichean.\\" Oh, and on alliteration. Why? Because Professor Coale is a sucker for alliteration on occasion--even in his own prose. Caveunt emptor et poeta alike! And, as Dante once wrote at the commencement of his Divine Comedy, \\"All who enter here, give up!\\"RRB12/10/12Brooklyn, NY"},{"Title":"Electronics: A complete course","review":"I bought this for an entry electronics class.

As the British Secret Service's liaison officer with the CIA and the FBI, Philby was aware of every single American move vis-&agrave;-vis the Soviet Union. Only when it was too late did the Americans discover that Philby was also a KGB-agent. But by then Philby was already \\"home and dry.\\" This work should be seen as Philby's self-vindication. Many view Philby as a traitor who moreover added insult to injury by displaying a complete lack of remorse. Such a provincial view completely misses the mark. Philby never saw himself as a traitor; the United States most certainly suffered at the hands of Philby, but it is hard to see how his actions were detrimental to the interests of his own nation. Furthermore, Philby was driven by ideals transcending national boundaries. He may have been guilty of poor judgement in throwing in his lot with the Soviet Union and believing that this nation would bring redemption to the whole of mankind, but that is altogether a different matter. Philby had made what he saw as an irrevocable decision, and he never looked back. It was an act of love; and true love never wavers. This book does not read like a spy novel. Although - or perhaps because - Philby's life was far more thrilling than anything that could be concocted in the imagination of the writers of spy novels, one is struck by Philby's detached and circumspect mode of narration. There were clearly things that Philby was not at the liberty to reveal in a book written in 1967, still the heyday of the Cold War. He could not say too much about his own comrades, because that would run the risk of exposing their modus operandi, and in Philby's line of work it was also wise to refrain from conveying to your enemy what you knew about his modus operandi. Even so, Philby does have a fascinating story to tell."},{"Title":"My silent war (Modern Library classics)","review":"Many of us enjoy the escapism of a good spy story, whether fictional or \\"true\\", and there is something strangely fascinating about the world of the secret services - a world we catch a glimpse of in this book. In this autobiography, Philby focuses mainly on the 1940s and early 1950s, when he was employed by Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (SIS or MI6), but when he was secretly working for the Russian secret service. Of course, this is Philby's version of history, but what history book is NOT biased?What makes Philby interesting is that he was motivated by political principles. He genuinely believed that by spying for the USSR he was advancing the cause of a fairer and more peaceful world. Like many others in the 1930s he could see that capitalism was a system based on exploitation, a system which was dragging the world into economic crisis and war, and a system which had given birth to the monstrosity of fascism. (We see similar developments today.)Unfortunately, the Russian state that Philby decided to serve had moved a long way from genuine Marxism. The 1917 Russian Revolution, led by Lenin, Trotsky and the Bolsheviks, had been a genuine workers' revolution, with working people exercising power through the \\"soviets\\" (elected workers' councils). But by the late 1920s the gains and democracy of the revolution had been destroyed by Stalin and the bureaucratic ruling class that had usurped power and turned Russia into a state capitalist tyranny.Philby's tragedy is that he dedicated his life to a totalitarian state which called itself socialist, but which was just as exploitive a system as the one in the West. Perhaps there was some excuse in the early 1930s for Philby being unaware of the true nature of the USSR, but he stuck loyally by the Stalinist regime even when its crimes could not be ignored, right up to his death in 1988. (Whereas genuine Marxists had long been advocating the slogan of \\"Neither Washington Nor Moscow But International Socialism\\".)In this book, Philby acknowledges that at one point he saw that \\"much was going badly wrong in the Soviet Union\\", but he says that he decided to \\"stick it out, in the confident faith that the principles of the Revolution would outlive the aberration of individuals, however enormous.\\" Sadly, what had gone wrong in the USSR was not just an \\"aberration\\", it was a full-scale counter-revolution.So I enjoyed reading Philby's autobiography, but the wider political background casts a dark shadow over it. And we also need to remember that the real world of secret services is a nasty one. They do not just spy on each other. They spy on (and often persecute) dissenting voices within their own countries, and they conduct dirty tricks such as the toppling of elected governments (as the CIA did in Chile).The secret services on both sides of Philby's \\"silent war\\" are villains. But these spooks are not all-powerful: the Tsar's secret police could not stop the 1917 Revolution; the KGB could not stop the fall of the state capitalist regimes of Russia and Eastern Europe; and MI6 did not even see the collapse of these so-called \\"communist\\" regimes coming.Phil Webster.(England)"},{"Title":"My silent war (Modern Library classics)","review":"Sure it's not a tell- all book, but Philby wrote it in the middle of the cold war. I still found it fascinating because I am new to his story.I especially enjoyed the cat and mouse game when Maclean and Burgess disappear.I'd rather hear it from Philby than any biographer.I understand he probably held back alot of juicy details,and attacked people he didn't agree with politically or personally, but it's still a really enjoyable read."},{"Title":"My silent war (Modern Library classics)","review":"If you are willing to find out the reason why this British aristocrat devoted himself to the service of Soviet intelligence, this book is a perfect answer.

Philby says pretty much nothing that will add to our knowledge of his ways and mechanics of operation. He is a fine writer, without doubt, but good writing befreft of content? He does not wax expansive on his faith - communism; he does not explain the hows of his first contact with the KGB; he does not even offer a strand of information on his life in Moscow, his marriage, his routine... aww, come on ...Pick it up and read it one three-hour layover at the airport... then place it in your library so that you have a book (for the record) that was written by THE spy who outdid 'em all!"},{"Title":"My silent war (Modern Library classics)","review":"Philby published a book, My Silent War in 1968, in which he detailed his exploits. It was this book that allegedly led the FBI agent Hanssen on the path to treachery.In one letter cited in the FBI's affidavit against him, Hanssen allegedly said he was encouraged by the memoirs of the notorious British-Soviet double agent Philby.&quot;I decided on this course when I was 14 years old,&quot; the letter stated. &quot;I had read Philby's book.

And so his autobiography reeks with the conviction of a man who is certain in his own mind that his actions were honorable.Robert Hanssen -- who would one day become an FBI agent -- was strongly influenced by Philby's book, and perhaps something else. He once said in a note to his Russian handlers, &quot;I decided on this course when I was 14 years old. I'd read Philby's book.&quot; The two sentences may convey an ambiguous meaning Hanssen did not intend. At any rate, he read Philby's book at some time, but not before he was twenty-four.Philby's strong convictions were transmitted to Hanssen by some influence that even Philby would probably not understand. How that influence stayed with Hanssen until he was 35 is even harder to grasp, for he detested communism. But he never wavered from &quot;the course&quot; he had decided on. It seems impossible that Hanssen's motivation was ideological, but rather a quest for the exciting and romantic life of the spy, as depicted by Philby. Hanssen must have found something attractive about spying besides the money, for he kept at it for fifteen years and continued even when he knew he was under suspicion.I found it easy to look at Philby with as much understanding as Archie Bunker might -- a dirty rotten pinko commie. In Russia, however, Philby is a genuine hero.

Kim Philby's personality is evident in this book and will therefore be a useful aid to anyone doing a psychological study. The usefullness will not come from what he reveals but in what he does not reveal and how he does not reveal it. This man is a true spy. A concealer and obfuscator at heart, this book is all smoke and mirrors and no substance. It's a whole lot liek the PR from movie stars and the White House. The words never really answer your question because as is the case in this book, it never takes one to the heart of the matter and fails to satisfy the curiosity, which I guess, is the reason why anyone would buy this book. Forget it. You don't find anything out. In the first few pages he tells you straight off (because, as the previous reviewer said, he is more intelligent than us) that he won't be telling us how and why he was contacted by the communists.

We should remember that no spy worthy of the name would sit down and bare his soul, spilling trade secrets. Philby is no exception. Very little is revealed in \\"MSW\\". There are 3 points of minimal interest: The first is to observe how Philby jockeys and maneuvers for position in a competitive bureaucracy-the British Secret Service. That would be the same Secret Service he sold out. The second is a surprisingly strong introduction, which gives the plot context that Philby failed to provide. The third entails his brief station in Washington (circa 1950) as head of British counter-intelligence in the US. The noose closes in on fellow spies Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean and the author himself. (Suspicions again arise about his '\\"loyalty\\" upon his return to England.) No point justifies the purchase price! The bottom line is that Kim Philby was a hard core Communist spy in the best Cold War tradition, He was a traitor to his country. He broke into small pieces whatever oaths he gave to England and his Queen. Added to that mix is his overtly snide contempt for his readers. (He is so much smarter than we are, you know). The best example of this is on page 193 when under suspicion in England and evading his surveillance, he meets clandestinely with his Russian handlers. \\"What passed there\\", we are informed, \\"is of no concern to the reader\\". No concern? Then why reveal the incident all! What a conceited little snob!

What you can deduce from Philby is that he was completely amoral, not to mention a traitor. Pity how he didn't get into his ultimate disillusionment with the Soviet Union towards the end (and communism for that matter). Treason in the Blood by Cave is much better informative source than even Philby's autobiography simply for the reason that Philby doesn't want to say anything"},{"Title":"My silent war (Modern Library classics)","review":"Although reviewers are correct in stating that this \\"autobiography\\" reveals very little about the author, it should be said that a Philby \\"expert\\", who spent a week in Moscow interviewing Philby for the Sunday Times, admitted that even he was not sure who the infamous spy really was. Perhaps Philby himself was doubtful. Philby remains, in essence, a chameleon throughout the book, and his \\"autobiography\\" fails to satisfy those who want the answers to two questions: why and how Philby managed to betray his country and bring down an entire intelligence service. There are great gaps in this book. It entirely skips over Philby's recruitment by Soviet agents at Cambridge, and although it begins with an exciting episode in Spain, it describes almost nothing about Philby's \\"other\\" work. In fact, there is so little mention of Philby's work as a double agent, that I began to forget that this man, while making great inroads in Turkey and Spain for his service, was betraying it at the very same instance. It is difficult to believe that Philby was a double agent when he shows obvious pleasure in the success of his plans, even when they work against the very people he is supposedly loyal to: the Soviets. At least one thing may be garnered from this autobiography: that Philby was not, as Nigel West pointed out, an \\"ideologue\\", but rather a theorist, and a manipulator, who was willing to sacrifice nearly everything to play his complex games of espionage.If, however, you are content to read about the endless political manoeuvring and intriguing inherent in the British intelligence service, along with its restructuring and development during WW2 and post-war years, then this is the book for you. Just don't expect any gripping accounts of Philby's deception. This isn't what Philby's book is about: rather, it's an insider's look into the British intelligence service, with the gloves off.\\"My Silent War\\" is, however, well-written, and is certainly not a piece of Communist propaganda, although the reader would do well to remember that the author's prejudice falls heavily on the side of that particular ideology, and therefore his account of several historical figures and events is rather suspect. Philby's arrogance is not altogether off-putting, and in some passages, he can be quite charming, even funny. Still, it is hardly a satisfying autobiography.*I would instead recommend John Le Carre's novel, \\"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\\", for those looking for a true tale of espionage. Though Le Carre's book is fictional, it is based on the Philby case, and shows the true devestation a \\"mole\\" can cause. Le Carre himself was a member of the SIS, and was even an acquaintance of Philby's, and therefore his novel is extremely true to life and makes for fascinating reading."},{"Title":"My silent war (Modern Library classics)","review":"The autobiography of Kim Philby, minus the last years (25) he spent in the Soviet Union, after his defection in 1963, is STILL a great read, his influncing US spy Hanssen, or not, notwithstanding. Mind you, a great deal of what he states is misinformation, based on fact, but that in itself makes for an even better read, for it is precisely at that game, that of misinforming, that Philby had no peer in the world of intelligence, ever. Moreover, his crafty use of the English language should also provide readers with a clue, or two, about the use of it, as should his former MI6 colleage and friend Graham Greene's brilliant prologue. Philby's unremorsefulness, disdain for his Queen and Country, and true allegiance to the communist cause ( which had already lasted nearly 35 years by the time the book was written), is not really the point here. After his defection, he knew what sort of people would buy his memoirs, and that was for the most part the MI6, MI5, FBI and CIA crowd he'd worked so hard to penetrate, and desinform, through the long years. And, in 1967, he wanted to inflict an even bigger damage on them. In this regard, he only partly succeeded. For a complete overview in the life of this, the most intriguing of all British traitors, interested readers should turn, first and foremost, to &quot;Treason in the blood&quot; ( tracing both Kim's and his famous father St John's lives). In addition, American readers could explore &quot;The Cambridge Spies: The untold story of McLean, Philby and Burgess in America&quot;, for a detailed, and harrowing account of how much did Philby and their cohorts achieve, in as little as a seven-year period at the dawn of the Cold War (from McLean's arrival in Washington, in 1944, to Philby's departure from the US, in 1951, and including Burgess' short, but deadly D.C. stay, at the start of the Korean War in 1950), in the penetration of the US intelligence establishment, on Moscow's orders."},{"Title":"My silent war (Modern Library classics)","review":"\\"My Silent War\\" presents a witty and literate glimpse into the subtle mind of one of the KGB's most successful spies, Kim Philby. The Cambridge graduate had thoroughly penetrated MI6 and was being groomed to be \\"C\\", or head of British Intelligence (although some writers including Nigel West dispute this) during World War II and the beginning of the Cold War, when he was finally unmasked because of the flight of his fellow Cambridge spies, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess.Kim Philby, according to Seale and McConville, has become a \\"caricature\\" of \\"Western demonology,\\" a \\"byword of reproach,\\" the deadly \\"viper\\" in the \\"trusting bosom of his country\\" (\\"Philby: The Long Road to Moscow,\\" 1978, 13). Nigel West's characterization of \\"My Silent War\\" as a \\"vitriolic\\" memoir illustrates this (even though his assessment of Philby in \\"The Friends\\" [1988, 51-68], is otherwise balanced). As evidence of \\"vitriol\\" he presents Philby's judgment (\\"MSW,\\"109) of Sir Stewart Menzies (\\"C\\" of MI6) as an intellectually \\"unimpressive . . . fairly cloistered son of the upper levels of the British establishment\\" whose attitudes [as far as counterespionage was concerned] were \\"schoolboyish-- bars, beards, and blonds\\"--an assessment that West himself confirms in \\"The Friends\\" (117). \\"Vitriol\\" in this instance and truth do not seem to be mutually exclusive. Was Menzies truly \\"hounded\\" by Philby's words? In retrospect, they seem rather mild when compared to those of John Le Carre (a.k.a. David Cornwell of MI5--eternal rival of MI6) in respect to Philby in the MI5-agent-turned-best-selling-author's introduction to Page, Leitch, and Knightley's \\"Philby: The Spy who Betrayed a Generation\\" (1969, 24). Le Carre writes: \\"In ten year's time [Philby] may be stopping British tourists in the Moscow streets. Imagine that leaky-eye and whisky-voice, that hesitant, soft-footed charm [.]\\"Now THAT is vitriol!Demonizing only impedes historical truth, as far as it can ever be discerned. Yes, Philby wrote in Moscow under the noses of the KGB, and was therefore selective in his reminiscences, but \\"My Silent War,\\" written in lucid prose, never ceases to fascinate. Raising as many questions as it answers, the book never sinks to Communist Propaganda-- Philby is too clever by far, and too competent a writer. An absorbing read, Kim Philby' s autobiography fully deserves its niche in the \\"Modern Library\\" series."},{"Title":"My silent war (Modern Library classics)","review":"Treason tends to get rather an unflattering press, however successful and elegant-minded the traitor. The basic question of loyalty goes back, I guess, to time immemorial. Moral philosophers have flailed at it incessantly, all to no purpose whatsoever in my own view. The issue comes down to this - each and every one of us recognises different, and often conflicting, loyalties. Socrates let himself be framed in court on a nonsensical charge and accepted the death penalty in the name of upholding the Law. More fool Socrates, I can only reflect, for all my general enthusiasm for the Rule of Law. Under what circumstances would any of us denounce others for what we would agree was wrongdoing? That would vary, I guess, but I never heard of anyone whose answer was \`under any and all circumstances'. In particular, where national laws are involved, they are all in the last resort, as Britain's eminent late Lord Chancellor Quintin Hogg Lord Hailsham observed, \`a con'. Nations are not some be-all nor yet any end-all unless we decide for ourselves that they shall be so.The case of Philby is one where I find the opinions of the Great and the Good more enlightening and useful than I usually find them. Graham Greene goes straight to the main point - Philby has a chilling and unshakable certainty in his adopted communist faith. He offers no apologia for Stalin's atrocities, he just presents the faith to himself as more important and lasting; and that, as Greene says, is what Catholics have done for centuries. What did Philby have against his native land? Frankly, little or nothing that I can see. He is the English of the English. He despises Baldwin and Chamberlain, but so did many without giving their main loyalty to the Soviet Union as Philby did. John le Carre is too outraged to talk sense or fact (?Philby had \`no women'? Apart from his being married four times, just read Muggeridge on Philby's proclivities as a womaniser. ?Philby had \`no faith'? Well done Philby, if I understand that). Le Carre acknowledges some primacy of patriotism, whereas Greene does not. Nigel West has a different slant, and one that I find interesting. Philby, says West, was fundamentally an ego-tripper, embracing communism by way of exercising his superiority complex. That could be right, but I wouldn't bet much on it.I simply cannot assess the \`sincerity' of Philby's communist convictions: indeed I would not claim to know what I mean by that term. What I do say is that I find the personality put across in Philby's way of expressing himself to be enormously attractive and engaging. In another context, this might be the absolute exemplar of the English public-school product - articulate, elegant, witty, showing a sense of proportion and a delightful sense of the ridiculous. About his private life there is absolutely nothing in this book. He was widowed on one occasion, for all you could tell from this narrative - I found this fact out from the brief curriculum vitae at the back - and I can only wonder what it can have been like to live with a man living this kind of double life, indeed how he slept at all, let alone with someone else. The story-line is as good as Greene says it is - completely riveting and better than most spy novels (Mr le Carre please note). He got away with it all for 11 years after his elite Cambridge lefty friends from the 30's Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess fled to Russia on being unmasked as spies, and they never brought him to trial because he had gone to Moscow via Beirut when the rumbling suspicions were finally confirmed, never to leave.Philby never really made the headlines in the way Burgess and Maclean did, partly because their discovery was at the height of the early cold war and the baleful era of Joseph McCarthy; partly because they were both homosexual, Maclean of the closet variety, Burgess a complete roarer. After their disappearance I still recall the cartoon by Bud Neil in the Glasgow Evening Times. Two workmen in flat caps were emerging from a manhole in the street, and one of Bud Neil's shapeless women says to another \`It widnae be them?' Distance lends enchantment to the view, but Philby has brought a lot of the enchantment back. Eleu loro."},{"Title":"My silent war (Modern Library classics)","review":"The book has thirteen chapters and the first ten are painfully boring. The last three chapters, although somewhat interesting, lack significant detail to ever recover from the three and a half hours of your life you just waisted. Philby has much more to say about every day office politics than anything about espionage. If I was writing a book and had nothing to say this is the book I would write. At the end there is a four page chronology on Philby's life. Take two minutes in the book store and read the chronology and you will get more out of it than the 202 pages that came before it. The best part will be putting it back on the shelf and moving on to something more interesting."},{"Title":"My silent war (Modern Library classics)","review":"I just love his humour, the book is straightforward, without any political bull.... The guy only once and very shortly explains his motivation behind \\"converting\\" and then goes on to tell it all (or sort of). In this business it is quite impossible to tell it all of course.As a homo sovieticus myself, I was quite impressed about the information in this book. I would have betted for more censorship, after all it was written in Soviet Union!"},{"Title":"My silent war (Modern Library classics)","review":"Very good book. Well written. Simply put, Philby was true to the cause he believed in. How wrong was this really? Makes you wonder. Before I read the book my opinion of Philby was cut and dried: TRAITOR! After reading his autobiography I am left with questions as to how mistaken were his loyalties to the \\"wrong\\"(in our opinion) philosophy. Be as it may, he was loyal to the very end, and with no material gain (unlike other spies). Make no mistake, he will always be a monster and a spy, but he was doing his job, one he believed in and dedicated all of his life to. He should not, and cannot ever be forgiven for what he did, but perhaps better understood for his motivation."},{"Title":"My silent war (Modern Library classics)","review":"Whereas, Philby is extremely circumspect in his story, and reveals almost no details of his traitorous actions, this short text, fully describes the chaos of the early British secret service. This book is almost written tongue-in-cheek, as though Philby is poking fun at his former colleagues. The book borders on catty. He describes some of the people he betrayed with strange affection, and others with old-style British disdain.What is revealed, and quite lucidly, is the utter chaos of the formation of the British Secret Service in the early years of WWII. He makes it clear how easy it was to manipulate the Service on behalf of his Soviet handlers. His rise to head of the Soviet counter-intelligence group was facilitated by the petty rivalries within the various divisions, each seeking its own funding and personnel.As his old school education, Cambridge education, and clear articulation reveal, he was moved forward mostly because of his ability to write briefs clearly in a world of petty bureaurocrats who relied on men who were either frankly inept or more concerned with politics than solving problems.As this book is a quick read (as long as you skip quickly over the various explanations of divisional structures), it is worth a look. I had this book sitting on my shelf for years, but decided to read it after watching \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\". Le Carre has taken much of the Philby betrayal and created his superb spy thriller from actual events of the day.One interesting footnote, is that Grahame Green remained friends with Philby until his death. Green visited Philby after he removed to Moscow before being arrested."},{"Title":"My silent war (Modern Library classics)","review":"If you're looking at this book, you are likely familiar with Kim Philby's CV, so I won't discuss that. Rather than buying this book, I suggest you check it out from your local library, and not waste your money. All of the things that would make this autobiography worth reading are simply not there. Instead, you get Philby's smug account of his career in the most general, broad-brush terms. Egotistical, self-absorbed, self-impressed -- the author's writing style, and personality, makes for a very dull book. But, that gives you an idea of why he was so successful for so long -- he obviously thought he was the smartest kid in the classroom and could outwit everyone else. Other than that insight, I kept waiting for him to say something revealing and was disappointed. I'm really not sure who would find this book interesting."},{"Title":"My silent war (Modern Library classics)","review":"If you're looking for any understanding of why Kim Philby betrayed his country for so many years you won't find it here. The book is more a series of chapter length anecdotal stories about events we already have learned more about elsewhere. What does show through though is his ego centric disdain for the rest of the \\"players\\" in his world.Don't expect to read about his early years, his many marriages, his motivations or his reaction to Khruschev's 1956 lifting the veil on Stalin's terror years. Not here.For a better understanding of Philby and his co conspirators - read \\"My Cambridge Friends\\" by Yuri Modin. Modin was his KGB handler and the handler of most of the other Cambridge crew : Cairncross, Burgess, McClean and Blunt. McClain apparently was the most destructive of the 5 for he provided strategic political insight to Soviet leadership. Philby, though devastating to western spy networks and the longest serving of the 5 (except perhaps for Blunt), didn't so much alter the course of world politics and power but the way the \\"game\\" was played.I don't know who the royalties for this book go to. But I wouldn't be wanting to make charitable contributions to them. It wasn't in Philby's nature to be charitable."},{"Title":"Pretty Little Devils","review":"i read this book within 2 days! its great dramatic and suspensfull!! i absolutly loved it its a lot better then other books like the clique gossip girls etc.. this is by far one of my favorites if you like mystery and girl gossip and just about every other problem in a teenage life.. its pretty much for you. get this book! you'll love it.. or at least i did! *im using my dad's account haha just so you don't think my dad is weird i thought i would put that out there*"},{"Title":"Pretty Little Devils","review":"This book was excellent.

Just goes to show you that high school girls really can be vicious..."},{"Title":"Pretty Little Devils","review":"IfPossessionswas \\"Mean Girls goes paranormal\\", then Pretty Little Devils was \\"Mean Girls gone psycho\\".Pretty Little Devils reminded me a lot of the horror movies of the nineties (Scream etc.) and the Point Horror books of the same time period (can you see I'm dating myself a little here?). The horror there is more psychological, with the mystery of who is doing this, what they are doing and why being used to disturb the audience rather than shot after shot of violence and gore that is much more popular at the current time.That said, while we do not see directly the most violent and disturbing acts committed by the mysterious caller, we still hear about what happened and with all sorts of description. Through one character in particular, Holder uses our fascination with gossip (especially the more morbid kind - like how we are most interested in celebrities once they die, rather when they achieve anything) in a very effective manner. It's very disconcerting to see that sort of behaviour in fiction, and know you can't explain it away through it being fiction or just that character. Unfortunately it's a reflection of real-life, and while some elements of stories like Pretty Little Devils is a little outlandish, at the root of many parts of it is still a lot of truth.For me though the most disturbing aspect was not the psychotic killer with a vendetta against the PLDs, but the PLDs themselves. Or rather, the groups of girls that the PLDs represent, and a) how girls can treat each other this way and call it friendship and b) that girls are so desperate to be popular and have that status that they can put up with that treatment. None of the PLDs and company are likable characters - even the main character is deeply flawed when it comes to what she wants - but over the course of the story layers start to be stripped away to reveal at least a little something to be sympathetic to.The message in Pretty Little Devils - be yourself, and be happy for it - is fairly obvious and most heavy-handed in the name (HAPPY2BME) the killer posts to their personal blog, but it still a very good one that needs to be listened to. Pretty Little Devil's wraps up this message in a story with plenty of twists and turns (I thought I had the killer picked out, but I started to waver about half-way through and by the end of it I had pretty much given up), and I think teen girls would like a twist in the popular clique books that are so popular at the moment."},{"Title":"Pretty Little Devils","review":"Hazel Stone, who is just starting her junior year in high school, is desperate to make new friends. Tired of the default group she's a part of, Hazel wants to be a member of the Pretty Little Devils, which consists of perfect popular girls. To her surprise, Sylvia Orly, the leader of the PLDs, agrees, and soon Hazel is inducted into the group, which subsists on secret parties during babysitting jobs, horror movies, and practical jokes.Meanwhile, Hazel has eyes on Matty Vardeman --- but so does Breona Wu, the head cheerleader and Sylvia's mortal enemy. Lucky for Hazel, he chooses the newly \\"damned\\" PLD instead of the cheerleader. Unfortunately this makes Breona extremely angry, and she and Hazel begin getting into fights in class.Sounds like typical high school drama. Well, it is --- until things turn sinister.

They're the queen bees of the school, whom everyone adores. So after Sylvia, their \\"leader\\" invites Hazel to one of their parties, she quickly agrees. Soon, Hazel is one of them and feels on top of the world. But trouble is brewing for this group of babysitters...they begin getting creepy phone calls, anonymous text messages, and emails from someone out to get them. As people around them start turning up dead, Hazel's not sure she wants to be a PLD anymore. Is her life worth the popularity?This book immediately made me think of the \\"Pretty Little Liars\\" series by Sara Shepard; with an anonymous person sending threatening texts to the most popular girls in school. Not to mention the title of the book...heh. I was pretty disappointed with the book. After reading the summary that immediately got me hooked, and all of the 5 star reviews about it online, I was surprised that I didn't really like the book. I think that the writing was weak and not very descriptive. Most of the time, the character's dialogue seemed artificial - either forced, or not how teenagers their age would normally talk. Also, the texting lingo was annoying; not all teenagers type like \\"C U L8R\\" like the author made it seem. In fact, I don't know anyone who types like that - it just takes longer to decipher the message. The book was written through normal chapters, the PLD's chat room - when they would type very annoyingly - and through short blog posts written by the killer.I'll admit though that the author did a great job keeping up suspense throughout the book! I was never quite certain who the killer could be, and it kept me on the edge of my toes - not knowing what would happen next. The ending was...interesting. Very unexpected. It's not until the last page that you find out who the real murderer was throughout the whole book; and even though it was a twist, it didn't make any sense. The author didn't include a motive for the character or anything so I'm still left pretty confused.Unfortunately, none of the characters in the book were likable. It was sad seeing how the PLD's defined friendship, because it wasn't accurate. Throughout the whole book, all Hazel was concerned with was fitting in, being liked, and what others thought about her. She had no problem turning her back on her old friends to join the PLD's instead. That shows a lot about her character, and she didn't change, either but instead just got worse as the book continued. The PLD's did a whole lot of underage drinking, not just at their parties, and the author didn't make it seem like a bad thing. Usually authors are trying to persuade their teen readers to not fall into peer pressure and drink, by having some type of bad consequence follow up. Nope, not here. Instead, it just made the PLD's look even more \\"cool\\". From the way the PLD's were portrayed - as unreachable and perfect from the eyes of the other highschool students - I found it strange how they randomly asked Hazel to join their group. She was a nobody beforehand, sort of like in the movie Mean Girls. What made them choose her to join the group that all of the other girls at school were dying to join? No pun intended.I really tried my best to enjoy this book and get into it, but I simply couldn't. Maybe it just wasn't for me.

I'm reading another one of her books (Possession) which is decent enough. It's also not like I can't get into YA fiction- it's actually one of my most favorite things to read. For whatever reason, this just didn't trip my trigger.I think what really did this in was that it was pretty obviously inspired by the Pretty Little Liars series. There's nothing wrong with writing a similarly themed book but Holden borrowed pretty liberally from the series to the point where the books share most of a title.

The crank calls were definitely eerie (I know I would flip out if some weirdo was crank calling me like that). Sylvia definitely has the group wrapped around her finger, even sweet little Hazel, who can't believe she's one of the PLD's.

Over 2/3 way in I almost gave up reading it wondering when the killer was going to strike at all! The threatening emails and text messages in almost every chapter never blossomed into anything tangible until it was too late to hold my interest any longer. Then the last 60 pages feel so rushed with half page scenes and lighting fast death after death!Also I feel Holder skipped over detailing what could have made this book worth while! The deaths were only briefly spoken about and there was virtually no final confrontation between the heroine and the villain!I give PLD 2 stars because even though I wasn't impressed with the plot itself, most of the characters were somewhat likable and the killer did catch me completely by surprise...

Mr. Breuer retells dozens of stories that were orginally reported in the book, HOUR OF REDEMPTION, by military historian Forrest Johnson, but Mr. Breuer neglects to cite or even acknowledge the existence of Mr. Johnsons's book, the first work ever written on Cabanatuan camp, published back in the 1970s.

As a Filipino-American, whose ancestor were directly affected by WWII, I found the book to be inspirational seeing both my beloved homelands unite to fight for the greater good.The book gives life to a time in history of great importance, that Americans lack awareness-in and in dept to pay tribute to both Filipinos and Americans who fought for their country.After reading the book, one is left with sheer amazement, pride, appreciation, and yet saddened by the lack of tribute lacking for these veterans, and The Great Insult America has bestowed upon Filipinos who fought and died for America and America's soldiers.In July 14, 1941, when the Philippines was still a colony of the U.S., 140,000 Filipino soldiers was call to active service by then President Franklin Roosevelt to fight in WWII along side the Americans under the U.S. flagTheir brave service under the U.S. flag was snubbed when in 1946 Congress sign into law the Rescission Act of 1946, which affectively denied them their right to receive the same right given to other WWII U.S veterans.Today there are only 12,000 surviving Filipino American veterans in the U.S and 35,000 Filipino veterans in the Philippines.The book exemplifies the bravery these men did for the country and the injustice they are enduring today.Marimax is currently filming a movie based on this book."},{"Title":"The Great Raid","review":"As an American missionary working in the Philippines, this bit of history was very interesting for me. The history is truly amazing- the brutality of the Japanese, the response of the American government, the personality and strategy of General Douglas MacArthur, and the reaction of the Filipinos themselves were all fascinating. The author based his book on many interviews he did with survivors, and this made the recollection of history much more interesting and also much more personal. The story is told through the lives of actual individuals and their memories- this enhances the story. The author has a political point to make in his book, and it is a political point that I happen to believe has truth to it. I will quote him from page 232, \\"Who was to blame for America's monumental debacle in the Philippines and at Pearl Harbor?....the culprits were the people of the United States and shortsighted politicians in Washington who held fast to the belief that the way to keep America out of war was to remain militarily weak...\\"I enjoyed the book, but I believe it was written poorly. There was an obvious bias against the Japanese. No doubt the Japanese committed numerous atrocities, but everything in the book was shaded with an honest dislike for their race. I found this frustrating. Though Filipinos were often exalted in the book, the author writes in a way that shows his favoritism (maybe racist favoritism) for Americans. The Filipinos are portrayed as the cute \`little brown brothers', which actually are the words of a former US President. In the book, vulgarity, machismo, and plain stupidity of American soldiers is exaggerated and exalted. The retelling of this history reminded me of how a war veteran might recount the events- with favoritism, a little added heroics, and genuine hate for the enemy. Are these things bad for a veteran to do and or believe? I don't believe so, but a non-fiction history account should retell history in a clear, non-biased way. Would I want my great-uncle Frank to tell me about his experience in WW2? Of course- I would covet first hand information. But would I want to base my understanding of the entire war on much more than Uncle Frank's observation? No. This book felt like great-uncle Frank. I look forward to reading Ghost Soldiers, to get a different style and outlook regarding the Philippines during WW2."},{"Title":"The Great Raid","review":"Like many people, I read and generally enjoyed the 2001 bestsellerGhost Soldiers: The Epic Account of World War II's Greatest Rescue Mission. What I didn't realize when I picked up this earlier book, was that it covers almost the exact same material, but in a much less engaging way. (It should be noted that both books owe a huge debt to Forrest Johnson's 1978 bookHour of Redemption: The Heroic WW II Saga of America's Most Daring POW Rescue, a debt acknowledged in Ghost Soldiers but not by this book.) Here, Breuer provides a workmanlike account of the post-Pearl Harbor political and military context that led to the U.S. \\"abandonment\\" of the Philippines, its subsequent fall to Japan, and the horrific fate of the US and Filipino soldiers taken prisoner. He similarly sketches out the spy network that operated under Japanese occupation, the regrouping of U.S. forces as the war in Europe wound down, and the planning and execution of the titular raid to free 511 POWs.This material all more or less overlaps with Ghost Soldiers but isn't nearly as well written. Breuer has a penchant for trite melodramatic phrasing, and tends to repeat information over and over and over as if his reader has no memory. It also doesn't help that instead of simply writing \\"three Rangers did X\\", he writes, \\"John Q. Doe of Springfield, IL, James R. Doe of Anywhere, WY, and Jesse T. Doe of Plainview, MI did X.\\" I certainly understand his desire to honor every solider he can by naming them, but it makes for very awkward reading. Another small tick that bothered me was that if any soldier had played college football, that merited mention -- but only football, no other sport. Why? Finally, his interviews with veteran POWs and Rangers seemed to yield little more than the most banal of anecdotes and recollections and their inclusion, again, while honoring them, really doesn't help the book's readability.Unfortunately, behind the weak writing lurk bigger flaws. Foremost of these is a total lack of explanation as why it was deemed so crucial to mount a dangerous, complex, behind-enemy-lines mission to rescue the POWs. Breuer repeats a number of times that it was feared that the Japanese would massacre the POWs, but never tells what foundation that fear rested on. The reader is left to conclude that it was all basically hearsay based on the notion that the Japanese might do it for reasons of revenge as they retreat. This contrasts poorly with Ghost Soldiers, which explains that the U.S. Army's knew of one such massacre (the Palawan Massacre, in which American POWs were burned alive by retreating Japanese), and thus there was a very real fear guiding the raid at the climax of the book. The book also suffers somewhat from Breuer's agenda to lionize Douglas MacArthur and vilify Roosevelt and the \\"faceless Washington bureaucrats\\" (can someone please retire this trite phrase?). This is somewhat redeemed by his drawing attention to the massively heroic efforts of Filipino soldiers at the side of the Americans, and their subsequent total betrayal when it came to due honors and compensation from the U.S. government.However, in the end, there's no reason to read this version of history when Ghost Soldiers is available -- unless you're really really interested in the Pacific Campaign. There's so much overlap between the two that all you'd be getting is different emphases. Related books that might be worth checking out areSilent Warriors of World War II: The Alamo Scouts Behind the Japanese LinesandManila Espionage, Claire Phillips account of her life as the ringleader of an Allied spy ring in the Philippines (later made into the forgettable film I Was An American Spy)."},{"Title":"The Great Raid","review":"I wanted to read this to learn more about the War in the Pacific. I found some good information regarding the Philippines, but it was hard to read and it did not lay the ground work for the big picture. I liked reading Bataan Diary by Chris Schaefer for a more well documented line of the War in the Philippines and I enjoyed Ghost Soldiers better for easier, exciting reading on the raid of Cabanatuan."},{"Title":"The Great Raid","review":"I was disappointed in this book for 2 main reasons.I had read Ghost Soldiers: The Epic Account of World War II's Greatest Rescue Mission byHampton Sides and had assumed this would be another book about the raid. So I was very disappointed to find three quarters of the book covered the war in the Philippines prior to the raid. I understand that this information was important to give the groundwork and reason for the raid but three quarters of the book??Mr. Breuer seemed to be determined to lionize Douglas MacArthur and blame Roosevelt and Washington for not reinforcing him when the Japanese invaded the Philippines. I don't claim to be an expert but I remember that the US military ran war games in the early 1920s and determined that they could not defend and reinforce the Philippines if the Japanese invaded. Considering he was the army chief of staff during the Hoover administration, I find it a bit of a stretch that he was not aware of this war planning. Second he seemed to amazed how ill-prepared the Filipino army was - wasn't a special military to the Filipino president?Mr Breuer rightly gave credit to General MacArthur for his hitting the Japanese where they weren't; a strategy which saved many American lives. But to make a disparaging comparison about Eisenhower and the D Day invasion on Normandy was inappropriate. The reason that MacArthur's strategy worked so well, was that he controlled the air and seas preventing the Japanese from responding. Hitler was very able to shift his troops in Europe to counter any allied invasion.I read the book because I wanted to know more about the raid, but would not recommend it.Marty Ford"},{"Title":"The Great Raid","review":"I read The Great Raid and found it very moving. It's hard to imagine the atrocities that occurred during that time period. I just recently saw the movie The Great Raid and it made everything come alive. Seeing how the prisoners of war were treated horrified me. It's amazing what the human body can endure and still survive."},{"Title":"The Great Raid","review":"This is the sort of exciting, astonishing history that must make novelists despair: How can fiction compete with reality? If a fiction writer dared to put into a novel the heroics, impossible feats and strange coincidences that are recounted here it would be condemned as far-fetched. But these events -- the Bataan Death March and the US Army Ranger raid on the Japanese POW camp near Cabanatuan on Luzon near the end of WWII -- really happened!A stirring history; a thrilling read.(Much, much better than Side's \\"Ghost Soldiers\\" with its lame justifications of the Japanese army's atrocities.)"},{"Title":"The Great Raid","review":"I read the book because I had enjoyed the movie based on it. As much as I enjoyed the movie, I enjoyed the book even more. It is a good, quick read and tells the story clearly. There is also much background material as well as a section in the back of the book that tells what happened to the major characters. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Great Raid","review":"I had expected better. As other reviewers have said, this book finds no fault with MacArthur (though many respected historians regard the re-taking of the Philippines as redundant and unnecessary altogether) and often reads as if written by a breathless cheerleader. Melodramatic? Yes, often. Read Hampton Sides' GHOST SOLDIERS instead."},{"Title":"The Great Raid","review":"HOUR OF REDEMPTION by Forrest Bryant Johnson is a thousand times the book that Breuer's is. Don't waste your $$$ on this one. Johnson wrote the original and it is the gold standard for the Cabanatuan raid (even far better than Sides' GHOST SOLDIERS).If you are interested in this subject, buy Johnson's book instead. It has been re-released and is available at the major bookstores as well as at Amazon.com. Johnson's HOUR OF REDEMPTION is the best WW II book I have read, bar none. I would highly recommend it to anyone, not just military buffs."},{"Title":"The Great Raid","review":"This is a fast-reading look at the January 1945 raid that freed over 500 remaining survivors of Bataan and Corregidor from imprisonment and likely execution at the hands of the Japanese. Author William Breuer describes more than just this remarkable raid on the Cabanatuan POW camp. He also gives a solid background, which included the surprise Japanese attack on the Philippines in December, 1941, the defense of Bataan and Corregidor, the death march, imprisonment, the activities of Filipino Guerillas, and the pacific war in general. Then he moves on to describe training for this mission, and the daring mission itself by the Alamo Scouts, Filipino's, and Army rangers, which exceeded beyond expectations (but not without tragic loss). The book is based largely on interviews with survivors, although I did occasionally wonder if the author had all his facts straight. Still, this is a gripping read."},{"Title":"The Great Raid","review":"I read the original hardback before it was out of print and now that it is in paperback I will be reading it again. One of the most gripping stories in history, I was spellbound and found it difficult to put the book down. Excellent storytelling."},{"Title":"The Great Raid","review":"Ask questions. The book and the movie that followed were both attempts to glorify the WRONG people. I'll admit that the Rangers had their hand in this rescue mission. But the REAL heroes are those of the Alamo Scouts. Look it up.I won't buy this book, nor will I support the movie...because the only reason the Rangers could participate in this mission was due to the help, and highly skilled Alamo Scouts. There is one book out on them, and their missions: Silent Warriors of World War II: The Alamo Scouts Behind Japanese Lines."},{"Title":"The Obsession - Reflections On The Tyranny Of Slenderness","review":"I read The Obsession back in 1980, when it first appeared. I was struggling with a severe eating disorder, and thought my problem had to do with will power and discipline. The Obsession was one of three books I read that year that literally turned my life around: the other two were Feeding the Hungry Heart, by Geneen Roth, and Fat is a Feminist Issue, by Susie Orbach. Each gave me a different, and crucial, perspective on my own struggles. Kim Chernin's book reminded me that the craze for skinniness is a very recent development in Western culture; that it has everything to do with the power dynamics of our society, and nothing to do with whether we're good or bad people based on our size; and that the most powerful female figures in history have been amply endowed, if not (by modern standards) downright fat. After reading this book, I felt like a warrior goddess for weeks. It helped me let go of a lot of self-hatred and confusion about my body. Kim Chernin is also an exquisite writer - there were passages that literally took my breath away. I give this book my highest recommendation for any woman struggling with her body image, or any reader wanting to understand women's minds at a deeper level."},{"Title":"The Obsession - Reflections On The Tyranny Of Slenderness","review":"This thoughtful, powerful, and well-researched study of women\`s preoccupation with food and weight is one of the best feminist reads ever. I began the book with expectations of simply enjoying a valid cultural history of food and eating. Soon, however, I could\`nt put it down, as I recognized myself and many of my friends and relatives in Chernin\`s case histories and literary examples. She captures perfectly the feelings of guilt and low self-esteem that ensue when you don\`t stick to a society-prescribed diet, even though that diet may be harming you physically and emotionally. She mentions at length the uneasiness felt by women who are miraculously happy with their bodies, because a culture and media obsessed with willowy, thin figures subtly pressure them to feel uneasy. The structure of the book is set up as a neat balance between real-life studies of anorexia and other weight disorders juxtaposed with cultural and literary views on women and their appetites and figures. The section on Margaret Atwood\`s novel &quot;The Edible Woman&quot; and its treatment of the anorexic personality is just one instance where Chernin\`s insights amaze you. At the book\`s fascinating conclusion, I felt like cheering. It makes one feel proud to be a woman, no matter what size you wear or which body part you dislike. I\`m not going to say that it turned my entire self-image around, but it definitely helped set me on a path of self- discovery and liking my physical body beter. That\`s why I hope today\`s young women will find and read it, too. Oh, and the poem comparing designer jeans to girdles is priceless!"},{"Title":"The Obsession - Reflections On The Tyranny Of Slenderness","review":"I read this book a while ago and was very moved and still am by its candidness. I found that it will resonate with anyone who has experienced an eating disorder, and it will enlighten someone who is naive to the hell that underlies such an eating disorder. After reading this remarkable volume, one cannot help but realise that eating disorders are not at all about food and that overcoming one involves much more than changing one's eating habits. The reader will realise that beating such a disorder is no easy feat. It can be the hardest task someone will ever complete."},{"Title":"The Obsession - Reflections On The Tyranny Of Slenderness","review":"This book was such a help to me in my cross over between teen to adult and the self image I had of myself. It opened my eyes to the fact that if you are not a 12 year old girl you won't look like one. Women are meant to have curves. I highly recommend for young girls so they don't buy into the onslaught of images showing anorexia as beauty."},{"Title":"The Obsession - Reflections On The Tyranny Of Slenderness","review":"Being neither a woman nor someone who has had any eating disorders, I hesitate to be too harsh about this piece. I would guess that \\"The Obsession\\" will (and, judging from the other reviews, does) serve as a device of comfort for some of those who are members of the aforesaid categories.However, as someone who chose the book because of an interest in eating disorders--friends have experienced them--I was disappointed by this work.Potential readers should be forewarned that most of the \\"analysis\\" in the work is psychoanalytic: that is, virtually useless. A quote from page 166 my 1981 paperback edition summarizes the problem: \\"But when we know of the obsession that follows, we shall be inclined to see in this cluster of disparate facts the very pattern which underlies the eventual development of obsession.\\" That is, the author is using throughout the book post hoc reasoning, fitting information to theory. The least thought is required to see that the principal conclusion reached here (that social oppression of women leads to eating disorders) is well supported by the evidence in the book, provided the conclusion is known before the supporting data are selected. Likewise, the least thought is required to realize that, because no speculation is offered as to why some women do _not_ develop eating disorders, the argument of the book is naught but rationalization.Another minor flaw--perhaps this has been rectified in subsequent editions--is that the prose is boring.Again, I mean not to deny that the volume might be a comfort to some; to most, however, it will not be worth the price. I paid the equivalent of about 75 cents for it and regret it."},{"Title":"Awakening The Mystic Gift: The Surprising Truth About What It Means To Be Psychic","review":"Jane Doherty is the real deal and she shows you how to open the psychic within yourself.

It's a tale I first read 20 years ago and I cannot drive through a small town on a beautiful fall day without remembering the vivid characters and thinking that small towns may not be as peaceful as they seem."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"A perfect book to curl up with on a gray autumn day, Harvest Home is gracefully written, with a formal and classic narrative voice more characteristic of turn-of-the-century fiction than a 1973 horror novel. You feel assured by the reasonableness of Ned Constantine, the narrator, and learn to trust his level assessment of the strange goings-on in the isolated New England village where he and his family have escaped to from crime-ridden New York City. At the time of the book's release in 1973, there was indeed a serious back-to-the-land movement of educated city-bred intellectuals migrating to the romance, purity and safety of the countryside. As in real life, many of these city folk discovered the dark side of rural life, albeit not to the degree of Ned Constantine, who is slowly seduced by the beauty and charm of Cornwall Coombe, only to find its surface civilization a shade away from the paganism of Medieval Druids. It is precisely because this story could actually take place in reality that makes it so horrifying. It is not probable that a rural community would embrace such extremes of pagan worship, but after all, we realize our beloved holidays of Halloween, Christmas, and Easter are borne from primitive practices, and we are not so far removed from these practices ourselves. Thomas Tryon embeds in his hero the deep, pre-conscious fear of The Feminine, including the fear of castration (here symbolized by cutting out the tongue), and of being tamed and indeed rendered impotent by female domesticity and desire. Freud would indeed have a field day here, as well as feminists who recognize the early-70s male anxiety of women taking over the workplace as well as the home. The intense power of Tryon's storytelling transcends any traces of misogyny in the narrative. The true horror of the concluding section, a climax carefully prepared for by Tryon with a slow build (quite appropriate for the deceptively peaceful setting) will still shock you even if you can see it coming a mile away. Such is the skill of a masterful craftsman who has us in his power from the first word to the last."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"After reading several reviews of this book, I requested it from my local library. I'm so glad I did. It's everything one could hope for in a classical horror genre. It reminded me of many things of I'd read or seen made into film, some of which must have been influenced by this book, and others which must have inspired it. There were hints of \\"Young Goodman Brown,\\" \\"The Lottery,\\" \\"Children of the Corn,\\" \\"Wicker Man,\\" and various other stories of \\"outsider vs. old ways.\\" While it doesn't paint women in a very positive light, it's easy to look past that and just enjoy getting sucked into a really good story written by a really good story-teller. The creepiness starts very subtly, and once you're fully engulfed in the story, it's pretty terrifying. Not in a slasher/psycho kind of way, but more in a sense of building dread. Don't miss an opportunity to find and read (or re-read) this book!"},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"Years ago, friends of mine who'd seen the TV movie spoiled the ending for me, but I finally decided to read it anyway. I'm glad I did. Although I knew the ending, there were plenty of moments along the way that took me by surprise, moments where I realized something as the narrator did as well. Beyond the horror elements, &quot;Harvest Home&quot; is a great book, richly detailed with unforgettable characters like Mother Fortune."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"If you just love to be caught up in a novel so tightly written that you just can't stop turning the pages and you are sorry to see it end -- you must have Harvest Home.When Tryon's novel was initially published, almost every person I worked with was reading it. We relished the reactions of each person as they began the story, and laughed to see them sneak extra reading time when they thought \\"management\\" wasn't watching. Be careful -- Harvest Home is the kind of novel that will make you ride past your bus stop or make you stay up all night long reading 'till you arrive at what must be one of the BEST, most exciting conclusions of any piece of fiction I've ever seen.If you haven't read Harvest Home, you've just got to buy a copy.

But i was sorta disappointed."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"This is the first book that I have ever felt guilty about reading. I picked it up hoping for some plot-driven relief from a Henry James novel. While the plot was compelling, Tryon's pretentious style almost made me prefer James. Further, Ned Constantine and his family are the shallowest of characters and, even though I wanted to like them, I found myself hoping for their untimely ends. Ned was the one character in a position to unravel the secret of Harvest Home - or at least get away - but he made bad decisions at every possible juncture. In a book this length, it is asking a lot for a reader to believe that even a shallow, stupid man could be so blind. If you are determined to spend money on this book, buy it by the cord and use it for kindling."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"I thought nothing would happen for the longest time.

Figured there would be some human sacrifice involved, but didn't see who it would be until near the end. Is there some serious allegory here about masculine v. feminine or primitive v. civilized? Maybe but not well developed. Actually the book was mostly dull with a pretty silly ending and an over-the-top, fairly annoying style.

There was a miniseries made from it starring Bette Davis in her later years, playing a New England &quot;wise woman&quot;. It's about a family moving from the big city to a quaint old-fashioned New England village. Hilarity does not ensue. A growing sense of horror and suspense does. How many times have we read that story, huh? Well, this one is different in that it is so well written and the end is so shocking. All of Tom Tryon's books are wonderful, and I know this one is also out of print, sadly enough. Come on, you people know you've seen it at garage sales, at used book stores, on the table at the library's annual book sale. Should you ever come across &quot;Harvest Home&quot;, pick it up. This story will stay with you, you'll think about it years later and re-read it - as did I."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"Harvest Home is not, despite frequent mislabeling, a horror novel. It is, however, a fairly good psychological tale that showcases its author's inventiveness and in the Widow gives the reader the delightful chance to know the sort of finely-crafted character rarely in evidence in contemporary fiction. Harvest Home is imaginative and unique, slightly puzzling, and in its own way horrific if not horrifying. Harvest Home also takes its time and moves along at an unhurried pace, not giving a lot of bang for the buck compared to later examples of the genre but offering in exchange a brooding claustrophobia, ever-present and similar to that which Shirley Jackson achieved in The Haunting of Hill House. What the intelligent plot of Harvest Home excels at is in its setting, its quietly layered story about a community which has successfully refused to be overwritten by the forces of society outside it. The residents of the Coombe have not so much escaped modern ways as sidestepped the taint of them via longstanding avoidance, and in so doing have clung to some very old and highly sanguine ways of doing things. Harvest Home is not \\"must read\\" literature but it does re-pay the investment of time and patience necessary to reach the end of its carefully-wrought tale."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"When I picked up Harvest Home in a second-hand bookshop I had pretty low expectations - I'd read other works by the same author and been decidedly underwhelmed. Once I'd read it I decided that perhaps all writers have one really good book in them - they just need to find the right subject matter. The fact that I guessed the dark secret of Harvest Home by about the middle of the book did nothing to spoil my enjoyment - and I have to say that the ending of the book is amazing - dark but amazing ... Sadly this book now seems to be out of print - but my advice would be if you see a second hand copy for sale snap it up! My guess is that it's a book most people will hang on to because they want to read it again and again.My verdict: One of my all time favourites - not great literature just a really entertaining read"},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"I was surprised by this book. It was written by an actor and was made into a TV Movie starring an aging Bette Davis. Strike one and two! The premise is a common theme in horror: a group of people (a writer and his family), are stuck in an isolated rural community with apparently friendly townsfolk who harbor a grisly secret. But wait! The book is actually populated with a number of interesting characters and moves swiftly through various twists and turns. The suspense builds nicely to an unpredictable climax. I enjoyed it. A good book for a rainy day."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"Beginning with a premise from Shirley Jackson's 'The Lottery', Harvest Home starts with the experience of a happy mood-shift of 'new beginnings' as a family of 70's Yuppies from New York retire to the bucolic settings of New Hampshire countryside, giving up the comforts of city living to live the life of the country gentry. What draws them to the town of Cornwall Coomb is the quaint Amish-Like sect of original settlers, ostensibly from England, who have tried to keep to the old ways, forgoing all modern conveniences. The city family tries it's best to fit in, and mostly they do, save for a few fau-pas unwittingly committed by an overcurious and somewhat ignorant central character, the Husband.And then slowly, as the story sucks the reader in to this apparent theme of readjustment, curious oddities and certain seemingly disassoicated mysteries which have hitherto been kept in the background as an apparent device to illustrate the quaintness of this rural New England atavistic culture, we start to gradually sense that there is something really...really..wrong here!With the grace of an Ira Levin novel (most particularly I'm thinking of 'Rosemary's Baby', with which this novel has much in common), Tryon begins to induce an ever-increasing sense of paranoia, through the view of the central character, as he discovers a latent Machenesque form of paganism in Cornwall Comb. As his curioisity and paranoia mounts, he becomes a pariah, not only to the town, but to his family for his 'questioning of the ways'.This mood of mystery, nameless dread and paranoia intensifes through the reading until the dark, dreadfull climax is reached, only to be surpassed by an even more chilling, yet subtler post-climax.This is my favorite horror novel of all time. Not to detract from Tryon's 'The Other', which is another great horror Novel based upon another literary premise (Poe's Doppelganger 'William Wilson'), Harvest Home seems to stick with me more. Every few years I want to bring it out and read it again. If you've read Shirley Jackson, Arthur Machen or Ira Levin, I think you will find much to enjoy here."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"First of all, I absolutely love to read and will read almost anything I can get my hands on (yes, even cereal labels). I also love being frightened. I first read Harvest Home about twenty years ago and it has left me with an unforgettable impression. It is by far, the scariest book I have ever read (I have read ALL of Stephen King's books). The story is wonderfully written and it keeps you turning pages until the chilling ending without suspecting for a minute the final outcome! I also read &quot;The Other&quot; by the same author hoping to be equally frightened, but was disappointed. I have also seen almost every &quot;scary&quot; movie there is and have never been as frightened as I was by this book. This is by far, one of the best books from any category that I have ever read!"},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"I recently joined an online book club and this was one of the first month's selections. I was in the mood for a little mystery since Halloween was around the corner so I picked this book. Although several of the book's visions can induce the creeps, I don't think I would classify this as horror.This book is apparently no longer in production so if you are interested in it, you need to get your hands on a used copy...which is no problem at here.The story is of a middle-aged couple (Ned and Beth Constantine) and their teenage daughter (Kate) that want to leave the hustle and bustle of New York City. After searching for a lengthy period of time for that perfect home, they happened upon a 300 year old house in the tiny, isolated New England village of Cornwall Coombe. Ned gives up his job as an advertising executive to pursue his lifelong passion of becoming a serious painter, and moves the family to the quaint little village.Amazingly, everyone from Cornwall Coombe still live their lives by the old ways. Some still use horses and buggies to get around, the farmers use mules and good old fashion elbow grease to plant and harvest their crops, and many rely on the healing powers/herbal remedies of the Widow Fortune, the town's influential matriarch, instead of using the doctor from a nearby town. Naturally, outsiders have a hard time fitting in and adapting to the \\"old ways\\" but thanks to the unexplained kind words about the Constantine family from the Widow Fortune, the town grows to accept Ned, Beth and Kate as their own.We also discover that the town was founded by the Penrose family centuries ago and nearly everyone in the town can trace his or her roots back to the family. Indeed, the house the Constantines bought was from Missy Penrose, the town's postmistress and it had been in her family the time until there came a point when she could no longer afford to keep it up.Just when all is cozy with the Constantines in their new town, the mysteries start to crop up and arouse Ned's curiosity. Why is there a grave of a woman named Grace Everdeen, buried outside of the cemetery gates and severely overgrown? Who is the father of Missy's daughter, also referred to as the \\"village idiot\\"/prophetic child? How does the Widow Fortune have such healing powers to help their own daughter when all other doctors have failed? Who or what is the ghost of Soakes' Lonesome? Why are these woods so heavily guarded by the tobacco-farming family, the Soakes? Who really did such atrocities to the new town peddler, Jack Stump, and why?The townfolk are full of secrets and superstitions, all that revolve around one big secret that \\"no man knows and no woman will ever tell.\\" Ned gets deeper in trouble as he unravels each secret that in turn only leads him to a few more. He discovers just how closely the town covets its corn crops and what they'll do to keep it flourishing. When unraveling the final big one, he gets to a point of no return.The plot has murder, ghosts, rape, incest, and bizarre pagan rituals. It took me a while to get into it, but overall I found it riveting. Tryon is a very detailed writer which made it much easier for me to picture each detail of the village and its occupants. Whereas some plot twists caught me by surprise, quite a few were still predictable. I was also somewhat letdown by the \\"big secret\\" as it didn't seem like much of a secret to me, especially among the villagers. The outcome of the secret is easy figured out that it can't quite be a secret among the town's people after all, unless is the ritualistic way that it happens that is the secret part, which still wasn't that surprising to me.Overall I recommend this book. It's a great read for a pre-Halloween autumn night (although it took me more than one night to read it). Just don't expect any \\"sleepless nights\\" horrors from it, but just enough punch to give you some of the creepies."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"I read this book a few years ago, and have not been able to forget its impact.

It only took me a few hours as I could not put it down. After completing the book I was in total shock and threw it across the room hitting the wall and breaking the spine. The entire book fell apart. I've been looking for another copy for my daughter who is 17 years old. Can't find one anywhere.

It is one of those books from the 70s that my parents had as a harcover, and it just stayed with me, after I took it to college and beyond. One of the key reasons this book is interesting is that it evokes an ominous sense throughout the story. Many of the details border on supernatural, yet the horror is firmly rooted in a small bucolic town's obsolete traditions involving human sacrifice and a female hegemony. If you can find it, read it. It's a fun, summer read."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"Harvest Home was one of the first \\"horror\\" novels I read while in high school and find that it is still one of the best horror/suspense novels from the seventies. After a recent re-read, I found Thomas Tryon's debut novel to be as relevant and powerful as it was when I first picked it up thirty years ago.The story weaves a classic tale of a seemingly sleepy, idyllic, small town New England hamlet, Cornwall Coombe, where a city-dwelling family, Ned and Beth Constantine moves to from NYC with their teen daughter, Kate, in search of a simpler life. Ned and family settle contently into small-town life with a determination to fit in.Before long, Ned comes to the realization that the town and it's homespun residents are not at all what they appear to be. He learns that the town's history centers around its ancient Cornish rituals which involves the harvesting of the corn crops. Ned embarks on a quest to discover the mysteries of the harvest and discovers that some secrets should never be found out.Mr. Tryon novel is a well-written chiller inhabited by believable and well-constructed characters. The descriptive imagery, characters, and action are all wonderfully depicted. I felt as though I was right in the middle of the story watching the events unfold. Harvest Home will make a nice addition to my e-reader."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"I read this book when it first came out, many years ago, and lost my original copy. I remembered it and wanted a replacement for it. I am very pleased with the quality of the copy I purchased from Amazon. The story is not too dated because of the way the people live in this community. A very good and spooky read."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"Though it doesn't exactly portray pagan/ wiccan worship in a positive light, this is one of my favourite horror novels. Vastly underrated, it has an elegance and sense of dread that put it, if not quite in the company ofThe Haunting of Hill House (Penguin Classics), then at least with great classy creep-outs likeThe House Next Door. Not much in the way of blood and guts but such a neat, quiet sense of dawning menace and a reasonably sophisticated plot make this one to be rediscovered."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"Violet DawnI can proudly say that I own \\"Harvest Home\\" and \\"The Other\\" by Thomas Tryon. This gifted writer has, in my opinion, not received the recognition that is truly due him. \\"Harvest Home\\" is written so well that one senses they are watching a movie instead of reading -- it's that descriptive! I truly believe that he was ever bit as good as Stephen King and Koontz! And I am an avid fan of both. Definitely five stars for this work."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"I know that my title is a cliche about reading modern horror stories but its actually true about Harvest Home. The book is well written with descriptive prose that flow rather than block the story, the characters are well defined and believable and the story itself flows with unexpected twists and turns. Harvest Home will keep you turning the pages and you may never see the countryside in the same light. Unfortunately, this is currently out of print, but it's worth the trouble of tracking down a used copy!"},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"I read this book in the winter of 99 it was a great book. I love the way it keeps u in suspense the whole way through. They should really bring this book back into print, i know alot of people who want to read it."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"Harvest Home is a work of classic horror - just as Rosemary's Baby is a book about female identity, changing family roles and motherhood in the 1960s, Harvest Home offers commentary on the \\"war between the sexes\\" in the 1970s. What if female power, neglected, overlooked and ultimately disregarded by \\"modern\\" men was something tangible that could be accessed, or was believed to be accessible? How would women wield that power? What if they were in charge? How much do we really know about the pre-Christian beliefs of agricultural western Europe? Those are the subjects Tryon grapples with. How does a modern guy like the narrator cope with the sexual revolution and Women's movement? He moves his wife and daughter to an apparently anachronistic village in New England trapped in a different era where men farmed the fields and women quilted, and all lived by gender specific \\"traditional\\" down home rural values. As the plot unfolds, however, the family moves ever closer to understanding their neighbors and their own roles in the drama that culminates as Harvest Home. It is not that the ending is so mysterious, but watching the narrator grow more aware is just good fun, like sitting in a dark theatre and begging the actor not to go down to the basement alone in the dark. Of course we know its a bad idea, but we still enjoy the slow journey down the stairs.Its an older book, but if you read it as Tryon's statement on female power, written at a time when men and women were locked in social combat, and a time when women were struggling to gain authority over their own lives, then characters like the Widow Fortune and Tamara and the growing empowerment of the narrator's wife, Beth (and his 'sickly' daughter),take on deeper more nuanced meanings. I re-read this book every year, just as I am preparing to plant my garden ......"},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"I first read this book in the 1970's after seeing the made -for- tv movie. My tastes in entertainment have changed from when I was a teenager, but I have to say I still get the delicious urge to read this book periodically. Tryon transports you, seduces you, leads you down a twisting, turning trail, and shocks you along the way. I found myself wanting to live in Cornwall Coomb except for...maybe in spite of...well, you'll find out. The infrequent newcomers to the Coombe always do eventually."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"You know how in horror novels, the story will tend to drive along in first gear, until those dramatic shifts into 4th for the most horrific moments? What KILLS me about Tryon is that, while he's absolutely fantastic at the 4th gear stuff, the rest of the story is literally set in Neutral, BARELY inching along.I just finished Harvest Home, having previously read The Other, and I'm glad I read both books solely for the final 50 pages of each. Those 50 pages are absolutely five star worthy, fantastic stuff I will never forget. But Tryon simply doesn't know how to get there.The problem is that there's no forward momentum to the story. Oh sure, \\"stuff\\" happens. For the first 200 pages or so, you're literally reading the narrator's list of what he did that day - yes, you meet the town, engage in some New England escapism, and occasionally, some bit of oddness will work its way in, but for the most part it's SO. UTTERLY. UNEVENTFUL!While you read, your mind will be searching for ANYTHING to grasp onto, which in a way is why the weird bits stands out so prominently. But describing mundane events - even if they'll later play a role in the overall mystery when you flash back to them - does not equal storytelling!And it kills me, because ANY story in the first 100 pages would have propelled Harvest Home forward. Frankly, anything would have been more interesting than looking over the shoulder of Ned as he goes about his day. A typical chapter: Ned goes to the Widow's house for tea. Ned then goes to paint. Ned meets Jack along the way. Ned has a drink with his wife. Ned goes to bed.\\" Yes, very rarely, something odd happens. THIS IS NOT STORY. The weird bits should be happening WHILE a STORY progresses as the backbone.And you know Tryon can tell a story. Around page 200 or so, Ned has decided to investigate the weirdness, and from here, you have a clear cut story moving toward the climactic ending - and it's quite good. A comparison would be if Poirot was hanging out at a mansion for a country party, and for 200 pages, you got the sense that something was afoot, but otherwise, you were just following typical manor activities. Then, someone dies on page 200 and Poirot spends the remaining 50 pages investigating. I can't remember Christie writing one like this.Of course, this would all be somewhat excusable if the characters were likeable and had some depth. But, er, let's just move on from this one.In retrospect, for me, the slog was worth it for the final 80 pages. But do not feel bad if you give up after the first 100 pages, which is exactly what I did. I have to say, though, that after this and The Other, I think I'm done with Tryon."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"Harvest home was made into a classic mini-series called The Dark Secret of Harvest Home, starring Betty Davis &amp; a very young Rosanna Arquette. It's a great story."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"Slow going at the beginning, this book picks up speed about 2/3 of the way through. Newcomers to a agriculturally based New England town discover some bizarre traditions and rituals honoring the harvest. Sexual situations and violence."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"Like a lot of reviewers, I read this book around the time it was first published. I read it again after almost thirty years. I found it a powerful and suspenseful tale back then, I think the level of writing--popular suspense thriller--holds up well but the underpinnings are a little creaky, though I think the primal nature of his allusions helps to impart a power to the story that, in some ways, the writing doesn't always provide.For example, the Oedipal nature of Ned's story--Greek son who despoils his mother (Mother Earth, in this case) and suffers gruesome disfigurement (not dissimilar to that suffered by Oedipus himself.) The Corn rites which seem to come directly from Frazier's \\"The Golden Bough.\\" These are cultural details which infuse the story with their power.Which doesn't mean there aren't issues. Cornish descendants might be expected to practice Celtic or Druidic fertility rites rather than ones more resemblant to (and, late in the book, are described as arising from) Ancient Greek ones. (Hint: much less in the way of violence in the former and little, if any, sex) And, speaking of sex, the proximate situation with Justin Hooke at the, pardon the pun, penultimate climax, leaves one wondering...hands securely bound behind his back? Seems like rather difficult physical situation....As for the writing. The plotting is effective though one feels that Tryon moves the downhill slide of Ned a little quickly, perhaps in anticipation of the twists at the end. Ned and the Widow Fortune are relatively well-realized but the rest of the characters rarely rise above types: the town tramp, the town golden boy. Where this lack of secondary characterization hurts the book most is in the character of Ned's wife, Beth, who remains something of a cypher through much of the book. Tryon appears to be going for a subtle shift in her as she comes under the sway of the widow and the town, and yet he feels he has to stage these melodramatic scenes--Kate's \\"death\\" and Tamar's \\"rape\\" in order to drive her motivations in distancing herself from Ned and in participating in Harvest Home. As for Kate, the daughter, she is little more than a plot device.Where I think that Tryon succeeds is in his avoidance of the standard American Gothic horror novel, a la Stephen King. He has respect for the cultural and spiritual significance of the type of society he is writing about and their rituals--unlike a lot of creative types back then (this era was bookended by stuff like \\"Easy Rider\\" and \\"Deliverance\\" which embodied the Urban Coastals paranoia about \\"country folk.\\") We can shudder in horror at the fate of those, like Ned, who cross the residents of Cornwall Coombe, and we can intellectualize their bloody acts, but the primal nature of their beliefs can't be so easily discounted--Beth's condition at the end of the novel seems to indicate that, perhaps, they may be right."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"I see quite a few glowing reveiws posted here for \\"Harvest Home\\", and I would love to add one...but I can't. It's been about 3 days since I finished reading Tryon's novel and I am still not sure if I liked it or would recommend it. It took me a couple days and about 100 pages to really get into the story, Tryon's writing style is very descriptive, almost too flowery at times. The story does not grab you by throat, (sorry if you are looking for details look at other reviews, I hate reviews filled with spoilers) you are eased into the world Tryon created. The suspense builds slowly, I mean very slowly. And the payoff is okay, but not the \\"Repeat to Yourself It's Only a Book\\" kind of payoff the cover promised. The characters of the Widow and Ned were done well, but the rest of the characters were just so much background noise. On the flip side, the story did pique my curiosity, and I did keep coming back to see how everything would come out. I see plenty of reviews here that say you can see the ending coming from a mile away....I didn't. I thought the novel was pretty inventive at times, and it kept me guessing throughout. So while I am not sure I would recommend this novel, if you happen to stumble across it, you could do a lot worse than losing a few days reading it."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"The best I can relate to you is what was said about the book in a television ad for it. An actor walked out, said, &quot;When I finished Tom Tryon's &quot;Harvest Home&quot;, I turned on all the lights and called my mother.&quot; Then he walked offstage."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"I remember reading this book way back in the early 70s, one of those \`Book of the Month' club editions with the untrimmed page edges and cheaper binding (\`special book club edition' indicated in small italic font on the inside flap of the dust jacket). In a fit of nostalgia I decided to take a second look at it more than 30 years later.Thomas Tryon was one of a triumvirate of authors successfully producing horror novels back in the late 60s - early 70s, along with Ira Levin (\`Rosemary's Baby') and William Peter Blatty (\`The Exorcist'). Tryon's previous novel \`The Other' (1971) was made into a feature film in 1972, so he was riding considerable momentum when \`Home' was issued in 1973.\`Home' takes place in 1972 in the bucolic New England town of Cornwall Coombe. Ned Constantine, the first-person narrator, his wife Beth, and daughter Kate, have just moved to the village from New York City.Cornwall Coombe has plenty of Yankee charm, a hint of mystery, and a large cast of eccentric characters: there is a kindly Widder Woman with a \`Foxfire' homeliness about her; an older married couple in the house next door, who are full of facts and observations about life in the village; a scraggly but lovable peddler; Tamar, the Town Hussy; and her odd little daughter, who is gifted with prophetic and disturbing visions.Ned discovers that much of the social and economic life of the village revolves around adherence to pastoral rituals and beliefs that are seemingly drawn from medieval England, rather than 20th century America. While at first these beliefs seem quaint and harmless to Ned and his family, he gradually realizes that there is a dark and dangerous undertone to Cornwall Coombe's customs. There is an encounter with what seems to be a \`ghost' and an eerie tableaux in the deep woods. Soon Ned is forced to a fateful decision: does he step over the line into being a participant, or does he reject the Old Ways and in so doing becomes the interloper who must be eliminated ?The main drawback to \`Harvest Home' is its leisurely pacing, so leisurely, in fact, that I suspect anyone under the age of 40 - raised on the more graphic horror that has occupied pop culture since the advent of Stephen King in the mid 70s and George Romero's seminal \`Dawn of the Dead' in 1979 - will find it boring. The Portents of Doom that Tryon sprinkles through the early pages of the book are too thin a gruel to nourish modern readers more used to violence and action within the first 50 pages of their novels. When the horror tones of the story do finally kick in, they are relatively weak and rely more on subtlety and atmosphere than overt gore.In some ways I suspect the languid tenor of \`Home' led to Tryon's somewhat premature eclipse in the world of horror fiction. Just a year after \`Home' appeared on store shelves, Stephen King would publish \`Carrie', and then in 1975 his own Haunted Village novel \`Salems Lot' which is superior to Tryon's works. In the wake of the King juggernaut, the horror tales of Tryon, Blatty, and Levin came across as too mannered and sedate.Readers willing to indulge in a slow-paced, but well-written, horror novel set in the early 70s will want to give \`Home' a try. But anyone looking for an intense dose of thrills and chills will need to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"I read this book a long time ago, I loved it, I bought it for my husband, it's a classic.

Though &quot;Harvest Home&quot; was very well written, I found it not scary at all. Quasi-eerie? Yes. Brooding? Yes. Keep-me-up-at-night-holding-my-teddy-bear-scary? No.The beginning of the book was a nice trap to lure the reader into a false sense of security (as well as the characters, I might add). The plot was masterfully woven and made the reader wonder, &quot;where is this going?&quot; I was thoroughly impressed.&quot;If thoroughly impressed, why only four-stars?&quot; you may ask. Well, I'll tell you why. First of all, being a Celtic Pagan, I could see the research Mr. Tryon did to come up with the rituals and the harvest ceremonies. The problem I had was that Mr. Tryon led us to believe that Ned (the main character) did not deserve his punishment (for those of you do not want the ending spoiled, I warn you now--read no further!) of his tongue getting dislodged from his mouth and eyes gauged out. Call me apathetic, or slightly cruel, but it was his own fault. The women warned him, but noooooo. I would love to live in Cornwall Coombe...I would keep to myself (Ahem! Hint, hint Ned) and not meddle in people's business. It was a religion...heaven forbid that they worship God as well as an Earth Goddess (gasp!) and Harvest God (gasp again!). I guess I'm just odd and eccentric that way. Must be the Pagan in me.Other than that minuet thing, I found the book VERY enjoyable and worth the read. Read this book; for horror (if you like that kind of horror) or just for the experience of a well-written novel."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"I bought a book by Thomas Tryon called \\"The Other Harvest Home.\\" He is the author of both titles so you would assume that it was a compilation that contained both titles. It is actually a copy of \\"Harvest Home\\" by the author of \\"The Other.\\"There were cheaper versions of just \\"Harvest Home.\\" The title of the book was VERY misleading. I would not order from this seller again without verifying what he/she is selling."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"Born in 1926, Thomas Tryon first came to public attention as an actor in such films as I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE and the popular television series TEXAS JOHN SLAUGHTER--but Tryon's acting career began to falter in the early 1960s. Fortunately, he turned to writing and discovered his true calling: the 1971 novel THE OTHER was a critical and popular sensation, easily one of the best psychological horror novels of the decade. He followed it in 1973 with equally lauded and popular HARVEST HOME.Read today, it easy to foresee several of the major plots of HARVEST HOME--but this is largely because so many later novelists (including Stephen King) borrowed so liberally from the novel. Still, there's nothing like the original, and in 1973 the book was all of that, the tale of a New York couple with a difficult teenager daughter who decide to trade the crime-ridden cityscape for countryside peace... and stumble into a rural nightmare that makes a metropolitan crime wave seem tame by comparison.Cornwall Coombe is a tiny, isolated village, the sort of place where everyone is related to everyone else by blood or marriage or sometimes both. It is also a community that clings to \\"the old ways,\\" rejecting most modern agricultural ideas--not to mention newcomers to the area. As it happens, however, Ned and Beth Constantine and their daughter are smiled upon by the Widow Fortune, a woman who holds tremendous sway in the community, and as time passes they are accepted.But into what? For it soon transpires that the \\"old ways\\" include a number of odd superstitions, all of them centering on the cycle of seasons and the area's corn crop. At first Ned is amused, then curious--but the more he learns the more disturbing the superstitions and traditions become. And unsavory stories abound: the strange grave of Gracie Everdean, the mystery of Missy Penrose's parentage, the ghost of \\"Soake's Lonesome\\"--and always, always the corn crop itself.The novel can be criticized for the occasional plot or character inconsistency, and as previously noted the basic premise has been so often repeated that much of the plot can be foreseen. Even so, it is a tremendously readable novel, atmospheric and truly disturbing, and while it does not best Tryon's THE OTHER (which remains his masterpiece), HARVEST HOME is uniquely memorable in its own right.Sadly, Tryon would die in 1991, having written only a handful of novels; amazingly, most of his works--including THE OTHER and HARVEST HOME--are out of print. But like THE OTHER, HARVEST HOME is well worth seeking out. Recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"This is an exceptionally well written chiller. It takes place in Cornwall Coombe, a seemingly bucolic little hamlet in New England. It is to this idyllic locale that Ned Constantine, his wife, Beth, and their teenage daughter, Kate, move.Ned had quit his job as an advertising executive in New York City and was now a professional artist, having established a studio in which to paint on his newly purchased property. In love with the three hundred year old house that they had unexpectedly been able to purchase, he and his family settled down to what he hoped would be a tranquil existence.Alas, this was not to be. The town's very being revolved around ancient rituals dictated by the corn crop, and the town's ways were old ways. Its bucolic setting was deceptive, as there existed a malignancy that was becoming all too apparent to Ned. It was a feeling, however, that neither his wife nor daughter shared.Cornwall Coombe was a town seemingly controlled by the Widow Fortune, an old woman with a knack for healing. The town had a secret, and its insular townspeople were all in on it. Ned was determined to discover what that secret was, even if it were to his detriment. He ultimately finds that some secrets are best left undiscovered.This is a beautifully written book, almost lyrical in the telling. The author has a distinct gift for storytelling, and the tale that he weaves is spellbinding, as well as chilling. It is a tale that is sure to keep the reader riveted."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"Thomas Tryon, an actor turned author, crafted one of the finest real horror novels of the latter half of the 20th century with The Other.

Lovecraft and Stevenson, Tryon treads new ground for the modern novel. Harvest Home (1973) demonstrated to many modern authors (Stephen King and Peter Straub both acknowledge borrowing heavily from Tryon) how horror novels don't have to contain creatures or aliens to be scary.Harvest Home is the story of a young couple who move to a remote hamlet in New England, known as Harvest Home. The village has chosen to remain isolated over the years. While not Quaker or Amish, the feeling is similar. The residents are all either related to or married to other residents of the village. The residents are not too welcoming of outsiders.When the Widow Fortune takes a liking to the family, the town eases its defenses and also embraces them. The problem is that there is something sinister running amok in the village. There is something creepy going on during the corn harvest....When you read this novel, you have to be able to imagine yourself in a time before Stephen King's novels (because he crafted several novels and stories based on material he gleaned from this book)...a time before modern horror cinema had bastardized all the really unique ideas that Tryon laid out in this book.The novel was another best seller for Tryon. It also spawned a film, albeit a made-for-TV film. It was a huge hit for the network, because almost everyone at the time had read the novel AND it starred the inimitable Bette Davis as the Widow Fortune.Get this novel through hook or crook and allow your mind to go back in time....and prepare to be scared.Not as good as \\"The Other,\\" but certainly a worthy follow-up to it."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"My mom read this book right after she finished high school and still had it in the bookshelf by the time I was in high school. I read it one day when I had nothing else to read and finished it the same night. Yikes! Really creepy for a 15 year old with an active imagination to read. Fifteen years later I still think about it though I have yet to re-read it. Excellent book."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"harvest home can still give me chills nearly 30 years after first reading it. living in connecticut, not far south of saxony, cornwall and kent (yes-- they're all real connecticut towns) i drag out my dog-eared copy every halloweentime and silently carp at ned constantine to stay out of the woods. does anyone else out there think, as i do, that sophie hooke did not hang herself but was also murdered quietly by the widow, so that beth could step in to the corn maiden role and have the opportunity to get pregnant according to the widow's &quot;plan&quot; (sophie claimed to be diseased in the conversation she'd had with justin. the widow would know that bit of medical info and wouldn't want to take a chance on a blighted corn maiden or pregancy.) just a thought. on the other hand, maybe i've just read the book too often!"},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"\\"Harvest Home\\" is a novel that has haunted me since I first had the pleasure of reading it two decades ago. Thomas Tryon is a wonderfully descriptive writer whose elegant turn of phrase makes this novel a memorable horror story told in a very light way.This is a horror story. What can be more horrible than what Ned Constantine, the narrator/protagonist of the story had to witness during the climax of the novel? There is a great element of greek tragedy present in this novel as each main character has a tragic flaw that determines his or her fate. With Ned, it is his insatiable curiosity, with his wife Beth, the fear of men due to her domineering father and the daughter Kate, her frailty as a result of living with constant stress, the result of the hustle of NYC life and the tensions between her parents.The Constantines move to Cornwall Coombe, a hamlet in Connecticut nominally under the rule of the benign yet forbidding Widow Fortune. The Constantines are initially amazed at the archaic lifestyle of the villagers but the women soon involve themselves and grow to love the rustic ways of the village. Ned, to his misfortune, rejects the charms of the villagers and their ways and moves to undermine the widow through his encouraging of the dissatisfied young Harvest Lord, Worthy Pettinger, escape to a better life and his obsessive quest to solve the msyery of what happened to the disgraced Gracie Everdeen, a young village woman who allegedly caused years of famine for the village by cursing the corn.There are tales of adultery, legend and subtle violence throughout the novel which works so well because the reader cannot fully empathize with any character. Tryon has fleshed out his characters so well, and his description of the village life and countryside is so lyrical that a reader cannot help but fall in love with this book and be haunted by the ingenious plot for years to come.A great novel by a great writer. A novel that transcends the horror field to rank with those of Faulkner and Dickey."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"This is an exceptionally well written chiller. It takes place in Cornwall Coombe, a seemingly bucolic little hamlet in New England. It is to this idyllic locale that Ned Constantine, his wife, Beth, and their teenage daughter, Kate, move.Ned had quit his job as an advertising executive in New York City and was now a professional artist, having established a studio in which to paint on his newly purchased property. In love with the three hundred year old house that they had unexpectedly been able to purchase, he and his family settled down to what he hoped would be a tranquil existence.Alas, this was not to be. The town's very being revolved around ancient rituals dictated by the corn crop, and the town's ways were old ways. Its bucolic setting was deceptive, as there existed a malignancy that was becoming all too apparent to Ned. It was a feeling, however, that neither his wife nor daughter shared.Cornwall Coombe was a town seemingly controlled by the Widow Fortune, an old woman with a knack for healing. The town had a secret, and its insular townspeople were all in on it. Ned was determined to discover what that secret was, even if it were to his detriment. He ultimately finds that some secrets are best left undiscovered.This is a beautifully written book, almost lyrical in the telling. The author has a distinct gift for storytelling, and the tale that he weaves is spellbinding, as well as chilling. It is a tale that is sure to keep the reader riveted."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"This creepy novel is a favorite of mine, and the ending is one that stays with you long after you've put the book down. From the opening pages of Harvest Home, as we meet one interesting character after another, the reader cannot help but feel an anxious dread that all is not well in Cornwall Combe, even as the narrator -- Ned Constantine -- and his family eagerly try to adapt themselves to the 'old ways' of the isolated New England village. But like a character in a Greek tragedy, Ned is driven to uncover the mysteries of the place no matter where they lead; and what seems at first an innocuous question (\\"What happened to poor Gracie Everdean?\\"), leads inexorably from one disturbing disclosure to the next. So much of what we heard and saw in the earlier parts of the tale come back to haunt us in the closing pages -- that delicious \\"so THAT'S what that meant\\" moment of insight a good writer gives the reader at story's end. Harvest Home is best read in late fall ... when the skies are overcast, the air musty with decay and the corn is just coming in from the fields ..."},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"...I ordered this through an auction on Amazon. I am so glad that I did. I remember the TV movie, from 1978, because my mother loves horror stories. I also read the book, for an English class, when I was a senior in high school. I am half way through it, and just as intrigued, if not more than when I read it the first time. I had forgotten a lot--well, I graduated from high back in the '80's. I can barely put the book down. Thomas Tryon is a master at writing---the descriptions that he uses are uncanny. He is an excellent writer with great ideas. The character of Widow Fortune is unforgettable. If you have a chance to read this book, and you love horror and suspense. Go for it!"},{"Title":"Harvest Home","review":"I received a copy of this book as a gift from a friend who was sure I would love this book. I had never heard of the author, but decided after a few weeks to give it a go.Tryon's writing is wonderfully fluent and absorbs the reader, while maintaining a sense that you are watching through a window. I have to say I was disapointed to read some of the previous reviews on this book, I found it to be excellent in all areas.Yes, some things are led up to to a certain degree, but even when you think you know what the suspense is all about, you're still shaken with the shock of what did happen.Gender roles are also curiously enforced; our society says that men are still largely in change of us no matter how things may appear, yet this text shows that the women hold the key to everything, and the men are only barely needed pawns.I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of horror, but also has enough of a desire to read a book that is more then just pulp."},{"Title":"Seasons of Love: Sweaters for the Family","review":"I have many crochet pattern books and &quot;Seasons of Love&quot; is amongst my favorites.

Fortunately it turns out that Venus not only has a breathable atmosphere but is inhabited. In \\"Pirates of Venus,\\" Carson Napier learns about the politics and culture of the planet called Amtor and fell in love with Duare, the daughter of a jong (i.e., she is a princess). Of course, in grand ERB tradition, by the end of that first novel Carson and his beloved were separated by a cruel fate (she is carried away by a flying creature and he is captured by a Thorist spy, and the time has come for him to do something about that.Originally published as a serial in \\"Argosy Weekly\\" in 1933, this pulp fiction adventure is communicated to ERB by Napier himself, using telepathy (I liked the Gridley from the Barsoom books better). Carson is held captive and is put in a room where there are seven doors: one leads to escape, the rest to horrible deaths. This is a fairly interesting start to the story and ERB has some fun coming up with a way for his hero to get out of this predicament. Carson, who is given the name Albargan (\\"No-Hair-Man\\") by the natives, catches up with Duare, who keeps insisting that he is too low to speak to her since she is a janjong and he is a nobody. There are some interesting science fiction notions, as when Carson considers the Amtorian theory of the cosmos, which is totally wrong since the planet's constant cloud cover keeps them from seeing anything else in the solar system.Even though you find all of the standard Burroughs elements from the romantic adventure formula that made him famous as Carson pursues Duare, \\"Lost on Venus\\" really is more of a political polemic than his standard stories. This book continues the political satire of the series with the Thorists clearly intended to represent the Communists and it is hard not to see the scientifically advanced city of Havatoo as representing an Aryan wonderland in the Nazi tradition (later on in the series ERB clearly takes aim at Mussolini's brand of fascism as well). \\"Pirates of Venus\\" is not really considered a dystopian novel, but in terms of predicting the political evils that would lead to World War II, Burroughs was fairly accurate. This was the last of the major series that ERB created and during the 1930s it really represented his best work, which would seem to indicate that his political passions in the Venus books worked to his advantage."},{"Title":"Lost on Venus","review":"The second novel in Edgar Rice Burroughs' Venus series. Space-faring earthman Carson Napier was separated from his beloved princess Duare at the conclusion of the previous novel. Now, he is after her once again, determined to get her home safely to her kingdom of Vepaja, and the result is the literary equivalent of one of the old Saturday morning serials with just a pinch of social commentary. From the Room of the Seven Doors, down the River of Death to the City of the Dead, where a mad scientist presides over a kingdom of zombies, and the beautiful city of Havatoo, which is a paradise but only if your lineage is pure, Carson and Duare bounce from predicament to predicament. Will they survive their adventures? Will Duare drop her haughty facade and accept Carson's love? Is there any doubt? Not really, but getting there is the fun. This series benefits by being more humorous than most of Burroughs' work."},{"Title":"Lost on Venus","review":"This is the second book in Edgar Rice Burroughs' \\"Carson of Venus\\" series.

Only one door holds freedom.Carson, of course, escapes with his life, but discovers that Duare, the princess of the Vepajans who first cared for him when he arrived on Venus, is also being held captive. Carson loves her in spite of her insistence that he not tell her so, and he helps her out of danger. They travel far into the south where it is rumored that no man can survive, and they stumble upon Skor, an awful dictator who reanimates dead bodies to do his bidding.

The BA charts are woefully lacking in detail -- especially depths -- and discussions of shore sites are in many cases unduly negative. We visited a number of places about which Mr. Wilson used disparaging terms and found them delightful. Coverage of the Exumas assumes one is approaching from the banks side and gives little attention to approaches from Exuma Sound. In some places the author gets on a soapbox for environmental concerns and in other places he tacitly approves practices (such as feeding fish at snorkel sites) that are not ecologically sound. Fails to acknowledge existence of the Explorer series of charts that are by far the best for practical use in the area.

I got the book directly from Flying Tiger ace, R.T. Smith. Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. The beginning is a narrative that sets up what the AVG (American Volunteer Group) was all about and how they got to China in the first place during the summer and fall months of 1941. R.T. then offers the actual printed copies taken from his daily diary which he kept throughout his time with the Tigers. His entries are relatively short and really give you the sense that that's what you would write if you were there. Great photos dot the book and he does include short notes at the bottom of the pages to clear things up. It's a very easy but informative read.Overall, a great book and highly recommended if you want to learn more about the real Flying Tigers from one of their aces. I strongly recommend buying all of the books written by members of the AVG in order to understand these true American heroes who offered their lives for China and the U.S. during the dark days when WWII was just beginning."},{"Title":"Tale of a tiger","review":"This is an annotated diary.

This novel is about the relationship between Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King Henry VIII, and Prince Phillip of Spain who is the soon to be husband of King Henry's oldest daughter Mary, who is the current Queen of England. The series was first published in 1946-1953. This newly released novel from Sourcebooks tells the story of the love /hate relationship between Princess Elizabeth and Mary. This historical novel gives us an insight into the Tudor court with the Catholic Mary and Phillip and Protestant Elizabeth. Mary hopes with the help of Phillip that she can bring back Catholicism to England. Phillip in the meantime becomes attracted to Elizabeth. I think this is actually the first account I read which explains the animosity that is to come between Phillip and Elizabeth during Elizabeth's reign. This series is very well researched and even though it was written in the early 50's, it still has a modern feel to it. Any historical buff will enjoy this series."},{"Title":"Elizabeth and the Prince of Spain","review":"Let the reader beware: you won't find any bodice-ripping here. This book, the last in Margaret Irwin's trilogy telling the story of the young Elizabeth I up to her accession to the throne, was published in 1953. For those accustomed to the faster pace and more scandalous nature of today's historical fiction, this book will seem old-fashioned. But if you come to it with an open mind and allow the story to unravel, I believe any reader could come to enjoy it as much as I did.The \\"Prince of Spain\\" in the title of the book is Philip, King Consort to Elizabeth's sister, Mary I. His character, so often misunderstood, comes to life here. Emotionally recalcitrant, dutiful, zealous, and mediocre in intellect, he finds himself drawn like a flame to the brilliant and troublesome Elizabeth. His lust from the first is mixed with hate (he imagines having her burnt or drowned in their first meeting, in a wonderfully eerie passage), which foreshadows the later bitter rivalry the two will engage in, culminating in the defeat of the Spanish Armada. The lack of sex scenes only increases the tension in their dynamic.Although the Elizabeth/Philip relationship is the focal point, other wonderful characterizations abound. Standouts include Emperor Charles V, a Robert Dudley besotted with Elizabeth, and the Papal legate Mary summons to restore the Catholic faith in England, Reginald Pole. The last is particularly well-drawn. Pole is the last of the Plantagenets, a great-nephew to Edward IV and Richard III. Henry VIII had his mother butchered by an axeman. Although very intelligent and gifted, Pole spends his life floundering in his incredible privilege, lacking the vigor and character required to effectively use his talents.This is not a book that is easy to read. It is detailed, rich in subtleties and requires re-readings to fully appreciate it. I wasn't sure about it on my first read, but now it has become one of my favorite books on the Tudor period. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Elizabeth and the Prince of Spain","review":"A religious zealot and totally dedicated to his nation Spain, Philip, King Consort knows he is to marry Princess Mary I. However, she mirrors him in terms of intelligence and beliefs. Instead he is attracted to his betrothed's dynamic sister, the Protestant Elizabeth. He loathes his desire for his future sister-in-law, as she brings out carnal feelings he knows are unholy. Neither is aware of what awaits them and their nations in three decades.At the same time they do their careful two steps, Robert Dudley is in love with Elizabeth. Obsessed with restoring God's laws, Mary orders the Papal legate Reginald Pole, the great-nephew of Edward IV and Richard III to lead the reversal of the heresy her father Henry VIII caused. However, the brilliant Pole who knows overturning the Anglican heretical legacy would be a tribute to his late mom killed by the former monarch. However, he lacks the energy and ambition to take charge of the royal demand.This is a reprint of the third young Elizabeth trilogy (see Young Bess: The Girl Who Would Be Queen and Elizabeth, Captive Princess: Two Sisters, One Throne) written in 1953. The story line has a historiographical feel to it as readers will see a different style and tone than in present day written Tudor novels. Still, fans of the era will appreciate the well written insightful look at three rivals competing for power at a time of intense turmoil.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Elizabeth and the Prince of Spain","review":"This is the third novel in a frightening and moving trilogy about the young Elizabeth Tudor.

There are many other wonderfully drawn personalities in these novels, including the dying Henry VIII, Thomas Seymour and his brother the Protector, Catherine Parr, Elizabeth's two siblings, Lady Jane Grey, and, in this third book, the young Philip of Spain. Ms. Irwin is careful to provide enough background to make it all clear, and while the didacticism occasionally shows, it never gets tedious. Highly recommended, and a perfect introduction to further reading about this pivotal era of history."},{"Title":"Elizabeth and the Prince of Spain","review":"I found this a bit slower to read but still engaging and interesting.This is the concluding book of the trilogy which included \\"Young Bess\\" (which I did not read) and \\"Elizabeth, Captive Princess: Two Sisters, One Throne\\" which I did read and review.As I noted in my review of \\"Elizabeth, Captive Princess,\\" the writing style is unusual as if flows yet twists in a puzzling fashion that seems to fit Princess Elizabeth. The thought process presented is almost frenetic as Elizabeth tries to maintain such a fine line between her fierce independence and her need to show submissiveness to Queen Mary and Prince Philip. There is already political tension between Queen Mary and the imprisoned Elizabeth due to their respective claims to the throne and due to their religious differences. Queen Mary has brought England back to the Catholic faith as the only true religion which is supported by Rome and Prince Philip. On the other hand, Elizabeth was raised with their father's less formal ritual in the Protestant church. The tension is increased by the jealousy evoked by Prince Philip's interest and leniency towards Elizabeth. Prince Philip, aged 27, marries Queen Mary, aged 38, as a political move to increase the power of Spain. Philip convinces Mary to show mercy and release Elizabeth from The Tower and allow her to live freely, if guardedly.Elizabeth is portrayed as a bright young woman who draws men, young and old, to her ethereal manner and charms the common masses with her natural exuberance. She continually chants in word games and speaks in riddles to keep her meaning ambiguous or at least uncommitted. The author catches this character so well that, for me, it made the reading slower as I had to pay close attention to catch the nuances and think about the implications of what Elizabeth is saying outwardly compared to what she is thinking or feeling that she is not expressing.It appears that the author did detailed research into the important events and times of the story and into the known letters written by the participants. These then are fleshed out in fiction that gives the characters depth - and life. A large part of the story focuses on portraying the development and character of Philip before shifting back to Elizabeth. It can not be known how they truly interacted and felt, but the author pulls you into their lives in a vivid way. The book made me want to look up what factually happened to these historical characters and try to determine how close to reality the story is.The story makes me glad that I do not live a life that must play such political games of manipulation. It was somewhat surprising that Elizabeth was allowed to live by Queen Mary. This was due in great part to Prince Philip who was inclined to subtly be with Elizabeth with the hope they might be together if Mary died. Ultimately Elizabeth does succeed to the throne upon Mary's death but she continues to keep Philip at bay. As the bookmakers in Europe took bets that Elizabeth's reign would not make it past six months one gets a glimpse from the author of the matters of state, marriage proposals and considerations that Elizabeth had to juggle. This is a remarkable historical portrayal of very interesting historical figures."},{"Title":"Elizabeth and the Prince of Spain","review":"Elizabeth And The Prince Of Spain opens with the marriage of Prince Philip of Spain to Elizabeth's sister, Mary. Mary is the daughter of Henry VIII's first wife, Katherine of Aragon, and she has no sisterly love for the offspring of his next wife, Anne Boleyn. The marriage is one of political convenience for Spain; Mary is more than a decade older than Philip. While he is polite, he has no real interest in Mary. Mary, on the other hand, after a lifetime of no love interest, falls devotedly and jealously in love with Philip.This love is both the greatest danger and the safety net for Elizabeth. Left to her own devices, Mary would put Elizabeth back in the Tower and take her life. Instead, to please Philip, she restrains herself, and even brings Elizabeth to court. This is a double-edged sword. While she pleases Philip, she now watches his every move intently, afraid that he will fall under Elizabeth's spell.Elizabeth also faces the double-edged sword. She must please Philip enough to retain him as her protector and keep him interested in her, but at the same time, she must keep him at arm's length. An affair with Philip would end her life as it would be the one crime Mary would never forgive.Margaret Irwin has written a trilogy about Elizabeth and this one is the third in the series. It easily stands alone, however, as there is little suspense in the story of the Tudors for most readers. Irwin's forte is characterization; her characters act in ways that are believable to the reader while retaining enough mystery to intrigue them. This book is recommended for readers of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Elizabeth and the Prince of Spain","review":"This was such an unusual point of view for an Elizabethan novel. It is the third in Ms. Irwin's series on the young Elizabeth. Her books told her life before she became queen. I read the first one (Young Bess, reviewed HERE) and liked it but didn't love it. I did not have the opportunity to read the second. This one I found fascinating. I must admit to not knowing all that much about Philip of Spain and this book opened my eyes a bit to a man who was an important figure in Tudor times. Ms. Irwin's book postulates that Elizabeth may not have survived Mary's reign without Philip's intervention and that is very interesting to contemplate.The book is not long and was very very easy to read. In this tale you see the beginnings of Elizabeth's years long dance of courtship while keeping all her suitors at bay. The book ends with her coronation.I think it was the focus on the early relationship with Philip that made the book so interesting for me. With all the reading on Elizabeth I have done this was new territory. It is always enjoyable to explore new material."},{"Title":"Elizabeth and the Prince of Spain","review":"ELIZABETH AND THE PRINCE OF SPAIN by Margaret Irwin is a historical fiction set in 1541 England.It is the final book in the Elizabeth I trilogy.See Young Bess and Elizabeth,Captive Princess.This is an intriguing story of Elizabeth,King Henry VIII's,daughter,the beheading of Anne Boleyn,and Phillip, the Prince of Spain.It has treachery,betrayal,sibling rivalry,tragedy,truimphs,the battle between King Henry VIII's daughters,danger to one sister through another sister's rule and jealousy.This is a compelling and captivating story of Tudor England.

This is a must read for fall Tudor England,and anyone who enjoys the King Henry VIII rule.This book was received for the purpose of review from the publisher.Details can be found Sourcebooks,Landmark,a division of Sourcebooks,Inc."},{"Title":"Elizabeth and the Prince of Spain","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Originally published in 1953 this was the last book in Margaret Irwin's \\"Young Bess\\" series. Because it was written in an earlier era the book is not a racy bodice ripper - something that I appreciate. It's not that I'm a prude - but I do get a tad tired of the \\"sex sells\\" philosophy- especially in relation to good historical fiction writing.This book revolves around Philip of Spain's relationship with Elizabeth. The staunch Catholic, philanderer (depending on your point of view I guess) and husband of Elizabeth's half sister Queen Mary, lusted for Elizabeth. This aspect of Elizabeth's life provides a fresh point of view which I quite liked. I think Ms. Irwin did an excellent job of portraying the historical context and the book is rife with court life details. It's a book that I enjoyed reading and thinking about all of the \\"what ifs\\" made for some interesting \\"grist for the mill\\".I don't believe that I have read the first two books in this series - but would like to. It's a good stand alone book but reading it in series might be worthwhile. Sourcebooks does such a great job of bringing back some of \\"the best of the best\\". This is another highly recommended read for all historical history fans - especially those of us who love Elizabeth I ."},{"Title":"Langenscheidt's New College Merriam-Webster: English Thesaurus","review":"I thought that this thesaurus was the most complete and organized thesaurus that I have ever owned.

That aside, this is a very good book.Disney took on the collective work of Dan O'Neill and the Air Pirates after they issued parodies of Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters. Or, as intellectual property (IP) lawyers say, &quot;properties.&quot; Levin's work emphasizes the case, how it came about, how it moved through the courts, and what the disposition was. As a result, the reader gets a good idea of how IP cases work, and what was at stake. He discusses the notion of parody, infringement, and so on, pointing the oddities and contradictions in the statutory and case law. (But, hey, a case citation once in a while, counselor?) The publishers reproduce some of the offending material, letting the reader see what Disney saw. Levin also does not glorify O'Neill or the other Air Pirates, though he clearly supports their side, and says that getting the real story from O'Neill and his crew was not always easy. Finally, if this book causes a few more folks to seek out O'Neill's &quot;Odds Bodkins&quot;, it will have done a great service. Like UG comics? Don't miss this. IP lawyer? A must read."},{"Title":"The Pirates and the Mouse: Disney's War Against the Counterculture","review":"The topic of this book certainly sounded interesting, especially since I was taking a Media Laws course at the time I read it. However, this book was bogged down with too many problems for me to recommend it.First of all, the book is full of small errors that make it seem like it was hastily thrown together and shoved onto the shelves. The author is listed as \\"Bob Levin\\" on the front cover, but as \\"Bob Levine\\" on the spine. A citation on the back page quotes an editor as calling the book \\"The definitive history of this wonderful, mad (and, I believe, signficant) episode in Amercan [sic] popular culture.\\" And one of the illustrations and comics in the book are listed as being from 1971, even though Levin later says (correctly) that they were from the mid 90s.Aside from these annoying but ultimately forgivable problems, the author just doesn't have a very fluid or gripping writing style. Some of his sentences so grossly overuse punctuation marks that they may discuss three different topics in a single sentence. I will admit that he does a passable job describing copyright laws, but that was just one part of this book. His footnotes also tend to be places for him to get in his two cents rather than truly informative additions. And he ultimately fails to make the characters endearing to the audience, which is frustrating since he admits in the book that each author is trying to sell a story or viewpoint to the reader. It may be more objective to paint the Air Pirates as nothing more than a bunch of stoned twenty-somethings following an even more-stoned thirty-something, but it sure didn't sell to me that we should be rooting for them.The ending of the book also let me down. I won't go into details, but suffice it to say that after discussing a series of lawsuits brought against the Air Pirates, the story ends very abruptly, without describing the final decision in any great detail. This should have been the climax of the narrative, and it just fizzles out.So while I appreciate Bob Levin pointing out this interesting case that has apparently gotten very little recognition, I wish that he would have discovered it, and then turned it over to a better author."},{"Title":"The Pirates and the Mouse: Disney's War Against the Counterculture","review":"Ably researched and written by Bob Levin (an experienced essayist for &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;), The Pirates And The Mouse: Disney's War Against The Counterculture is the intrinsically fascinating and little-known story of a group of rogue cartoonists led by Dan O'Neill (the youngest syndicated cartoonist in American newspaper history), who waged a countercultural war of pictures against the Disney Corporation by portraying Disney characters engaging in un-Disney like behavior. In response, Disney executives brought forth a massive lawsuit against these unapproved cartoonists for copyright infringement. The Pirates And The Mouse traces a complex and tangled personal, legal, and cultural saga ranging from O'Neill's bitterness against the censorship that cost him a job, to contemporary corporate politics, issues of intellectual property rights and social commentary, and more. The Pirates And The Mouse is a &quot;must-read&quot; for anyone concerned with such issues as artistic freedom, copyright law, as well as readers seeking to learn more about the oft-unspoken and somewhat darker side of the corporate Disney."},{"Title":"The Pirates and the Mouse: Disney's War Against the Counterculture","review":"An hilarious blow-by-blow account of Disney's war on independent culture. A look back at the late 60s and early 70s that's all too disturbingly relevant today."},{"Title":"The Pirates and the Mouse: Disney's War Against the Counterculture","review":"According to Bob Levin, copyright law has become a way by which big corporations screw the public trust. Back in 1971, a group of artists calling themselves the Air Pirates put out an unauthorized Mickey Mouse comic book that was heavily pornographic in nature. The ensuing battle lasted for about a decade until Disney finally won.This book rates 3 stars out of 5 due to the fact that it is mostly bogged down in all sorts of highly legalistic language and is hard to read by someone who, like this writer, does not have a law school education."},{"Title":"The Pirates and the Mouse: Disney's War Against the Counterculture","review":"The history outlined in THE PIRATES AND THE MOUSE is essential reading. Unfortunately, Mr. Levin has foreclosed the chances that a *great* history, as opposed to a good one, of the Air Pirates controversy will ever be written.As a researcher, Mr. Levin is fearless and gratifyingly thorough. As a prose stylist, however, he cakes on the pretension as if imitating--poorly--the academic and cultural-studies historical texts with which both his subject and his approach prompt comparison. He injects himself needlessly (as a participant in the counterculture, as a \\"wit,\\" as an eloquent commentator, &c.;) into the history wherever he can, and rarely uses one adjective or adverb when he can stack three or four atop each other like cords of wood.I'm perplexed that Groth and Thompson--two critical writers I've admired since I was a teenager, both of whom are enviably well-read in multiple genres--could let THE PIRATES AND THE MOUSE slip through their editorial fingers in this state. It's a beautifully designed book loaded with information and images that can scarcely be found anywhere else, but I can't read even three pages of it at a time without craving another kind of prose: matter-of-fact, eloquent, and focused. This ain't hairsplitting. The greatest archive in the world will reach no one if the text that mediates between archive and public keeps jerking the spotlight back upon itself."},{"Title":"The Pirates and the Mouse: Disney's War Against the Counterculture","review":"bob levin's writing style aside, this book is an extremely informative expose of the first amendment with regards to copyright infringement and parody. the champion here (or protagonist if you will) is the enlightened dan o' neill. even though the \\"air pirates\\" was a collective effort by london, richards, halgren, and flenniken, o'neill was the one who braved this whole mess out with humor, wit, and defiant intellect. the famous phrase \\"the pen is mightier than the sword\\" underestimates the relentlessness and ruthlessness of the disney empire against an intellectual threat that put the \\"disney intellect\\" to shame; i am again refering to o' neill.a fine prep in copyright law, the beginings of the underground comics, disney's wrath, and an american champion of free speech: \\"they should have known he was irish\\" dan o' neill. you will have more than a few chuckles during your reading....thank you bob levin, dan o' neill, and the rest of the \\"pirates\\". you are not forgotten!!!"},{"Title":"Five-Point Play: The Story of Duke's Amazing 2000-2001 Championship Season","review":"Duke is on TV almost as much as Sponge Bob. I've probably missed five games in twenty-five years (including my time at Duke). After reading this book, I've missed all of them. The behind-the-scenes, locker-room perspective on how Coach K motivates players is powerful and moving. His preparation for each game centers less on the opponent and more on singling out one player on his own team to lift that player's game. His simple, direct message gets through.&quot;Next Play,&quot; &quot;Confidence Breeds Courage,&quot; &quot;Collective Responsibility&quot; and other catch-phrases of K's apply not only to basketball but to business and to life.How many coaches after winning the National Championship would bring their team back into the locker room two days later to remind them that the Lessons of the Fist (for what those are you have to read the book) apply not only to basketball but to life? How many, in the same meeting, would goad their players to excel not only on the basketball court but in the classroom and in life?This is a book to treasure."},{"Title":"Five-Point Play: The Story of Duke's Amazing 2000-2001 Championship Season","review":"Five-Point Play is the perfect companion to the 2000-2001 Basketball Season. I received the book from Amazon two days ago, and managed to read it in just a couple of hours. The book is a blow-by-blow account of how the Blue Devils grew and matured during its championship run. Five-Point Play is written in the same style as the ESPNMAG article that was written from Coach K's perspective.Although I don't think one has to read &quot;Leading with the Heart&quot; to enjoy this book, I do think that one's enjoyment is definitely elevated by doing so. A lot of what Coach K emphasizes in Five-Point Play has distinct echoes from his previous book. Such important lessons as communication, trust, collective responsibility, caring, etc. are big themes that he re-emphasizes to the team. However, the primary difference is that in this book, Coach K follows the season in chronological order, with descriptions of practices and in-game situations. There are also several quotes from the players, coaches and staff that are inserted during these situations that further illuminate the different perspectives on the team. Perhaps one of the most interesting parts of the book describe, in great detail, the team's psyche when Carlos suffered his foot injury and the team's subsequent shift in offensive and defensive strategies. In reality, there was a signifcant amount of doubt that the team would be able to be competitive by practically everyone on the team-- including Coach K! Fortunately, the Duke Blue Devils overcame this obstacle (among many others) and surged towards the National Championship."},{"Title":"Five-Point Play: The Story of Duke's Amazing 2000-2001 Championship Season","review":"In Five Point Play, Coach Mike Krzyzewski tries to teach the 2001 Duke basketball team about not only basketball, but life too. By setting examples for the team, Coach shows his players the results of communication, trust, care, responsibility, and pride, the same points that helped them win the national championship. \\"Coach K\\" has a crew of talented coaches and players that include Shane Battier, Jason Williams, Carlos Boozer and many more. I like the way that Coach Krzyzewski put this book together, by explaining every pep talk, describing every huddle, and giving the details of every game. Although I wouldn't recommend this book to a North Carolina fan, I hope that every other basketball fan gets a chance to read Five Point Play."},{"Title":"Five-Point Play: The Story of Duke's Amazing 2000-2001 Championship Season","review":"I thought this book was great. It was truly inspirational. It changed my life. From now on, I am going to cut my own meat!

What is of most interest though, is the way that Coach K is able to truly understand and coach each of his different players in an effort to continually help them play to their potential. The reader will clearly see that Coach K's success is based on his ability to develop trusting relationships with each of his players and staff.If you want a view inside the locker room of one of sport's most respected and successful programs, then definitely &quot;Five-point Play&quot; is the book for you."},{"Title":"Five-Point Play: The Story of Duke's Amazing 2000-2001 Championship Season","review":"I am a Duke grad, so my love of Duke hoops and Coach K are unmitigated. However, his books, as much as I'd like to feel otherwise, are not good. If they didn't deal directly with glorious Duke basketball, I don't think I could have finished them.This book offers the occasional fresh story or insight; mostly it is predictable and repetitive--just the qualities which K and his clubs avoid consistently.The brillliance of Coach K and his Duke teams are far better enjoyed while watching them play. His talent for motivation, and his exemplary example are better displayed on the court as well."},{"Title":"Five-Point Play: The Story of Duke's Amazing 2000-2001 Championship Season","review":"Five Point Play is a must-have for any die-hard Duke basketball fan. The book depicts the 2000-2001 season in its entirety from not only Coach Krzyzewski&#65533;s point of view, but also from the point of view of many of the players who made the national championship possible for the university. All the important highlights of the season are included, from Coach&#65533;s 500th victory at Cameron Indoor Stadium, to the &#65533;Miracle Minute&#65533; that led to a surprise victory against Maryland.The book does not just talk about the highlights of the games, however. It accurately portrays Coach&#65533;s &#65533;recipe&#65533; for success that helped land the team in the Final Four and, eventually, to the 2001 National Championship. Coach K (his nickname) makes sure that he imposes a low-pressure environment on his players. He attempts to remove any jealousy between the all-star members of the team and forces his players to openly admit their respect for their comrades and allow everyone to make a play, not just the starters or the Senior members (including Shane Battier). He also makes it known that he will not yell at any player who misses a shot (and he keeps that promise) but he will chastise a player who does not attempt a play when there is an opportunity. One of coaches other important &#65533;ingredients&#65533; is his idea of &#65533;Next Play&#65533;. In other words, he encourages the team to avoid becoming over-confident after a victory or to obsess about mistakes or misfortunes, and tells them instead to focus on what is coming up. Most importantly, Coach emphasizes his five-point idea of &#65533;The Fist&#65533;: Collective Responsibility (Coach is constantly quoted using &#65533;It&#65533;s our&#65533;&#65533; instead of &#65533;It&#65533;s your&#65533;&#65533; as to imply that everything that happens is the result of the team and not an individual), Communication, Caring, Pride, and Trust. Five Point Play seems to be not only a book about Duke&#65533;s incredible basketball season, but also a motivational &#65533;lecture&#65533; as many of the ideals used by Coach can easily be applied to everyday life.Anyone looking for an in-depth account of Duke basketball or for some inspiration from one of college&#65533;s most respected coaches cannot go wrong with buying this book."},{"Title":"Five-Point Play: The Story of Duke's Amazing 2000-2001 Championship Season","review":"...;I loved this book. It really showed how Coach K dealt with his players. This is a good book forsomeone looking into coaching, it shows it is not just X's and O's.

A great read for a Duke fan or any fan of basketball."},{"Title":"Five-Point Play: The Story of Duke's Amazing 2000-2001 Championship Season","review":"As an avid Duke fan, the book was quite enjoyable and fun to read. Even folks that have read virtually every Duke article during last season's championship run will find a substantial amount of &quot;new&quot; material, i.e, Coach K's &quot;conversation&quot; with Nate James prior to the Final Four trip. Coach K's constant reference to the &quot;fist&quot; gets a little tiresome after a while but he truly believes in the concept and his success is indisputable."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],W={key:0},P={key:1};function M(n,e,s,u,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),o("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",x,[(t(!0),o(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),b(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),o("span",P,"Loading...")):(t(),o("span",W,"See more"))],8,j)):p("",!0)])}const q=c(H,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-0313a643"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/27.md","filePath":"guide/27.md"}'),B={name:"guide/27.md"},O=Object.assign(B,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(q)]))}});export{L as __pageData,O as default};
